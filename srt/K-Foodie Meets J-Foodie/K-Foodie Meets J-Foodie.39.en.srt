-It's raining.
-Right.

26
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:37,964
Where are we?

27
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:40,700
-Sapporo, right?
-Sapporo, Hokkaido.

28
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:44,504
When I came before,
it was snowing. It was all white.

29
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:46,873
It's the city of snow.

30
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,676
In the white snow,
the view looked completely different.

31
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:53,813
In a pure white snowy landscape.

32
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,816
It was past 11 p.m.,

33
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:58,184
but there was a line.

34
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,252

40
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,483
Hmm…

41
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,787
I've had more desserts since meeting you

42
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:37,490
than I've ever had my entire life.

43
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:40,727
Well, there may be people who don't drink
among our viewers.

44
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:43,530
I should learn more
about desserts for future dates.

45
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,098
-Exactly.
-Thank you.

46
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,633
Then let's go in.

47
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:51,804
It's really amazing.
There's a line forming.

48
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,741
-After you.
-Thanks.

49
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:58,344
-Hello.
-Excuse us.

50
00:02:58,411 --> 00:02:59,946
Wow, amazing.

51
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,080
Hello.

52
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:04,450
I came here on a snowy day this year.

53
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,186
-Thank you for visiting.
-Hello.

54
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:09,022
-Did I sit over there then?
-Oh, we can sit outside too.

55
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:10,957
-Maybe it was the third floor.
-Third floor?

56
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,860
There are a lot of seats
upstairs and downstairs.

57
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,562
Has it been a few years?

58
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:21,034
When did the night parfait
become a custom in Sapporo?

59
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,572
There is a long tradition in Hokkaido
of eating something sweet after a meal.

60
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:26,639
Has it?

61
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,374
Amazing.

00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,810

PARFAIT MEANS "PERFECT" IN FRENCH

72
00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:03,576
SHIME PARFAIT MEANS
FINISH YOUR DAY PERFECTLY

73
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:08,281
Didn't I say this before?

74
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,717
Korea has many dishes.

75
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:14,153
Even after round two or three,
when you still want to eat,

76
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,789
in Korea, it's gamjatang,

77
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,559
and then you have fried rice.

78
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:23,263
Basically, it's only in Sapporo, Japan.

79
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,430
I see.

80
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:27,533
So even in Japan,
it's specific to Sapporo.

81
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,404
They have night parfaits
which I thought was a great idea.

82
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:34,874
This should go nationwide.

83
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,511
But it's still enjoyed only in Sapporo.

84
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,481
Uh, well…

85
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,350
I don't really know yet.

86
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,552
I've never even ordered a parfait before.

87
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:50,089
Korea doesn't have
a parfait culture like Sapporo.

88
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:54,494
Let's show it to Koreans
who aren't used to it.

89
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,163
I'm a beginner. Please teach me today.

90
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,900
Shall we order then?

91
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,001
Looks fancy.

92
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:03,770
Wow, look at this.

93
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,705
If you bring a girlfriend here,

94
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,240
she'd love it.

95
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,342
See? It's so pretty.

96
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,311
Where would you find this?

97
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:20,420
Pudding and seasonal fruit.

98
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,255
This is pudding a la mode.

99
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,425
That's the summer version.

100
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,795
In fall, the fruit changes.

101
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:33,599
Pudding a la mode sounds good too.

102
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:40,673
I'm already set on the pudding a la mode.

103
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,142
-Pudding a la mode.
-Then I'll…

104
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,645
I'll do mango and plum.

105
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,248
And a pistachio cookie assortment.

106
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:50,783
We haven't picked a drink yet.

107
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,885
I'll have a hot coffee.

108
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:54,487
Hot coffee, okay.

109
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:57,790
What do you recommend?

110
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:01,327
Maybe sake, rum, or whisky.

111
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:05,565
For whisky, Hakushu is refreshing,

112
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,401
so Hakushu might be good.

113
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:11,871
For gin, Ohoro Gin is easy to drink.

114
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,039
-Hakushu, please.
-It's delicious.

115
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:15,007
-Applause, right?
-Hakushu.

116
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:16,709
-Applause, please.
-Coming right up.

117
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:17,944
Please.

118
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,746
-Please.
-Of course.

119
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:22,048
So it's a bar with really good desserts.

120
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,483

145
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:49,936
This is a dropper.

146
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:53,272
It's filled with caramel sauce.

147

Please drizzle it to your taste.

148
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,044

150
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,383
Do Koreans know pudding a la mode?

151
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,451
What's that?

152
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:10,289
If you're a middle-aged man or woman,

153
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:13,059
everyone's had pudding a la mode.

154
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,728
-It's a classic.
-A steady seller.

PUDDING A LA MODE

156

CENTERED ON CUSTARD PUDDING
WITH VARIOUS FRUIT & TOPPINGS

157
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,403
At a department store's rooftop cafeteria.

158
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:29,709
On a special day once a year,
we'd have pudding a la mode.

159
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:30,843
Was it pricey?

160
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,812
Back then, it wasn't about the price.

161
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,614
-It's for a special day.
-Right, right.

162
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,083
Back then, there wasn't
anything that sweet.

163
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:40,753
-I have memories of pudding a la mode.
-Pudding a la mode.

164
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,788
-Shall we try it?
-Let's try it.

165
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:43,856
Let's eat.

166
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:49,862
I brought my phone to take photos.

167
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:54,534
Me too. I usually don't,
but I brought mine.

168
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:02,341
Si-kyung behind the camera.

169
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:04,911
Feels like a date.

170
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:06,712
Honey, where should we go next?

171
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,950
-Let's eat.
-Enjoy.

172
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:14,687
For pudding a la mode,

173
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,590
there's always a cherry.

174
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:20,293
A cherry on top
makes it pudding a la mode.

175
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:23,996
This is for the Showa generation.

176
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,400
Is it a taste of nostalgia?

177
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:28,768
Memories?

178
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,605
-You hardly get those now.
-That's true.

179
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:40,913
Why is this so good?

180
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,248
Why does this taste good?

181
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,787
It's the best of this kind
that I've ever had.

182
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:49,989
-Dried fruit.
-Dried fruit?

183
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:53,960
Sweet, bitter, salty. Really well made.

184
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:56,862
Mango sorbet.

185
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:02,768
FROZEN FRUIT DESSERT WITHOUT DAIRY

186
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,075
It's sweet.

187
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,043
This tastes refined.

188
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:13,879
This?

189
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:22,321
-This one's a bit tart.
-Cassis-based.

190
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:26,158
PLAIN SOFT ICE CREAM

191
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,196
Hokkaido dairy products are great.

192
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,263
It's good.

193
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,000
-Is it good?
-It's good.

194
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:35,935
It's good.

195
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,004
All I can say is, it's good.

196
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,779
When I first came to Hokkaido,

197
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,280
I had soft-serve ice cream,

198
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:51,384
and thought, "How is this so good?"

199
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,818
Where did you have it?

200
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,920
Every soft-serve was good.

201
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,989
Hokkaido milk is good.

202
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,592
-Right.
-They say it's the best milk.

203
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,362
And it's even better in summer.

204
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:06,999
-When is milk best for soft-serve?
-Does milk have a season?

205
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:11,404
In summer, cows eat fresh pasture,

206
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,072
so it tastes cleaner.

207
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,974
-Cleaner?
-Summer milk, that is.

208
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:19,245
In winter, they eat hay,
so it tastes richer.

209
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:22,882
So there's a hay season
and a pasture season.

210
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:26,419
So with dry feed,

211
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,554
the milk gets richer.

212
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:32,191
With fresh grass, the milk tastes fresher.

213
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,693
I see.

214
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,595
-It depends on what they eat.
-I guess so.

215
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:39,565
The best soft-serve tastes clean.

216
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,586
Seasonal fruit is really good.

217
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,557
Hokkaido is truly blessed.

218
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:05,725
-Hokkaido?
-Its nature.

219
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,960
-Cheese is great too.
-Vegetables are great.

220
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:10,362
-Fish is great too.
-Fish is great.

221
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:16,902
What's good in winter
and summer is totally different.

222
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,904
The scenery's different too.

223
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:22,942
It's even admired across Japan.

224
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,076
Right.

225
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,521
Oh man, this is good.

226
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,089
So good. What do I do?

227
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,491
I'm getting hooked.

228
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:44,797
All the sweetness is natural.

229
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,568
-Brazil.
-Brazil?

230
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:55,541
TODAY'S COFFEE (BRAZIL)
647 YEN / 6,470 WON

231
00:12:56,542 --> 00:13:00,012
HAKUSHU WHISKY
1,189 YEN / 11,890 WON

232
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,354
This is great.

233
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,092
It pairs well with coffee.

234
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:16,796
It depends on the person,

235
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:20,199
but if you want one last drink,

236
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:24,336
or want to sober up a bit,

237
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:27,339
-either way, come here.
-That's right.

238
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:31,110
When I'm tipsy, I crave ice cream.

239
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:35,481
When you're drunk, you want sweets.
It feels refreshing too.

240
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:39,118
It's cold, so it feels good.

241
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,787
It's the best bar snack.

242
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:44,056
-I could drink forever. It's dangerous.
-Yeah?

243
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,191
That's dangerous.

244
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,259
Eat it going, "Ugh, rough,"

245
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,861
then, "Oh, this helps."

246
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:52,398
It feels like you're sobering up a bit.

247
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,067
Great pairing too.

248
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:58,904
It's been a while for me.

249
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,739
This is really nice.

250
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:05,344
Having ice cream
or a dessert after drinks.

251
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:08,814
-It's the best combo.
-The best.

252
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:27,299
It's been a while, but there's
a Japanese whisky boom in Korea.

253
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,168
It's hard to buy now.

254
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:33,472
Back then, whisky was looked down on.

255
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,942
It was a dad drink.

256
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,244
Really?

257
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:42,381
People hardly drank it.
Because it was the era of shochu.

258
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:43,549
Japan has shochu.

259
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:46,819
Shochu was replacing whisky.

260
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,922
Even at bars,

261
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:54,627
people didn't order whisky.

262
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:57,096
Whisky nearly died out.

263
00:14:57,663 --> 00:15:00,232
Now it's totally flipped.

264
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:17,449
Is it good?

265
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,618
When I was young,

266
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:23,522
at a vegetable market called Yachaba,

267
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:27,092
-I worked winning auction bids.
-Part-time?

268
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,594
Part-time.

269
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:34,199
I got a spoiling melon
every day, unsellable stuff.

270
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,567
Because it wouldn't sell.

271
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:38,404
The owner would hand me one daily,

272
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,172
saying, "Have a melon."

273
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:44,710
I'd take it to the theater and cut it.

274
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:48,013
-When you were poor?
-We ate messed-up ones.

275
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:53,152
I ate so much that I thought,
"I could go without melon for life."

276
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:56,555
-So eating it takes you back?
-It does.

277
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,058
I'm not sentimental over it.

278
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,160
It was just,
"I ate a lot of melon back then."

279
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:03,595
I lived on melons.

280
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,075
This place.

281
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,277
Koreans, when you visit Hokkaido,
come here.

282
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,012
It's so good.

283
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,381
-In Japan, have a beer--
-Oh!

284
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:23,582
-Excuse me?
-Sorry.

285
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,783
I found the pudding.

286
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:26,652
This is it.

287
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,654
-Pudding.
-He looks so happy.

288
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:33,492
-He really loves it.
-Drizzle caramel here.

289
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,694
I wanted to eat it like this.

290
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:41,100
This is good.

291
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:52,811
It's good.

292
00:16:58,584 --> 00:16:59,752
You know what?

293
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:03,322
When you have dessert, Mr. Matjjigae,

294
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:04,623
your face totally changes.

295
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,759
I like pudding.

296
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:09,294
Pudding a la mode is the best.

297
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:13,699
This is really so good.

298
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:19,605
Nice place. Thank you.

299
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:22,207
-Does it suit your taste?
-It's the best.

300
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:28,113
I actually wanted to come
on a snowy night.

301
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,582
-For the vibe.
-That would be nice too.

302
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:36,588
It's midwinter.
It's snowing and cold outside.

303
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,360
Then you step inside…

304
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,995
-And you have parfait.
-…you have parfait.

305
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,333
Thanks for waiting.

306
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,237
Your pistachio cookie assortment.

307
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:58,811
PISTACHIO COOKIE ASSORTMENT
2,070 YEN / 20,700 WON

308
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:02,281
From the left, pistachio pudding,

309
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:03,949
pistachio canelé,

310
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,484
a bear monaka,

311
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:10,923
filled with pistachio cream,
house-made bean paste, and strawberries.

312
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:14,860
There's also a cake
with lots of pistachio.

313
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:18,797
This one is a pistachio-filled macaron.

314
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:23,335
And this is pistachio raw chocolate.

315
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:27,039
This butter sand has a lemon curd spread.

316
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,441
In the center is smoked pistachio.

317
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:30,776
-Smoked?
-Yes.

318
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,146
Let's start with the smoked pistachio.

319
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:43,889
Excuse me, a refill, please.

320
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,025
This kind of looks like sausage.

321
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:49,428
It's like really good smoked ham.

322
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:56,068
It's a perfect bar snack with drinks.

323
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,136
Isn't it?

324
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,239
-Which one first?
-Let's start with this one.

325
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,740
-Pudding.
-Please enjoy.

326
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,082
Nutty.

327
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,487
Wow.

328
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,289
The aroma's amazing.

329
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,258
Almost like a sesame sauce.

330
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,094
The coffee goes down smooth.

331
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:25,764
I didn't know pistachio was this trendy.

332
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,999
It's trending.

333
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:28,867
Is it still trending?

334
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:29,935
I think so.

335
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:35,240
Anything that's green in a cake shop

336
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,176
is probably pistachio, if it isn't matcha.

337
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,578
Oh, I see.

338
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,480
Aren't you curious about this?

339
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:42,581
The bear?

340
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:43,649
Monaka.

341
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:45,817
How cute.

342
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:49,588
-Strawberry's yours.
-Strawberry?

343
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,623
No, no.

344
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,800
Oh, this is good.

345
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:03,969
So good.

346
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,137
The monaka's good.

347
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,909
The bean paste went right in my mouth.

348
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:13,445
It's over!

349
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,248
Tasty emergency?

350
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,450
-A "tasty emergency"?
-Tasty emergency.

351
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:21,286
-Wee-woo, this is a tasty emergency.
-Delicious!

352
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,290
It's gone.

353
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,659
It's already gone.
Only a bit of shell left.

354
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:31,496
-Gone so fast.
-Pistachio and bean paste go so well.

355
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,598
Pis-ang!

356
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:33,532
PISTACHIO + ANKO

357
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:39,571
This tastes great.

358
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:40,973
This is dangerously good.

359
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,244
If drinkers end up liking desserts too,

360
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,745
you gain weight.

361
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,614
Where does it show first?

362
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,681
Face?

363
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,984
-No, the body.
-The body?

364
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,453
If your face gains weight, it's over.

365
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,221
From now on, maybe…

366
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,624
I should watch what I order.

367
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,692
Then no one will watch the show.

368
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:05,364
"Today's menu is chicken breast salad."

369
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:09,067
You want to eat, right?
But we won't, either!

370
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:10,302
The worst.

371
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:13,138
Your diet mate next door.

372
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,239
It's the worst.

373
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,911
This is the best bar snack.

374
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:21,613
Best bar snack?

375
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,283
This would go well
with Japanese shochu too.

376
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:28,020
If not alcohol or coffee,

377
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:30,789
what drink pairs well with these desserts?

378
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:31,857
Rooibos tea.

379
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:33,959
So only rooibos.

380
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,094
Caffeine-free rooibos tea.

381
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,997
I like rooibos.

382
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:40,265
It's good for you too.

383
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,100
You've never had it, right?

384
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,602
I have!

385
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,470
-No, you haven't.
-Rooibos tea.

386
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:47,706
Chamomile, roo… rooibos.

387
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,475
I've tried many kinds of tea.

388
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:51,743
Really?

389
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,280
It's great.

390
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:58,517
-Ah, so good.
-This is what you end with.

391
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,852
A shime parfait.

392
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:03,655
SHIME PARFAIT

393
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:09,161

EASING THE STOMACH THE DAY AFTER DRINKING

396
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:20,172
NOW IN KOREA

397
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:24,042
In Korea, we drink a lot,

398
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,011
so we can't finish with parfait.

399
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,947
-Not with parfait.
-Nope.

400
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,983
It's like a hospital.
Everyone goes for treatment.

401
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:35,787
Just to survive the next day--

402
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,356
You could just go home.

403
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:39,858
But you can't move even if you go home.

404
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:42,861
We need something like
naengmyeon, jjamppong,

405
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:45,263
or today's dish!

406
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,431
It's bukeoguk.

407
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:47,933
Bukeoguk!

MECCA OF HANGOVER FOOD
MUGYO-DONG BUKEOGUK RESTAURANT

409
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:54,573
A BUKEOGUK RESTAURANT

410
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:56,975
WITH 57 YEARS OF HISTORY

411
00:22:57,442 --> 00:23:00,312
If you're a Korean foodie…

412
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,013
-You've come here at least once.
-…once, at the least.

413
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,350
There's quite a bit written in Japanese.

414
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:07,819
I think it was featured on NHK.

415
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,655
So lots of Japanese customers come.

416
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,624
The smell is amazing.

417
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,726
-It's here.
-I can smell it already.

418
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:15,894
Amazing.

419
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,167
-Smells great.
-Smells really nice.

420
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:26,605
When Koreans smell this, they go, "Ah."

421
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:28,006
It puts you at ease.

422
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,074
Puts you at ease?

423
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,776
What's on the menu here?

424
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:33,245
There's no need to mull it over.

425
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:34,346
Why?

426
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,847
There's only one dish.

427
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,849
-Only one?
-Just bukeoguk?

428
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,551
-Only bukeoguk.
-I see.

429
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,319
BUKEO HAEJANGGUK

430
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:42,387
Nothing else?

431
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:43,388
No.

432
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,657
No meat or anything?

433
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:46,825
No meat.

434
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:49,361
So everyone comes just for the soup?

435
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,896
That's all there is.

436
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:52,597
I see.

437
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:54,699
There is a kind of secret menu.

438
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,435
Something only for regulars.

439
00:23:56,501 --> 00:24:00,639
You never know when they'll run out,
but there's a fried egg.

440
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,674
-The secret menu is a fried egg?
-Yes.

441
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,643
They call it choran.

442
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,745
When a chick turns into a young hen,

443
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:09,080
the first eggs are called choran.

444
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:10,982
-The first eggs from a hen?
-Yes, yes.

445
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,185
So it's a special egg.

446
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:18,723
And that's why
they probably sell out in the morning.

447
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,927
For regulars, say "Egg, please,"
and they'll give you one.

448
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:23,528
Only 500 won apiece.

449
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:25,931
-That seems cheap.
-It is.

450
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:27,899
And there's salted shrimp mix

451
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:31,069
made from small shrimp, salted shrimp.

452
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,171
They serve it like a sauce.

453
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:34,873
Shall we try?

454
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,274
Excuse me.

455
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:37,442
Yes.

456
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:38,810
-Sir.
-Hello.

457
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:40,512
-Thank you for letting us film.
-Thank you.

458
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:41,580
Thank you.

459
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,749
Bukeoguk and rice.

460
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,219
And could we get the egg too?

461
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:48,520
Two eggs, yes.

462
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:50,188
And salted shrimp to mix too.

463
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:52,224
-Fried egg, please.
-Sure, right away.

464
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,159
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

465
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:57,062
ORDER
BUKEO HAEJANGGUK

466
00:24:57,128 --> 00:25:02,200
FRIED EGG (SECRET MENU)
SALTED SHRIMP MIX (SECRET MENU)

467
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:04,369
It's like fast food.

468
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:05,770
As soon as you order,

469
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:08,206
the food comes out.

470
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:10,775
I see.

471
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:14,179
I don't usually finish with bukeoguk.

472
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:15,447
Then what do you go for?

473
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:17,582
Maybe naengmyeon.

474
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:20,318
-Naengmyeon, huh?
-But that varies too.

475
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:21,553
By season,

476
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,421
the hangover fix changes.

477
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:28,126
Sometimes a spicy broth to sweat it out.

478
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:32,364
Sometimes a cold naengmyeon broth.
And I go, "Okay, that's it."

479
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:38,403
Sometimes bukeoguk
with warm beef bone broth.

480
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:42,207
Is it beef bone broth?

481
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,476
Here, probably beef bone broth.

482
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,044
Beef, I see.

483
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:48,647
-It's beef bones.
-Right, beef bones.

484
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:52,484
So it's not 100% seafood.

485
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,019
They do have those.

486
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:56,621
In Gangwon-do,
there's hwangtae haejangguk.

487
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:58,990
Could you confirm once more?

488
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:02,093
How are bukeoguk and
hwangtae haejangguk different?

489
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,597
Bukeo and hwangtae are the same fish.

490
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:07,899
The drying process is different.

491
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:10,068
So the drying is different.

492
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:13,305
MYEONGTAE
DIVIDES INTO BUKEO OR HWANGTAE BY DRYING

493
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:15,607
-Bukeo?
-It's simply dried.

494
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:20,478
1 TO 2 WEEKS OF SUN AND WIND DRYING
LOW MOISTURE AND FIRM TEXTURE

495
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:26,017
Hwangtae is made
by freezing and thawing over and over.

496
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:30,622
Freeze it. Thaw it. Repeat.
Then it can be called hwangtae.

497
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:36,528
TAKES 2 TO 3 MONTHS OF REPEATED FREEZING,
THAWING, AND DRYING FOR A DEEPER FLAVOR

498
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:42,200
Hwangtae is almost considered
a Gangwon-do specialty.

499
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,303
-But it's bukeo here.
-Bukeo. It's already out.

500
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,205
-Hello.
-Yes.

501
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,274
-I'll serve this side first.
-Sure.

502
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,343
Thank you.

503
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:56,047
BUKEO HAEJANGGUK
1,000 YEN / 10,000 WON

504
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,684
-This is hanwoo beef bone broth, right?
-Yes.

505
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:02,854
They grind bukeo bones
with non-glutinous rice.

506
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,626
-What's on top? Tofu?
-Tofu.

507
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:08,893
-Tofu.
-And egg.

508
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,764
BUKEOGUK

509
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:15,734
RICH IN NUTRIENTS FOR LIVER RECOVERY
BROTH SOOTHES THE STOMACH

510
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:17,802
Thank you.

511
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:20,171
Do you give us more if we ask for it?

512
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:21,239
We do.

513
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:25,577
It's unlimited refills.

514
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,278
Broth?

515
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:30,849
What's the most number of refills ever?
Not that I'd go that far.

516
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:32,984
About thirteen? Fourteen?

517
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:36,321
Someone got a refill thirteen times.

518
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:37,922
There was someone like that.

519
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:41,760
What's the basic way to eat it?

520
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,929
-Start with the broth?
-That's fine.

521
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:45,997
Let's eat.

522
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:50,001
This is the real thing? Local bukeo?

523
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:51,369
Yes, please enjoy.

524
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:52,470
Looks great!

525
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:08,186
Insane.

526
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:09,921
I used to think Korean food

527
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:13,725
was on the mild side,

528
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:16,227
but this is seasoned just right.

529
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:25,770
Japanese people would like
this kind of broth too.

530
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,106
It's good.

531
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,346
There's

532
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:38,283
nothing to fault with this broth.

533
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:44,756
The umami really shines,
as it does in jjamppong.

534
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:48,827
when land meat meets seafood.

535
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,429
That's when it really explodes.

536
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:57,335
This layers beef bones with seafood.

537
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:00,004
The broth looks gentle,

538
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:04,442
but it's packed with explosive umami.

539
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:08,780
If you suddenly had this for dinner,

540
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:11,683
it might feel light.

541
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:15,520
-For round two or breakfast?
-Right.

542
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,688
And lunch.

543
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:21,459
We really had a heavy drinking culture.

544
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:22,761
In the past, yes.

545
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:26,164
So places like this always exist.

546
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:31,536
This place is for hangovers.

547
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:36,107
Office workers stop in before work,
or to recover.

548
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:45,049
So good. It's been a while.

549
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:49,821
-It's amazing.
-It's good.

550
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:51,456
I hadn't come recently.

551
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,727
ALCOHOL ONLY SOLD IN MORNING & EVENING

552
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,462
They don't serve alcohol here.

553
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:59,731
Not while there's a line.

554
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:05,170
For me,
a place without alcohol is hard to visit.

555
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:08,139
Unless I need this urgently,

556
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:11,309
I probably wouldn't come.

557
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:14,546
-This is bukeoguk.
-Yes.

558
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,282
Not bukeoguk, just bukeo.

559
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:19,017
Bukeo?

560
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:20,785
"Eo" means fish.

561
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:28,359
Got it.

562
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:33,298
So it's milder than hwangtae.

563
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:34,799
Simple.

564
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:38,269
Hwangtae has a bit more depth.

565
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,337
Exactly.

566
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:43,241
You can savor the lingering taste
when you chew it,

567
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:45,310
but this goes down gently.

568
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,145
Exactly.

569
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:49,047
So that's the difference.

570
00:30:56,221 --> 00:31:00,391
The bukeo in this soup,

571
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,728
I could eat a lot of it.

572
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:04,863
Right.

573
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:08,933
Compared to hwangtae, it's quite light.

574
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:13,304
And these side dishes.

575
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:16,975
The sides are stronger, so

576
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:20,078
in Korea, we top it
or eat them on the side.

577
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:35,526
So you dip like this.

578
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:41,032
-The eggs are here.
-Thank you.

579
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,902
-Is this choran?
-Yes, choran.

580
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:45,603
This is the secret menu.

581
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:51,542
FRIED EGG (CHORAN), 50 YEN / 500 WON
SALTED SHRIMP MIX, FREE

582
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:55,280
SALTED SHRIMP MIX
SESAME OIL, SCALLIONS, SESAME SEEDS

583
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:58,416
You can put it on rice and mix.

584
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:00,018
Thank you. This is the best.

585
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:09,227
Delicious.

586
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:22,273
The aroma of sesame oil is spot on.

587
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:28,980
It's so good.

588
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:32,951
Makes you want to try it like this.

589
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,666
The umami is incredible.

590
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:02,347
This salted shrimp mix is really good.

591
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:07,185
I should eat it like
Japanese egg-over-rice.

592
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:10,121
-TKG, is it?
-Yes, Tamago Kake Gohan.

593
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:24,168
Fried egg is great for hangovers too.

594
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,674
So good.

595
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:34,712
Salted shrimp has
ojeot, yukjeot, and chujeot.

596
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:37,315
Ojeot is shrimp caught in May.

597
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:39,617
Yukjeot is shrimp caught in June.

598
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,319
They have their season.

599
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:45,556
So the taste and size can
be totally different.

600
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:55,466
Wow.

601
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:57,969
It makes you say "Wow."

602
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:00,571
This is really good.

603
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:08,913
This kimchi is good.

604
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:12,683
This is really tasty.

605
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,752
The cucumber's good too.

606
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:17,422
-It's called oiji, pickled cucumber.
-Oiji.

607
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:19,690
"Oi" is cucumber. So, oiji.

608
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:26,798
And you hardly see oiji these days.

609
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:27,999
We all had it growing up.

610
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:31,002
When I find it, I go crazy.

611
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,938
No one makes it now. It's a hassle.

612
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,273
-Which?
-Oiji.

613
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:36,641
This is good.

614
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:48,419
What's the difference
between mul-kimchi and regular kimchi?

615
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:53,524
You drink the brine as well?

616
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,927
-Do you drink mul-kimchi?
-It's like a digestive.

617
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:01,099
Mul-kimchi is also fermented.

618
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:07,105
Back then, if someone collapsed
from the carbon monoxide from briquettes,

619
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:08,873
we had them drink mul-kimchi.

620
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,374
The mul-kimchi brine?

621
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,211
If they drink it, they burp,

622
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:16,047
and it really helps.

623
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,415
I see.

624
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,383
The balance is great.

625
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:23,921
The soup doesn't have a strong presence,

626
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:28,426
so with the more assertive salted shrimp…

627
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:29,861
Right.

628
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:32,930
…and kimchi and mul-kimchi,

629
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:35,266
the balance is so good.

630
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:39,770
It's like a generous parent.

631
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:43,708
Embracing kids with strong personalities

632
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:46,144
while not standing out themselves.

633
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,380
But the kids still gather around them.

634
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:50,448
Right.

635
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,365
Man, it's so good.

636
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,101
You know…

637
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:49,140
it's unlimited refills.

638
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,175
You can have more. Are you done?

639
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,312
I'm okay.

640
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,847
-Excuse me!
-Yes?

641
00:36:57,748 --> 00:36:59,317
Sorry, I'll have a bit more.

642
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,285
Of course. Right away.

643
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:13,731
A BOWL REFILL / FREE

644
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:16,100
-Here's your refill.
-Thank you.

645
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:18,302
I'll put it here.

646
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:19,503
Thank you.

647
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:22,206
That's a lot.

648
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:24,008
It looks like a new portion.

649
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,677
-Can you handle that?
-No problem.

650
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:39,457
I'm getting better.

651
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:40,691
I can drink more.

652
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:49,600
This is really tasty.

653
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:57,341
You have your real job after this…

654
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,343
-Yes, off to sing.
-…right?

655
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:01,279
Powered by bukeo.

656
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:04,015
-You don't drink when you sing, do you?
-No.

657
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:07,051
Some people drink during live shows.

658
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,655
It may vary person-to-person,
but I don't think one ever should.

659
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:15,026
You may feel more happy and satisfied,

660
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:18,062
but objectively that isn't good.

661
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,130
Oh, really?

662
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:22,033
You're not singing for your own mood.

663
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:25,102
You need to stay cool-headed.

664
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:26,537
So you can't get drunk.

665
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:27,738
That's cool.

666
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:32,276
I may not look it, but I've been
a professional singer for 26 years.

667
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:35,179
Congrats on selling out in Japan.

668
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,982
Thank you. Thanks to you.

669
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:40,284
No, I didn't do anything.

670
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,086
Can you come?

671
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,854
I have work.

672
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,123
I'll be out of town.

673
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:48,826
-I want to go.
-Everyone says that.

674
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:53,064
If I'm out of town, it can't be helped.

675
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,732
I really wanted to go.

676
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:57,601
I'll keep going.
There'll be shows next year.

677
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,437
Please come sometime.

678
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:02,907
When I went to Japan last time,

679
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:06,444
your face popped up in a taxi,

680
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:10,114
so I sent him a photo,
"Mr. Matjjigae, you're on!"

681
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,682
"What ad is that?"

682
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:16,620
I thought,
"You must be doing countless ads."

683
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:17,722
No, no.

684
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:20,157
I show up a lot in taxis.

685
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:24,295
That ad was good too.

686
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,198
I don't know what it was,

687
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:29,834
but it made me happy.

688
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,135
Was I doing something?

689
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:34,038
It's nice here, right?

690
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:35,306
I like it.

691
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:36,907
Well,

692
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,143
I have a gift.

693
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,146
-It's a talisman.
-A toothpick?

694
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,214
A keychain.

695
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:47,718
Myeongtae is trendy with young people
these days.

696
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:48,786
Myeongtae.

697
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:51,255
Myeongtae wards off bad luck.

698
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,993
It acts as a charm.

699
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,362
They say it has that kind of power.

700
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:00,131
When new shops open,

701
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:04,435
they hang it on the door.

702
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:05,936
It'll protect you.

703
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:07,104
Bad luck?

704
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:08,839
To keep bad luck away.

705
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,010
And it watches over you
with its eyes open.

706
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,379
-So it guards you.
-Like it's guarding you.

707
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:18,816
It's cute and trending with young people.

708
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:20,851
Thank you.

709
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:27,458
-Don't throw it away.
-I won't. Jeez.

710
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:32,263
You look like a myeongtae master.

711
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:34,765
Bukeo!

712
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:37,168
"I've caught fish for 50 years."

713
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:38,636
Bukeo!

714
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:40,571
