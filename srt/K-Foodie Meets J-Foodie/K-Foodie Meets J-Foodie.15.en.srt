1
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:05,105
K-foodie meets J-foodie.

2
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:06,440
This is insane.

3
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:08,842
SEOUL, KOREA

4
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:12,980
The weather is so nice.

5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,384
The lake.

6
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:20,153
There's a bird that looks like a swan.

7
00:00:20,638 --> 00:00:23,811
LOOKING AT SEOKCHON LAKE
WHILE WAITING TO GO ON A DATE

8
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,929
HIS DATE HAS ARRIVED

9
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,933
I flinch every time
I see someone with white hair.

10
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:43,610
Thank you. Thank you.

11
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:45,779
-Hello.
-Hello.

12
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,948
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

13
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:49,883
I'll drive today.

14
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,885
Okay. Your car's all cleaned up and shiny.

15
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:54,588
-It's nothing.
-I can see that you love your car.

16
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:56,023
Welcome. Hop in.

17
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,492
-Excuse me.
-Hop in.

18
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,362
-How was the hotel?
-The room was huge.

19
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,566
It was such an amazing room,

20
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,734
I almost felt like I didn’t deserve it.

21
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:11,271
-The weather is so nice.
-It is.

22
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,011
Where are we going today?

23
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,581
We're going to a place called Namyangju.

24
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:22,783
It takes about 30 minutes from Seoul.

25
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,618
It's a little to the east.

26
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:26,553
-We're going east.
-Yes.

27
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,921
We had grilled chicken

28
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:29,923
-in Kumamoto.
-Yes.

29
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,526
This might actually rival that.

30
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,828
-It's similar…
-Chicken!

31
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,763
No, it's not chicken.

32
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,931
-Duck.
-Duck!

33
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,967
LAST INSANELY GOOD SPOT

34
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,268
This is the mother hen.

35
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,839
Oh, it's delicious.

36
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:49,242
I should take him to a place like this.
Remember this smell.

37
00:01:51,407 --> 00:01:53,547
CHICKEN VS DUCK

38
00:01:58,347 --> 00:02:02,389
EPISODE 15
DUCK REBELLION: CHARCOAL-GRILLED DUCK

39
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,825
In terms of poultry rankings,

40
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:08,362
duck is definitely near the top.

41
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,597
Yes, that’s the case in Japan.

42
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,799
In Korea, though,
it’s not really treated that way.

43
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,301
-Really?
-Yes.

44
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:17,337
-Duck?
-It's commonly eaten.

45
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:18,905
-I see.
-It's not that expensive.

46
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,775
But it's delicious.

47
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:23,477
I'm confident about this place.

48
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,616
I got a call yesterday
from my manager in Japan.

49
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:32,319
-Mr. Ariyoshi…
-Mr. Ariyoshi.

50
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:34,287
Mr. Ariyoshi mentioned on the radio that

51
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:38,592
the show with the Korean foodie singer
and Mr. Matjjigae

52
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,394
is really entertaining.

53
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,397
-Really?
-Yes.

54
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:46,533
What about the people around you?
Do they enjoy the show?

55
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,235
-Everyone watches it.
-In Japan?

56
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,103
-They're enjoying it.
-I see.

57
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,439
I'm happy.

58
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,308
From here on,
we’re no longer in central Seoul.

59
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,210
-Did we come far?
-Yes, pretty far.

60
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:02,115
We should start seeing it soon.
Just a little farther to go.

61
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:06,086
NAMYANGJU
THE CITY OF DASAN JEONG YAK-YONG

62
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:08,655
-The scenery is nice here.
-Yes.

63
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:10,157
You won't be able to drink today.

64
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:13,794
I'll ask my manager to drive
on the way back.

65
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,529
Do you get physicals?

66
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,464
I think I need to get one this year.

67
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,068
How long has it been since you got one?

68
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,269
I haven't got one recently.

69
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:24,137
-You shouldn't do that.
-I was scared.

70
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,273
You should get them regularly.

71
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,708
Do you get them regularly?

72
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:29,276
I do.

73
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:32,245
You get to eat delicious food every day

74
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,948
-because you're healthy.
-Yes.

75
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,017
-We're here.
-We are?

76
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:37,984
Yes.

77
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,688
Jinmi Grilled Duck.

78
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,824
It's an interesting place.

79
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:50,030
What? This place…

80
00:03:52,936 --> 00:03:54,801
JINMI GRILLED DUCK

81
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:58,138
IF YOU FOLLOW THE MYSTERIOUS SIGN…

82
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:02,876
A greenhouse-style BBQ joint.

83
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,159
-It's fun, right?
-It's wild.

84
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:21,995
-Let's go.
-Let's go eat.

85
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:22,929
JINMI GRILLED DUCK

86
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,932
Something smells good.

87
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,768
I smell something nutty.

88
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,269
His face just lit up.

89
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:31,938
-You didn't have breakfast, right?
-No, I didn't.

90
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,206
Thank you.

91
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,976
They're already eating.

92
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,344
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

93
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,480
-Hello.
-Duck. Hello.

94
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,316
-Hello.
-Hello.

95
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:49,489
Duck. Duck.

96
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,158
Duck.

97
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,728
The oil’s coming up. It looks delicious.

98
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,863
He's like my son.

99
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,466
Hello.

100
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:00,400
NEXT TARGET

101
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,635
Hello.

102
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,637
-Duck?
-Yes. Have a seat.

103
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:04,604
Duck.

104
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,873
It smells so good already.

105
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,009
Okay.

106
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:16,616
I don't see a kitchen here.

107
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,954
-The kitchen is in the main building.
-Oh, I see.

108
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:23,390
This area is just for prepping the meat.

109
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,227
This is awesome.

110
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:30,063
-Is it soothing?
-Looking at the river…

111
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:37,470
EATING CHARCOAL-GRILLED DUCK
TO THE SOUND OF RUNNING WATER

112
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:42,676
I'm excited for the grilled duck.

113
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,046
Hello. Let me set your table up.

114
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,281
Oh, the table. I see.

115
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:52,252
They put tinfoil on top of the grill.

116
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:55,422
-This is the table, right?
-Yes. It'll become the table.

117
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,624
-This is where the charcoal goes?
-Yes.

118
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:01,628
They've been in business for 30 years.

119
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:05,065
He’s the second-generation owner.

120
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,300
-So his father was the first owner?
-Yes.

121
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:11,605
Did you start out grilling duck
from the beginning?

122
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:14,307
Did you start out grilling duck
from the beginning?

123
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,275
That's right.

124
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,445
Are there ducks nearby?

125
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,614
-He's asking if there are ducks nearby.
-No, not here.

126
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,616
The farm is in Yangpyeong.

127
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,819
They have their own farm in Yangpyeong,

128
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,520
which isn’t too far from here.

129
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,956
-The duck farm?
-Yes.

130
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,992
Is the duck meat in good condition today?

131
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,527
We have
freshly slaughtered duck from today.

132
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,496
They have
freshly slaughtered duck from today.

133
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:41,001
You can have
fresh duck meat here every day.

134
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,369
I'll look forward to it.

135
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:43,470
He's looking forward to it.

136
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:44,404
Okay.

137
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:48,041
We'll have charcoal-grilled duck
and doenjang-jjigae.

138
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,509
Okay.

139
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,211
What would you like to drink?

140
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:53,146
Should I have Coke?

141
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:55,015
Coke, please.

142
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:58,418
It really feels like I'm here with my son.

143
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,954
-Daddy will have…
-Coke!

144
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,689
I'll have a morning beer.

145
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,190
I'm so excited.

146
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:10,330
-Put the side dishes on the table.
-Okay.

147
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:12,265
We’ll do the initial grilling
for the duck.

148
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:17,003
They show it to us first
and then do the initial grilling.

149
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,471
Oh, after they show it to us…

150
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:19,406
-Yes.
-Thank you.

151
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,508
-Oh, it's mumallaengi.
-Thanks.

152
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:25,245
-It's dried radish.
-Dried radish?

153
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:26,713
This is regular kimchi.

154
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:28,615
And this?

155
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:30,283
-Chives?
-Yes.

156
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,852
-This is mustard sauce.
-Mustard?

157
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,154
Mustard soy sauce.

158
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,889
Mustard soy sauce?

159
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,293
-I'm not sure about this.
-Really?

160
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,963
I thought it was sesame sauce,
but it isn't.

161
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,297
It's not sesame sauce.

162
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:47,867
Take as many chives as you want,

163
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:51,938
add the sauce,
and mix it all together before eating.

164
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,642
I saw that woman eating it with chives.

165
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,980
-Mr. Matjjigae…
-I'm going to see how they eat it.

166
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,918
So they wrap it with the chives.

167
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,857
-It's really good.
-Is it?

168
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:11,958
Yes.

169
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:14,928
Oh, they're grilling it.

170
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,546
CHARCOAL-GRILLED DUCK (ONE DUCK)
55,000 WON, 5,500 YEN

171
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:36,182
Grill it a bit more before you eat it.
Put it near the fire.

172
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,484
-Doenjang-jjigae.
-Thanks.

173
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,386
Doenjang-jjigae. Thank you so much.

174
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,354
DOENJANG-JJIGAE
5,000 WON, 500 YEN

175
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,590
-I'll grill it.
-Okay.

176
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,731
-So that's how much they grilled it.
-Yes.

177
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:02,175
Since there's a lot of fat, the fire
flares up when the oil drips down.

178
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:03,810
-I see.
-So it's better to keep

179
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,478
the middle empty.

180
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,113
I see.

181
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,482
So it gets smoked like this.

182
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:14,821
Let's just grill it to the right level.

183
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,389
Grill it to the right level.

184
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:19,192
The fire is still a bit weak.

185
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:20,160
It's weak?

186
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,128
-Shall we wait a little longer?
-Yes.

187
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,932
We'll let the duck grill

188
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:27,934
-and have some beer while it gets cooked.
-Yes.

189
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,538
-Morning beer.
-I'm happy.

190
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,508
-I'll pour it for you.
-Please.

191
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,416
Mr. Matjjigae.

192
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:46,619
How long has it been
since you quit drinking?

193
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,388
Eight years? Six years? Seven years?

194
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:50,523
-Did you forget?
-I did.

195
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,659
-It's full of foam.
-It's fine.

196
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:56,129
Back in the old days,
they would tell me to pour it again.

197
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,665
The foam is like a symbol
of affection to me.

198
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,434
-Jjan.
-Jjan.

199
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,579
I think it's done.

200
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,681
-You can eat it now.
-Shall we eat?

201
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:16,816
Let's dig in.

202
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,686
-How long have you been eating yakiniku?
-For a while now.

203
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:23,456
But I never had grilled duck before.

204
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:25,391
How will it taste?

205
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:40,206
But it's delicious.

206
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,609
I'm confident about this place.

207
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,520
This is amazing.

208
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,021
Right?

209
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:56,923
This is delicious.

210
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,793
What is this? The fat…

211
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,700
The duck fat is insane.

212
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,769
I'm glad. Yes!

213
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:14,774
It got smoked in its own fat,
so the aroma’s really rich now.

214
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:18,545
Most of it has turned
into a rich, savory taste.

215
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,851
This is good.

216
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:27,720
I'm glad.

217
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:32,091
The texture of the meat is nice.

218
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,127
It's not too soft or chewy.

219
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,328
He's right.

220
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:38,831
The more you chew,
the more flavor comes out of the fat.

221
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:44,204
As soon as I had this,
I knew he would like it.

222
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:48,374
I think I'm starting to get
a sense of your taste.

223
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,178
I like pig fat

224
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:54,047
and chicken fat,

225
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,649
but duck fat is the best.

226
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,185
It doesn't feel out of place.
There's no sense of discomfort.

227
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:00,453
It's light.

228
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:04,357
I think it was called
unsaturated fatty acid.

229
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,026
It's good for you.

230
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:14,701
It's also really tasty
if you eat it with chives.

231
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,044
Right. Chives.

232
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,118
What?

233
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,422
The chives are…

234
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:43,162
The chives are insane.

235
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,597
Amazing, right?

236
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,532
This is insane.

237
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,167
I'm glad.

238
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,802
The chives are insane.

239
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,307
They add

240
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:58,211
perilla oil, sesame seed, seasoned salt,

241
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,481
and chili powder to the chives.

242
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:06,319
It washes away the guilt and leaves
a refreshing taste in your mouth.

243
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,188
This is really good.

244
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,523
I'm glad.

245
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,525
I'm glad he likes it.

246
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,228
Wow!

247
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:20,667
I'm looking forward
to the Japanese staff's reaction.

248
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,469
We're all eating together
after the shoot, right?

249
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,338
-They'll eat with us.
-That's good.

250
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:27,073
This is amazing.

251
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:29,409
It's delicious.

252
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:34,881
If Mr. Matjjigae's wondering
what the Japanese staff will think,

253
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,349
it means it's good.

254
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:38,151
It was always like that.

255
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,654
-Mmm!
-Mmm!

256
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:42,822
The chives are insane.

257
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,698
The chives are insane.

258
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:57,704
DUCK MEAT X CHIVES

259
00:13:58,538 --> 00:13:59,539
-Kimchi.
-Kimchi.

260
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:03,776
DUCK MEAT X KIMCHI

261
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:05,912
It goes well with kimchi too.

262
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:07,613
The duck goes well with everything.

263
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:13,152
Do they also have rice here?

264
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,354
They do.

265
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,621
A bowl of rice,

266
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:16,923
please.

267
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,163
DUCK MEAT X RICE

268
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,431
Does it go well with rice?

269
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:26,466
Mmm!

270
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,402
It's so good that
I want to come back here.

271
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:30,770
-Really?
-Yes.

272
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:33,005
DUCK MEAT

273
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:34,640
-Doenjang-jjigae.
-Yes.

274
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,675
DOENJANG-JJIGAE

275
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:40,513
It's good.

276
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,614
It's delicious.

277
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,553
I forgot what beer tastes like,
but I think it'll go well with beer.

278
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,721
Right?

279
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:51,157
NON-ALCOHOLIC BEER

280
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,329
-Jjan.
-Jjan.

281
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:59,599
DUCK MEAT X BEER

282
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,337
Duck fat goes well with anything.

283
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,506
Wow.

284
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,608
You found a great place.

285
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,511
It's delicious.

286
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:14,414
It's really good.

287
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:16,015
It's so good.

288
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:19,552
Is it okay
to raise my expectations by this much?

289
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,188
This grilled duck’s got me awestruck!

290
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,591
-This grilled duck’s got me awestruck!
-Oh!

291
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,394
Duck rhymes with awestruck.

292
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:32,732
I didn't know we'd be able to
finish a whole duck.

293
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,438
Would you like to introduce
this restaurant to Japanese people?

294
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:43,743
I'd love to bring everyone here.

295
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,078
We don't have this in Japan.

296
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,313
Right?

297
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:49,816
In Japan, duck is enjoyed in dishes like

298
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,717
duck soba…

299
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,787
-Duck hot pot.
-Duck hot pot.

300
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:57,924
-Duck soba set meals.
-They have set meals.

301
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,727
Just eating it in its wild form like this

302
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,729
really lets you taste the wilderness.

303
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,698
-The taste of the wild.
-Yes.

304
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:06,833
THE TASTE OF THE WILD

305
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:10,970
I'm sure that everyone will like this.

306
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,740
The savoriness of the fat…

307
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,044
the flavor of the meat…

308
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:22,014
and this place…

309
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:23,816
Just this spot alone

310
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:28,488
will be worth the trip to Korea.

311
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:29,956
Wow!

312
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,193
-That’s quite the compliment.
-Because it’s about

313
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,661
a two-hour flight from Haneda Airport

314
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:38,264
and just one hour from Gimpo Airport.

315
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,300
You can leave in the morning
and be here by lunch.

316
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:44,337
And then you can have a duck party here.

317
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:46,706
He must really like it.

318
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,478
Those coming from Japan, please stop by.

319
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:55,248
Dads would feel pretty proud
bringing their family here.

320
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,550
It's 5,500 yen for a whole grilled duck.

321
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:58,918
It's cheap.

322
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:01,554
He's suddenly promoting…

323
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:05,091
-You're suddenly promoting this place.
-That's…

324
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,159
-Is it good?
-It's good.

325
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,239
I think rice goes really well

326
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,075
-with meat.
-True.

327
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,679
Can you finish the rice?

328
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,514
Can I have half?

329
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,750
You can put it on the lid.

330
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,554
Thank you.

331
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,692
Right. In the end,

332
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,360
you come back to the rice.

333
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:53,372
I think the duck has
more savoriness than chicken.

334
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:55,808
The duck fat is good.

335
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:00,980
The pieces that have a lot of fat

336
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:02,782
are really good.

337
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,827
This oil…

338
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,432
Can I mix rice with this?

339
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,100
What? But…

340
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:22,668
Well…

341
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:30,543
-You think it'll be bad for you?
-I don't think it'll be a problem.

342
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,157
The oil from the duck is really good.

343
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,660
Duck oil.

344
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:48,961
He's making me want to try it.

345
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,264
The oil from the duck is good.

346
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,040
It's good.

347
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:04,777
It’s good as is, certainly,

348
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:09,582
but when grilled over charcoal,
the nuttiness really comes alive.

349
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:11,984
Sir, one bowl of spicy noodles, please.

350
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:14,053
-Sure.
-In Korea,

351
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,923
do they not have noodles

352
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,494
that you dip in there?

353
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:23,696
Dip it in what?

354
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,667
In here?

355
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:30,169
-Do you want to dip it in here?
-I do.

356
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:32,571
That's a bit…

357
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,874
-We should heat it up, right?
-We should…

358
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,342
Yes.

359
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:38,577
It should be cold noodles.

360
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,780
-I'll ask.
-Yes, please.

361
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,051
Sir, I'm sorry,

362
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,886
but for the noodles,

363
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:49,221
-can we get some noodles…
-Yes?

364
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,891
…separately before you season it?

365
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:54,160
-Sure.
-And I know it's troublesome,

366
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:56,162
but could you boil this for us?

367
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,329
You want me to boil this?

368
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:01,701
I want to dip it in there.

369
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:04,603
-He likes the oil.
-If you could just heat it up…

370
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,806
He wants to dip the noodles in it.

371
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,441
He likes doing stuff like this.

372
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:09,975
Okay, sure.

373
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,144
-Please.
-Sure.

374
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,280
-Has anyone made that request before?
-No.

375
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,749
-He's the first.
-No one has ever made that request.

376
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:20,352
Tell the chef that some eccentric
Japanese man made the request.

377
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:24,724
-But it's going to be good.
-It'll be good for sure.

378
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,560
It's like tsukemen,
where you dip cold noodles…

379
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,729
-Yes.
-…in warm oil.

380
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:31,263
-Something like that.
-It's warm.

381
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,299
-Right!
-I want to try it.

382
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,434
You're like a culinary researcher.

383
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:39,138
This could become
a local specialty, you know.

384
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:42,508
THE FIRST ORDER IN 30 YEARS
SINCE ITS OPENING

385
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:45,211
A customer asked me to boil this.

386
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:48,013
Put some plain noodles aside
when you're cooking it.

387
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,648
And he asked us to boil this.

388
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,951
A Japanese man
wants to dip the noodles in here.

389
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:03,729
DUCK OIL AMONG THE DOENJANG-JJIGAES

390
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:08,968
BOILING DELICIOUSLY(?)

391
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:13,572
It's here.

392
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,641
-It's here.
-It's here.

393
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:18,644
-I got it heated just like you asked.
-Thank you.

394
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:19,812
Thank you.

395
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:21,747
And here are the spicy noodles.

396
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:23,282
-Thank you.
-Sure.

397
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:26,018
SPICY NOODLES
7,000 WON, 700 YEN

398
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:27,486
Everyone.

399
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,156
-I ordered this.
-Mr. Matjjigae style.

400
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:32,758
These are boiled noodles.

401
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:34,760
-We call them somyeon.
-Somyeon.

402
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:35,728
I'll dip the noodles

403
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,063
in the…

404
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:41,100
duck oil.

405
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,182
That confident expression.

406
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:01,487
It's good.

407
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:14,366
Right?

408
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:15,701
It's good.

409
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:17,069
It's really good.

410
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,138
This…

411
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:22,708
You know how you add potato noodles

412
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:24,844
in the broth after making bulgogi?
It's like that.

413
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,414
It's so good because the noodles are cold.
Like tsukemen.

414
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,950
It's tsukemen. Duck tsukemen.

415
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:34,386
This could become trendy here.

416
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,523
-"I'll have some Matsushige Noodles."
-Oh, that…

417
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:40,259
-Is that…
-Try some.

418
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:42,561
-These are the spicy noodles.
-It's bibimguksu in Korean.

419
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:45,431
-Bibimguksu.
-You can go back and forth.

420
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:46,498
Yes.

421
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,979
Once you get sick of duck oil noodles,
you can have this.

422
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,647
In Korea,

423
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,351
we wrap the leftover meat with this.

424
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,255
You really love to wrap things.

425
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:10,789
-You wrap it together.
-Yes.

426
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:26,805
But this is really good.
It's just like those noodles in bulgogi.

427
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:33,812
It’s like a vicious cycle.

428
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:36,448
I just keep going back and forth
and eating it all.

429
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:37,816
-I know.
-Yes.

430
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:40,352
I recommend that you go back and forth.

431
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,354
This was nice.

432
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,989
-You liked it?
-Yes.

433
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:46,692
It was the best tsukemen I had in Korea.

434
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:50,362
-Let's call it Matjjimen.
-Matjjimen. I like it.

435
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,870
Matjjimen is good, right?

436
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,139
-Matjjimen is the best.
-Matjjimen is so good.

437
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:03,375
Matjji Matjjimen

438
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,277
Matjjimen.

439
00:24:05,344 --> 00:24:06,845
NEXT INSANELY GOOD SPOT

440
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,814
It's sundae-gukbap.

441
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:10,149
Tonkotsu ramen.

442
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,785
PORK BROTH GUKBAP VS PORK BROTH RAMEN

443
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:14,787
FUKUOKA'S FAMOUS DISH, TONKOTSU RAMEN

444
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,735
-I'll have some more noodles.
-Legend.

445
00:24:30,398 --> 00:24:32,271
THE ULTIMATE BROTH, TONKOTSU RAMEN

446
