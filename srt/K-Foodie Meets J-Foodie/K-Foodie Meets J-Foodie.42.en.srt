11
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,313
This is insane.

12
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:53,887
This place still has
a quiet, suburban feel.

13
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:58,691
A QUIET PART OF ASAHIKAWA, HOKKAIDO

14
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:01,461
I'm craving chanko nabe today.

15
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:05,598
Is it called chanko nabe everywhere?

16
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:08,168
Chanko nabe is chanko nabe everywhere.

17
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,836
Is there a birthplace of chanko nabe?

18
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:13,673
Back in the day,

19
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:17,744
Hokkaido produced
an overwhelming number of sumo wrestlers.

20
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:20,713
Kitanofuji, the face of this restaurant,

21
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,517
was a legendary yokozuna.

22
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:28,488
Kitanofuji was
a sumo wrestler from Asahikawa

23
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,056
and he passed away last year.

24
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:33,493
He loved The Solitary Gourmet.

25
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,497
We had hoped to ask Kitanofuji

26
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:40,366
to narrate The Solitary Gourmet.

27
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:43,536
But last year his health
kept him from being on the show.

28
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:46,906
Soon after that, he passed away.
It was heartbreaking.

29
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:51,444
Being able to eat chanko nabe
shaped by his legacy here means a lot.

30
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,713
I'm truly moved.

31
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,548
-You look really happy.
-Yes.

32
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,483
Let's head in.

33
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,986
Do you still follow sumo closely?

34
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,622
I do. I watch every tournament.

35
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:07,627
And I appear on sumo talk shows too.

41
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,547
Excuse us.

42
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:28,615
Welcome.

43
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:30,550
Hello, nice to meet you. I'm Matsushige.

44
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,318
Thank you. Please, come in.

45
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:33,820
This is Sung Si-kyung.

46
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,622
-A pleasure to meet you.
-Are you the owner?

47
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,490
That's right. Pleased to meet you.

48
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:40,093
How are you related to Kitanofuji?

49
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:43,062
He's my uncle.

50
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,864
I see.

51
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:49,169
-He passed away last year.
-That's right.

52
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,237
I really wanted to meet him once.

53
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,406
Sadly, I couldn't.

54
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:57,277
Shall we head inside?

55
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,046
Let's go up to the second floor.

56
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,183
Did Kitanofuji come here often?

57
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:05,218
He came every summer.

58
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,252
I see.

59
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,856
Did you ever take up sumo yourself?

60
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,725
I might look like I did, but I didn't.

61
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,027
-You didn't?
-No.

62
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:16,563
-Weren't you encouraged to try?
-I was,

63
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,831
but I don't have the grit.

64
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:23,870
This is from my uncle's
60th ring-entering ceremony.

65
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:27,273
Even at sixty,
his physique was incredible.

66
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,242
He looks strong.

67
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,782
This style is the oicho, the topknot.

68
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:39,586
OICHO TOPKNOT
SYMBOL OF SUMO IDENTITY AND DIGNITY

69
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:43,489
Sumo wrestlers have
a hair-cutting ceremony when they retire.

70
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,391
Every wrestler cries.

71
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:49,929
It's the sensei that cuts
the topknot at the end, isn't it?

72
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:50,830
That's right.

73
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,699
MASTER

74
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,635
Is this Kitanofuji's
kesho-mawashi from back then?

75
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:56,703
Yes, it is.

76
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,438
KESHO-MAWASHI

77
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:03,943
AN ORNATE APRON THAT UPPER RANK SUMOS
WEAR, GIVEN TO THEM FROM SPONSORS

78
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,748
Shall we go eat
while we look at Kitanofuji's legacy?

79
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,717
Yes, this way.

80
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,686
-Wow, what a place.
-Excuse us.

81
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,393
There are some
brawny folks eating over there.

82
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,262
They all look quite solid.

83
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:24,964
What do you guys do?

84
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,733
We're a high school judo club.

85
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:27,734
-A judo club!?
-Judo.

86
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:31,070
A judo club… I did judo too.

87
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:32,705
I actually wanted to do sumo the most.

88
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,008
But my school
had no dohyo, so I joined judo.

89
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:41,981
This is my first time
at a chanko nabe place.

90
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,783
By the way, what's chanko?

91
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:48,087
Chanko is the general term

92
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,790
for food that sumo wrestlers eat
at the sumo stable.

93
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:56,529
Sumo wrestlers
train full-tilt from morning.

94
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:05,238
Lower-ranked wrestlers cook
while the seniors train.

95
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:11,744
The main hot pot among those dishes

96
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,681
is chanko nabe.

97
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:21,888
They pack the pot
with nutrients and ingredients.

98
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:27,593
Each sumo stable has
its own method for simmering broth.

99
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,863
Are there different bases, like ramen?

100
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:31,864
There are.

101
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:36,336
Shio, shoyu, and miso.

102
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:39,072
These days,
there are all kinds of bases, right?

103
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:42,875
Right.
There are spicy, stew-style ones too.

104
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,945
There are so many kinds of chanko.
What do you recommend?

105
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:50,650
Kokonoe chanko
packs the most ingredients.

106
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:51,651
-With everything.
-Yes.

107
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,286
KOKONOE CHANKO NABE

108
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,889
STYLE OF KITANOFUJI'S SUMO STABLE

109
00:05:56,956 --> 00:06:02,061
I'd like to add chicken tataki
and shiretoko chicken as toppings.

110
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,797
SHIRETOKO CHICKEN
PREMIUM CHICKEN FROM SHIRETOKO

111
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,399
CHICKEN TATAKI
MINCED CHICKEN MEATBALLS

112
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:09,302
In the kokonoe style,
the chicken tataki is the best.

113
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,573
Anything else catch your eye?

114
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,741
There's zangi.

115
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,409
Zangi.

116
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,778
-Since we're in Hokkaido.
-Zangi, please.

117
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,347
-Shall we try botan shrimp sashimi?
-Shall we?

118
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,983
-We'll order that then.
-Certainly.

119
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,486
MAIN
KOKONOE CHANKO NABE

120
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,221
ADD-ONS: CHICKEN TATAKI, SHIRETOKO CHICKEN

121
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:34,127
SIDES
ZANGI, BOTAN SHRIMP SASHIMI

122
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:41,067
Are chanko nabe shops everywhere in Japan?

123
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,201
There are, but…

124
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:44,303
-Not that many?
-Not that many.

125
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,240
I've never actually had it.

126
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,543
I've seen it a lot on TV shows, though.

127
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,278
I make chanko nabe at home often.

128
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:53,980
Really?

129
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:57,884
In the end,
there's no fixed recipe for chanko nabe.

130
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,486
Just add what you like,
and make it taste good.

131
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:03,222
-Good vegetables and good meat…
-Exactly.

132
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:05,892
Just add as much as you want.

133
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,794
But I want to get the broth right.

134
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,395
What do you use as the base?

135
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,397
Chicken.

136
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:16,736
They simmer chicken
for hours to make the broth.

137
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:20,106
I bet they take the broth
seriously here too.

138
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,641
I'd think so.

139
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:25,778
They even put
Kitanofuji's name on the sign.

140
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,947
They can't serve sloppy chanko nabe.

141
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:31,184
-That look says he won't forgive bad food.
-Right.

142
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:34,620
Excuse me.

143
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,656
I'll set up the hot pot.

144
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,492
So this is the kokonoe chanko nabe.

145
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,928
It's just the broth for now.

146
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,698
-So you add the ingredients here.
-Yes.

147
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,667
Are you from around here?

148
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,635
I married into this town.

149
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:51,904
I'm originally from Sapporo.

150
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,206
Are you the female owner?

151
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,942
-I'm the third-generation female owner.
-Oh, the owner.

152
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:57,109
I see.

153
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:00,980
How long do you simmer the broth?

154
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:04,417
About a day or two.

155
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:08,988
We simmer whole chickens for 12 hours.

156
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,859
So it takes about a day and a half.

157
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,530
CHICKENS USED

158
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:21,167
TOTAL: 900 CHICKENS

159
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:25,104
300 SERVINGS OF CHANKO NABE

160
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:29,242
3 CHICKENS PER SERVING

161
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:32,912
AFTER 12 HOURS OF SIMMERING

162
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:39,285
ULTRA-CONCENTRATED BROTH COMPLETE

163
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,090
-It's really concentrated.
-It is.

164
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:49,629
Kitanofuji would approve the taste, right?

165
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,863
He would.

166
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,964
"This is good enough."

167
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,233
"It's okay to serve as kokonoe chanko."

168
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:59,305
After all,
the shop name is after Kitanofuji.

169
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,341
The hakkaku oyakata comes here too.

170
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,510
-The Sumo Association chair?
-Yes, he visits.

171
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:09,048
The current chair is
Kitanofuji's disciple.

172
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,583
He stopped by recently.

173
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:15,054
He said,
"You can't replicate this chanko."

174
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,323
-He praised the flavor.
-I see.

175
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,725
He brings the wrestlers along too.

176
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,161
I can't wait.

177
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:26,666
Please grind the sesame seeds.

178
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,936
-Grind about sixty to seventy percent.
-Seventy?

179
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:30,970
Seventy percent.

180
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:33,573
One moment, please.

181
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,977
GROUND SESAME
FOR DIPPING BROTH AND SOLIDS

182
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:42,381
Aren't you curious about the broth base?

183
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:49,922
SIX CHICKENS FOR BROTH
TWO SERVINGS

184
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,269
-Is it good?
-It's good.

185
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,506
Wow…

186
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,610
I'm really looking forward to it.

187
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:11,744
I'm excited.

188
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:12,878
Can't wait.

189
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,617
Excuse me.

190
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,519
Here's the zangi.

191
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:25,391
ZANGI
1,400 YEN / 14,000 WON

192
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,961
This is botan shrimp sashimi.

193
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,330
Amazing.

194
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:35,635
BOTAN SHRIMP (TWO PIECES)
2,600 YEN / 26,000 WON

195
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,037
-Please enjoy.
-Try the botan shrimp.

196
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:55,888
Delicious.

197
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,667
It's so good.

198
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:11,103
It's sweet like a dessert.

199
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,781
The botan shrimp is so fresh.

200
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:28,254
-It's really good.
-Delicious.

201
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:34,126
How is zangi different from karaage?

202
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:40,232
In Hokkaido, they call karaage "zangi."

203
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,736
ZANGI
HOKKAIDO-STYLE KARAAGE, BOLDER SEASONING

204
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,774
Zangi.

205
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,142
Add lemon to taste.

206
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:03,656
It's good.

207
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,798
It's very simple.

208
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:19,038
The umami of the meat is concentrated.

209
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:21,607
Right.

210
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,076
You can really taste the meat.

211
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,512
There are no unnecessary tricks.

212
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,382
It's rich yet clean.

213
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,685
The portion's huge, isn't it?

214
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:34,820
Awesome. It's so thick.

215
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:40,025
This alone could be enough.

216
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:44,096
Zangi is a great side.

217
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,432
I could eat a bunch of these.

218
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,702
-It's here.
-Thanks for waiting.

219
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,071
Kokonoe chanko for two.

220
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:57,576
KOKONOE CHANKO NABE (FOR TWO)
12,000 YEN / 120,000 WON

221
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,680
ABOUT 20 DELICACIES FROM LAND AND SEA

222
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,621
VEGETABLES, MEAT
SEAFOOD, NOODLES, MEATBALLS

223
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,791
It looks like a sumo's topknot.

224
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,459
-Oicho?
-Yes.

225
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,562
Excuse me.

226
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,166
Looks fresh and delicious.

227
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:24,236
-We start with burdock.
-Burdock goes on the bottom.

228
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,172
Yes, it builds the broth.

229
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,675
-Are those scallops?
-Yes.

230
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:30,743
Scallops.

231
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,213
-Hairy crab.
-Hairy crab?!

232
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,848
Packed with innards.

233
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,350
Next is thornyhead fish.

234
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:39,418
Thornyhead?

235
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,221
This is ganmodoki.

236
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,026
We custom make
the ganmodoki, shirataki, and tofu

237
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,795
to go well with the hot pot.

238
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:52,031
SHIRATAKI
TOFU

239
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:53,499
GANMODOKI

240
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:55,467
RADISH

241
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,004
That's fantastic.

242
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,707
Here's the shiretoko chicken you added.

243
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:07,046
SHIRETOKO CHICKEN 1,300 YEN / 13,000 WON
PREMIUM CHICKEN FROM SHIRETOKO, HOKKAIDO

244
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:09,248
And the added chicken tataki.

245
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:16,322
CHICKEN TATAKI 1,200 YEN / 12,000 WON
MINCED CHICKEN MEATBALL

246
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:19,258
Since the broth base is chicken,

247
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,293
chicken with chicken can't go wrong.

248
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,228
Right.

249
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:24,230
This is cod.

250
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:26,332
Salmon.

251
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,067
Botan shrimp.

252
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,337

SEAWEED, GARLIC CHIVES, CROWN DAISY

255
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:42,681
CHANKO NABE WITH OVER 20 INGREDIENTS

256
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,784
Amazing.
The Kokonoe chanko is finally ready.

257
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:48,921
-Is this for two people?
-Two people.

258
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:51,924
It's for two,
but sized as one sumo portion.

259
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:54,827
Impressive, isn't it?

260
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:56,962
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

261
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:57,897
-Please enjoy.
-Help yourself.

262
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:01,934
Oh, it's brisket.

263
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,538
Do we dip it in sesame?

264
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:07,506
Like this.

265
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,476
You add a little broth.

266
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:11,477
You need the broth.

267
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,747
-Like this?
-Yes.

268
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:15,915
Try it first.

269
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:20,819
Need more broth?

270
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,232
This is insane. That broth is insane.

271
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,137
I'm craving the chicken meatball.

272
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,150
I'll try the chicken meatball.

273
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:58,157
This is it. This is the one.

274
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:01,493
Chicken tataki?

275
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:07,099
I think the chicken tataki
is the star of the chanko.

276
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:11,203
Now this is chanko nabe.

277
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,739
Chicken in rich chicken broth.

278
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:19,678
So good.

279
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,786
With this, rice would go down easy.

280
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,592
The broth is incredible.

281
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,435
What is it with this broth?

282
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,145
-Amazing broth.
-It's the best.

283
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:56,882
Super powered jjambbong, essentially.

284
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,551
A super rich chicken broth,

285
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:05,124
packed with veggies, meat,
shrimp, and crab, all mixed together.

286
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,593
An umami punch that opens your eyes.

287
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,229
Peak, concentrated umami.

288
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:12,731
The ingredients are top tier.

289
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,802
No wonder it's good.
Broth that takes a day and a half to make.

290
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:22,641
It's almost painfully umami rich.

291
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,942
Umami on umami.

292
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,678
My lips are already sticking together.

293
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:30,582
It clings, sticky and rich.

294
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,217
The broth is thick already.

295
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,954
A distillation of flavor.

296
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:37,589
Next level flavor.

297
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:41,960
-Found a scallop.
-You have.

298
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,531
Come here, scallop.

299
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:48,400
Scallop.

300
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,036
-There's a scallop.
-Yes.

301
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,095
Is it good?

302
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,633
This place is unusually good.

303
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,701
It is.

304
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,004
What's this?

305
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:27,473
Ganmodoki.

306
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,907
What's in it?

307
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:30,008
It's tofu…

308
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:35,414
Slowly, slowly.

309
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:36,849
After you finish.

310
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,818
-Time your questions better.
-I'm sorry.

311
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:43,088
It's deep-fried tofu.

312
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,223
It's soft and fluffy.

313
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,159
It soaks up broth, so it's very hot.

314
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:48,460
-Careful.
-Okay.

315
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,401
The tofu…

316
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:00,572
Soak it in the broth.

317
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,289
So good.

318
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:21,059
-It's insanely good.
-It's insanely good.

319
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:22,961
-It's insanely good.
-It's insanely good.

320
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,531
This is like the final boss.

321
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,166
In games,

322
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,235
there's a boss at the last stage.

323
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:33,205
Chanko nabe feels like that final boss.

324
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:35,607
It has everything.

325
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:36,608
And it's delicious.

326
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,579
Kitanofuji himself was like a final boss.

327
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,217
Salmon.

328
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,995
-This shrimp is packed with roe.
-Roe.

329
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:08,840
Chicken broth has soaked into the chives.

330
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,275
It's the best.

331
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:12,578
Hairy crab.

332
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:18,717
SHIRATAKI (KONJAC NOODLES)

333
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:25,257
They said this shirataki is special-made.

334
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,358
It's so good.

335
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:27,326
This is insane.

336
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:28,860
Burdock.

337
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:33,432
So tender.

338
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:34,600
Seaweed.

339
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,239
This is insane.

340
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,474
Insane.

341
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,276
I've unlocked "insane."

342
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:49,348
I'm glad a Korean loves it this much.

343
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,885
I told you it's my first time.

344
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,288
Maybe this is…

345
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:58,257
since we started this show,

346
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:01,360
this might be the best
I've eaten in Japan.

347
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,197
I'm blown away.

348
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,533
It's like a party. It's like a festival.

349
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,601
A festival, yes.

350
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:11,770
Over here, hairy crab.

351
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:14,306
Over here, beef.

352
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:15,807
And here, botan shrimp.

353
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:18,010
The chicken meatballs are so good.

354
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,244
The chives are outstanding.

355
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,748
What can I say. There's no flaw.

356
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,283
I took a sip of the broth,

357
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,818
and it's already thick.

358
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:30,756
The rich broth got even richer.

359
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,292
-Shall we ask for more broth?
-Sounds good.

360
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:34,426
Excuse me, ma'am!

361
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:35,327
Yes?

362
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:39,398
Excuse me. I'll add more broth.

363
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,633
BROTH REFILL

364
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,734
This is delicious.

365
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,769
Glad to hear.

366
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:46,805
I've never had chanko nabe

367
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:50,409
with broth this rich.

368
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,477
Really? Thank you.

369
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:54,713
-It's the best.
-Thank you.

370
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,383
Each ingredient's strength
are all condensed in this hot pot.

371
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,319
-I'm glad.
-Amazing.

372
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:05,123
Do you like it?

373
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,192
More than like it.

374
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,295
-I want to live here.
-Here? In Asahikawa?

375
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:11,196
For a month.

376
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:14,299
I want to eat it
as much as I want for a month.

377
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:16,034
You'll get huge.

378
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:19,871
Shall we add kishimen?

379
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:21,173
Kishimen?

380
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:24,943
Unlike somyeon, it's a flat noodle.

381
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:27,279
Could we, please?

382
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:29,348
KISHIMEN

383
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:33,652
KISHIMEN
BROAD, FLAT UDON

384
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,826
I think they are ready.

385
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:41,860
Are they cooked?

386
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:44,196
Kishimen cooks fast.

387
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:03,415
Not the same, but it's like kalguksu.

388
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:11,957
It's just delicious.

389
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:20,632
I could eat this endlessly.

390
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:22,634
You could.

391
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:12,818
Is it good?

392
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,087
What am I going to do about my diet?

393
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:17,689
How do I ever start?

394
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:19,791
How do I eat small portions of this?

395
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:21,126
Right.

396
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,428
My chopsticks won't stop.

397
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:29,701
This is nice.

398
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:30,769
You like it?

399
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:33,338
FILMED WITH CONSENT
SAUNA ATTIRE WORN INSIDE

400
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:34,473
Do you like saunas?

401
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:37,275
I used to like saunas.

402
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:39,344
I don't go as much these days.

403
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:41,880
Since they're popular
among younger people, I go less now.

404
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,548
You do stand out.

405
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:47,486
The hair and you're a big guy too.

406
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:51,356
We went together in Seoul, remember?

407
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:54,226
-We went to a sauna in Seoul.
-That was a sauna, right?

408
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:57,329
-Yes, it was a sauna.
-So it was.

409
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:58,897
Let's go again next time.

410
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,165
This place is great too.

411
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,501
SAUNA

412
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:07,005
Is Asahikawa known
for bathhouses or hot springs?

413
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,340
Definitely.

414
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:10,041
It's a must on trips.

415
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:14,412
A trip is meaningless
without places like this.

416
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:23,021
Hotels often have facilities
everyone can enjoy, like a sauna.

417
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:24,189
That's nice.

418
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:30,095
OMO7 Asahikawa
by Hoshino Resorts has an excellent sauna.

419
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:31,329
It sure does.

420
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:34,866
We can enjoy the steam like this.

421
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:36,434
It relieves fatigue.

422
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,437
We worked up a good sweat.

423
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:44,242
Food after a sauna visit
would taste amazing.

424
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:45,443
-Shall we go?
-Let's go.

425
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,546
THE NEXT INSANELY GOOD SPOT

426
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,748
Top-grade bulgogi.

427
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:52,551
TOP-GRADE HANWOO BULGOGI

428
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:54,386
The top-tier spot from our show.

429
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:57,055
ROYAL HOT POT
SHINSEOLLO

430
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:59,391
There's no way this can't be delicious.

431
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:03,395
FOOD OF KINGS
ROYAL COURT CUISINE

432
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:20,111
