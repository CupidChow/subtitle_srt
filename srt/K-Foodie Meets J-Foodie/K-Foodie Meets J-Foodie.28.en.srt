EPISODE 28
RED MEANS APPLE, BLACK MEANS TATIN

7
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,097
Do you like apples?

8
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,632
-Do you?
-Well…

9
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:07,134
I don't hate it.

10
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,669
You don't really like them.

11
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,804
I'm not the biggest fan of fruits.

12
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:13,140
-That's not healthy.
-Do you like them?

13
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:14,441
I love fruits.

14
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:18,745
They say heavy drinkers
don't like sweet things.

15
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,013
That is true.

16
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,750
When it comes to cakes or pies,

17
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:28,689
isn't apple the best flavor?

18
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,390
True.

19
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:33,126
Have you had Tarte Tatin before?

20
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:34,595
Of course.

21
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,263
I have a baking certificate.

22
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:38,398
Amazing. So I got this Tarte Tatin

23
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:42,135
from my daughter and her husband
for my birthday.

24
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:44,371
-From this place?
-Yes.

25
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:48,408
It came frozen,
so I thawed it before eating.

26
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:50,143
I was blown away.

27
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:54,748
I've never had
an apple dessert like that before.

28
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:56,183
-Not even in Tokyo?
-No.

29
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:58,952
Not even in the plethora
of dessert shops of Tokyo?

30
00:01:59,019 --> 00:01:59,886
Not once.

31
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:03,056
So I'm curious what it will taste like
if I have it fresh.

32
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,192
-It's your first time here?
-Yes.

33
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:06,994
That's good.

34
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:07,995
Right?

35
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:11,164
Wow. What an amazing shop.

36
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,934
-La Voiture.

-Excuse me.
-Wow.

40
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,879
Apples…

41
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:27,848
Wow, the apples…

42
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:31,118
We are being welcomed by apples.

43
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,891
Do you actually use these apples?

44
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,661
That's right. They're Aomori apples,

45
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:43,196
and we actually use them.

46
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,766
OWNER OF LA VOITURE

47
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,135
After eating the Tarte Tatin from here,

48
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:52,439
my whole idea of apple desserts
was completely overturned.

49
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,342
-Really? Thank you.
-I was shocked.

50
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:56,710
What is Tarte Tatin?

51
00:02:56,777 --> 00:03:01,114
Tarte Tatin is
a traditional French dessert.

52
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,984
It's a tart made by

53
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:07,320
cooking down apples in a pot.

54
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,723
And the ingredients?

55
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,959
-Apples, butter, and sugar.
-Apples, butter, and sugar.

56
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,295
-And dough.
-With lots of care.

57
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,999
-The name Tatin…
-Yes.

58
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:21,201
…comes from the Tatin sisters.

59
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:25,272
They actually made the tart by mistake.

60
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:28,742
They never intended to make it that way?

61
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:32,079
That's right. There are many theories.

62
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,648
One is that they forgot
to put the dough on the bottom.

63
00:03:34,777 --> 00:03:38,605
FIRST THEORY, A REGULAR APPLE TART
WAS SERVED UPSIDE DOWN

64
00:03:38,705 --> 00:03:42,122
NORMALLY, YOU LAY DOWN THE DOUGH FIRST
AND THEN BAKE IT WITH APPLES ON TOP

65
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:44,311
APPLE
DOUGH

66
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,015
BUT THEY FORGOT TO LAY DOWN THE DOUGH
AND ONLY BAKED THE APPLES

67
00:03:48,157 --> 00:03:51,835
THEY LATER PUT THE DOUGH
OVER THE COOKED APPLES

68
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:55,302
CREATING THE UPSIDE-DOWN TART, TARTE TATIN

69
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,671
Another theory is that
they burned the apples,

70
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,639
so they covered them with the dough.

71
00:03:59,768 --> 00:04:03,030
SECOND THEORY, THEY WERE TRYING TO
SAVE AN APPLE PIE THEY MESSED UP

72
00:04:03,138 --> 00:04:07,726
THEY COOKED THE APPLES
FOR TOO LONG BY MISTAKE

73
00:04:07,843 --> 00:04:12,698
SO THEY PUT THE DOUGH ON TOP
TO SAVE THE APPLE PIE

74
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,089
ALTHOUGH THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO
SAVE THE APPLE PIE,

75
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:17,758
THE TARTE TATIN WAS BORN

76
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:23,263
The Tatin sisters used to run a hotel.

77
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,299
And when they served it there,
people really liked it,

78
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,068
and it spread across the whole world.

79
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:36,576
So who started the Tarte Tatin shop here?

80
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,579
It was my grandmother.

81
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,314
-The one in the photo?
-Yes.

82
00:04:43,745 --> 00:04:46,140
A DESCENDANT OF THE TATIN SISTERS

83
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:50,323
A Tarte Tatin medal?

84
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,826
-Yes, it's a medal.
-She is really something.

85
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:57,030
She served Tarte Tatin at her restaurant.

86
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:58,698
TARTE TATIN

87
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:02,569
But only her Tarte Tatin became famous.

88
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,405
So she changed her restaurant into a cafe.

89
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,109
Let's order a Tarte Tatin!

90
00:05:09,204 --> 00:05:10,377
TARTE TATIN
8,600 WON, 860 YEN

91
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,913
We'll order one each.
Does the cake set

92
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,614
-come with a drink?
-Yes.

93
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:17,350
What drink goes well with Tarte Tatin?

94
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:21,621
Whiskey goes really well
with desserts like this.

95
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,690
You think so? Should we do the Plus, then?

96
00:05:24,153 --> 00:05:26,026
WHISKEY PLUS
EXTRA 1,500 WON, 150 YEN

97
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:28,395
Whiskey plus?

98
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,865
-You add the whiskey to it?
-Yes.

99
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,568
He just needs the whiskey.

100
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:35,769
I see.

101
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,538
We don't offer whiskey on its own.

102
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:40,207
I'll take black tea.

103
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:44,110
I'll have coffee
and apple syrup carbonated water.

104
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:45,779
Sure.

105
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,984
-Walnut tart.
-Oh, it's walnut pie.

106
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:54,554
Wherever I go, I always find walnuts.

107
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:55,755
-Let's try this, too.
-I want

108
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:56,723
-to try this.
-Yes.

109
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,724
Walnut tart.

110
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:58,925
-We'll share one.
-Okay.

111
00:05:58,992 --> 00:05:59,893
-Okay.
-Okay.

112
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,027
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

113
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,028
WHAT THEY ORDERED TODAY

114
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,496
TWO TARTE TATIN, ONE WALNUT TART

115
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,532
BLACK TEA, COFFEE,
APPLE SYRUP CARBONATED WATER

116
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,401
One thing I really like is

117
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:11,471
how Japanese people study things

118
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,506
from other cultures thoroughly,

119
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:17,644
add just a little twist,
and turn them into something Japanese

120
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,580
that makes foreigners go, "Oh!"
and surprise them.

121
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:22,883
We love to imitate things.

122
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:26,186
Pasta, western food, and desserts.

123
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:28,455
Among Japanese people,

124
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:32,792
there's a tendency
to look down on old things.

125
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,595
We underestimate ourselves.

126
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:38,665
But when foreigners say,

127
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,834
"Doesn't Japan have
such-and-such delicious things?"

128
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,403
or, "You have such excellent skills,"

129
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,672
it makes us realize their value again.

130
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,641
I think those ups and downs

131
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:51,678
have lasted for hundreds of years.

132
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,915
-Ups and downs.
-Ups and downs.

133
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:58,852
Anyway, I'm very happy I get to taste

134
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,055
foods from all around the world
in Tokyo and Seoul.

135
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:03,089
-Right?
-Yes.

136
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,557
It's good.

137
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,294
-Your food is here.
-It's here.

138
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:08,695
It's here.

139
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,096
Here you go.

140
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,698
I thought it was sweet red bean jelly.

141
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:12,866
Right?

142
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,135
It's burnt.

143
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,237
-This…
-It just looks burnt.

144
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:19,839
If you get the whole cake,
it looks like a black blob.

145
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,007
-Yes.
-I see.

146
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:22,842
How many apples are in a whole cake?

147
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,444
More than 20.

148
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:25,512
Twenty.

149
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:29,149
There's more than one apple in one slice.

150
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,519
Mr. Matjjigae,
who loves apples, is very excited.

151
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,621
He loves desserts and apples.

152
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:37,624
-And now he's actually here.
-I've always wanted to come.

153
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,592
-Thank you.
-It's your first time, right?

154
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,795
-I only had frozen ones…
-Right, so…

155
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:43,430
-…that I thawed.
-Right.

156
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,733
-So I wanted to have fresh Tarte Tatin.
-I'm happy to hear it.

157
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,234
Thank you.

158
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,370
Okay…

159
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:53,974
TARTE TATIN (DRINKS INCLUDED)
15,200 WON, 1,520 YEN

160
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,608
Try it.

161
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,143
-Go ahead.
-You first.

162
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,212
I already know what it tastes like.

163
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,815
Then…

164
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,287
So you eat it from there?

165
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:10,724
-Did I do something wrong?
-No. I don't know.

166
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,625
I just noticed you start from this side

167
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:13,660
Then where do you start?

168
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:15,295
I don't know.

169
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:16,796
Try this part first.

170
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,301
You're cutting it vertically.

171
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,038
I'm cutting it diagonally.

172
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,476
-I'm going to try it.
-Okay.

173
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,178
-Your first Tarte Tatin.
-This is…

174
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,616
-It is…
-What's wrong?

175
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,885
What happened?
You put it in and took it out.

176
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:40,820
The butter smell is strong.

177
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,066
It's good. It is really good.

178
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:56,236
-It's the flavor of a grown-up.
-No explanation needed.

179
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,670
It is a grown-up flavor.

180
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,305
A grown-up flavor.

181
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,409
This doesn't have liqueur, right?

182
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,477
-Like hard liquor?
-Yes.

183
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,047
There's this strong scent

184
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:11,651
that makes me think
there's liquor in there.

185
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,289
The side looks really pretty.

186
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,302
Just now,

187
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:33,840
I scolded you for taking it
out of your mouth after you put it in.

188
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,041
But I get it now.

189
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,509
-You also wanted to, right?
-Yes.

190
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,744
You want to check again.

191
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:39,045
You check one more time.

192
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:42,615
-"What's this?"
-"Where is this smell coming from?"

193
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:45,919
It's the smell of butter
and whiskey, I think.

194
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:50,323
And it was cooked down perfectly
that it just melts in your mouth.

195
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,092
It's so soft.

196
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,961
I think the varieties of sweetness

197
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:57,630
are at the heart of fine dining.

198
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:01,935
There's a sweetness
that only comes with patience.

199
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:05,605
One you can't get from a plain apple,
but only by

200
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:10,176
carefully simmering it
with effort and care.

201
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,979
The apple is at its most delicious state.

202
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:16,516
When I was young, there was
a simple snack called Yakiringo.

203
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,451
It's just roasted apples,

204
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:23,089
but I was shocked because I never knew
roasted apples could be so sweet.

205
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:24,724
How did you roast it?

206
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,327
I think they used a toaster oven.

207
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,895
I guess it's a Japanese thing.

208
00:10:29,116 --> 00:10:30,697
-I've never heard of it.
-Yakiringo.

209
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:35,034
-Moms would always peel apples for us.
-They do that.

210
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:39,105
But apples just tasted like
moisturizing cream to me.

211
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,473
What do you mean?

212
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,543
My mom would put cream on her face

213
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,178
and then peel apples for my family.

214
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:48,281
So I always wondered
why it tasted like a skin care product.

215
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:51,718
It had a really strong flavor
of moisturizing cream.

216
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,420
-I see.
-It's a little story of mine.

217
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,556
Buy her a good moisturizing cream.

218
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,992
It was even worse
because she did use a good one.

219
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,461
-It was too good.
-It tasted like expensive cream.

220
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:15,608
You said it's a grown-up taste.
I get what you meant by that.

221
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,944
It has a bitter taste to it.

222
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,480
It's not an uncomfortable bitterness.

223
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:23,183
I think it's probably because
of the part that looks burnt.

224
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:27,120
The farther up you go,
the more bitter it gets.

225
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,455
Burnt flavor.

226
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:33,459
The burnt part
actually gives it a smoky flavor.

227
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,796
It's strange to say this,
but I'm not craving coffee.

228
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,365
-Really?
-It's like, this is enough.

229
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:42,235
That's the role of coffee

230
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:43,770
when eating sweet things.

231
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,105
-Cleansing the palate with bitterness.
-Yes.

232
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:49,209
But this already has the bitter flavor.

233
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,243
I think that's why.

234
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:54,681
I think something light like
black tea would be a better pairing.

235
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:58,084
-It goes well together.
-Right? Of course it does.

236
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:00,053
Why did you choose coffee?

237
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:02,822
I don't know. I just did.

238
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,392
It's good.

239
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,628
-It's good.
-Right?

240
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:10,997
-It's extraordinary, right?
-Yes.

241
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:15,301
I don't think we'll be able to
have this anywhere else.

242
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:17,770
Only here.

243
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,907
A traditional French dessert

244
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:25,411
completed in the "La Voiture" style.

245
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:28,114
It's like a collaboration between
Japan and France.

246
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,550
This is why I like Kyoto.

247
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:33,152
They have lots of luxurious shops.

248
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,321
Even Japanese people feel Kyoto is special

249
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,757
when they visit.

250
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:40,560
Only Kyoto has places like this.

251
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:44,130
No other city can copy this.

252
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:45,398
Yes.

253
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,400
It has that depth.

254
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,437
I'm really learning a lot while doing this

255
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,172
with Mr. Matjjigae.

256
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,608
I would probably never have gone

257
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:57,577
to a Tarte Tatin shop
until the day I died.

258
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:04,150
When I studied Japanese through
expressions from Solitary Gourmet,

259
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:05,852
Was it "meeting with the unknown"?

260
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:08,855
This feels like something like that.

261
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,024
When you're with a lady friend,

262
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,925
shouldn't you take her
to a place like this

263
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,230
to show her that you have good taste?

264
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,932
Won't that make you popular?
I don't really know, but…

265
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,467
I don't know places like this.

266
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,403
I do know a really good pigs' feet place.

267
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,904
I know a good pigs' feet place.

268
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:27,507
Don't say that.
It looks like pigs' feet now.

269
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,242
Right. It looked like that.

270
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:31,244
Well-cooked…

271
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,347
Because it's a dessert
meant to be eaten after

272
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,082
-hunted meat or rich dishes.
-I see.

273
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,252
-I see.
-I think it could be connected to

274
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,486
pigs' feet somehow.

275
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,989
-You don't have to force a connection.
-No, no.

276
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:45,692
It's actually really good when it is

277
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,427
-eaten with meat.
-I think it'll go well…

278
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,628
-Yes.
-…with pork.

279
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:50,563
After eating pork

280
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,099
-and your mouth feels greasy…
-Yes.

281
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,935
The bitter and tangy flavor

282
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,804
will cleanse your palette.

283
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,476
This is the walnut tart.

284
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,412
This seems unique.

285
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,581
I've cut it in half.

286
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,583
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

287
00:14:10,945 --> 00:14:14,053
WALNUT TART (DRINKS INCLUDED)
13,200 WON (1,320 YEN)

288
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,689
This is the apple syrup…

289
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:18,157
-Carbonated water.
-carbonated water.

290
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:21,761
It's a syrup made with only apples.

291
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:25,765
It'll be easier just
to eat it with your hands.

292
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,201
French-style.

293
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,504
It's hard.

294
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:33,206
-Is it?
-It's totally hard.

295
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,208
-Is it warm?
-It's cold.

296
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:38,144
Look over here, please.

297
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:42,382
It's completely different
from the Tarte Tatin we just had.

298
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,016
-Thank you.
-Go on.

299
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,021
It's all gooey and stretchy.

300
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,491
Like peanut butter.

301
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,659
It's like caramel. Or should I say nougat?

302
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,895
The nougat from nougat crackers.

303
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:59,665
-It's good.
-It's good?

304
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,368
This also has a bitter taste.

305
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:04,137
-It's bitter.
-I see.

306
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,574
It's glossy.

307
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:21,254
-It's bitter.
-Right?

308
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,390
It's like a healthy bitterness.

309
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:27,860
This is also a grown-up flavor.

310
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,363
I think the bitterness
comes from the walnuts.

311
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,998
Do you think so?

312
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:35,735
The bitterness comes from
the inner shell of walnuts

313
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:39,872
as well as the caramel.
We burn it quite intensely.

314
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:44,110
-It's a bitter caramel.
-I've never had anything like this.

315
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:46,345
We can find walnut pie anywhere.

316
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:49,615
But this one is different.

317
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,056
It's luxurious.

318
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,825
This calls for whiskey.

319
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:02,128
-I see.
-Whiskey would go well with this.

320
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:03,296
-Whiskey?
-Yes.

321
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:05,598
-Would you like some?
-No, no.

322
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:08,334
-Could you please give him a glass?
-We have really good whiskey.

323
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:09,335
-Yes.
-For pairing.

324
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:11,237
Try the Tarte Tatin with whiskey, too.

325
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,405
Right?

326
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,341
-I'm not wrong, right?
-Okay.

327
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:17,643
-I understand how much you want whiskey.
-No, no.

328
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,612
I want to drink whiskey

329
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:20,980
all the time.

330
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,983
But the moment I tasted this,

331
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,718
I knew it would go well with whiskey.

332
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:27,019
Whiskey.

333
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:31,691
Isn't the purpose of this show

334
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:34,961
to present even more delicious pairings?

335
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,295
That's true.

336
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,998
-Thank you for waiting.
-What's this?

337
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:40,566
Bourbon whiskey.

338
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,535
-American?
-Yes.

339
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:48,241
It's quite a light color for bourbon.

340
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,017
Why did you quit drinking?

341
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,720
I feel so bad for you right now.

342
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,021
-Let me smell it.
-Just try…

343
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,585
This is to die for.

344
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:35,755
-It suits the tart really well.
-Really well.

345
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:38,391
Both walnut tart and Tarte Tatin
go well with whiskey.

346
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:40,593
It makes me want to eat more.

347
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,662
I can keep eating.

348
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,030
It's so good.

349
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,131
This is the best.

350
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,242
It's good.

351
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:57,610
I agree.

352
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,146
This really is amazing.

353
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:03,049
Right now, it feels like
Shimokitazawa at 3 a.m.

354
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:07,119
-Like I'm at a bar.
-All of a sudden.

355
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:12,425
The sun is out right now,

356
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,596
but it feels like the middle of the night.

357
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,798
Tarte Tatin is a dessert of the night.

358
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:22,268
I think I can eat this until the morning.

359
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:26,806
Dessert is the finest work of art
humans have created.

360
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:32,244
The moment you pair it
with a good wine or whiskey,

361
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,214
that's when you feel

362
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,484
this is what culture is.

363
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:43,723
It's the ultimate moment of luxury
a person can experience.

364
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:50,029
I'll try the carbonated water
with apple syrup.

365
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,106
-Okay.
-This is…

366
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,708
It will be really good with alcohol.

367
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:04,176
Try it.

368
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:14,520
Right?

369
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:18,090
The only thing missing is the alcohol.

370
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,726
-Right?
-Some alcohol would make it complete.

371
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:24,163
I think gin, regular soju,

372
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,733
or bourbon will go well with it.

373
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,602
Vodka, too.

374
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:33,506
If you just add
some kind of liquor to it…

375
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:36,108
-This…
-…it would make a world of difference.

376
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:40,212
It's because
the sweet flavor is all natural.

377
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,515
If you add some alcohol to this,

378
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,383
it will certainly be like

379
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,986
"meeting with the unknown."

380
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:48,120
Right.

381
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:49,622
Gosh.

382
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:51,223
This…

383
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:52,591
Whiskey Plus.

384
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:53,926
He added it.

385
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:58,230
This non-alcoholic drink.

386
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,499
This alcoholic drink.

387
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,036
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

388
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:16,515
-It's good?
-It works.

389
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:17,450
They go well together.

390
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:18,384
They do.

391
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:21,053
-What was lacking is now fulfilled.
-It's been fulfilled?

392
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:22,655
It's been filled?

393
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,156
The last missing piece

394
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:26,492
was bourbon.

395
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,730
We didn't come here to drink.

396
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:33,432
This isn't a drink.

397
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:34,667
It's medicine.

398
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,569
That's what drunk people always say.

399
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:37,924
