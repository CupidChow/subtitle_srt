1
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:05,438
K-foodie meets J-foodie.

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:06,940
This is insane.

3
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:11,578
GAMJATANG

4
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:15,949
PORK BONE STEW
WITH PERILLA SEEDS, SCALLIONS AND GARLIC

5
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:23,757
DEEP, RICH WORLD OF GAMJATANG

6
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:27,927
HAENGDANG MARKET SHOPPING STREET

7
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:34,734
We're here at Haengdang Market
located in Seongdong-gu.

8
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:37,303
Today,

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,806
we're meeting up somewhere.

10
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:43,209
Today on K-foodie meets J-foodie.

11
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:45,178
Mr. Matjjigae loves pork the most.

12
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,347
But we've never done gamjatang.

13
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:48,982
I searched and searched.

14
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,151
And I chose this place.

15
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:56,656
Koreans all have their own gamjatang spot.

16
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,691
For our Japanese viewers,

17
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:01,094
gamjatang comes in all kinds.

18
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:04,798
Finding your favorite takes work.

19
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:08,701
You won't know
until you've tried many places.

20
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:11,738
Why am I explaining gamjatang this hard?

21
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,273
I'm a singer, after all.

22
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:19,012
GAMJATANG EXPERT: SUNG SI-KYUNG

23
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,418
LET'S EAT REGULAR MENU: GAMJATANG

24
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:32,158
LET'S EAT FEATURED 10 GAMJATANG SPOTS

25
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:36,429
OF THESE,
THE MOST SUNG SI-KYUNG-ESQUE GAMJATANG

26
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,836
It's awesome. Really.

27
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:45,138
If gamjatang were a ballad singer,

28
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,107
this place would be like Sung Si-kyung.

29
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:49,209
Sung Si-kyung isn't the very best, right?

30
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,777
But he's not bad. He's smooth.

31
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:54,247
Feels like you could
eat this for a lifetime.

32
00:01:56,349 --> 00:02:02,155
THE SUNG SI-KYUNG OF GAMJATANG

33
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:06,259
INSANELY GOOD SPOT
JAESUDON GAMJATANG

34
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:07,327
Gamjatang?

35
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:09,829
Gamjatang? Is this it?

36
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:12,599
Hello.

37
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:14,367
Is this gamjatang?

38
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:15,468
Yes, it's gamjatang.

39
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:16,769
Excuse me.

40
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:19,372
Hello.

41
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,407
Hello.

42
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,276
-Over here.
-Hi--

43
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,911
Hi.

44
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:26,446
This way, please.

45
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,449
Today's opening feels a bit different.

46
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:30,817
I've been waiting.

47
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,752
-Did you wait long?
-Not at all.

48
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,820
No worries.

49
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:36,556
Today, it's gamjatang.

50
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,224
Gamjatang.

51
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,859
It's pork.
Your favorite meat, Mr. Matjjigae.

52
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,428
But isn't gamja potato?

53
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,198
-Not exactly.
-It isn't?

54
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:48,201
There are a few theories.

55
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,670
For the first theory,

56
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:54,274
gamja refers to
the spinal cord in pork backbones,

57
00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:00,580
so the stew with the pork backbones
became gamjatang.

58
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:04,017
Sometimes gamjatang has no potato.

59
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:10,290
Another says
it's named because real potatoes go in.

60
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:13,526
-There are a few theories.
-I see.

61
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,528
-Shall we order?
-Let's order.

62
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:18,064
-What should we do?
-About the menu…

63
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,899
There's the hot pot, gamjatang,

64
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,770
and ppyeo haejangguk,
a single serving version,

65
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:28,141
so it comes with about two bones.

66
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,409
That's one serving.

67
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:32,178
But with ppyeo haejangguk,
you can't make fried rice.

68
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,913
Fried rice!

69
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,449
-Koreans always order fried rice.
-Fried rice.

70
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:39,686
You need the hot pot
to finish with fried rice.

71
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:43,289
So for fried rice,
let's do gamjatang first.

72
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,658
One small gamjatang, please.

73
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,026
ORDER

74
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,529
SMALL GAMJATANG (2–3 SERVINGS)

75
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:52,432
DRINKS/BEER
BEER, NONALCOHOLIC BEER

76
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,168
-Long time no see.
-Cheers.

77
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:02,842
I'm confident about
this place's gamjatang.

78
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:03,910
Really?

79
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:10,450
We're near the Majang-dong Meat Market.

80
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:12,919
MAJANG-DONG MEAT MARKET

81
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:16,689
KOREA'S LARGEST MEAT MARKET
IN MAJANG-DONG, SEONGDONG-GU, SEOUL

82
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,726
It handles about 70%

83
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:24,364
of Korea's meat distribution,

84
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,734
so you can source extremely fresh meat.

85
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,837
But even before
this became a gamjatang place,

86
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,406
the owner's husband spent
26 years at Majang-dong

87
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:37,143
cutting and trimming bones.
He's a true specialist.

88
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,780
So there are people at the market
who specialize only in bones.

89
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,181
MAJANG-DONG BONE SPECIALIST

90
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:45,685
I've only had gamjatang once.

91
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,253
Near Yongsan, right?

92
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,422
I'm not sure it was Yongsan.

93
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:51,057
It was during the promotions in Korea.

94
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,493
It was late at night,

95
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:57,130
and I couldn't sleep
unless I ate something,

96
00:04:57,196 --> 00:05:02,902
so I tried gamjatang
at a spot the staff recommended.

97
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,406
Was it perilla seed powder?
There was a lot sprinkled on.

98
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,141
That powder left a strong impression.

99
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:09,475
Right.

100
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,878
Not every gamjatang is like that, though.

101
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:16,482
But gamjatang generally
uses plenty of perilla powder,

102
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,051
to make it richer and nutty.

103
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:20,687
They say gamjatang originated in Jeolla.

104
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:24,290
-From Jeolla, then.
-Right, the southwest.

105
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,092
Right. So it's a dish from Jeolla.

106
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:31,964
Jeolla dishes use
plenty of perilla seed powder.

107
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,768
But gamjatang is
something you eat out, right?

108
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,737
Some people make it at home.

109
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:38,905
With pork bone broth?

110
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,807
Yes, pork bone broth.

111
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:43,910
Still, instead of making a pot for three,

112
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:49,649
broth simmered for hours
with lots of bones tastes better.

113
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:53,953
I think gamjatang
tastes better at restaurants.

114
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:59,992
In Japan, some people
make chicken bone stock,

115
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:05,465
but hardly anyone makes tonkotsu at home.

116
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:07,967
Here it comes.

117
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,035
Please.

118
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,239
It's really rich.

119
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,244
GAMJATANG [SMALL]
29,000 WON / 2,900 YEN

120
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,146
Is this perilla powder?

121
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,248
That's perilla seed powder.

122
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:26,419
-The black powder.
-The stuff sprinkled here?

123
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,287
Is this "ugeoge"?

124
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:30,156
-Ugeoji.
-Ah, ugeoji.

125
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,792
-Outer cabbage leaves.
-Outer leaves?

126
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,294
They dry the outer leaves.

127
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,130
-They dry them one by one.
-Right.

128
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:40,566
In Busan,
hairtail shops use radish greens.

129
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:42,969
The leafy stalks above the radish.

130
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:45,304
It's similar to that.
It's the cabbage version.

131
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:46,472
UGEOJI

132
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,476
These bones look wild.

133
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,011
They're backbones.

134
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:56,249
And pork backbones in gamjatang

135
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:59,986
are rich in protein,
calcium, and vitamin B

136
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:03,122
which helps one recover from fatigue
and slows down aging,

137
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:06,559
as well as prevent osteoporosis.

138
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:09,429
-You said osteoporosis perfectly.
-Osteoporosis.

139
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,366
Even in Japan,
few people pronounce it properly.

140
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,334
I studied it today.

141
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:20,106
They say it helps prevent it.

142
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:22,008
Full of health benefits.

143
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:31,451
-Looks great.
-It tastes great.

144
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,094
-My mouth is watering.
-Is it?

145
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,730
Shall we try a little broth?

146
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,733
It looks pretty spicy.

147
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,135
It's not that spicy.

148
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,203
-Really?
-Yes.

149
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,738
-Thank you for the food.
-Trust me.

150
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:55,074
Smells great.

151
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,880
Delicious.

152
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:02,548
This is great.

153
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,790
The gamjatang broth is great.

154
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,263
It's soothing.

155
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,265
-It really seeps in.
-Wow, that's rich.

156
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,302
The gamjatang broth varies a lot.

157
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:24,971
This one is pretty rich, right?

158
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:27,173
It's on the richer side.

159
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:32,979
And the backbones are already cooked.

160
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:36,983
Take one each on to your plate.

161
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,351
-These pork backbones?
-Yes.

162
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:41,687
-Wow, this big?
-Yes.

163
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,593
-And it comes with ugeoji.
-Yes.

164
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,897
Flip it over
since you're picking the meat.

165
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:52,164
This side?

166
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,000
Everyone has their own way,

167
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:58,404
but you nibble as you drink.

168
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:02,542
This is a wasabi and mustard soy sauce.

169
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:05,044
So we dip it in that
wasabi and mustard soy sauce.

170
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,546
Wasabi and mustard soy sauce.

171
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,949
Try the meat first.

172
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:12,985
This is…

173
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,622
-Pork backbone?
-Yes.

174
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:29,201
It's been cooked
until the meat has become tender.

175
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:30,269
Delicious.

176
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,470
The meat is really good.

177
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:52,858
This place is great.

178
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:56,395
The gamjatang is good.

179
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:57,663
Thank you.

180
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:58,731
So good.

181
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:02,401
The meat is… how do I put it… quite…

182
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:05,338
The meat's pretty red, like ham.

183
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:08,507
The meat is so tender

184
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:13,913
that it almost feels like
I'm eating really premium ham.

185
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,450
The red color on meat by the bone

186
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:20,252
is due to "pinking."

187
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:26,459
It's myoglobin, a protein
found in meats like chicken or pork.

188
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:31,297
That protein makes it look red.
But it isn't undercooked.

189
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,199
It's simmered for
over two hours before serving,

190
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:35,868
so it's safe to eat.

191
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,204
This…

192
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,242
This is good.

193
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,913
The bit tucked between the bones…

194
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,883
-Right.
-It's pretty tasty.

195
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,051
That's right.

196
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,690
Told you. I was confident.

197
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:58,758
This gamjatang is great.

198
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:04,030
You already know everything that I like.

199
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,698
I do.

200
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,701
I've learned a lot about your tastes.

201
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,503
As for my taste…

202
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:11,904
I'm easy to read.

203
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,139
No, no.

204
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:17,476
I figured you'd like this gamjatang.

205
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:22,948
How often do Koreans eat gamjatang?

206
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:24,884
It depends on the person.

207
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:27,820
When I was younger…

208
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:29,889
About once a month?

209
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:31,891
-Maybe twice a month.
-Twice a month?

210
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,661
That's quite often.

211
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:41,734
Good for a first round with friends,
or to wrap up.

212
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:44,603
-Really?
-Gamjatang is truly common, everyday food.

213
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,706
It's similar to ramen in Japan.

214
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,408
And it isn't that expensive?

215
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:50,843
-Not expensive.
-So it's affordable?

216
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,513
Hard to believe this is a common dish.

217
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:56,449
Really?

218
00:11:56,515 --> 00:12:00,786
For a Japanese,
if ramen came with huge chunks of pork,

219
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,589
it would feel like a premium meal.

220
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:07,727
Do luxurious places ever serve gamjatang?

221
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:08,794
No.

222
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:14,066
If you ask what represents Korean food,

223
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:17,770
people say bibimbap or bulgogi.

224
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:23,709
But people don't actually
eat bulgogi every day.

225
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:27,213
I'd say gukbap or gamjatang

226
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:33,352
are true Korean staples
that are eaten more often.

227
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,430
You can use your hands.

228
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:45,998
Oh, really?

229
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,569
That's why gamjatang places
always have tissues.

230
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,271
Wet wipes.

231
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,379
This calls for hands.

232
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,914
You need your hands.

233
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:05,217
That's right.

234
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,822
You two always say this,
Mr. Goro and Mr. Matjjigae.

235
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,792
-"Meat on the bone tastes best."
-It does. The best.

236
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:17,029
Since it's around the bone,
it isn't fatty at all.

237
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,231
It's clean and light.

238
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,701
I know jokbal well,

239
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:25,604
but I've never eaten pork bones this big.

240
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:34,313
The bones must've made a rich stock,

241
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,083
and it feels like the stock
seeps back into the meat.

242
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,385
So it never gets old…

243
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,090
no matter where you bite.

244
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:51,831
This is fun.

245
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,466
Grab that piece by hand.

246
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:58,904
Beginners will take a while.

247
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:00,906
I don't know how to strip the meat.

248
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:05,778
Could we get an extra plate?

249
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,179
One soju, please.

250
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,350
-He really loves this.
-Thank you.

251
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:12,651
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

252
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:27,099
So you can strip it off first
and set it aside.

253
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,167
Yes.

254
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,336
-Pick it off first…
-Yes.

255
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:32,204
…then eat it all at once.

256
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:35,608
Do that, and to taste,

257
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,276
ladle the soup over it.

258
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,346
I want to try that, too.

259
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,183
This one's actually
for you, Mr. Matjjigae.

260
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,025
No, I'm good.

261
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,194
I want to do this one myself.

262
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,629
Ah, okay…

263
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,065
I figured this would happen.

264
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,534
-I want to do it myself.
-Okay.

265
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,871
I'd rather do it myself than be fed.

266
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,276
-I really appreciate it.
-No worries.

267
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:13,812
Ugeoji.

268
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,357
You know, this ugoge…

269
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,959
-Ugeoji.
-Ugeoji.

270
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,329
The ugeoji is good.

271
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:33,666
As a Korean, I'm glad you think so.

272
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,301
The taste of ugeoji.

273
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:36,669
The ugeoji is tasty.

274
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,638
What's the Japanese version of ugeoji?

275
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:43,242
Closest would be mustard greens.

276
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,682
Wrap the meat in ugeoji,

277
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,217
dip it in plenty of sauce,

278
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,520
and take a bite.

279
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,867
-Ugeoji with meat works, right?
-Delicious.

280
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:14,406
The meat and ugeoji
have steeped well in the soup.

281
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,076
It's packed with umami.

282
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,178
Isn't this the first time?

283
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,413
That he hasn't touched the kimchi.

284
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,683
-I haven't had any side dishes.
-Right.

285
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,020
Gamjatang is great.

286
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:29,989
-Thank you.
-It's delicious.

287
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:34,259
-I'd like more broth.
-Me too.

288
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,029
-Could we get a little more broth?
-Okay.

289
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,366
This is sujebi.

290
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,270
-What is it?
-Sujebi.

291
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:48,607
Sujebi is dough,
probably made with starch,

292
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,043
torn by hand and dropped in.

293
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,712
It's a bit springy and chewy.

294
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:56,715
-Thanks as always.
-The meat is delicious.

295
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:57,783
He says the meat is good.

296
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,651
-Thank you.
-The meat's so good, I'm shocked.

297
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,653
This is 29,000 won.

298
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,888
That's cheap!

299
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:06,859
So students on a budget
come in groups of three or four

300
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:10,863
and order a small gamjatang.

301
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:14,066
They keep asking for more broth.

302
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,235
"Excuse me, could we get more broth?"

303
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,170
You know how it goes.

304
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,939
It's a taste of nostalgia too.

305
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:23,108
Then they finish with fried rice.

306
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,810
How much is fried rice now?

307
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,745
-It's 2,000 won.
-2,000 won?

308
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,883
-Cheap.
-It used to be even cheaper.

309
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:34,219
And with fried rice,
they drink lots of soju.

310
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,756
It's the kind of place you go to unwind.

311
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,160
-Shall we get fried rice?
-We can't skip it.

312
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,995
Two orders of fried rice, please.

313
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,532
Do they make the fried rice
with the leftover gamjatang broth?

314
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,167
-Watch this.
-This broth…

315
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,368
I'll just watch.

316
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:55,307
LAST PIECE OF MEAT

317
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:04,049
Should I take the meat?

318
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,265
Should we split it?

319
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:21,333
I've had enough.

320
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,701
Are you okay then?

321
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:25,137
THE LAST PIECE GOES TO SUNG SI-KYUNG

322
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,575
I can smell sesame oil.

323
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,276
Looks like they already drizzled some.

324
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:32,411
What is she going to do?

325
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:33,812
He is curious how you make it,

326
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,180
so please show him.

327
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:36,582
I see.

328
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,085
-Oh, the broth.
-We pour it all in here.

329
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,656
First, they empty it all out.

330
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,398
Oh, the potato's good.

331
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,600
-Oh, the potato.
-It's good.

332
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,502
-Oh, Mr. Matjjigae.
-Oh, Si-kyung.

333
00:18:58,504 --> 00:18:59,505
This is to eat.

334
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:00,405
LEFTOVER GAMJATANG

335
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:10,449
Something like this.

336
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,819
Is that laver in there?

337
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,754
-Laver, yes.
-Laver.

338
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,757
Laver and more perilla seeds?

339
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:19,958
And this leafy one?

340
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,793
-That's kkaennip.
-Sesame?

341
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,128
Perilla leaf.

342
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:27,065
-And chopped kimchi.
-So kimchi too.

343
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:28,800
-It's the best.
-I see.

344
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:32,971
-Hold on, the owner…
-They season it a bit light.

345
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,973
She just used a little technique.

346
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,277
-The spoon…
-They season it using the broth.

347
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:42,681
They season it on the mild side,

348
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:47,719
then add or dip in broth to taste.

349
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,556
How much was the fried rice?

350
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,090
-4,000 won for two portions.
-Cheap.

351
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:54,259
So cheap.

352
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,662
They call this a Korean dessert.

353
00:19:56,728 --> 00:20:00,065
Koreans turn anything into fried rice.

354
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:03,202
Gopchang, gamjatang, even tteokbokki!

355
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,771
If there's broth left,

356
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:09,074
you just add sesame oil,
laver, kimchi, rice, and stir-fry it.

357
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:14,713
When it sets, I'll scrape the nurungji.

358
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:19,952
They even make a crust on purpose.

359
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:22,154
-Is it nurungji time now?
-Yes.

360
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,764
There's even controversy
surrounding fried rice.

361
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:34,566
Some people tell staff
they'll make it themselves.

362
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,069
They ask for more sesame oil and make it.

363
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:38,604
Sounds like you'd do that.

364
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,671
Yes…

365
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,476
What kind of image do you have of me?

366
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:46,645
How do I put it…

367
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:49,481
You're relentless when it comes to food.

368
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:50,549
True.

369
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:56,555
Think of Mr. Matjjigae back then,
drinking soju with fried rice.

370
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,156
You'd come with friends.

371
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:00,692
Back then, it was under 1,000 won.

372
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,595
You could order fried rice…

373
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,631
-Enjoy.
-…and drink soju freely.

374
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:06,798
-Thank you.
-No problem.

375
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:10,535
The owner gave you the best bites.

376
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,471
NURUNGJI

377
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:14,172
-Would you like some?
-No, I'm fine.

378
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:15,841
I'll find the nurungji myself.

379
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:23,515
Thank you for the food.

380
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:31,690
This handle.

381
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:33,625
You can hold it and do it.

382
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,027
It's the other way around.

383
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,433
It's like you're holding a phone
this way and saying, "Hello."

384
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:48,740
I'm going to soak the rice in the broth.

385
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,776
-That's it.
-That's right.

386
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,145
You know what you're doing.

387
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:56,148
SI-KYUNG'S THOUGHTFUL GESTURE

388
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:57,215
Delicious.

389
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:00,319
It doesn't seem like there's much in it,

390
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,821
but the perilla leaves are the kicker.

391
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:05,290
Exactly.

392
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:07,326
You really are a gourmet.

393
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:13,565
It's delicious.

394
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,500
-It's delicious.
-It's good.

395
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,541
I hope everyone in Japan tries gamjatang.

396
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:23,875
I am not sure

397
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,946
if gamjatang is available in Shin-Okubo.

398
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,549
I've never had it in Japan,

399
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:32,617
but if it is in Japan,
I'd go hunt it down.

400
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,355
And it's so cheap too.

401
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,430
It's the first time I've seen him
not touch the side dishes.

402
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,234
Glad to hear it. The best.

403
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,904
I think we'll get another refill.

404
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:58,043
Koreans say that a lot.

405
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,847
Even when we're stuffed
and about to burst,

406
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,316
once the fried rice comes out,

407
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,052
-we go "Huh?" without thinking.
-So you end up eating.

408
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,889
You finish it bit by bit with drinks.

409
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:12,858
It just keeps going in.

410
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:15,460
The broth is great.

411
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:33,678
Seeing you eat the meat
alone right now makes me mad.

412
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:37,749
Like, "He took the meat."

413
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:39,117
Sorry.

414
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:41,052
-Should we add more?
-No, I'm good.

415
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,254
Maybe… take some…

416
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,722
-Just a little.
-Right?

417
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,991
-Take this side.
-Can I get that side?

418
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,293
I knew this would happen.

419
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:51,229
I asked earlier, right?

420
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,431
I know.

421
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:54,566
I asked if I could take the last piece,
and you said okay.

422
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:55,834
I did but…

423
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:59,504
After that fried rice in between,

424
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:02,174
now I want meat again.

425
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,241
I get it.

426
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:08,647
So good.

427
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:10,715
It really tastes even better today,

428
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,184
since he says it's good.

429
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:58,497
That's awesome.

430
00:24:58,563 --> 00:24:59,631
That was delicious!

431
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,702
-Delicious!
-Glad to hear it.

432
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:04,836
THE NEXT INSANELY GOOD SPOT

433
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:07,939
Seoul's iconic seafood market.

434
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,207
Amazing.

435
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,877
It's massive. I'm surprised.

436
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:14,379
KOREA'S LARGEST SEAFOOD HUB

437
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:16,848
SEOUL'S LARGEST SEAFOOD MARKET

438
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,619
THE SEA OF SEOUL
NORYANGJIN SEAFOOD MARKET

439
