1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,807
K-foodie meets J-foodie.

2
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:08,475
This is insane.

3
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:10,978
It has gotten cold.

4
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:13,981
It's been a while since I came here.

5
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:17,851
TODAY'S INSANELY GOOD RESTAURANT

6
00:00:18,556 --> 00:00:21,455
IS LOCATED IN A QUIET RESIDENTIAL AREA

7
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:22,923
TORI, TORITAKA

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:26,593
YAKITORI OMAKASE, TORITAKA

9
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:28,996
JAPANESE CHICKEN SKEWERS, YAKITORI

10
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:31,298
A PLACE TO ENJOY YAKITORI
AS AN OMAKASE EXPERIENCE

11
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:35,769
It's a cut so scarce that you might get
just one bite from ten chickens.

12
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,572
A YAKITORI RESTAURANT FEATURING RARE CUTS

13
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:39,973
EPISODE 4

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,910
THE BEST GOURMET PAIRINGS
FOR FINE DRINKS, OMAKASE YAKITORI

15
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,280
-Welcome.
-Excuse me.

16
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:48,248
Excuse me. Let's sit over there.

17
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:50,417
-Would that be okay?
-You can sit over there.

18
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:51,752
Welcome.

19
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:55,489
I haven't been here in a while.

20
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:59,793
Having yakitori and sake here

21
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,795
was one of my greatest pleasures.

22
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:03,363
But you can't anymore.

23
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,665
I can't.

24
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:08,802
A place like this feels a bit awkward
if you're not drinking.

25
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,573
-So that’s the image yakitori has.
-Yes.

26
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:14,508
Yakitori is associated with drinking.

27
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:19,279
-Many see it as a drinking snack, no?
-I see.

28
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:22,015
Shall we order the omakase,
the chefs' choice?

29
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:24,885
-Is this place known for omakase?
-Yes, it is.

30
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:30,324
AN OMAKASE EXPERIENCE MADE
WITH FRESH INGREDIENTS EVERY DAY

31
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,160
TORITAKA
OMAKASE SKEWER COURSE

32
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:34,828
SEVEN SKEWERS
3,380 YEN (ABOUT 32,000 WON)

33
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:39,132
TEN SKEWERS
4,150 YEN (ABOUT 40,000 WON)

34
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:43,537
For drinks, is it beer or wine?

35
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,639
We start with white wine.

36
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:46,673
-I see.
-Is that so?

37
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:48,408
-I like wine.
-Okay.

38
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:49,776
Yes!

39
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:53,447
Just hearing "white wine" gets me excited.

40
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:58,619
I used to come here just to drink.

41
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,454
How much did you drink?

42
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,356
-I'd start with beer.
-Right.

43
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:05,425
And then… You know the 120cc sake?

44
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:09,196
I would have
three to four glasses of that.

45
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:11,331
-I would order that much.
-Excuse me.

46
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:13,266
-I don't need wine.
-You don't?

47
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,735
SOBER FOR SEVEN YEARS

48
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,972
You said you quit drinking
because you have to drive yourself

49
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:21,274
to the filming set, right?

50
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,242
Yes.

51
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:26,680
I work until late at night

52
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,750
and I leave at five
in the morning the next day.

53
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,118
-You have time left.
-Three hours.

54
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:32,819
-And I want to drink beer.
-Yes.

55
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:36,356
I figured it’d be better to quit
than keep resisting beer.

56
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:37,624
So I did.

57
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:40,694
-You don't regret it?
-I don't.

58
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:43,263
But smelling the alcohol
in places like this

59
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:45,932
makes me reminisce.

60
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:52,039
I used to love sake
before I quit drinking,

61
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,574
and I would normally order Kokuryu.

62
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:55,676
KOKURYU

63
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:57,310
KOKURYU, BLACK DRAGON

64
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:00,013
A PREMIUM SAKE BRAND
LOCATED IN FUKUI PREFECTURE, JAPAN

65
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,716
IT IS KNOWN FOR ITS CLEAN AND DRY FLAVOR

66
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,551
Kokuryu does go well with omakase.

67
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,787
-One glass of Kokuryu, please.
-Sure.

68
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,321
With wine?

69
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,957
Since we're here anyway…

70
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,028
-It's white wine.
-Okay.

71
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:19,132
It's an Italian white wine,
150ml in volume.

72
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,968
It's a blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir.

73
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:25,572
It's perfect for an aperitif.
Please enjoy.

74
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,874
-White wine.
-Yes.

75
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,876
THE KOKURYU IS HERE

76
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:33,013
I found out about Kokuryu
when I was shooting a drama.

77
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,082
-It was set in the Fukui region.
-Right.

78
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:38,218
I was so into it.

79
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:41,688
I really liked it.

80
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,657
Kokuryu.

81
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,158
Next is Kokuryu.

82
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:58,739
Excuse me.

83
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:00,307
It's good.

84
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:03,310
It goes down really smoothly.
It's a bit dangerous.

85
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,811
I think you'll get drunk easily.

86
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,382
And it's not that sweet,
so I think alcohol lovers would enjoy it.

87
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:11,184
-It's good.
-Yes.

88
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:15,522
When I come here and see sake in front
of me, it makes me wonder.

89
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,191
-"Why did I quit drinking?"
-It makes you want to drink?

90
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,659
Yes.

91
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,099
-Is it Daiginjo level? Higher-grade sake?
-Yes.

92
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,435
Could I…

93
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:31,605
Of course, I don't drink.

94
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,607
-But can I just have a lick?
-The Kokuryu?

95
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,176
-A lick?
-Can I have a taste?

96
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:37,144
Of course.

97
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,000
It's nice.

98
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:04,938
This is a three-piece otoshi set.

99
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,406
-The otoshi set is here.
-Right.

100
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,277
OTOSHI (750 YEN, 7,200 WON)
SMALL APPETIZER

101
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,813
SERVED BEFORE THE MAIN DISH (EXTRA CHARGE)

102
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,748
The yellow one is pumpkin tofu.

103
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,783
Then braised chicken
mixed with vinegar miso,

104
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,919
and simmered taro.

105
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,587
Thank you.

106
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,023
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you for the food.

107
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,958
What should I eat first?

108
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,459
What do you want to eat first?

109
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,228
Shall we start with the vegetables?

110
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:39,206
The vinegar miso.

111
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:42,042
-It's good.
-The green onions are good.

112
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,248
Compared to Korea, I think Japan

113
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,284
respects the vegetables more.

114
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,485
Vegetables are often

115
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,621
-the key ingredients in Japanese cuisine.
-Right.

116
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,958
They're the main ingredients
in home cooking.

117
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,192
-Right?
-Yes.

118
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,760
Especially with green onions,

119
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:03,430
Japanese people
use them in almost everything.

120
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,599
It's the same in Korea.

121
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:09,769
But we're usually craving meat more.

122
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,539
AFTER THE OTOSHI IS SERVED

123
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:16,076
THE YAKITORI IS GRILLED OVER CHARCOAL

124
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,617
Thank you for waiting.
The first skewer is ready.

125
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,085
It's here.

126
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,754
This is a misaki, a hen tail cut.

127
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:29,456
COURSE ONE, MISAKI

128
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:30,891
THE TAIL CUT OF A LONG-RAISED HEN

129
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:33,260
KNOWN FOR ITS CONCENTRATED SAVORY FLAVOR
4-STAR RARITY

130
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,528
It's served in a French style,

131
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,898
seasoned with garlic butter.

132
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,166
-Garlic butter.
-This…

133
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:41,635
The smell…

134
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,210
It smells so amazing.

135
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:55,015
-The smell of Japanese cuisine…
-The smell of garlic…

136
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,717
The smell of garlic bread…

137
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,221
WOW

138
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,157
Wow!

139
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,629
This is amazing.

140
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:11,965
-It's insane.
-Right?

141
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:14,434
-It's crazy.
-Indeed it is.

142
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,137
It is crazy.

143
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,807
It's so chewy.

144
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:22,075
The texture is…

145
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,213
The more I chew…

146
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,885
-What is this?
-What is this?

147
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,820
It's filled with a savory taste.

148
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,622
Is it different from a regular tail cut?

149
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:38,124
Young hens have more fat,

150
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,527
but as they mature, they become leaner.

151
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:43,563
-Right?
-And their meat develops a savory flavor.

152
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,864
MISAKI

153
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:46,766
A DISH THAT ENHANCES SAVORINESS

154
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,601
AS CHICKENS MATURE AND GROW LEAN

155
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:51,671
-The tail cut tends to be oily.
-Yes, it does.

156
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:55,241
-But this…
-It's firm.

157
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:57,077
It's like gizzard.

158
00:07:58,078 --> 00:07:59,612
That's how chewy it is.

159
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,753
I'd like to bring my parents here someday.

160
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:07,921
THAT'S HOW GOOD IT IS

161
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,389
My mother and father…

162
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,925
You suddenly want to become a filial son?

163
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:15,395
When I find a really good restaurant,

164
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:18,031
I want to bring others there.

165
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:21,835
I want to share this unique

166
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,803
and delicious flavor with others.

167
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:26,072
That's what a good restaurant is to me.

168
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,974
You weren't a filial son lately?

169
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,378
Just the usual…

170
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:32,312
-Usual?
-Yes.

171
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,980
Well…

172
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,017
-I bought my mom a new car.
-You bought her a car?

173
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:39,919
She wanted a luxurious car,
and I couldn't understand it.

174
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,087
You couldn't understand…

175
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:44,357
I told her that she didn't need one,

176
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:48,495
but she said she wanted to drive one
since she's not getting any younger.

177
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,430
-So I bought her one.
-You did?

178
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,233
-You are a filial son.
-That's all I did.

179
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:56,669
It's here.

180
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,540
COURSE ONE, THE CHEWINESS
OF THE MISAKI IS INSANE

181
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:01,875
COURSE TWO, OBI

182
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,410
This is the second skewer.

183
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:06,112
It's called obi,
and it's the thigh lean meat cut.

184
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,480
COURSE TWO, OBI

185
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,983
TENDER, JUICY INNER THIGH MEAT

186
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,117
3-STAR RARITY

187
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:15,355
SEASONED WITH SIGNATURE TARE,
DOUBLING THE SAVORINESS

188
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,324
-Thank you for the food.
-Enjoy.

189
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,369
I can't help but watch

190
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,204
when Mr. Matjjigae eats.

191
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:33,640
I'm happy.

192
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:38,211
So that's what it tastes like. Happiness.

193
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,380
It just makes me happy.

194
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,418
I'm happy.

195
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,288
Do you really think so?

196
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:02,702
It's really…

197
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:10,510
The flavor of thigh meat is important, but
who you're eating with is more important.

198
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:19,886
And…

199
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:28,895
-They go so well together.
-They do, right?

200
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,396
Yes.

201
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:42,175
It's amazing, right? It's insane, right?

202
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:45,311
I drank a lot of sake
before I quit drinking,

203
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,947
but this combination is the best.

204
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:51,384
I'd like to recommend it to people
all around the world.

205
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,586
-You like it that much?
-It's really good.

206
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:59,025
Having a glass of Kokuryu here…

207
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:01,928
-It's good.
-It's good, right?

208
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,463
It's amazing!

209
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:07,267
-Do you want to try other sake?
-No, I want another glass of this.

210
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,234
-One more?
-Yes.

211
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:10,069
I'll drink instead of you.

212
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:13,773
-Okay.
-Sake gets me drunk.

213
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,441
Of course! That's why you drink it.

214
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,709
I'll have a hangover.

215
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,511
-You won't.
-I think I will.

216
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:19,946
That will never give you a hangover!

217
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,148
It's so delicious
that your body will just accept it,

218
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:24,417
and you will never get a hangover.

219
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,519
I've never had a hangover from that.

220
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:28,154
-Really?
-Kokuryu…

221
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:31,891
It makes you think, "This is delicious,"
while enjoying it with yakitori.

222
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:35,228
Then you wonder,
"How much did I drink today?"

223
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,729
but wake up fine the next day.

224
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,097
I feel like

225
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:42,335
I'm learning boxing from a retired boxer.

226
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:47,340
"I don't fight anymore,
but you must fight with all your might."

227
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:49,475
You must have Kokuryu with your meal here.

228
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,545
The food here really does
taste better with alcohol.

229
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:55,315
He keeps licking it
even though he's quit drinking.

230
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,016
-I'm licking it.
-He's licking it.

231
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,419
If you lick it,
it tastes completely different.

232
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,920
-It resets your taste buds.
-Right?

233
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:05,024
The sweetness of sake enhances
the savoriness in your mouth.

234
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,960
-It's good.
-It's good.

235
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,127
What's this?

236
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:11,297
COURSE TWO, OBI IS HAPPINESS

237
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:12,732
COURSE THREE, CHOUCHIN

238
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:13,800
This is chouchin.

239
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,569
Fallopian tubes and unfertilized eggs.

240
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:19,539
They're eggs before the shell forms.

241
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:20,974
COURSE THREE, CHOUCHIN

242
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,076
UNFERTILIZED EGGS
AND FALLOPIAN TUBES OF CHICKEN

243
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,011
UNIQUE TEXTURE AND FLAVOR
5-STAR RARITY

244
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,414
FALLOPIAN TUBE

245
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,084
UNFERTILIZED EGG YOLK

246
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:35,054
UNFERTILIZED EGG YOLK:
THE YOLK BEFORE THE SHELL FORMS

247
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:38,291
FALLOPIAN TUBE: TUBE-SHAPED ORGAN
THROUGH WHICH THE EGG PASSES

248
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:41,127
-You can't find chouchin in Korea.
-Is that so?

249
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:45,431
SEPARATING THE UNFERTILIZED EGG YOLK

250
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:46,799
But this one…

251
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:51,904
It's strong.

252
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,615
Should I dip it in the shichimi spice mix?

253
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,627
Is it good with the spice?

254
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,830
-It's good with both.
-Yes.

255
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:20,800
It's good.

256
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:23,703
MMM!

257
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,171
It's so good.

258
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,647
-Is it good with wine?
-It is.

259
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:36,983
-It doesn't get better.
-Is that so?

260
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,852
It's a good day and a good life.

261
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,121
Ending your day

262
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:46,526
with delicious food and alcohol…

263
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:49,595
-That is a great life.
-Yes.

264
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,298
I say that a lot on my YouTube channel.

265
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:55,635
When I feel full

266
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:58,504
after having gukbap with soju,

267
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:01,441
there's just nothing else I want.

268
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,176
"This is enough."

269
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,645
"What could be better than this?"

270
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:09,816
"I'm satisfied with my life right now."

271
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:14,454
Isn't that the happiness of a gourmet
when it comes to food and drinks?

272
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:16,456
-Gourmet…
-Yes.

273
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,925
But I'm not a gourmet.

274
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,526
Is that so?

275
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:23,129
-What is a gourmet, really?
-I don't know.

276
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,200
-Let's just drink.
-Okay.

277
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:35,808
You don't even need chopsticks
for yakitori.

278
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,477
-Yes.
-It creates

279
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:41,280
a sense of familiarity,
making it easy to say,

280
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,883
-"Let's have a drink and chat."
-Right.

281
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:45,818
I think we've gotten closer.

282
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,120
-More so than before this meal.
-Yes.

283
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,389
Sitting side by side at the bar.

284
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:52,458
-Holding skewers.
-Yes.

285
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,594
Our hands accidentally
bump into each other

286
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,462
-while dipping it into the sauce.
-Right.

287
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,997
Then I'll apologize.

288
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,133
And since he doesn't drink…

289
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,335
You always eat faster than me.

290
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,138
The pace is different.

291
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,040
-I want to eat it just as it's served.
-Right.

292
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:10,576
They serve the food

293
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,578
at just the right pace.

294
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:16,048
-So I eat it when it's the tastiest.
-Right.

295
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,484
Then I wash it down with alcohol.

296
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:21,754
I think that is the rule
of eating yakitori.

297
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:24,490
-That's respectful towards the master.
-Yes.

298
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:30,163
COURSE THREE,
CHOUCHIN HAS A RICH, DEEP FLAVOR

299
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,398
COURSE FOUR, FIVE, SIX

300
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:36,836
HEART, TSUKUNE, KNEE CARTILAGE

301
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:39,839
This is chicken heart.

302
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:42,642
COURSE 4, HEART

303
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:46,746
CHICKEN HEART
KNOWN FOR ITS JUICY FLAVOR

304
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,818
It smells nice.

305
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:59,125
-This is yakitori.
-It's good.

306
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,269
COURSE 5, TSUKUNE

307
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,104
GRILLED MINCED CHICKEN SKEWERS

308
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,940
CONTAINS CARTILAGE FRIED IN CHICKEN FAT

309
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:17,510
As soon as I put it in my mouth
I knew it was good.

310
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:20,246
It's good.

311
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,619
How many will we have?

312
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:30,056
This tsukune is good.

313
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:40,032
This is the knee cartilage.
It's the meat around the knee.

314
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,034
COURSE 6, KNEE CARTILAGE
MEAT AROUND THE KNEE

315
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,203
IT'S A SMALL AREA
8 TO 10 CHICKENS ARE NEEDED FOR ONE SKEWER

316
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:51,143
We use homemade
raw soy sauce to flavor the chicken.

317
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,147
The result is quite delicious.

318
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,921
-It's raw soy sauce.
-Yes.

319
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,322
It's nutty.

320
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:04,857
It's best when marinated
for several hours.

321
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:08,361
-Is soy sauce used in Korean cuisine?
-Yes. Korea also has a soy sauce culture.

322
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:09,862
Gochujang, doenjang, soy sauce.

323
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:11,464
What about when you eat sashimi?

324
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,366
Then I prefer the Japanese style.

325
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,568
Do I call it Japanese style?
It's always different.

326
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:19,438
I like dipping mine
into the Japanese style soy sauce.

327
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,875
When I have sashimi…

328
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,710
-You have rules?
-I have my own way.

329
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,479
I like the sweet Kyushu soy sauce.

330
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:29,682
-I used to have it as a child.
-Sweet soy sauce…

331
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:35,621
Because I'm someone who eats
sashimi with sweet Kyushu soy sauce,

332
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,124
even if I have
a good fish dish in Tokyo,

333
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:39,625
-I always think this.
-Kyushu?

334
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,527
"This would be better
with Kyushu soy sauce."

335
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,963
That's what being a gourmet is.

336
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,232
Someone who's stubborn.

337
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:50,336
Since when did yakitori
become popular in Korea?

338
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:53,005
We have chicken skewers.

339
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,641
It's a street food

340
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,544
and they brush gochujang sauce on it

341
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:00,613
and sell it in snack carts.

342
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:04,183
But these kinds of yakitori restaurants
have been trending recently.

343
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,453
-Really?
-Japanese restaurants are booming lately.

344
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:11,290
There are a few restaurants
that are quite authentic.

345
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:16,462
What's the most common way
to eat chicken in Korea?

346
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:17,863
Fried.

347
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:19,599
-Fried chicken?
-It's fried chicken.

348
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:23,269
In Korea, they fry it whole.

349
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:28,507
You said you want to drink sake
when you have yakitori,

350
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:32,044
but in Korea you have beer with chicken.

351
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:32,979
CHICKEN AND BEER

352
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:36,716
Chicken and beer is a combo
best enjoyed with a group.

353
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:40,686
But yakitori feels like
savoring solitude alone.

354
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,656
-Yes, you can come alone.
-A lot of people do that, right?

355
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:46,325
That's what amused me in Japan.

356
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,427
Everyone was alone.

357
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,429
It felt different from Korea.

358
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:54,533
COURSE FOUR, FIVE, SIX
VARIOUS YAKITORI

359
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,135
COURSE SEVEN

360
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:59,238
This is our shop's secret menu, otafuku.

361
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,107
It's the thymus gland of the chicken.

362
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:02,074
COURSE SEVEN, OTAFUKU

363
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,843
THYMUS GLAND OF A CHICKEN
TENDER AND CHEWY

364
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,444
ONLY TWO TO THREE SERVINGS PER DAY

365
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:06,412
7-STAR RARITY

366
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,547
It's a cut so scarce that you might get

367
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:11,017
just one bite from ten chickens.

368
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,018
Thank you.

369
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,019
THYMUS GLANDS ARE RARE

370
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,286
Thymus gland.

371
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:15,955
-We had it yesterday.
-The thymus gland?

372
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:17,857
-It's a thymus gland of a chicken, right?
-Yes.

373
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:21,894
The thymus gland is in between
the neck meat and the skin.

374
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:27,199
How is it?

375
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:31,103
It tastes mature.

376
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,772
-Mature?
-Yes.

377
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:37,610
Beef thymus gland has a simple,
child-friendly taste.

378
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:38,744
Right.

379
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:41,013
This tastes more mature.

380
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,909
You'll know what I mean
once you have some.

381
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:52,358
-It's as you said.
-It tastes mature, right?

382
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,061
-It has a bitter taste.
-Right.

383
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:59,231
This would be amazing with alcohol.

384
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:04,637
-The more I chew, the better it is.
-Thank you.

385
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,906
-It's so good.
-This restaurant is great.

386
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,808
It's really good.

387
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,342
This place is great.

388
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:13,012
There are good restaurants in Korea,
but where should I take him?

389
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:16,382
I'm feeling a lot of pressure about
where to take you.

390
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:20,619
I was lying in bed last night

391
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,855
and I kept thinking,

392
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,891
"Will Mr. Matjjigae like that place?"

393
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,027
"Maybe another place? No, not that place."

394
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:29,595
Don't overthink it.

395
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,864
We can just improvise.

396
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,933
You have a restaurant
you go to often, right?

397
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,903
-I do.
-A place you'd go to for dinner.

398
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,472
-Really?
-Yes.

399
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:41,474
INSPECTING RESTAURANTS

400
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,408
This is it.

401
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:43,909
There aren't many places like this.

402
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,077
All the way over here.

403
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:50,916
Are you satisfied with this place?

404
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:52,618
-Very much so.
-Right?

405
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:53,719
HIGHLY SATISFIED

406
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:55,755
Everything costs about 3,000 yen.

407
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:58,991
When Koreans hear the word
"omakase" they're surprised.

408
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:00,693
They ask how much it is.

409
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,462
But it's a very cost-effective course.

410
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,331
If you want more,

411
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:07,666
you can order ten
and it'll cost about 4,000 yen.

412
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,135
I just want to eat, not film.

413
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,302
NEXT INSANELY GOOD SPOT

414
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:13,839
AUTHENTIC PUDDING SHOP
IN FRONT OF MOUNT FUJI

415
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:16,776
MOUNT FUJI PUDDING

416
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:34,324
