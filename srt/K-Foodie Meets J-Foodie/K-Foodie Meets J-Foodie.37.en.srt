1
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:04,638
K-foodie meets J-foodie.

2
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:06,273
This is insane.

3
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:13,914
BUDAE-JJIGAE

4
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:17,417
A STEW CREATED DURING THE KOREAN WAR
USING INGREDIENTS FROM U.S. MILITARY BASES

5
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:20,621
TWO MAJOR REGIONAL STYLES
SONGTAN VS UIJEONGBU

6
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:26,126
EPISODE 36
THE ORIGINAL TASTE OF BUDAE-JJIGAE

7
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:27,194
Hello.

8
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:28,996
-Good morning.
-Yes.

9
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:30,330
Where are we?

10
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:33,066
This is a place called Pyeongtaek.

11
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:37,738
SEOUL TO PYEONGTAEK
ONE HOUR BY CAR

12
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:42,009
PYEONGTAEK,
WHERE U.S. MILITARY UNITS ARE STATIONED

13
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:44,778
THE SONGTAN-STYLE BUDAE-JJIGAE,
WHICH ORIGINATED IN SONGTAN-DONG

14
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:47,381
IS ESPECIALLY FAMOUS

15
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:51,785
-I wanted to have budae-jjigae…
-Yes.

16
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:55,122
…from where it originated,
so I brought you all the way here.

17
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:59,893
This is the place it originated from.
It's called "Choi's."

18
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:03,730
-The original Songtan budae-jjigae?
-Yes.

19
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,334
It says, "Korean food."

20
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:11,505
-Budae-jjigae.
-This is true Korean food.

21
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,206
-Korean food.
-Yes.

22
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,042
-Have you had it before?
-No.

23
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,843
-For real?
-Yes. Not once.

24
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,045
Budae-jjigae.

25
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,480
I wonder if you'll like it.

26
00:01:21,043 --> 00:01:24,251
TODAY'S INSANELY GOOD SPOT

27
00:01:24,914 --> 00:01:28,121
55 YEARS OF TRADITION,
ORIGINAL SONGTAN-STYLE BUDAE-JJIGAE

28
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:32,092
PACKED WITH CUSTOMERS

29
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:35,329
-So many people came here.
-That's a lot of people.

30
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:37,631
Even the president came.

31
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:40,033
-Even the president came here?
-President Kim Dae-jung.

32
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,401
Amazing.

33
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,971
So this is the place people come to
for budae-jjigae.

34
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:46,173
-Let's go.
-Excuse me.

35
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:51,278
-This way.
-It smells good.

36
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,313
Hello.

37
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:55,115
Wow.

38
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:57,784
It's already…

39
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:05,192
People are eating meat
so early in the morning?

40
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:08,695
Normally, I'd just have the jjigae,

41
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:10,430
but you came all the way here.

42
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:15,235
When you go to a budae-jjigae restaurant,
there's usually a griddle.

43
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:18,839
And unlike regular steak,

44
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:21,341
they cook it together

45
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:25,312
with ham, bacon, and sausage.

46
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,080
As the processed meats cook,

47
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:31,551
their seasoned oils mix
with the regular meat,

48
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:34,721
blending together to make a steak

49
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:36,790
that's unlike anything

50
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:39,326
you've ever had before,
full of rich flavor.

51
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:43,363
-So it's kind of like junk food.
-It is.

52
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,564
Nice.

53
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:47,034
-Hello. Excuse me.
-Hello.

54
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,702
-He's the owner.
-Hello.

55
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,270
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

56
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,938
This is Mr. Matsushige from Japan.

57
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,640
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

58
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:56,376
This is the original restaurant, right?

59
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:59,680
Yes, we're the original
Songtan budae-jjigae.

60
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,715
This is the original Songtan budae-jjigae.

61
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:03,984
I heard. I'm looking forward to it.

62
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:06,319
-He's looking forward to it.
-Thank you.

63
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,021
What do you recommend?

64
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:10,223
-What used to be called "ros"…
-Yes.

65
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,325
-…is now known as bacon.
-Yes.

66
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:15,696
Orders start from one serving.

67
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,497
And the T-bone steak is also available.

68
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:19,099
-Then we'll take that.
-Okay.

69
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,701
-And we'll also have the jjigae.
-Okay.

70
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,069
Thank you.

71
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:27,107
-What does "budae" mean?
-Military base.

72
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:29,276
So it's "military base jjigae."

73
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:33,980
It's because it originates
from the U.S. military base.

74
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,716
-Budae-jjigae.
-Yes.

75
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,684
After the Korean War,

76
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,053
-during a time of poverty…
-Yes.

77
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,988
…food was scarce.

78
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,194
American soldiers would share

79
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,130
-leftover ham, sausages, and canned goods.
-Yes.

80
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:52,799
So-called rations or military provisions.

81
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,945
So it was like surplus goods
from the U.S. military.

82
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,605
People had no choice
but to make use of what they were given.

83
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:03,343
Quite a lot of them were expired,

84
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,513
so to make them edible, they boiled them,

85
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,416
added vegetables to stretch the portions,

86
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:10,984
and mixed in kimchi

87
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:16,289
to create a Korean-style flavor
everyone could enjoy.

88
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,560
-And that's how budae-jjigae was born?
-That's right.

89
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:25,465
Budae-jjigae is truly…

90
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:28,602
So it's like American sausage
meets Korean flavor.

91
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,071
-Like a hybrid?
-Yes.

92
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:34,174
So it is Korean food,

93
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:38,044
but since the ham itself was American,

94
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:42,849
it has this oddly fascinating
blend of flavors.

95
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,651
Excuse me.

96
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:50,390
That's huge!

97
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,325
T-bone steak.

98
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:55,028
T-BONE STEAK, 2 SERVINGS
72,000 WON, 7,200 YEN

99
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,030
BACON, 1 SERVING
14,000 WON, 1,400 YEN

100
00:04:57,097 --> 00:05:02,169
It's like one of those steakhouses near
a U.S. military base in Okinawa, Japan.

101
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:14,648
One side of the cut is tenderloin
and the other is strip loin,

102
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,583
so you can enjoy two flavors in one.

103
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,021
TENDERLOIN AND STRIP LOIN

104
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:23,456
Where's the meat from?

105
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:24,858
All our beef is domestic.

106
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:29,129
It's Korean beef.

107
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,899
And the bacon is American, right?

108
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,067
That's right.

109
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:36,069
-American bacon.
-Yes.

110
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,840
The reason we place the bacon on top

111
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:42,776
is because the rendered fat drips down
as it cooks

112
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,712
and flavors the meat.
That's what makes it so delicious.

113
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,787
Did this restaurant serve T-bone steak

114
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:58,124
from the very beginning,
alongside the budae-jjigae?

115
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,894
Did you serve T-bone steak from
the beginning, with the budae-jjigae?

116
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,896
-Yes.
-He did.

117
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,464
Back in the day,

118
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,667
what we now call
budae-jjigae restaurants

119
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:10,871
were actually all budae barbecue houses.

120
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:13,340
Back in the day, budae-jjigae restaurants

121
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:17,143
-were all budae barbecue houses.
-Budae barbecue?

122
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,312
-The sauces and meats that came from…
-Yes.

123
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,915
…the U.S. military bases

124
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:24,050
were all sold here, along with the stew.

125
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,720
So back then, the term budae-jjigae
wasn't really used.

126
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:29,656
Every time a new president
came into office,

127
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,959
-the name would change, like Johnson-tang.
-Johnson-tang. Right.

128
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:35,128
Yes, that's how it went,

129
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:38,698
until the name budae-jjigae
eventually became standardized.

130
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,328
LYNDON B. JOHNSON,
U.S. PRESIDENT FROM 1963 TO 1969,

131
00:06:41,403 --> 00:06:43,069
HAD BUDAE-JJIGAE DURING HIS VISIT TO KOREA

132
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,138
SO THE DISH WAS NAMED
JOHNSON-TANG AT THE TIME

133
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:46,873
It looks so good.

134
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:50,110
It's grilled nicely.

135
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:56,750
BACON GRILLED TO PERFECTION
WITH THE T-BONE STEAK

136
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,722
PERFECTLY COOKED
AND SOAKED WITH BACON FAT

137
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,829
You can eat it now.
Dip it in the sauce first

138
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:12,432
-and wrap it in bacon like this.
-Wrap it.

139
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,100
Wrap it?

140
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,304
You can choose the sauce you like.

141
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,173
-This one's steak sauce.
-Steak sauce.

142
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:22,943
And this is Tabasco mixed with mustard.

143
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,377
It's a bit unusual.

144
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,013
-Try it.
-Thank you.

145
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,182
Wrap it.

146
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:50,971
It's good.

147
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:51,905
It's good.

148
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:00,613
The meat is really satisfying to chew.

149
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:02,916
And it's thick, too.

150
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:07,320
Wrapping such premium meat

151
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,756
with that flavorful bacon
gives it an incredible kick.

152
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,591
When you bite in,

153
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:15,628
the fresh juices from the beef
blend with the bacon's seasoning.

154
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,898
It's a full-on meat festival.

155
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,803
It's good. It's really good.

156
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,112
Definitely not breakfast food.

157
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,616
It is really good, though.

158
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,921
Wrapping it in bacon is the best.

159
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:49,863
-Wrapping is the most straightforward way.
-Yes.

160
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:56,503
It's good.

161
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:59,639
I'm just going to try the bacon.

162
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,174
Just the bacon itself is good, too.

163
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,750
This one cooked nicely.

164
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:15,855
Eating just the bacon

165
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,458
kind of feels like breakfast

166
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,261
since it's still morning.

167
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,464
Like a hotel breakfast vibe.

168
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:26,533
Do you like bacon?

169
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,668
I love bacon.

170
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,036
It goes well with rice.

171
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33,173
-Rice?
-In Japan,

172
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:37,944
don't people eat spam
or bacon with plain rice?

173
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:39,813
Bacon's usually something

174
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,981
-you eat in the morning with eggs.
-Bacon and eggs.

175
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,683
Bacon and eggs.

176
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,187
But just grilling
and eating bacon on its own…

177
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,556
-That's pretty rare.
-It's rare.

178
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:52,725
How about this?

179
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:06,940
It's good.

180
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:10,743
The potato is cooked nicely.

181
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:15,915
But you know,

182
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:19,786
it feels like everything around here
is starting to taste like bacon.

183
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,287
That is true.

184
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,924
-No matter what I eat…
-Even the onion tastes like bacon.

185
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,960
…I taste the bacon.

186
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,194
The beef tastes like bacon.

187
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:30,230
It's got such a strong presence.

188
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,232
This feels like the main dish,

189
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,435
while the budae-jjigae
is more of a finisher.

190
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:39,139
Because for Koreans,
it's natural to finish a meal

191
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,341
with spicy soup or rice.

192
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:42,742
Americans can just

193
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,945
have meat and wine,
and that's fine.

194
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,615
But for Koreans,

195
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:52,919
stopping there feels strange.
Like we need something to wrap it up.

196
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,122
Don't you crave rice right now?

197
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:57,323
Totally!

198
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,192
-Should we order some?
-No.

199
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,127
Let's just wait until the budae-jjigae.

200
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,197
Today's real main event

201
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:06,332
is the budae-jjigae.

202
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,867
Let's move on to the jjigae, then.

203
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,905
You said it's your first time trying
budae-jjigae, right? I'm excited.

204
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:12,872
I'm excited.

205
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,876
It's delicious.

206
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:18,011
Thank you.

207
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:21,247
Does budae-jjigae taste
about the same everywhere?

208
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:23,216
-No, it's different.
-It's different.

209
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:26,019
You can get real deep into this, actually.

210
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,987
Each region has its own style.

211
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:32,225
There's also a U.S. military base
in Uijeongbu,

212
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,494
which is why there's
a local Uijeongbu-style budae-jjigae.

213
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:35,795
We're in Songtan right now,

214
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:39,465
and Songtan-style budae-jjigae
has a different flavor.

215
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,102
The Uijeongbu style is lighter.

216
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:46,172
It includes glass noodles and tofu,

217
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,007
with a clean, mild broth.

218
00:11:48,403 --> 00:11:50,210
UIJEONGBU BUDAE-JJIGAE
VEGETABLE BASE BROTH

219
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:53,012
FLAVORED WITH KIMCHI, GLASS NOODLES,
AND BAKED BEANS

220
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,215
And Songtan style has a richer flavor.

221
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,950
They use beef or pork bone stock

222
00:11:57,016 --> 00:12:00,186
and give it a heavier, deeper taste.

223
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,822
SONGTAN-STYLE BUDAE-JJIGAE
BEEF BONE BROTH BASE

224
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,858
WITH KIMCHI, MINCED MEAT, AND CHEESE
KNOWN FOR ITS RICH AND SAVORY DEPTH

225
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,962
In short, wherever there was
a U.S. military base,

226
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:13,900
different regional styles of budae-jjigae
developed, each with its own unique twist.

227
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,380
Wow.

228
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,884
Wow, just look at that.
Pure temptation right there.

229
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,721
Once it's all done, I'll come back.

230
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,422
-So we just wait?
-Yes.

231
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:40,260
-He asked us to wait.
-He did?

232
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:41,527
-Yes.
-Okay, I'll wait.

233
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,296
I looked inside the pot,

234
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,064
and it's incredible.

235
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:46,833
There was this

236
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:49,102
big layer of melted cheese on top.

237
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,437
That's what makes the broth so flavorful.

238
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:52,372
CHEESE

239
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,473
It melts?

240
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,509
There was a lot of minced meat, too.

241
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:58,678
Yes, that's called dajimyuk in Korean.

242
00:12:58,745 --> 00:12:59,812
MINCED MEAT

243
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:03,549
So it's got sausage, ham, and minced meat?

244
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,550
Yes.

245
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:08,855
And the chopped garlic.
Is that for finishing at the end?

246
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:12,992
No, garlic goes in before it boils.

247
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:14,427
The owner will prepare everything,

248
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:17,497
-so please wait just a little longer.
-I can't imagine what it would be like.

249
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,734
-I want to open it.
-No, you can't.

250
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,169
You shouldn't open it.

251
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,104
-I shouldn't?
-No.

252
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,407
I understand, though.

253
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,576
Even as a Korean, I want to open it.
So of course he'd want to.

254
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:35,148
If you try opening it and the owner
catches you, you might get kicked out.

255
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:36,949
There are places like that in Korea.

256
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,986
-Really? They're that strict?
-Yes, some owners

257
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:41,154
are very particular.

258
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,690
-If I open it…
-They'll start scolding you.

259
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,758
It's like a cultural debate!

260
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:49,729
-At this point…
-Yes.

261
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:52,365
…the temptation is strong.

262
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:55,435
-I want to open it.
-You can't.

263
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,370
You have to hold it in and let it pass.

264
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:59,806
Just let me eat freely!

265
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,442
No!

266
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,078
All the waiting we've done until now

267
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,713
will go to waste.

268
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,148
It's not like it'll disappear
the moment I open it.

269
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,984
No, we'll have to start all over again.

270
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:18,391
Does the owner really know
what's happening inside the pot?

271
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,892
There's a timer. He knows.

272
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,027
-He's there, right?
-Yes.

273
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:22,595
He's coming back now.

274
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,201
Your food's ready.

275
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,869
So this is how it's served.

276
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,974
-Kimchi.
-It's kimchi.

277
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,111
We cut the kimchi
right before it's brought to the table.

278
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:52,091
He just opened it and mixed it.

279
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:55,595
I was about to say something
about what's in the pot,

280
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,497
but I couldn't say anything.

281
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,366
Please wait just a moment.
I'll let you know when it's ready.

282
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:01,901
-What did he say?
-Wait a bit more.

283
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:03,503
-Not yet?
-Not yet.

284
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,271
Not yet…

285
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:08,708
-He'll tell us when it's done.
-I see, all right.

286
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:13,045
As long as he doesn't forget.

287
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:17,950
-We can't have the kimchi either?
-You can.

288
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,253
-I can?
-Go ahead.

289
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,491
It's good.

290
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,269
See how serious he is.

291
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,708
All done. You can eat now.

292
00:15:49,144 --> 00:15:54,220
BUDAE-JJIGAE, 2 SERVINGS
22,000 WON, 2,200 YEN

293
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,523
So you put that in the rice?

294
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,292
-On top.
-On top?

295
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,461
Like this. I'll show you.

296
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,832
You do this and this…

297
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:10,036
Then spread it out like this.

298
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:17,210
-Yes.
-I'm putting it on top.

299
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:20,146
-And more broth.
-Broth…

300
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,160
Let's dig in.

301
00:16:54,576 --> 00:16:56,048
This is unlike anything I've ever had.

302
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,351
-Right? It's completely new, isn't it?
-Yes.

303
00:16:58,417 --> 00:16:59,986
I love this so much.

304
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,571
It's so delicious.

305
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,743
Wow, this…

306
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:26,546
It's like I've fallen under the spell

307
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:29,749
of ham, bacon,

308
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,517
and sausage.

309
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:35,688
This is unbelievably good.

310
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:36,989
I'm glad you like it.

311
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:44,230
It's good.

312
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:58,844
It's good.

313
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,012
You know,

314
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:05,851
it almost feels nostalgic.
It makes me think

315
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,286
I had this as a kid.

316
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:10,022
-Were you Korean?
-I think I've become one now.

317
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:16,963
Maybe I drifted by boat
and ended up in Kyushu or something.

318
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:18,297
It feels

319
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:19,832
like home.

320
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:25,705
In Japan, we had something similar
when we were kids.

321
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,641
-Fish sausage.
-Yes.

322
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,077
The pink ones, made from fish
instead of meat.

323
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:32,745
-The pink ones?
-The pink ones. Yes.

324
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:35,381
Koreans love those, too.
We call them pink sausages.

325
00:18:35,868 --> 00:18:37,116
FISH SAUSAGE

326
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,285
SAUSAGE MADE BY MINCING
AND MIXING FISH, PORK, ETC.

327
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:44,357
You coat it lightly in egg, pan-fry it,

328
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:45,992
and eat it as a side dish.

329
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,393
-So good, right?
-It's good.

330
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,496
It really is. It brings back memories,
you know? Sometimes I just crave it.

331
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:56,969
Budae-jjigae actually seems like something
you could easily make at home.

332
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,672
-The flavors aren't unfamiliar.
-Exactly, it's really approachable.

333
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,607
For Japanese viewers,

334
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:03,342
what you see is what you taste.

335
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:05,945
-Ham, sausage, sausage, ham.
-Yes.

336
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:08,714
But you've never eaten it
like this before, have you?

337
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:09,749
No.

338
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,784
MM!

339
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:16,589
It's such a simple combination
of ingredients and seasonings.

340
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:20,493
I wonder why Japanese people
haven't tried this.

341
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:24,063
Because the kimchi here
is authentic Korean kimchi.

342
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,232
You take real pride in that, I see.

343
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:30,503
Even though the ingredients
originally came

344
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,471
from the U.S. military,

345
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,942
the foundation of the dish
is unmistakably Korean.

346
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,744
-Yes.
-It's really good.

347
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:39,945
That's good.

348
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:56,762
It's really good.
Can I have a bottle of soju, please?

349
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:57,863
Soju?

350
00:19:58,864 --> 00:19:59,965
You want soju?

351
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,268
-I have no choice.
-You have no choice?

352
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:29,128
This…

353
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,464
This is insane.

354
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,039
Does soju go with budae-jjigae?

355
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:41,841
Yes. It's soju.

356
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,677
Today's weather is perfect
for budae-jjigae and soju.

357
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:03,462
The broth's getting richer
and thicker now.

358
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:05,631
At this stage,

359
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:08,934
you add more stock
and drop in the noodles.

360
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:12,171
When the noodles cook,
the starch makes it even thicker.

361
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:13,305
Shall we add some?

362
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:14,874
Can we get some noodles, please?

363
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,875
Okay.

364
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,079
I'll add some ramyeon for you.

365
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,350
Can I add another slice of cheese?

366
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,152
-Let's do that.
-Okay.

367
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,054
ADDING RAMYEON NOODLES

368
00:21:30,251 --> 00:21:32,391
TO THE REDUCED BROTH

369
00:21:32,895 --> 00:21:35,027
AND ADJUSTING THE SEASONING
WITH EXTRA BROTH

370
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:47,273
RAMYEON NOODLES
2,000 WON, 200 YEN

371
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:49,642
CHEESE
1,000 WON, 100 YEN

372
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,511
-Noodles.
-Go ahead.

373
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:53,879
-Can I have it now?
-Yes.

374
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:55,414
-Our noodles taste best…
-Yes.

375
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:58,284
…when they're slightly undercooked.

376
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,719
They're not your regular ramyeon noodles.

377
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,756
The owner said we should eat it al dente.

378
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,758
I see. Then we should do that.

379
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,093
Al dente.

380
00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:12,998
-It's perfectly chewy.
-Perfectly chewy.

381
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,970
Al dente instant noodles.

382
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,456
Is it good?

383
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:42,695
For those watching
this show on Thursday nights,

384
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:46,432
if you watch this after 10:00 p.m.,

385
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,536
-you'll end up at a convenience store.
-Yes.

386
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,672
Ramyeon, kimchi, sausage…

387
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,375
Don't eat it. Your face will get puffy.

388
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:02,882
It's good.

389
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,892
How's the cheese?

390
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,460
Delicious.

391
00:23:15,907 --> 00:23:17,507
It gives it a completely different feel.

392
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:21,233
These days,
Buldak cheese carbonara noodles

393
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,370
are trending worldwide, right?

394
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:27,339
The super spicy Korean instant noodles.

395
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,376
But honestly, this tastes better.

396
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:43,322
That guilty pleasure of processed meat

397
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:47,359
and the bold kick

398
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,129
of instant noodles.

399
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:54,266
This is insanely good.

400
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:33,806
I want to stop filming
for the day and keep eating this.

401
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,774
This processed meat combo is amazing.

402
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:37,743
This is an absolute success.

403
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:42,614
If I'd grown up…

404
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:45,684
eating this,

405
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:47,419
I'd probably crave budae-jjigae

406
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,856
at least once a month.

407
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,227
I'm thinking about cooking it at home.

408
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:57,029
Matjjigae's budae-jjigae.

409
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:58,130
NEXT INSANELY GOOD SPOT

410
00:24:58,626 --> 00:25:01,767
HANDMADE DUMPLINGS KNEADED
AND SHAPED EVERY MORNING

411
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:05,104
FRESHLY MADE NOODLES

412
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,973
AND SLOW-SIMMERED BONE BROTH

413
00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:11,777
HANDMADE DUMPLING KAL-GUKSU

414
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,278
A BOWL MADE WITH CARE

415
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:24,056
It's really seeping in.

416
