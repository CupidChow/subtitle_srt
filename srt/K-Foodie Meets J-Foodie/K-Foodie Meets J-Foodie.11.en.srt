YOUNG MATSUSHIGE, LIVING IN FUKUOKA

4
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:14,748
WHAT'S HIS SOUL FOOD?

5
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:16,316
This place hasn't changed in 50 years.

6
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:18,018
This never disappoints.

7
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:19,887
It really hits me that
I'm back in my hometown.

8
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,321
Horaku Manju.

9
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:22,556
FIRST SOUL FOOD
MANJU

10
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,157
It's been a while.

11
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:25,926
-It has.
-It's been too long.

12
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:28,829
This tastes just like
the maruten I remember.

13
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:31,365
If someone asked me
what I'd want for my last meal…

14
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,166
I'd choose udon. It's my soul food.

EPISODE 11
YOUNG MATSUSHIGE'S SOUL FOOD

17
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:41,942
K-foodie meets J-foodie.

18
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:43,443
This is insane.

19
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,548
It's called Nishijin,
"new town in the west."

20
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:48,615
NEW TOWN IN THE WEST

21
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:49,883
I see. Nishijin.

22
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:53,692
The high school I went to is nearby.

23
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:57,558
Do people know you're from Fukuoka?

24
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:01,528
Everyone knows. I can speak the dialect.

25
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:03,730
-Oh, by the dialect.
-It sounds totally different.

26
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,233
-Compared to Seoul and Busan dialects…
-Really?

27
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,001
-…they might be even more distinct.
-I see.

28
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,572
Not many young people
use the dialect around here anymore.

29
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,574
-They don't?
-Not really.

30
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,209
My accent still comes out really thick.

31
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,378
Can you show us?

32
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,382
I've been jabberin' in Hakata dialect
for a good while now.

33
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:23,483
Ain't makin' sense, huh?

34
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:25,752
-It's difficult to understand.
-It is.

35
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:27,721
-Mr. Matjjigae.
-Yes?

36
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:30,757
When did you move to Tokyo?

37
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,559
I was 19. Wait, was I 18?

38
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:33,527
Eighteen or 19.

39
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:36,563
I took an extra year after high school
for college prep.

40
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,031
I took three years.

41
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,801
-Three years?
-Right.

42
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,269
-That must've been tough.
-Yeah.

43
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:44,605
-But it felt pointless in the end.
-Three years…

44
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:47,574
That must have been tough.
I only took one year.

45
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:49,843
After you moved to Tokyo,

46
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,080
did you visit home now and then?

47
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:55,749
-There's a "Youth 18 Ticket."
-Okay.

48
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:58,485
I used that to come home.

49
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:01,088
-That's nice.
-Yes.

50
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:02,923
Smells good, right?

51
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,225
Back in the day, this shopping street sold

52
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:06,460
-various tempura…
-Okay.

53
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:10,130
…and freshly made side dishes.

54
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:14,234
I wanted you to try chigiriten,
something they used to sell here.

55
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,136
-It's fish meat…
-Okay.

56
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:19,239
…deep-fried and then shredded.

57
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,341
-Sounds like a snack.
-Yes, more like a snack.

58
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:25,245
I'd carry it in my pocket
and eat it on the go.

59
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,014
It's a nostalgic treat.

60
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,416
There's a tempura shop here.

61
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,884
-Do you have chigiriten?
-Excuse me?

62
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,620
-Chigiriten?
-No, we don't.

63
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:36,123
I thought so.
They used to sell it over there.

64
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,457
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

65
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,660
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

66
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,895
-They don't sell it anymore.
-Looks like it.

67
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:46,433
There used to be what we called
the "Cart Squad" on that street.

68
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:48,869
-The local produce sellers…
-Yes.

69
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:50,504
…would load up their carts

70
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:55,208
and sell all kinds of things,
including homemade food.

71
00:02:56,476 --> 00:03:00,781
I wonder if the Cart Squad
is still around.

72
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:03,984
Does the Cart Squad still come out?

73
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:06,853
-The Cart Squad.
-Two…

74
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,755
-There are only two carts left.
-Really?

75
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:10,357
-Yes.
-They're almost gone. Why?

76
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:11,658
-Just one…
-One?

77
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:13,994
-Only the flower shop still does it.
-Right.

78
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,028
We saw it earlier.

79
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:16,797
There used to be a whole row.

80
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,732
-When you were young.
-Yes, back in the day.

81
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,534
Back when I was full of beans.

82
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,002
-Thank you.
-Good luck!

83
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:24,171
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

84
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,906
-That's a shame.
-Yeah, too bad.

85
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,007
-Right.
-Yeah.

86
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:30,110
I thought we could snack on
all sorts of things here,

87
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:32,946
but everything's gone. It came as a shock.

88
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,651
I wanted to try some old-school snacks

89
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:40,554
at these small, family-run shops.

90
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,089
This is the only one left.

91
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:45,125
This place hasn't changed in 50 years.

92
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,761
-Horaku Manju.
-Oh, manju.

93
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:48,795
HORAKU MANJU

94
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:50,664
60-YEAR-OLD SHOP

95
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,133
MANJU

96
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,669
CLASSIC JAPANESE SWEET BUN
FILLED WITH SWEET BEAN PASTE

97
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,405
BLACK PASTE MADE FROM RED BEANS

98
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:01,208
WHITE PASTE MADE FROM KIDNEY BEANS

99
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:03,977
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE GENEROUS FILLING

100
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:09,816
YOUNG MATSUSHIGE'S SOUL FOOD, MANJU

101
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:12,552
My high school was
just across that main road.

102
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,354
-I see.
-So after club activities,

103
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:16,156
I'd come straight here.

104
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:18,291
There used to be an okonomiyaki place.

105
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,127
One okonomiyaki was 100 yen.

106
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,661
-That's cheap!
-Right?

107
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,531
If I had less than 100 yen,
I'd get a manju and head home.

108
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,000
-It was about 50 yen back then.
-Just 50 yen.

109
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,603
-That was 40 years ago, right?
-No, 50 years.

110
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,404
-Fifty?
-Yes.

111
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,441
-Hello.
-Hi.

112
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:35,642
Welcome.

113
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:38,345
-The street has changed so much.
-It really has.

114
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,113
So the Cart Squad is gone now?

115
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,783
There are some carts, but not as many.

116
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:45,018
-I was craving some chigiriten.
-Okay.

117
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:47,821
-I looked for it but couldn't find it.
-Right?

118
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,022
-Yes.
-It's gone now.

119
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,490
-It was there, though.
-It was.

120
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:53,126
It smells amazing here.

121
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:56,029
-What… There are two kinds.
-White paste and black paste.

122
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,899
I'll try both.

123
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,968
WHITE PASTE, BLACK PASTE
110 YEN, AROUND 1,100 WON EACH

124
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,336
-Two of each, please.
-Okay.

125
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,672
-These are good.
-They look delicious.

126
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:06,973
-And…
-Here you go.

127
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:08,708
-Thank you.
-Two white and two black.

128
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:09,676
-Thank you.
-Sure.

129
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:12,012
-That'll be 440 yen.
-Okay. What a steal!

130
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:13,213
It really is.

131
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:16,283
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

132
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:17,317
Thank you.

133
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,618
So…

134
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,520
Which is-- Oh, the colors are different!

135
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,055
Which one are you trying first?

136
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,057
-The black one, of course.
-It's the classic.

137
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:25,559
Red bean is the classic.

138
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,397
-Bon appétit.
-Let's dig in.

139
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,631
It's warm.

140
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:46,146
How is it?

141
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:48,748
This is really good.

142
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,050
Right?

143
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,153
It's packed with red bean paste.

144
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,955
Wow, it's amazing.

145
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,023
I bet this would go well with whiskey.

146
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,427
You say everything goes with whiskey.

147
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:01,728
No, not everything.

148
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,965
But whiskey actually pairs well
with sweet food like this.

149
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:13,139
-Doesn't it taste a bit like honey?
-Oh, maybe.

150
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,641
I can taste honey.

151
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:18,044
DOUGH AND FILLING CONTAIN
HONEY FROM HOKKAIDO

152
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,748
Freshly baked walnut balls
were amazing too.

153
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:25,785
-Walnut balls melt in your mouth.
-Right.

154
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:28,646
-So…
-Manju has more of a chewy texture.

155
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:32,025
It tastes kind of like
Korean bungeoppang, a fish-shaped bun.

156
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:34,494
But that is crispy on the outside.

157
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,397
-This one's soft all around.
-No crispy bits at all.

158
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:40,267
That's the difference. Man, this is good.

159
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,170
This one has white paste.

160
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:54,481
The white paste is sweeter, I think.

161
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,851
Oh, I love this.

162
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,388
It's not about which one is better…

163
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:02,956
I like both of them.

164
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,558
You get two for 220 yen.

165
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,630
Grandmas would love this.

166
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:12,599
Even grandpas like me love it.

167
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,868
I bet students still line up here

168
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,937
after club activities.

169
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:22,976
People in Korea say
you have a youthful vibe.

170
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:24,644
-Me?
-You've got a spark in your eyes.

171
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,514
-They think you're cool.
-Sweet!

172
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,117
They say, "He's still young."

173
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:32,485
All thanks to my makeup artist.

174
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,554
That was the secret?

175
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:39,459
The way you talk,
and the energy in your eyes

176
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,761
make you seem so young.

177
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:43,430
-That's what they say.
-Really?

178
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,999
I was thinking of getting
some work done next time.

179
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,034
Please don't.

180
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,302
Do you mean it?

181
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,604
-These are surprisingly filling.
-Yeah.

182
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,273
These are quite satiating.

183
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:57,110
-Shall we move on to the udon place?
-Let's go.

184
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,080
I'm craving that nostalgic broth.

185
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,482
They open at 11.

186
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:03,650
INABA UDON

187
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,653
-Hello.
-Hello.

188
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,588
-The vibe is nice.
-Hello.

189
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,591
-Come on in.
-It smells amazing already.

190
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,026
Wow, it smells good.

191
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:14,594
Wow.

192
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:18,231
-It feels like I'm back home.
-Really?

193
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,767
This place does Fukuoka… Oh, hello.

194
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,068
-Welcome!
-Thank you.

195
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,370
Hello.

196
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,638
-It's been a while.
-It has.

197
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,273
-It's been too long.
-How have you been?

198
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,442
-I'm doing well.
-That's great.

199
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,779
-You look healthy.
-Yes, I'm doing well too.

200
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:36,049
-I saw a photo on the sign.
-Right.

201
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:37,951
Yes, that's me.

202
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,957
A lot of udon places I grew up with

203
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,526
-have closed down.
-That's true.

204
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:50,130
Not many old places like this
are still around.

205
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:53,500
-This place has quite a history.
-Right.

206
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:56,536
This branch has been here
for over 50 years.

207
00:08:56,603 --> 00:09:00,340
Inaba Udon has been around
for about 74 years as a brand.

208
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,275
I'm excited.

209
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:05,311
Did you come here when you were a student?

210
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,013
Yes, back when I was a student.

211
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,816
And after I started working,
whenever I stayed nearby,

212
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,352
I'd skip the hotel breakfast

213
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:13,820
-and come here instead.
-I see.

214
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:18,792
Starting the day
with a bowl of udon is the best.

215
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,561
This place…

216
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:24,164
Their udon's amazing,
but the tempura's great too.

217
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,000
-You soak the tempura in the broth.
-In the broth?

218
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,134
Exactly.

219
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,904
-It's awesome that way.
-Sounds perfect.

220
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,774
SOFT NOODLES

221
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:37,010
CLEAR BROTH

222
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,312
CRISPY TEMPURA

223
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:43,016
A UNIQUE COMBO YOU'LL ONLY FIND
IN FUKUOKA

224
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,752
When it comes to udon toppings,

225
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,555
-burdock tempura is popular.
-Okay.

226
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,056
-Yeah.
-Then I'll go with that.

227
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:51,825
-Burdock tempura.
-Right.

228
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,960
I'll have the shrimp tempura udon.

229
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:55,728
That's a sneaky move.

230
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:59,065
The shrimp tempura here isn't so huge.

231
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:02,669
-There's just a little bit in it?
-They use tiny shrimp here.

232
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,437
-I'll stick with burdock tempura.
-Yeah?

233
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:06,906
-Yes.
-Since we're here, have a beer too.

234
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,908
-Is that okay?
-Sure.

235
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:14,981
One burdock udon
and one shrimp udon, please.

236
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:16,416
-And one beer.
-For now.

237
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:17,817
-Also, grilled maruten.
-Okay.

238
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,886
-And some kashiwa rice balls.
-All right.

239
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,054
-Two sets, please.
-Sure.

240
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:22,922
-Do you have sparkling water?
-Yes.

241
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:25,925
FOR THE FIRST TIME,
MR. MATJJIGAE IS ORDERING UP A STORM

242
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,727
-Try it.
-Okay.

243
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,629
Here you go.

244
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:34,067
-All right.
-Shall we toast?

245
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:36,970
-Jjan!
-Thank you.

246
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:38,037
Jjan!

247
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,840
THE RESTAURANT DOES NOT SELL
SPARKLING WATER

248
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:48,815
You don't usually have udon
for dinner, do you?

249
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:50,216
Not really.

250
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,953
It's more of a lunch thing or a quick bite
when you're feeling a bit hungry.

251
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,889
-It's something light and fast.
-Right.

252
00:10:55,955 --> 00:11:00,059
In Korea, people often eat udon
at highway rest stops.

253
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,662
-It's the same in Japan.
-I see.

254
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:04,731
Excuse me, here's your grilled maruten.

255
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,833
-This is…
-Grilled maruten.

256
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,469
GRILLED MARUTEN
110 YEN, ABOUT 1,100 WON

257
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,538
GRILLED MARUTEN

258
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,773
FISH CAKE MADE FROM WHITE FISH,
STEAMED THEN GRILLED

259
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:18,411
NOT DEEP FRIED, BUT GRILLED

260
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,879
-Bon appétit.
-Let's dig in.

261
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:21,514
-Enjoy.
-Feel free to add soy sauce.

262
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:23,316
-Please, go ahead.
-Thank you.

263
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:26,386
Mmm!

264
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,122
You haven't even chewed it yet.

265
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,024
The moment it hit your mouth,
you went, "Mmm!"

266
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:32,425
This…

267
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:36,229
tastes just like the maruten I remember.

268
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,768
Is this a sweet soy sauce?
We're in Kyushu after all.

269
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,503
It's probably sweet.

270
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:55,148
It's really good.

271
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:56,849
-Masitda.
-Yes, it's delicious.

272
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,018
It has a rustic flavor.

273
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,853
Nothing fancy,

274
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:02,455
but satisfyingly good.

275
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:03,957
A bit sweet, right?

276
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:07,994
It's soft, with a pleasant sweetness.

277
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:09,896
-This is called oden, right?
-Yes.

278
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:11,130
Fish cake.

279
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:15,034
There used to be tons of udon places
like this back in the day.

280
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,402
Why are they all gone?

281
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:21,708
Because Hakata's more famous for ramen.

282
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,710
Ramen's more famous than udon now.

283
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:26,246
So everyone thinks of ramen
when they hear Hakata.

284
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:31,517
When I was a kid,
I ate udon more than ramen.

285
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,454
-It's my soul food.
-I see.

286
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:38,324
I wonder what my Korean soul food is.

287
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,894
Tteokbokki, spicy rice cakes, maybe?

288
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,663
-Do you know tteokbokki?
-I do.

289
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,065
That's a staple snack for students.

290
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,467
-Really?
-Tteokbokki.

291
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,168
Is it more of a snack?

292
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,571
Yeah, but it can be a meal too.

293
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:54,107
-Do you want to try it sometime?
-Sure.

294
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:55,842
Thanks for waiting.

295
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,810
-Thank you.
-Here's the shrimp tempura udon.

296
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,178
-Thank you.
-Looks great!

297
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,414
SHRIMP TEMPURA UDON
580 YEN, AROUND 5,800 WON

298
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,683
KASHIWA RICE BALLS
260 YEN, AROUND 2,600 WON

299
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,385
-Burdock tempura udon.
-Thank you.

300
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:08,855
BURDOCK TEMPURA UDON
560 YEN, AROUND 5,600 WON

301
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:12,392
I love these little fried shrimp.

302
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,962
Normally you get one long shrimp
when you order shrimp tempura.

303
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:21,501
These small shrimp bring out
the best flavor in the udon broth.

304
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:22,468
-Oh.
-Right.

305
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:26,105
So we've always used little ones.

306
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:29,208
-Try the kashiwa rice ball too.
-Okay.

307
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:34,681
It's rice with chicken and burdock root,
made into rice balls.

308
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:38,618
You can usually find these
as a side dish at most udon places.

309
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:42,021
INABA UDON SET MEAL

310
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,991
If someone asked me
what I'd want for my last meal,

311
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:48,461
I used to say something fancy like eel.

312
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,463
But now, I'd choose this.

313
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,098
Udon and rice balls.

314
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:54,967
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

315
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:56,302
Is this ichimi?

316
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,538
-And that's shichimi, right?
-Yes.

317
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,239
ICHIMI: SINGLE SPICE
CHILI POWDER

318
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,242
SHICHIMI: SEVEN-SPICE BLEND
CHILI POWDER, SICHUAN PEPPERCORN, ETC

319
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:04,477
Which one do you want?

320
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:06,746
-I'll go with ichimi.
-Me too.

321
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,686
Say cheese!

322
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,355
Say cheese!

323
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,291
Okay.

324
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:21,060
HOW TO ENJOY INABA UDON
1. SPRINKLE SOME ICHIMI

325
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:26,966
Let the tempura sit in the broth
so it soaks up the flavor.

326
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:30,169
2. SOAK THE TEMPURA IN THE BROTH

327
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:37,276
How is it?

328
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,314
This never disappoints.

329
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,216
It really hits me that
I'm back in my hometown.

330
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,722
-Like this?
-Yeah, let it soak in.

331
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,464
Isn't it good?

332
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:01,567
This…

333
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:04,270
It's 100 times better
than instant Tempura Udon.

334
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:06,072
There are instant noodles

335
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:09,876
called Tempura Udon in Korea.
It's quite famous.

336
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,044
This is a version
that's 100 times better than that.

337
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,114
Now for the noodles.

338
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:22,255
The noodles are great too, aren't they?

339
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:25,958
Crazy, right?

340
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:28,194
This is seriously good.

341
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:29,929
They're soft.

342
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:34,167
Soft noodles like these
haven't caught on in Korea yet.

343
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:37,203
Even in Japan,
not everyone's used to this texture.

344
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,371
-I guess so.
-Yeah.

345
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,741
UDON TEXTURE BY REGION

346
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,309
VERY CHEWY: SANUKI

347
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:45,011
MEDIUM: KANSAI

348
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,647
LESS THAN MEDIUM: TOKYO

349
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,515
NOT CHEWY AT ALL: HAKATA

350
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:55,488
HAKATA UDON
= SUPER SOFT NOODLES (NOT CHEWY)

351
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:58,825
Even when you're not feeling well,
you could still eat this.

352
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,561
This is so good.

353
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,465
These have their own charm.

354
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,067
We Koreans usually prefer firmer noodles.

355
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:12,038
But this feels like
a warm hug from Grandma.

356
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,841
It's like a grandma's warm, gentle love.

357
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,643
Still, it's the broth that makes udon.

358
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,586
This broth!

359
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,721
This udon broth…

360
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:33,759
Thank you.

361
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,461
This is amazing.

362
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:38,364
-I'm so happy to hear that, thank you.
-Thank you.

363
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:40,833
-Thank you.
-I love it.

364
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,268
I think I'm in love.

365
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,670
-Thank you.
-You are?

366
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,872
This is it.

367
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:48,541
I might come back tomorrow morning.

368
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:50,109
-Before filming.
-Yeah, for sure.

369
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,776
If it's not a secret,
what's the broth made of?

370
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,951
We use several ingredients.

371
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,286
-Kelp…
-Kelp.

372
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,555
-…dried mackerel, dried anchovies…
-Dried mackerel.

373
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:04,624
Stuff like that.

374
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,427
-It's perfect for booze lovers.
-Right?

375
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,698
People who like to drink will love this.
It's great, really.

376
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:16,335
I'd love to come here after a night out

377
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,604
and have this broth before heading home.

378
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,239
Same here.

379
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:25,144
I wish there was a place in Seoul
that served this udon for hangovers.

380
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,480
There are plenty of udon shops in Seoul,

381
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,649
but nothing tastes quite like this.

382
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,684
You should add ichimi,

383
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:34,453
-not shichimi, right?
-Ichimi is the way to go.

384
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,057
If you use shichimi,
the flavor gets muddled.

385
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:43,763
It's only been three or four minutes
since the food came out,

386
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,332
-but this turned into a flavorful chaos.
-I know.

387
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:51,037
Everything's blended into one.

388
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,772
But that's what makes it good.

389
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,473
-The broth became a tasty mess.
-Right.

390
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,475
The tempura that's gone all soft

391
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,611
has burdock root…

392
00:17:58,678 --> 00:17:59,979
-Right.
-…and shrimp inside.

393
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:02,515
This tempura tastes even better
when you soak it in the broth.

394
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,083
-Exactly.
-And the broth

395
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,053
is better with the tempura in it.

396
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,888
It's a match made in heaven.

397
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:11,357
It's not ideal to eat too much at dinner,

398
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,992
but you have to try this too.

399
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,226
Kashiwa rice balls.

400
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,228
-Kashiwa rice balls.
-Kashiwa rice balls.

401
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,201
Soak the rice ball in the broth…

402
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:24,804
It feels like cheating,

403
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,307
-but the rice gets warm.
-Total carb party.

404
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:29,875
Yes, it is.

405
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:33,079
A guilt-free carb party, though.

406
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:34,547
I agree.

407
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,128
The broth is just so good.

408
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:51,731
Only people who grew up around here

409
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:55,534
know the taste of these soft noodles,
the broth, the tempura,

410
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:58,871
and the delicious chaos
that comes with it.

411
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:03,976
At first, I was going to enjoy some beer,

412
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:06,712
but now I don't even care about the beer.
I'm in a trance.

413
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:09,649
You get it now, right?

414
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,785
-It's…
-I think I do.

415
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:14,487
…subtly delicious, isn't it?

416
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,799
This is amazing.

417
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:33,739
Where was it?

418
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:35,675
There's this oden place I love in Osaka.

419
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:38,544
I once asked for more broth
because it was so good,

420
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:40,079
-but they said no.
-Oh!

421
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,115
We can't ask that.

422
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:47,253
You can't ask for more broth
at oden places.

423
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,791
It feels like it'd be rude to ask.

424
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,560
There was a ton of broth left.

425
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,696
We drank until closing time,

426
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,130
but they dumped all the broth.

427
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:00,199
-They threw it out?
-They did.

428
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,767
What a waste.

429
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,636
They could've just given it to me!

430
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:07,540
That must be a Japanese custom.

431
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:11,711
They're probably thinking,
"I'm not here to sell broth!"

432
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,946
-I see.
-Maybe that's it.

433
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,781
"You're supposed to eat the solid bits!"

434
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:17,917
But Koreans love broth.

435
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,919
I get that oden broth tastes good,

436
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,387
but it's not something you drink.

437
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:22,588
-Really?
-Yeah.

438
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,190
-You don't really drink it?
-Not really.

439
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,191
-What?
-I mean…

440
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,159
You don't drink it with a spoon?

441
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,028
-Nope. We don't.
-Wow, you don't.

442
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,398
-Do you all drink it?
-Yes.

443
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:34,266
It's different in Korea.

444
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,669
We drink the broth.
It's part of our culture.

445
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,872
You don't really drink oden broth, do you?

446
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,274
-Not really.
-Right?

447
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:45,077
You might dip your food in it…

448
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:48,380
-So you just eat the solid bits?
-Yeah. Just the solid bits.

449
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,116
Mustard and eggs are mixed in,

450
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,118
so the broth gets cloudy.

451
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,452
But that's what makes it good.

452
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:56,889
People just leave the broth behind
and go home.

453
00:20:56,956 --> 00:21:00,326
Oh, that's why. I get it now.

454
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,895
This is the great oden broth debate.

455
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:03,896
Interesting.

456
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:09,201
Is it good?

457
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,274
This means I'm enjoying the food.

458
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,510
When I go into a restaurant

459
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,845
and the food is good,

460
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:21,480
I always check the menu.

461
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:23,682
-To see what else they have.
-I see.

462
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:24,950
Got your eye on anything?

463
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,752
One inari sushi, please.

464
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:30,890
-It's 100 yen.
-Right.

465
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,391
INARI SUSHI
100 YEN, ABOUT 1,000 WON

466
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:35,161
Looks like a classic inari sushi.

467
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,296
-Do I eat it as is?
-Yes.

468
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,198
-Should I dip it in soy sauce?
-No.

469
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:41,567
Just eat it as is.

470
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:47,139
-Is it moist?
-It is.

471
00:21:47,206 --> 00:21:49,008
-And sweet?
-Yes.

472
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:50,543
-Sweet and salty.
-Sweet and salty?

473
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,814
I must be out of my mind.
I shouldn't be eating this right now.

474
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,251
-It was amazing.
-Good.

475
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,686
-Thanks for bringing me.
-I'm glad.

476
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,822
Hearing that makes me happy too.

477
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,659
What should I treat you to
next time you're in Korea?

478
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,661
There's got to be something similar.

479
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,932
-Kal-guksu!
-Kal-guksu.

480
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,433
THE NEXT INSANELY GOOD SPOT

481
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:24,510
This is insanely good.

482
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,446
KAL-GUKSU

483
00:22:42,132 --> 00:22:44,132
