00:00:04,033 --> 00:00:07,074
TODAY'S FOODIE DESTINATION
OSAKA

2
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:12,379
A TRUE HIDDEN GEM INTRODUCED
BY MR. MATJJIGAE

3
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:16,350
NOT A TRENDY HOTSPOT

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,388
BUT A SECRET SPOT
ONLY THOSE IN THE KNOW VISIT

5
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:24,958
EPISODE 35
ACTORS' HIDEOUT

6
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:28,896
K-foodie meets J-foodie.

7
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,430
This is insane.

8
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:34,768
Where are we?

9
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:36,303
This place

10
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,106
-is called Tanimachi Yonchōme.
-Tanimachi Yonchōme.

11
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:43,210
It's not exactly a major downtown area.

12
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:46,280
-Right.
-It's more of a commercial district.

13
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,482
Right nearby,

14
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:51,485
-there's the large moat of Osaka Castle.
-Yes.

15
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,720
And around the castle

16
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:56,423
are various public institutions,

17
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,992
-like police stations and such.
-I see.

18
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,495
-NHK is one of them.
-Yes.

19
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:04,998
NHK, JAPAN'S PUBLIC BROADCASTER

20
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:09,202
BASED IN TOKYO, HAS 54 REGIONAL STATIONS

21
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:13,240
-So, about 20 years ago, I happened to…
-A show?

22
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:15,909
…work on an NHK morning drama
called Chiritotechin.

23
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:17,811
I played the role
of the protagonist's father.

24
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:19,713
-Yes.
-Because of that,

25
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,817
I came to work at NHK Osaka
for over half a year.

26
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:27,487
Back then, I used to drink a lot,

27
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:33,360
and since filming
always ended late at night

28
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,729
and everyone was staying nearby,

29
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:39,433
this place became our usual meeting spot…

30
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,602
-Everyone would wait over there?
-…after work.

31
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:43,537
Like a hideout.

32
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,272
What kind of food do they sell?

33
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:47,908
-Regular Japanese food? Izakaya-style?
-What kind of food?

34
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:49,676
It's like creative cuisine.

35
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:53,647
Back then, creative cuisine
wasn't really a thing yet,

36
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,717
-but the owner, Mr. Kuroda…
-Yes.

37
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,820
…came up with
all sorts of inventive dishes.

38
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:03,123
And as you can probably tell,

39
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,659
-it's not an easy place to get into.
-Is it narrow?

40
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:08,662
-It looks dangerous.
-Is it here?

41
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,931
Looks dangerous, right?

42
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:13,500
What's up with this lighting?

43
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:17,070
-It looks dangerous.
-It looks dangerous.

44
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,005
-Yes.
-Let's go in.

45
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,706
Amazing.

46
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,710
-Tanimachi's B-grade gourmet spot.
-B-grade gourmet.

47
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,279
B-GRADE GOURMET

48
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,615
AFFORDABLE YET DELICIOUS FOOD
MADE FROM SIMPLE INGREDIENTS

49
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:32,052
THE B-GRADE IZAKAYA NEAR NHK OSAKA

50
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:34,955
THAT CAPTIVATED ACTORS

51
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:38,258
IZAKAYA: STAY + DRINK + PLACE

52
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:41,962
MEANING A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN DRINK

53
00:02:42,925 --> 00:02:46,366
WAKON HOMURA
B-GRADE IZAKAYA

54
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,437
The ultimate B-grade gourmet spot
in the Tanimachi Yonchōme area.

55
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:54,408
It's a tiny place,
so it's always packed with people.

56
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:55,909
Everyone drinks in spots like this.

57
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:57,978
-Really?
-Hello.

58
00:02:58,078 --> 00:03:00,447
-Excuse me.
-Hello. Welcome.

59
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,549
It's been a while.

60
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:04,117
-Thank you.
-This is Mr. Kuroda.

61
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,786
-Hello.
-Hello. I'm Sung Si-kyung.

62
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,688
-Si-kyung.
-Nice to meet you.

63
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,157
It's been a while.

64
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,059
The last time you came here
was with your wife

65
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,427
-after performing.
-With my wife.

66
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:17,330
That was about 20 years ago.

67
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:20,000
-Your hair used to be black.
-I had black hair.

68
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,936
Your hair is white now, too.

69
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:25,906
-It's been 20 years for me, too.
-It's been 20 years.

70
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,174
You're still the same.

71
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:31,011
But the neighborhood feels
a bit different.

72
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:32,879
There are a lot more restaurants now.

73
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,682
Many places closed during COVID,
but new ones have opened again.

74
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:36,883
I see.

75
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:41,254
The place upstairs where everyone
used to drink together is closed too.

76
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,490
The hideout?

77
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,859
-It's gone?
-It's gone.

78
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:48,862
So, we even took a photo of your autograph

79
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:51,598
-on the wall upstairs and hung it up.
-Really?

80
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:54,634
You wrote it directly on the wall
and not on the wallpaper,

81
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,470
so we had no choice.

82
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:59,940
Do the NHK morning drama cast members
still come here?

83
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:00,974
Yes, they do.

84
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:03,176
Has it become a sort of tradition?

85
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,278
I suppose it has.

86
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:06,713
Somehow it just did.

87
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,448
-Shall we sit?
-Okay.

88
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,619
How many people can fit
if the place is full?

89
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,988
About 12,

90
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,790
depending on how close everyone is.

91
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:18,325
-Yes.
-Depends on how close.

92
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,394
We used to squeeze in here
as much as we could.

93
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,130
You like shops like this?

94
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,698
I do.

95
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:26,600
Enjoy it today.

96
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,135
What do you want to drink?

97
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,669
I'd like to have a draft beer.

98
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:30,604
-Draft beer.
-Yes.

99
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,105
-I'll have non-alcoholic beer.
-Okay.

100
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:33,707
-Sure.
-Thank you.

101
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:35,375
Thank you.

102
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,844
-What's this?
-Draft beer and non-alcoholic beer.

103
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,079
-Yes.
-Thank you.

104
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,048
-Thank you.
-We're at an izakaya.

105
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,950
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

106
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:56,563
But Mr. Matjjigae,
you quit drinking, right?

107
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:59,800
I thought you wouldn't be able to go
to Korean street stalls

108
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,635
or Japanese izakayas anymore.

109
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,904
-I can go there.
-Really?

110
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,773
In Japan, we can have

111
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:09,042
-non-alcoholic drinks.
-That's different.

112
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:10,944
Back then, in Japan too,
if you didn't drink…

113
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:13,713
Yeah, there was a time when
not drinking felt a bit out of place.

114
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,916
Almost everyone drank.

115
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:19,219
Mr. Kuroda, it's okay to just have
non-alcoholic drinks these days.

116
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:20,453
Things have changed.

117
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,856
-Times have changed.
-Yes.

118
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:27,694
So, 20 years ago,
how much did Mr. Matjjigae drink?

119
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:30,197
Since they drank together,
a bottle would be gone in no time.

120
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,298
In no time.

121
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:34,734
Mr. Matjjigae didn't really eat much.
He mostly just drank.

122
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:37,437
-That's pretty cool.
-Cool? Hardly…

123
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,705
Like a samurai.

124
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:41,408
-But…
-But when he got sleepy, he left first.

125
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:44,311
Yes. The hotel was next door,
so I'd say, "I'm heading out," and go.

126
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:47,247
And he always paid the bill,

127
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:49,416
so everyone would be disappointed
when he left.

128
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:53,887
That was part of playing
the father's role.

129
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:55,155
It couldn't be helped.

130
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,659
There are so many different dishes.

131
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,027
Yes.

132
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,029
First, try the shutō…

133
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,900
-And mascarpone cheese.
-It's a must-have.

134
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:11,004
This place is actually the creator
of shutō with mascarpone cheese.

135
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:12,339
-We'll have that.
-Okay.

136
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,741
COURSE 1: THE OWNER'S ORIGINAL CREATION

137
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:19,166
SHUTŌ (JAPANESE-STYLE SALTED SEAFOOD)
WITH MASCARPONE CHEESE

138
00:06:19,316 --> 00:06:22,649
Normally, shutō is mixed
with cream cheese, right?

139
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:26,786
The combination of cream cheese
and salted seafood already existed.

140
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,655
-Right?
-But I didn't like

141
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,858
how firm cream cheese was.

142
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:35,962
I wanted something smoother,
so I started using mascarpone instead.

143
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:41,534
That was about 20 years ago,
back when it wasn't popular at all.

144
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,137
I tried it here
and thought it was delicious.

145
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:45,972
Then, while you were filming a drama,

146
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,275
you mentioned it on another show,

147
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,543
and the dish spread all across Japan.

148
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:55,148
I mentioned how good it was
on TV several times.

149
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,350
-You mentioned this restaurant?
-Then

150
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,887
the menu spread
all over Japan, apparently.

151
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:03,290
Is the shutō the regular kind?

152
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:04,691
It's tuna.

153
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:05,625
-Tuna.
-Tuna?

154
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:10,397
Yes, our restaurant specialized
in tuna back then,

155
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:14,034
so we used tuna shutō.

156
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:17,958
MASCARPONE CHEESE

157
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:21,161
SHUTŌ (SALTED TUNA)

158
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,613
This is our shutō
with mascarpone cheese.

159
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,149
-With tuna shutō.
-Shall we

160
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,584
-give it a try?
-Yes.

161
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:34,207
SHUTŌ AND MASCARPONE
4,000 WON, 440 YEN

162
00:07:34,716 --> 00:07:36,089
SHUTŌ AND MASCARPONE

163
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:38,024
TUNA SHUTŌ WITH MASCARPONE,
NOT CREAM CHEESE

164
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:39,726
AN APPETIZER THAT SHOWS THE OWNER'S FLAIR

165
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,129
This is my first time trying mascarpone
in a combination like this.

166
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,998
I've only ever used it

167
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:48,835
for making tiramisu.

168
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:55,942
-They go really well together.
-Right?

169
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,546
It's incredibly good.

170
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,815
-I told you.
-The sesame seeds…

171
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:04,250
They're a brilliant touch.

172
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:08,488
It's that sweet and salty balance.
The mascarpone is sweet and smooth,

173
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:11,658
and it completely rounds out
the saltiness of the tuna shutō.

174
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:19,265
This calls for sake.

175
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,234
Should we order some?

176
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:22,736
Do you have any recommendations?

177
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:26,639
Summer sake has just started coming in.

178
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:28,408
This is Yamagata Masamune.

179
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:30,643
Summer sake goes down easily.

180
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,545
-It's hot, so I'll have summer sake.
-Okay.

181
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:33,513
Yes.

182
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,616
There's that Homura logo.

183
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:38,718
-It's been so long.
-This…

184
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,954
Homura means "flame."

185
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:43,323
HOMURA (FLAME) LOGO

186
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,724
Thank you.

187
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:50,697
This is good.

188
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:51,731
It's good?

189
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:53,633
It's fresh,

190
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,803
with a fruity note.

191
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:59,672
-Try pairing it.
-It's perfect.

192
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,484
-It's good.
-It's good?

193
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:15,555
Drinking it right after the mascarpone
makes it feel extra smooth.

194
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,492
It's almost like rich milk ice cream.

195
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,062
And what else?

196
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:27,067
There are quite a few
Okinawan dishes here.

197
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:31,204
Like tebichi or goya champuru.

198
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:34,074
-Make it in your style, Mr. Kuroda.
-Right.

199
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,208
What's yaki tebichi?

200
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:37,477
Tebichi means pigs' feet.

201
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:38,978
YAKI TEBICHI
GRILLED PIGS' FEET

202
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,447
Pigs' feet sound good.

203
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:43,083
-Shall we have the tebichi?
-Tebichi. Okay.

204
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:46,152
And maybe something for him…

205
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:48,421
There's rafute,
a Japanese-style braised pork.

206
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:49,656
Japanese-style braised pork?

207
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,325
Yes, rafute is an Okinawan pork dish,
seasoned with brown sugar.

208
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:56,029
It's a sweet, savory
Japanese-style braised pork. It's good.

209
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,299
-And for the finale, there's pepe-meshi.
-Pepe-meshi.

210
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:00,934
-He's been talking about it.
-Yes.

211
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,670
"There's something called pepe-meshi."

212
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,338
"What's pepe-meshi?"

213
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:07,373
"You won't know
until you try it yourself."

214
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,342
-We're not at the finale yet.
-Yes.

215
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,077
Then I'll have the kakuni,
the braised pork.

216
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,846
-Kakuni.
-Please.

217
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:14,881
COURSE 2: OKINAWAN FUSION DISH

218
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,150
YAKI TEBICHI (GRILLED PIGS' FEET)

219
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:20,954
YAKI RAFUTE
(OKINAWAN-STYLE BROWN SUGAR BRAISED PORK)

220
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,990
Why have you always had
so many Okinawan dishes here?

221
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:28,928
I originally started out
specializing in tuna,

222
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:32,832
but my tuna supplier closed down.
So when I looked for new ones,

223
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:38,204
most of the tuna wholesalers had started
running their own restaurants.

224
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:40,840
There wasn't anyone left
to supply me with tuna.

225
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:44,144
-I thought it was over.
-Right.

226
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,814
But I had a liquor supplier
down in Okinawa.

227
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,949
The old man there told me,

228
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:53,219
"If things get tough,
try making Okinawan food."

229
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:58,158
"I'll help you with anything.
I'll send you whatever you need."

230
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,293
So after I closed my restaurant for a bit,

231
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,630
I went to stay at his place

232
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:07,967
for a few weeks.
He took me all over Okinawa,

233
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,637
saying things like,
"This is Okinawan culture,"

234
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:13,573
and, "This sells well in Okinawa."

235
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,552
Then when we came home,
his wife would be waiting,

236
00:11:15,652 --> 00:11:18,011
and she taught me how to cook
Okinawan home-style dishes.

237
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:20,113
-Really? That's incredible.
-That's amazing.

238
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,749
-I got back on my feet.
-You could make a drama about it.

239
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:25,852
That was about 20 years ago.

240
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:26,819
That's awesome.

241
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:29,322
-Yes.
-Here you go. Yaki tebichi.

242
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,991
-Please put the bones in this bowl.
-Okay.

243
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:40,533
YAKI TEBICHI
11,000 WON, 1,100 YEN

244
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,672
YAKI TEBICHI, GRILLED PIGS' FEET
AN OKINAWAN DISH

245
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:49,229
TEBICHI IS THE OKINAWAN WORD
FOR PIGS' FEET

246
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:51,244
It's the best.

247
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,046
I came to Osaka and ended up in Okinawa.

248
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,280
You're right.

249
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:03,223
This is good.

250
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,397
-Hurry up and eat.
-Okay.

251
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,533
-Or I'll eat it all.
-Okay.

252
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:26,713
-Is it good?
-It's good.

253
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,481
It's kind of like fried chicken.

254
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:37,857
It's exactly the kind of flavor I love.

255
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:40,426
This is…

256
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,997
It has that rich,

257
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:46,833
savory taste that keeps you
going back for more.

258
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:47,900
The seasoning…

259
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,837
I think it's perfect.

260
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:53,873
It makes me want to drink more.

261
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,277
Is this an Okinawan dish?

262
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,312
It's a bit of a variation.

263
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:03,349
Since I'm not from Okinawa,
I intentionally serve it this way.

264
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,151
I didn't want to make it exactly the same.

265
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:11,858
The slightly burnt, crispy part…

266
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,860
-The burnt part?
-Can I eat it?

267
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,895
Oh, that's the best part.

268
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:19,932
-Eat.
-The best bite.

269
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,069
Which one should I drink?

270
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,239
Which one should I drink?

271
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,840
SAKE, CRAFT BEER

272
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:30,143
Which one should I choose?

273
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,745
Which one should I drink with this?

274
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,647
Shouldn't you go with beer?

275
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,485
Just let it flow down.

276
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:40,953
I'm feeling it.

277
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:50,296
Is it good?

278
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,368
It's so good.

279
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:57,203
Next time, let's go have
Korean pigs' feet.

280
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,838
-Let's.
-Yes.

281
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,641
If everyone got their own portion,

282
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,343
we'd all just keep eating without a word.

283
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,545
Right, that's exactly what would happen.

284
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:08,314
Even the actors who are picky about food

285
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:10,817
say they love

286
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:13,720
Homura.

287
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:16,222
-It's that kind of place.
-I can see why.

288
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:17,757
-This place is dangerous.
-Dangerous.

289
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:19,759
Dangerous? How so?

290
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:21,728
The drinks…

291
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,363
Is it okay if I get drunk?

292
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:24,597
-Yes.
-Really?

293
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:25,898
Yes.

294
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,067
Someone will carry you home.

295
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:32,271
You're the only one who could do that.

296
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,273
I'm heavy.

297
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:39,045
When was the last time you got so drunk
you blacked out?

298
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:40,646
That almost never happens.

299
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,814
-Never?
-No.

300
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,983
I want to experience being
completely drunk.

301
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,318
You want to get drunk?

302
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,286
Doesn't it make you happy?

303
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:50,757
People who can really hold their liquor
tend to feel a bit lonely, you know?

304
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,993
The stronger the drinker,
the deeper the loneliness.

305
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,697
Right. I've spent
my whole life taking care of others.

306
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:01,968
Mr. Matjjigae, you used to be
a heavy drinker too, right?

307
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,703
No, not really.

308
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,272
Oh, I see. Still, you wanted
to be happy, right?

309
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:09,942
It wasn't about wanting to be happy.
I wanted to reset, to return to myself.

310
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:14,247
Especially when you're doing theater,

311
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,883
you're in such a heightened state.

312
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,919
I'd be like, "I'll kill you, you jerk!"

313
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:22,822
-When you're fully immersed in a role?
-After giving it everything,

314
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:25,358
you can't just say, "Good work today,"

315
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:29,695
-and go back to your hotel and sleep.
-That must feel strange. I understand.

316
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,898
So to completely reset myself,

317
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,902
-I'd just clear my head with alcohol.
-I see.

318
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:40,440
It was a way to calm down
from that rush, to reset the high.

319
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:43,743
I used to drink for that reason.

320
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,747
But now that I'm older,

321
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:51,451
I can slip in and out

322
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,619
of a role more freely.

323
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:57,757
I've reached a point where
I don't need alcohol anymore.

324
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,761
-Really?
-Pretty much.

325
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,564
Yeah. I don't rely on it now.

326
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,631
Well…

327
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:08,100
As a birthday gift,

328
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,670
would you drink with me
just for one night?

329
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,406
Why would my drinking
be your birthday present?

330
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:17,176
It just feels like it would
make us closer somehow.

331
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:20,146
-I wasn't really expecting anything.
-Right.

332
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:24,383
Well, I don't mind having dinner together.

333
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,718
Okay.

334
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,087
-Mr. Kuroda.
-Yes?

335
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,089
-Do you have sparkling water?
-Sparkling water.

336
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,358
Do you like ginger ale?

337
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:33,292
Do you have it?

338
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:36,496
Lately, I've been into things
with a spicy kick.

339
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:37,730
Just a little bit, please.

340
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:38,965
And one bottled beer, too.

341
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,266
-Sure.
-Okay.

342
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,735
Here's our recommended drink,
the spicy ginger ale.

343
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:44,303
It's fine, thank you.

344
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,807
-And this is Orion beer.
-Thank you.

345
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:51,310
-Please recommend the next sake, too.
-Something different? Sure.

346
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,613
He drinks surprisingly well.

347
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,214
Be surprised.

348
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:59,185
Thank you.

349
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,629
What song is that?

350
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,963
It's an Okinawan folk tune.

351
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,064
Really?

352
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:16,035
This one's a lightly carbonated sake.

353
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:17,503
Lightly carbonated sake.

354
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,906
You have to drink it
right after it's opened.

355
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,109
-Kaze no Mori.
-Thank you.

356
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,344
-It's from the Nara region, right?
-Kaze no Mori.

357
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,880
-Kaze no Mori.
-I think the name comes from an area

358
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:30,116
called Kaze no Mori.

359
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:32,018
There's a traditional brewery there.

360
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:33,920
Excuse me.

361
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:38,658
Nara's a wonderful place.

362
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,261
It's full of World Heritage sites.

363
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,408
It's slightly fizzy.

364
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,243
I can smell the aroma from here.

365
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,644
-You can?
-Yes.

366
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,113
What an interesting flavor.

367
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,082
It's completely different.

368
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:04,383
-It's different, right?
-It is.

369
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,952
This is…

370
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:07,753
-Insanely good, right?
-Absolutely.

371
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,022
Here's your yaki rafute.

372
00:18:13,363 --> 00:18:16,896
YAKI RAFUTE
7,700 WON, 770 YEN

373
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:21,067
It's Okinawan pork belly with the skin on.

374
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,301
With the skin on.

375
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:24,337
Marinated in brown sugar.

376
00:18:26,134 --> 00:18:30,142
OKINAWAN-STYLE BROWN SUGAR BRAISED PORK

377
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:33,913
PORK WITH SKIN, SIMMERED IN SAKE,
THEN GRILLED

378
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,782
AND COATED IN A BROWN SUGAR GLAZE

379
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,387
-Tell me how to eat this.
-You just…

380
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,301
It's good!

381
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,406
It's tender.

382
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:02,541
It melts in my mouth.

383
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,980
-It's soft.
-We boil it with the skin.

384
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:09,749
There's mayonnaise, too.

385
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,118
-The daikon…
-Try it with the daikon.

386
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,687
-Grated daikon?
-This is incredible.

387
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:17,189
This is just…

388
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,991
Let's try this.

389
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,280
It has a bit of a Chinese-style flavor.

390
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,548
It does,

391
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:45,184
but still feels distinctly Japanese.

392
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:46,419
It's so tender.

393
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:50,856
And this sweetness, it's such a pleasant,

394
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:53,726
elegant kind of sweetness.

395
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,997
This place is called Homura,
"Flame," for a reason.

396
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:00,466
-The grilling technique is incredible.
-Flame.

397
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,636
When the flames flare up,
the exhaust fan gets pretty loud,

398
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:07,573
but grilling is Mr. Kuroda's specialty.

399
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,312
This sauce…

400
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:19,351
It's amazing.

401
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,056
I've been replenishing it
for over 20 years now.

402
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:25,257
Really?

403
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:27,059
-You keep refilling it.
-It's all in there?

404
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:31,564
This sauce is our treasure.

405
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:35,301
You use it for other dishes too, right?

406
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:38,471
-Yes, for this and for tsukune.
-Tsukune.

407
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,574
-Just those two?
-Yes, only those two.

408
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,010
-People get mad when I clear the plate.
-The sauce…

409
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,879
Everyone licks the plate clean.

410
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:48,047
Sauce maniacs.

411
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:49,949
In Japan, you call that "baka," right?

412
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:52,218
Like "tuna baka" or "ramen baka."

413
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:56,422
In Japan, whether it's cooking or acting,

414
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:59,125
being called a baka
or a pervert is a compliment.

415
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:03,095
Right. For an artist,
that's the highest praise.

416
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:05,664
This is a delicious kind of madness, too.

417
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,566
That's why…

418
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:11,771
-You can really enjoy drinking here.
-You can.

419
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,278
This is incredibly good.

420
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:24,150
It's less of an Okinawan dish and more of
your own original creation, isn't it?

421
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,786
This sauce is just amazing.

422
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,287
I can't resist it.

423
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:29,789
You can't.

424
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,160
I actually saved
this perfect little piece from earlier.

425
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:38,297
For the best bite.

426
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:42,468
If I dip this into that sauce…

427
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,004
-Can I?
-Go ahead.

428
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,272
Will it be okay?

429
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:47,473
Is it okay?

430
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,609
Sure. This is Tanimachi's
ultimate B-grade gourmet spot.

431
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,378
That's why

432
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:55,648
-they don't have strict rules here.
-Everything is okay?

433
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:00,452
Here.

434
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:06,859
Dip it into the soul of this restaurant,

435
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,429
and add just a touch of mayonnaise.

436
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:18,103
-This is it.
-That's it.

437
00:22:29,615 --> 00:22:30,950
-This is good.
-It's good.

438
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,785
-The sauce.
-It's amazing.

439
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:35,554
This sauce is really good.

440
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:37,523
I can't resist it.

441
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,093
We haven't ordered that yet, have we?

442
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,561
The pepe-meshi.

443
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:43,963
-Should we try it?
-Yes.

444
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,865
We'll have the pepe-meshi.

445
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:47,733
COURSE 3:
THE OWNER'S ORIGINAL PASTA

446
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,504
PEPE-MESHI

447
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:54,240
What do you think the "pepe" is?

448
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:55,207
Peperoncino?

449
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:56,342
-Correct.
-Peperoncino.

450
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,177
-I got it right?
-I originally

451
00:22:58,244 --> 00:23:00,646
worked in kaiseki cuisine,
traditional Japanese fine dining.

452
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:01,680
-Japanese cuisine?
-Yes!

453
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:04,617
-That's what I used to make.
-You can cook anything, then.

454
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:09,321
Back then, Japanese chefs
weren't allowed to eat onions or garlic.

455
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,923
No mayonnaise, either.

456
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,425
We believed they interfered
with our sense of taste.

457
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:16,262
So those who seasoned the food
weren't supposed to eat it.

458
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:20,499
A junior of mine quit Japanese cuisine
and took up Italian cuisine.

459
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:21,834
So I went to visit.

460
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:25,104
When I tried the peperoncino there,
I was blown away.

461
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,939
I asked, "How did you make this?"

462
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:30,342
And he said,
"Garlic, olive oil, and chili."

463
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:34,213
It was so simple,
yet the flavor moved me deeply.

464
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,582
You're talking about aglio e olio, right?

465
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:41,553
Yes. Then I thought,
"What if I added broth to peperoncino?"

466
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,923
-And the broth kept increasing.
-What an artist.

467
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:48,494
At first, I ended up with
what I called "broth-soaked peperoncino."

468
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,064
Then I had my younger colleagues try it.

469
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:54,066
They were all young

470
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:56,769
and you know, when Kansai people
have leftover soup…

471
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,203
They want to mix it with rice.

472
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,307
Yes, they ate it with rice.

473
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,542
So I put rice in the bottom,

474
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,211
poured the rich peperoncino broth over it,

475
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:10,049
and I wanted to make
a Japanese-style pasta,

476
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,685
so I topped it with umeboshi.

477
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,219
-Like ochazuke.
-Yes.

478
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:18,223
-This is such a wonderful restaurant.
-Their signature finishing dish.

479
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,592
The famous pepe-meshi.

480
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,728
So this is pepe-meshi.

481
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:25,631
It's been a while.

482
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,236
THE FAMOUS PEPE-MESHI
8,800 WON, 880 YEN

483
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:35,240
-So this is it.
-Peppers…

484
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,509
-And rice.
-And rice.

485
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,845
Is there rice in it? There's rice!

486
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:41,146
Yes, there's rice in it.

487
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:42,448
Go ahead.

488
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:58,263
It's good.

489
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,935
This has to be good.

490
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,470
I can tell just from the smell.

491
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:19,451
It's good.

492
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,553
-You finished it already?
-I did.

493
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:23,956
I'll have a bit of the umeboshi.

494
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:25,491
Please do.

495
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,600
This…

496
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:39,505
This is really good.

497
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:40,606
It's good, right?

498
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:45,010
There's a burst of umami.

499
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:48,414
-It's rich in flavor.
-The broth is just incredible.

500
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,851
-And the noodles. The texture is perfect.
-Yes.

501
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,055
It's not too soft, not too firm…

502
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,424
Just that ideal balance
of firmness and softness.

503
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,260
That springiness and firmness…

504
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:04,997
Would this be similar to Korea's rajuk?

505
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,800
RAJUK, RAMYEON WITH RICE
COOKED TOGETHER IN THE SAME POT

506
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:09,034
How should I describe this?

507
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:10,903
Maybe like gaengsigi?

508
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:12,337
GAENGSIGI, GYEONGSANG-DO DISH

509
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,640
PORRIDGE WITH ANCHOVY BROTH, KIMCHI,
LEFTOVER RICE, ETC.

510
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,581
It's my first time.

511
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:24,450
I've never had this before.

512
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,151
You can only have pepe-meshi here.

513
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:28,454
-Did it exist 20 years ago, too?
-It did.

514
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,924
Back then, the younger folks
always ordered pepe-meshi at the end.

515
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,792
I don't really remember eating it, though.

516
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,562
-It's good.
-It's the best.

517
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:39,164
The umeboshi
really brings it all together.

518
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:41,733
And the shiso, too.

519
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,335
The shiso and umeboshi.

520
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:11,730
It's delicious.

521
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:14,733
It's good, right?

522
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:21,840
Even without knowing the chef's story,

523
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:24,076
it would have tasted great,

524
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:27,312
but after hearing everything
he's been through,

525
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:28,347
this dish feels like…

526
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:31,283
-This is Michelin-worthy.
-Michelin?

527
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,885
This is really…

528
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,387
This is the best.

529
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,122
I want to see pepe-meshi

530
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:40,392
become a national dish someday.

531
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:43,695
That would be wonderful.

532
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:47,766
I've been meaning to ask…

533
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:51,003
when business gets busy,

534
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:55,007
don't you ever think about expanding?

535
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:57,743
Making the place

536
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,412
a bit bigger?

537
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:02,281
Mr. Kuroda, what do you think?

538
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,882
I've thought about it before,

539
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:07,920
but I believe that requires talent, too.

540
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,558
I don't think I have
that kind of managerial talent.

541
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:15,427
There was a time I let someone else
run the place for me,

542
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:17,796
but the quality started to slip
little by little.

543
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:18,730
Right.

544
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:21,066
I didn't even know
what I was doing anymore.

545
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:25,537
So when COVID hit, I shut everything down

546
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:26,838
and started over on my own.

547
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:29,308
And honestly, I think the food
tastes much better now.

548
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,943
That makes sense.

549
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:32,711
So I'm pretty sure

550
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:35,914
-I'll keep handling everything myself.
-That's cool.

551
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:38,317
I just want to do what I can,
within my own limits.

552
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:43,021
What struck me the most earlier was that

553
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:45,824
he's only got two dishes that use
that sauce, tsukune and rafute,

554
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:50,562
yet he kept the same sauce alive
all these years.

555
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,332
Isn't that incredible?

556
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:57,169
If you think of it as your own flavor,

557
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,705
you can't hand it off to others
for the sake of expansion.

558
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:02,874
It's something you savor right here,
in Mr. Kuroda's little hideout.

559
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:06,378
-Right.
-The taste of beautiful madness.

560
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:11,183
If we weren't filming, it's the kind
of place I'd drink myself silly.

561
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,119
It's a precious spot, run by a chef

562
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:18,390
with real conviction,
someone who's poured years of care

563
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,593
and craftsmanship into his food.

564
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,195
Truly precious.

565
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:26,031
I feel so grateful

566
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,767
that he introduced me to a place
that serves food this good.

567
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:30,135
It's honestly amazing.

568
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,706
I was a little worried
it might feel like a burden, though.

569
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:35,774
For me?

570
00:29:35,841 --> 00:29:39,645
Yes. Revealing
your private spaces like this.

571
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:41,680
I think

572
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:46,451
the Netflix viewers are going to love it,

573
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,689
but I did wonder
if that might worry you a bit.

574
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:52,257
Of course it does.

575
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:53,191
Right.

576
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:55,794
-My treasured spots…
-Right.

577
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:58,397
These secret hideouts
are slowly being discovered by everyone.

578
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:02,067
I just hope it's not too much pressure
for you, Mr. Matjjigae.

579
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,803
It's not really a burden.

580
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:07,673
It's all part of fate.

581
00:30:08,707 --> 00:30:12,110
Even if it's a place

582
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:15,247
I'd rather keep to myself,

583
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,783
if people it interesting,

584
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:21,987
and want to visit that place
or taste their food,

585
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:26,558
that can become something valuable
for the restaurant, too.

586
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:29,795
It's not just mine, after all.

587
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:33,765
-Yes.
-Somehow, we've ended up with the ability

588
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:37,235
to share places like this with others.

589
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:39,037
-Right.
-So,

590
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:42,374
I hope people seek out
restaurants like this.

591
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:46,378
They'll think, "But this place
is so hard to find!"

592
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:50,282
Yet someone's stubbornly making
amazing food there

593
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:51,516
in a tiny kitchen,

594
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:55,354
cooking dishes that fit
their own standards.

595
00:30:55,420 --> 00:31:00,325
I think places like that can be found
all over Japan, Korea, and the world.

596
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:03,095
And it would be wonderful
if we could visit them.

597
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:04,096
Yes.

598
00:31:05,834 --> 00:31:08,200
AFTER THE FIRST ROUND

599
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:10,869
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

600
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:17,109
-We're staying here again tonight.
-Yes, we are.

601
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:19,077
OMO7 Osaka by Hoshino Resorts

602
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:22,848
is right in the Shinsekai area,
near Tsutenkaku Tower.

603
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:25,884
Yes, it's a popular spot
for Korean tourists.

604
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:27,886
Shinsekai is famous
for kushikatsu, isn't it?

605
00:31:27,953 --> 00:31:31,390
-This area is the mecca of kushikatsu.
-Right.

606
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:32,324
-Takoyaki.
-Yes.

607
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:34,192
Okonomiyaki and kushiage.

608
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:36,762
There are amazing dishes
everywhere in this area.

609
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,830
Right. Takoyaki is the symbol of Osaka.

610
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,999
-Takoyaki, yes.
-And this hotel

611
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,502
actually lets you eat takoyaki inside.

612
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,737
-That's awesome.
-It's a fun little tip.

613
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,476
The takoyaki here has a broth flavor.

614
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:54,012
It's delicious.

615
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:57,482
What? Fireworks?

616
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:01,253
This is basically a date.

617
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:03,955
It is a date.
Hey, don't sound so disappointed.

618
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:06,425
-Let's just eat takoyaki.
-A date with a gray-haired senior…

619
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,694
NEXT INSANELY GOOD SPOT

620
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:10,996
Don't open it.

621
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:12,197
I want to see it, though.

622
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:14,466
You have to resist that urge.

623
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:16,668
-I really want to open it.
-No, don't.

624
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:19,004
Just let me eat freely, please.
I really want to open it.

625
00:32:23,103 --> 00:32:25,130
