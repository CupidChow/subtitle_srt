The wind is strong today.

14
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:50,951
-It's a shame about Mount Fuji.
-We might not be able to see it.

15
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:52,986
Hello.

16
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,656
-Go ahead.
-Let's go further in.

17
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:58,025

INSANELY GOOD PUDDING SPOT

This place is extremely popular.

22
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,806
We scored a great table.

23
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,577
I mean, this is a great spot.

24
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:18,879
It feels like we're on a date.

25
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:22,349
I know, right?
This place is perfect for a date.

26
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:26,653
-That's why we dressed up in suits.
-And the music adds to it.

27
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,556
-The suits…
-I think they mistook me for a waiter

28
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:30,724
when we walked in.

29
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,195
-This is a date spot.
-Their cheesecake is good.

00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,273
So, where are we?

34
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,341
-This area?
-Yes.

35
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,276
-It's a seaside town called Akiya.
-Akiya.

36
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:52,913
-I used to come here often to go fishing.
-You used to fish?

37
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,817
I did a lot back in the day,
so I came here pretty often.

38
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:59,052
Whenever I have a day off,

39
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,056
I just want to be by the ocean.

40
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,627
Here, you can see the big Mount Fuji
in the background.

41
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:11,131
-Right?
-No, it's barely visible.

42
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:15,335
A HAZY VIEW OF MOUNT FUJI

43
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:18,905
Here, you can find out
if you're lucky or not.

44
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,475
-You can test your luck.
-Exactly.

45
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:25,379
-That is just like my life.
-Yes, I know what you mean.

46
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,481
-It's vague.
-And fuzzy.

47
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,116
But you can almost see it…

48
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:31,585
-Almost, but not quite.
-Yeah.

49
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,086
The weather will clear up.

50
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,689
-Do you think so?
-No more cloudy days ahead.

51
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:38,358
-Just like my love life.
-The future is bright.

52
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:39,893
-I can do it!
-For sure.

53
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,495
I can make it work this year.

54
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:44,665
-The pudding is good.
-Oh, the pudding?

55
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,299
-And…
-What a quick change of topic.

56
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,402
In the evening,

57
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,238
they sell a mean crab pasta here.

58
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,506
AT A PUDDING SHOP?

59
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,841
-Made with crab innards?
-With blue crab. It's great.

60
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,576
Blue crab meat is sweet and flavorful.

61
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,612
-The sauce is filled with crab meat.
-In the sauce?

62
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,113
Wow.

63
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,448
But they don't serve it now.

64
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:04,718
That's too bad.

65
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:06,953
-So let's have pudding for now.
-It's pudding time.

66
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,889
-I'm in dessert hell.
-What do you mean?

67
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,257
-Sorry.
-Come on.

68
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:11,958
-Right, dessert heaven.
-It's not hell.

69
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,560
Dessert heaven it is.

70
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:18,365
Japanese-style puddings
have evolved over time.

71
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:22,602
People used to prefer them
soft and creamy,

72
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:26,306
but the trend has shifted
to something that melts in your mouth.

73
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,774
But the pudding here

74
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:28,975
is firm.

75
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:31,812
-Dense.
-Which means…

76
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,748
-It's made the traditional way.
-I see.

77
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:35,816
Let's get some pudding.

78
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:39,386
-Hello, thanks for coming back.
-Hi, I'm glad to be here as always.

79
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,088
-Hello.
-Welcome.

80
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,889
Here's the menu.

81
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,358
This option comes with one pudding.

84

or Hokkaido fresh cream pudding.

85
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,103

Over here on the dessert menu,

91
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,783
we have a surprise chef's selection.

92
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,421
You can get a set of two puddings
or a pudding with a cake.

93
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:18,825
WHAT'S TODAY'S CHEF'S SELECTION?

94
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:20,794
What would you like?

95
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,996
I'll go with the most famous, classic one.

96
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,931
-Classic? That means…
-Right.

97
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,000
-Custard or…
-Custard or Hokkaido fresh cream.

98
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:30,036
-I recommend the Hokkaido fresh cream.
-Then I'll have that.

99
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,872
Hokkaido fresh cream pudding.

100
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,108
Not the chef's choice with two puddings?

101
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,878
-Well…
-The chef's choice?

102
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,513
-What do you want?
-The Hokkaido pudding.

103
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,248
I'll have the same one.

104
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:42,382
-Really?
-Yes.

105
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,551
Won't it be boring
if we get the same thing?

106
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,554
-Well…
-The chef's selection would be more fun.

107
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:51,625
-I don't choose my food for fun.
-No, I mean…

108
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:52,826
So, yeah.

109
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:55,095
-I eat here often, so…
-Yes.

110
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:56,930
I'll get the chef's pudding selection.

111
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:58,532
Respect.

112
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,100
He's doing it for the show.

113
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,636
-I'll stick with one pudding.
-A Hokkaido fresh cream pudding.

114
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,237
And for drinks?

115
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,306
-I'll have hot coffee.
-Okay.

116
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:08,175
-Me too.
-Okay.

117
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,743
I'll get those ready for you.

118
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,478
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

119
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,315
During the COVID pandemic,

120
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:18,952
I often made cheesecake
and pudding at home.

121
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:22,322
-You seem to cook and bake a lot at home.
-Yes, I do.

122
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:25,225
-I followed you on Instagram.
-Right.

123
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:28,461
I was almost a bit concerned.

124
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:29,830
He posts photos every single day

125
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,598
with incredible enthusiasm.

126
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,233
You cook often.

127
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,002
-You even made clam chowder once.
-Right, I did.

128
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,270
He makes all sorts of things

129
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,439
and post videos saying,
"This is delicious!"

130
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,707
It's all for the movie.

131
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:41,942
-For the movie?
-Yes.

132
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,477
The distributor wanted me

133
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,880
to increase my follower count.

134
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:49,416
-You were forced to do it.
-There's a social media manager.

135
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,618
We had a conversation about it.

136
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:55,055
I figured you got pressured to do it.

137
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,123
It's obvious that I had another motive,

138
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,859
but people like it.

139
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,594
-Are you on Instagram?
-Yes, I am.

140
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,998
You are? How many followers?

141
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,603
-Just over 600,000.
-Damn!

142
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:10,604
I should hurry.

143
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,472
I am just under 500,000.

144
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,673
I need to catch up.

145
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,808
600K VS 480K

146
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,109
It's going to take a while.

147
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:18,712
It only took me a month to hit 480,000.

148
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,046
Oh, man.

151
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,087
Have you been to a place like this

152
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,055
-for a date recently?
-That's so random.

153
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:32,192
This isn't exactly a conversation
to have over yakiniku.

154
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,527
-It's not about a recent date, but…
-Okay.

155
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:38,698
-This will be a bit heavy. Is that okay?
-What is it?

156
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:41,134
-It's fine. It's cloudy outside anyway.
-I mean…

157
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:44,804
-When you're in the public eye…
-Yes?

158
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:49,042
…life isn't always as fun as people think.

159
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,579
I made my debut at 21 or 22.

160
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:55,548
-That's young.
-And I'm 46 now.

161
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,450
-You've been a celebrity for 25 years.
-Yes.

162
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:03,523
So I never really had or even imagined
having a nice date at a place like this.

163
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:08,461
I worked part-time jobs
until my mid-thirties.

164
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:12,065
And I started acting professionally at 40.

165
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:15,335
-So before that, you were just…
-A regular person.

166
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:16,636
When did you get married?

167
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,571
Pretty early, around 27.

168
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,440
-That's young.
-We started dating

169
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:22,976
when we were teens

170
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:27,614
-and moved in together at 22 or 23.
-I see.

171
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,516
We've been together ever since.

172
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,319
Nothing dramatic ever happened.

173
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,755
That's actually dramatic compared
to other relationships these days.

174
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:36,756
It's romantic.

175
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,759
I'd love to hear about relationships,
but I won't have any advice to give.

176
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:42,329
-I see.
-I don't have much experience.

177
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:45,598
But if you ever need to talk,

178
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,534
you can always open up here.

179
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,003
Isn't it a bit early for that?

180
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,438
-Too soon? Then…
-Yeah.

181
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,273
-Maybe later.
-We can talk over pudding.

182
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,108
Let's save some serious talk for later.

183
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,643
Here they come.

184
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,744
Thanks for waiting.

185
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,413
Hokkaido fresh cream… Oh, my bad.

00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:27,374
Today's selection

194
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,508
Okay.

195
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,345
-Is this chocolate pudding?
-Yes, it is.

196
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:35,615
It comes with a baked cheesecake.

197
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,551
The Hokkaido fresh cream pudding is good.

198
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:42,989
-Do you have that saying in Japan too?
-What saying?

199
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:47,060
-"The grass is greener on the other side."
-Yes, that's all Goro ever thinks about.

200
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:48,895
Here's your chef's selection.

201
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:52,165
-Chocolate and pumpkin pudding.
-Okay.

202
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:54,701
It comes with a baked cheesecake.

203
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:57,303
-I should've gotten that.
-I told you so.

204
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,438
I missed out.

205
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:01,541
-We can swap if you want.
-No, that's okay.

206
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,176
-Let's share.
-No, I'm good.

207
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:05,045
Just take some. It's fine.

208
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,080
-Let's dig in.
-Okay.

209
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,115
How do we eat this?

210
00:09:09,644 --> 00:09:10,717
Just…

211
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,719
Have you never had pudding before?

212
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:15,221
Do I lick it?

213
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,725
-Spoon down from the caramel…
-I see.

214
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:21,227
-All the way to the bottom.
-The whole thing?

215
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,362
Yes, straight down.

216
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,032
It's quite firm.

217
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,867
It's got some weight to it.

218
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,436
It's pretty dense.

219
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,474
-It's not like convenience store pudding.
-Convenience store?

220
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,976
You can't compare this to that.

221
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,379
-I don't eat pudding that often.
-Then try it.

222
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,481
Sorry, I'm inexperienced with pudding.

223
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:51,524
How is it?

224
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,462
-This is amazing.
-I know.

225
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,064
Wow.

226
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,567
It's fantastic.

227
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:03,470
Oh, my.

228
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:13,980
Isn't it good?

229
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,182
How's the caramel?

230
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:17,684
Incredible.

231
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,888
The caramel smells amazing.

232
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,757
-It has a slightly burnt taste…
-Yeah.

233
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:26,459
…which is superb.

234
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:27,961
-The vanilla bean…
-Yes.

235
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:31,631
…adds a rich, elegant fragrance.

236
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:33,533
Hokkaido fresh cream pudding

237
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,003
-is rich in nutrients too.
-Really? Because it's milk?

238
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,539
Milk and eggs are the main ingredients.

239
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:42,075
I eat at least one a month.

240
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:53,153
It's nice to try other puddings
for a change.

241
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:03,096
Try some of the chocolate
and pumpkin pudding.

242
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,797
-May I?
-Of course.

243
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:16,943
It's almost like chocolate ice cream.

244
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,145
Right. Isn't it delicious?

245
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,881
-How's this one?
-It's pumpkin flavor.

246
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:23,183
-Pumpkin?
-Yeah.

247
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,326
-This has a healthy taste.
-It does.

248
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:35,395
Surprisingly, it's not too sweet.

249
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,898
Kids usually like sweeter things, right?

250
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,568
I think they'd prefer a chocolate one

251
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:44,404
or a more classic pudding over pumpkin.

252
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:49,375
When it comes to cold desserts,

253
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:52,345
pudding has always been a popular choice.

254
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:56,449
You could even make it at home.

255
00:11:56,516 --> 00:12:00,653
There's a pudding mix
that's been around for 50 years.

256
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,122
-Wow.
-Is pudding not a thing in Korea?

257
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,091
Not really, right?

258
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:07,360
There might be stores that sell it,

259
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:08,895
but it's not common.

260
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,129
Interesting.

261
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,967
-Don't they sell it in convenience stores?
-No, they don't.

262
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:16,135
-They do now.
-Really?

263
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,370
It's a recent thing.

264
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:20,240
I guess they sell it
in convenience stores now.

265
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,308
Japanese pudding?

266
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,277
-Jersey pudding.
-What?

267
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,179
-Jersey pudding.
-Excuse me?

268
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:32,585
-Jyaji?
-Please don't say that.

269
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:34,887
-You startled me.
-Is it a naughty word in Korean?

270
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:37,156
No, not really, but…

271
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:39,459
JERSEY PUDDING

272
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,761
PUDDING MADE WITH HIGH-QUALITY MILK
FROM JERSEY COWS

273
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:43,563
JAPANESE PRONUNCIATION OF JERSEY
IS "JYAJI"

274
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:46,566
SATISFIES THE PALATES OF BOTH KOREAN
AND JAPANESE PEOPLE

275
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,271
SOFT MILK PUDDING

276
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:55,575
When you go to the market in Seoul,

277
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:59,078
there's fried dough
coated with soybean powder.

278
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,047
-Fried dough?
-Glutinous rice donuts?

279
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,182
-Maybe it's sugar.
-Kkwabaegi!

280
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,018
-What?
-It's kkwabaegi!

281
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,253
It's twisted like this, right?
That's called kkwabaegi.

282
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,656
-They coat it like this.
-Yes, with sugar.

283
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,324
That was so tasty.

284
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:14,260
-It's best when it's freshly made.
-I agree.

285
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:17,897
-You can find it in any market.
-Okay.

286
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,733
-I saw it at the market entrance.
-In old-fashioned bakeries.

287
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,302
They sell things

288
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,304
like glutinous rice donuts.

289
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,572
It has red bean filling inside,

290
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,308
-with a glutinous rice dough coating.
-Yes!

291
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,343
-They fry them…
-I also had something chewy.

292
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,412
-Yes, that's the one.
-Glutinous rice donuts.

293
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,813
Those were really good.

294
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,382
-I have that ready too.
-You do?

295
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:37,884
-And walnut balls.
-Walnut balls.

296
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,887
-And kkwabaegi and everything.
-And kkwabaegi.

297
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:44,157
We have desserts only available in Korea

298
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,292
-such as yakgwa.
-Yako?

299
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,894
-Yakgwa.
-Yakgwa?

300
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,895
What's that?

301
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:51,164
It's a luxurious dessert

302
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,833
-that kings used to enjoy.
-That is luxurious.

303
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,805
Old-school food has made a comeback
among the young generation,

304
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:01,341
so yakgwa is trending.

305
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:03,109
I'll have that ready too.

306
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,610
Brace yourself for a food marathon

307
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,512
-next time in Korea.
-All right.

308
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,414
-Is that okay?
-Of course.

309
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,049
I'll finish everything.

310
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:11,484
Sounds good.

311
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:16,689
This is great coffee.

312
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:20,059
Kamakura has lots of great coffee places.

313
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:23,563
The coffee I drink at home

314
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:28,067
is from a café called Vivement Dimanche.

315
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:31,871
I buy beans that the owner roasted.

316
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:34,941
It's so good.

317
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,548
Wow, it's delicious.

318
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,351
-Masitda?
-Masitda means delicious.

319
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,354
How did you study Japanese?

320
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:52,825
-I pushed myself to the limit.
-I see. You're definitely making progress.

321
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,660
-Really?
-Yes.

322
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,230
Seriously, that's incredible.

323
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:00,032
-Thank you.
-No, really, I mean it.

324
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:03,503
-Finally, a compliment!
-He is amazing.

325
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:06,372
But I still have a long way to go.

326
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,975
-I feel like there's no end to it.
-What do you mean?

327
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,877
Even in ten or 20 years,

328
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:13,112
I still won't speak
like a native Japanese person.

329
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:15,381
What's difficult? The onomatopoeia?

330
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:18,651
That's especially difficult.

331
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:19,886
Like puru-puru, bouncy,

332
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,721
gucha-gucha, sloppy, poro-poro, drizzly.

333
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:24,824
Mochi-mochi, chewy, saku-saku, crispy,
gunya-gunya, mushy. They are all hard.

334
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:27,193
-Words for describing textures.
-Exactly.

335
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,829
-Korean is similar too.
-What?

336
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,965
Is there a word like puru-puru in Korean?

337
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,868
-Taenggeul-taenggeul, like bouncy.
-Taenggeul-taenggeul?

338
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,303
-Taenggeul-taenggeul?
-That's it.

339
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,604
Taenggeul-taenggeul.

340
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,542
-Taenggeul-taenggeul.
-Taenggeul-taenggeul.

341
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,610
-That's taenggeul-taenggeul.
-Exactly.

342
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:45,978
-Taenggeul-taenggeul.
-Right.

343
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,713
Taenggeul-taenggeul.

344
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,350
-You know what?
-Yes?

345
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,786
I've only been listening
to Korean songs lately.

346
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,154
-Really?
-Yeah.

347
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:56,322
Whose songs?

348
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,060
I'm so happy.

349
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,329
This is what I hear along with the melody.

350
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:05,832
"Ppappippyongppyongppyong."
Something like this.

351
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,500
I think Korean…

352
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:11,070
really goes well with music.

353
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,506
Does Korean sound fancy

354
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:16,042
-to Japanese ears?
-Yeah.

355
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:17,910
Korean sounds sophisticated.

356
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,680
-I see.
-It has a stylish ring to it.

357
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:23,583
I always say this.
If you know the lyrics,

358
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,319
you can enjoy the music seven times more.

359
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,187
-That's true.
-I studied English…

360
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:29,889
How well do you speak English?

361
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:33,292
-It's at a similar level to my Japanese.
-That's impressive.

362
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,127
I devoted myself to learning English

363
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:37,296
-for about two years.
-I see.

364
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,065
I tried to learn everything.

365
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,200
-After listening to pop songs…
-Yeah.

366
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:44,136
-…music critics explain things…
-Right.

367
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:45,771
…in a slightly smug way.

368
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,073
Yes.

369
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,709
"This song has been at the top for weeks…"

370
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:52,612
But no one ever explains
what the song is about

371
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:54,780
-and what the lyrics mean.
-True.

372
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,717
I was always curious about the lyrics

373
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,652
-and the message behind it.
-I see.

374
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:02,989
So I wondered, "What does this mean?"

375
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,925
People say,

376
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:09,128
if you speak the language in your dreams,

377
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:14,300
-it means you've mastered it.
-That happened a few times.

378
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,302
-But it's only in my dreams.
-Only in your dreams?

379
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,873
If Japanese people see Mount Fuji
in their dreams,

380
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,110
is it considered a good omen?

381
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:28,915
Mount Fuji, a hawk, and an eggplant.

382
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,684
Those are the top three good luck symbols

383
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,486
-in the first dream of the New Year.
-Right.

384
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,355
-Who sees an eggplant in their dreams?
-An eggplant?

385
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:39,825
You wouldn't feel lucky
when you dream about eggplants, right?

386
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:43,529
I bet you've never heard
about eggplant dreams being lucky.

387
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,197
It's probably a Japanese thing.

388
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,700
We've jumped a long way
from language learning.

389
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,802
From pudding to dreams out of nowhere.

390
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,573
-I see Mount Fuji!
-Really?

391
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,648
The western sunlight
is absolutely gorgeous.

392
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:08,521
The sunset looks incredible now.

393
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,156
Isn't it just perfect?

394
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:17,430
Mount Fuji looks stunning
from here with the ocean.

395
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,733
This is just…

396
00:18:20,785 --> 00:18:22,702
-Breathtaking.
-Truly.

397
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:27,540
Stunning.

398
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:32,244
A GLIMPSE THROUGH SI-KYUNG'S ADMIRING EYES

399
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,113
Everyone comes here

400
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:36,716
for this view.

401
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:43,789
Anyone who comes here and eats pudding
while watching the sunset

402
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,625
would get butterflies in their stomach.

403
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:48,527
-If you came here on a date…
-Yeah.

404
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,731
-…and watched the sunset together…
-Right.

405
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,600
-…I bet your heart would skip a beat.
-You think?

406
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,104
-Romantic, right?
-Definitely.

407
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:02,241
Sharing such a beautiful moment…

408
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,010
And at just the right moment,

409
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,445
-someone might pull out a ring.
-Again with the rings?

410
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,381
"When should I give it to her?"

411
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:12,852
-That could happen.
-Or if she asks, "Where's the ring?"

412
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,854
-"You just swallowed it."
-Oh, my.

413
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,523
-"I hid it in your pudding."
-It was in the pudding.

414
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,259
Now's the time to ask.

415
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,294
-Ask who?
-I don't know.

416
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:27,066
It could be a special someone watching
from Korea.

417
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:30,736
In Korea…

418
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:34,874
Ah… Hand me my phone.

419
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,976
NEXT INSANELY GOOD SPOT

00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:39,412
