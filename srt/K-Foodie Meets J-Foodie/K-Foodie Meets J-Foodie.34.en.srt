1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,171
K-foodie meets J-foodie.

2
00:00:04,238 --> 00:00:05,272
This is insane.

00:00:05,868 --> 00:00:07,407
TODAY'S FOODIE DESTINATION

00:00:08,637 --> 00:00:10,444
TWO HOURS FROM SAPPORO

6
00:00:10,686 --> 00:00:12,600
ASAHIKAWA, A SMALL CITY IN HOKKAIDO

7
00:00:13,108 --> 00:00:14,648
COLDEST REGION IN JAPAN

8
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:16,917
TEMPERATURE DROPS TO MINUS 40 DEGREES

9
00:00:17,413 --> 00:00:20,921
HOME TO THE LARGEST ZOO IN HOKKAIDO

10
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:22,823
SEEMS FAR FROM GOURMET

11
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,494
BUT WAS CHOSEN AS A DESTINATION
ON SOLITARY GOURMET

12
00:00:29,525 --> 00:00:31,031
FOR ITS HIDDEN GEMS

13
00:00:32,127 --> 00:00:34,788
IN SEARCH OF ASAHIKAWA'S
HIDDEN INSANELY GOOD SPOT

14
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:36,670
EPISODE 33

15
00:00:36,737 --> 00:00:38,739
HEAVENLY ASAHIKAWA
AND THE TASTE OF MOM'S COOKING

16
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,610
-We went to Sapporo in Hokkaido.
-We did.

17
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:46,580
But this region is further inland.

18
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:49,516
It's Asahikawa,
right in the central region.

19
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,151
Asahikawa.

20
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,820
It gets really cold here during winter.

21
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,856
Cold during winter,
hot during summer, right?

22
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:59,426
It wasn't like that in summer,
but it has gotten hotter.

23
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:05,065
There must be a reason why
we came all the way here from Sapporo.

24
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:11,872
You see, my "food mentor" is here.

25
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,774
-Really?
-Yes.

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,545
Actually, the show Solitary Gourmet

27
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:22,716
did an Asahikawa business trip episode
more than ten years ago.

28
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:24,318
-Ten years ago?
-Yes.

29
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:28,922
That's how I got to know her,
she was working as a coordinator

30
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:31,525
introducing local restaurants.

31
00:01:32,288 --> 00:01:35,662
IN THE 2016 SOLITARY GOURMET
ASAHIKAWA BUSINESS TRIP EPISODE

32
00:01:36,325 --> 00:01:41,501
MR. MATJJIGAE'S FOOD MENTOR
GAVE ADVICE ON ASAHIKAWA'S BEST EATERIES

33
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,737
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

34
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:45,005
HIS FOOD MENTOR

35
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:46,527
SHE ALSO MADE A SPECIAL APPEARANCE

36
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:52,245
I normally write essays

37
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,681
-about food.
-I've read them.

38
00:01:55,077 --> 00:01:57,918
MR. MATJJIGAE'S FOOD ESSAY
EATING NOTES

39
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:04,758
I always ask her
to draw food illustrations for the essays.

40
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:06,593
She's an illustrator

41
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,564
who makes the food look even better
than it does in real life.

42
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,199
Welcome.

43
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,868
-Welcome.
-Ms. Michiko Abe.

44
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:16,770
-Hello.
-Hello.

45
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:18,299
-Come stand in the middle.
-The middle?

46
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:19,773
I'm in between you two.

47
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,075
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

48
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,410
We're two giants.

49
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:24,978
We're at Asahikawa.

50
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:27,948
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

51
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,716
I'm Sung Si-kyung.

52
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:32,753
-I know.
-Thank you.

53
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,023
Aren't you from Kushiro,
in eastern Hokkaido?

54
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,257
Yes, that's right.

55
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,126
Then when did you move to Asahikawa?

56
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:40,694
When I was 18.

57
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:43,730
-It's been almost 30 years now.
-I see.

58
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:47,934
Anyway, I don't think there's anyone
who can draw food illustrations

59
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,470
as well as her.

60
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,039
You're too kind.

61
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,840
Just looking at her drawings
makes me hungry.

62
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:54,841
RAMEN

63
00:02:55,245 --> 00:02:57,644
RICE BALL

64
00:02:58,207 --> 00:03:00,213
CRAB CREAM CROQUETTE

65
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,983
So if she chooses a restaurant,

66
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,987
I'm sure it will be amazing.

67
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:10,157
So where are we going today?

68
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:13,460
It's a place that makes you
instinctively say, "I'm back,"

69
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:16,196
and makes everyone else
want to say it too.

70
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:17,764
It's an obanzai restaurant.

71
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:24,438
I believe the word obanzai
originally comes from Kyoto,

72
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:28,909
referring to everyday home cooking.

73
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:31,912
In other words, the taste of home.

74
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,447
I love it.

75
00:03:34,585 --> 00:03:40,641
OBANZAI
SIMPLE SETS OF HOME-STYLE SIDE DISHES

76
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,424
I've often seen phrases like

77
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:47,227
"I'm back" or "welcome back"
in movies and dramas,

78
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:49,796
and they have a really good vibe to them.

79
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:50,931
She's a boozer.

80
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,567
-So glad to meet you.
-Hello.

81
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:57,804
-Hello.
-She loves to drink.

82
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:58,939
-Right.
-I see.

83
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,007
-She seems like a nice person.
-I am.

84
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,009
I've always been lonely.

85
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,312
I've seen the show,
and you looked happy drinking alone.

86
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,147
No. That's not the case.

87
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:10,117
Please recommend a place
where we can drink.

88
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,652
-Maybe just a little, then?
-I'm already thirsty.

89
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,521
Right? You know that feeling.

90
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,622
Let's go.

91
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:17,124
She's the best.

92
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,425
I like her already.

93
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:20,994
-We need a fizzy drink to start with.
-Exactly.

94
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:22,362
-A fizzy barley drink.
-Yes.

95
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,296
BEER

96
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,098
Then we'll have a drink made with rice.

97
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:26,099
SAKE

98
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,234
Already…

99
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,969
Let's enjoy ourselves.

100
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,270
We're here.

101
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:31,605
Nice.

102
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:35,475
Koreans probably
wouldn't dare enter this place

103
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,144
unless someone recommended it.

104
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,379
You just can't imagine
what kind of place it is.

105
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:42,115
But you can look inside through here.

106
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:44,584
Then let's go in with that
"I'm back" vibe.

107
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,653
-I'm back.
-Nice to meet you.

108
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,922
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

109
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:50,690
-Excuse us.
-Excuse us.

110
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,259
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

111
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:55,061
-Hello. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

112
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:59,132
I'm Yutaka Matsushige, and this is
Sung Si-kyung, a famous singer from Korea.

113
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,802
-I'm a boozer.
-You are?

114
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,203
That's great.

115
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,285
I don't drink alcohol,

116
00:05:06,385 --> 00:05:08,608
but when it comes to delicious food,
I just can't resist.

117
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,611
-I can tell this place is good.
-Already?

118
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:14,748
What an amazing shop.

119
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,752
A SMALL HOME-STYLE RESTAURANT
IN ASAHIKAWA

120
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,387
DRAWING BY MS. ABE

121
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:24,558
TODAY'S INSANELY GOOD SPOT, YURURI

122
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,593
RECOMMENDED BY MS. ABE

123
00:05:28,123 --> 00:05:31,398
A SPOT FOR AUTHENTIC JAPANESE HOME COOKING

124
00:05:32,261 --> 00:05:37,024
ARTWORK BY MS. ABE CAN BE FOUND
THROUGHOUT THE SHOP

125
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:41,775
What's the seating capacity here?

126
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:46,079
There are six seats at the counter
and small tables for eight,

127
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:47,581
so a total of 14.

128
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,949
THIS IS INSANE
JJAN

129
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,952
This place is nice.

130
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:55,655
It is nice.

131
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:57,557
I'm glad to hear that.

132
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,727
-Shall we order something to drink?
-Yes.

133
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:02,596
They only serve beer in small glasses.

134
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,865
This is perfect for me.

135
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,868
Big glasses hurt your shoulder
while the small glass--

136
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:10,070
Don't drink until your shoulder hurts.

137
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,072
Our only muscles are in our shoulders.

138
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,975
Right. All for beer.

139
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,043
-I guess you can work out with beer.
-Of course.

140
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,979
We have to drink quickly.

141
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,983
-Do you have non-alcoholic beer?
-We do.

142
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,218
-I'll take one, please.
-Sure.

143
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:27,354
-It's two against one today.
-You're in the middle.

144
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,889
Let's merge.

145
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:37,330
In the past,
Hokkaido was a barren land for sake.

146
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,331
I see.

147
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,634
But now,
Hokkaido rice is the most delicious.

148
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,335
It's incredible.

149
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,472
That's why sake made

150
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:51,044
with Hokkaido rice…

151
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,880
has recently become much better.

152
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:55,849
-Right?
-Right.

153
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,251
"Whisper of the Wind." That's a nice name.

154
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,320
It was named by the owner
of Tokushaku Sanshiro,

155
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:03,023
-a Solitary Gourmet filming location.
-Really?

156
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,926
-I'd like to hear the whisper.
-You want to hear it?

157
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:08,094
-We must try hearing that whisper.
-How fun.

158
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:12,565
"Whisper of the Wind" could even work
as the title of his next single.

159
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,135
-Let's listen to "Whisper of the Wind."
-Singing…

160
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,037
You're like a radio DJ all of a sudden.

161
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,572
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

162
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,775
Jjan!

163
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,076
One more time.

164
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:25,912
-Jjan.
-Jjan!

165
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,761
Insanely good.

166
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:46,232
It's still morning.

167
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,869
This is otoshi, simple snacks.

168
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,272
From now on, I'll be serving you
whatever I want.

169
00:07:53,268 --> 00:07:55,909
OTOSHI, FOUR DISHES
5,000 WON, 500 YEN, TABLE CHARGE INCLUDED

170
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,845
It's nikujaga, braised potatoes with meat.
What are the others?

171
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,547
Tofu with horseradish.

172
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,782
-Horseradish?
-That's horseradish.

173
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:05,819
Cucumber and zucchini pickled in beer.

174
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,320
And eggplant miso.

175
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:08,888
-Eggplant miso.
-Yes.

176
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:12,058
-Looks good.
-Eggplant miso.

177
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:13,727
Thank you for the food.

178
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:14,781
EGGPLANT MISO

179
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:29,609
It's good.

180
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,782
The eggplant is delicious.

181
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,017
That's the stuff.

182
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,318
It's the best.

183
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:43,356
It's so well grilled, it makes you think,
"Wow, Mom did a great job!"

184
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:45,592
She's really good.

185
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:51,264
She did a perfect job
controlling the heat for the eggplant.

186
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,969
-Delicious. It's really good.
-Is it?

187
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,138
Just the eggplant alone blew me away.

188
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:02,108
-This…
-She's shy.

189
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:04,978
-Amazing.
-The eggplant is insane.

190
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,312
-It's insane?
-It's insane.

191
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:08,381
That's great.

192
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:09,549
I mean…

193
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:14,287
It feels like the kind of side dish
you could have anywhere,

194
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:16,556
but she made the flavor come alive.

195
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:18,324
-It's perfect.
-It is.

196
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,060
-Nikujaga.
-Nikujaga.

197
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,494
The potatoes taste good.

198
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,363
-Potatoes here taste good.
-Hokkaido.

199
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,697
It's the best.

200
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:35,742
The butter flavor has really seeped in.

201
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,018
The otoshi is perfect for my taste.

202
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,455
I'm getting excited.

203
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,557
Give me some recommendations.

204
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:53,626
-Sure.
-I think everything will be good here.

205
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:54,794
Right.

206
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,565
I want to order a ham cutlet.

207
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,033
-Ham cutlet?
-That's what I wanted.

208
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,403
Do you like ham cutlet?

209
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,638
It's all because of you.

210
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,273
-Is that so?
-I watched Solitary Gourmet

211
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,475
-too many times.
-Really?

212
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,343
Goro loves ham cutlet.

213
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,378
So I get it every time I visit Japan.

214
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,580
It looked so good.

215
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:16,683
The ham cutlet here is thin.

216
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,118
It's thin?

217
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:21,221
I like ham cutlet
when it's thin and crispy,

218
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,357
which makes you feel like
you could eat a hundred of them.

219
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:27,393
But don't you wonder about thick ones,
the kind that makes you think,

220
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,862
"Is it okay if it's this thick?"

221
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:32,098
Personally, I end up thinking,
"You could make ten slices out of this!"

222
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:34,067
The balance with the breading
is important.

223
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,635
-You like it thin.
-I do.

224
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:38,638
When I order a ham cutlet
and get a thick one, I get disappointed.

225
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:42,509
If it's not the thin kind,

226
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:48,348
then I like the thick ones
with tartar sauce between the ham.

227
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,683
Tartar? Not cheese?

228
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,186
Ham with tartar sauce inside,

229
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:55,488
breaded, fried, and then sliced.

230
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:57,090
That's really delicious.

231
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,159
-That's…
-You're drooling.

232
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,728
-Just thinking about tartar…
-Let's order.

233
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,163
And?

234
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,464
Red sausage.

235
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,801
I didn't come all the way here
for red sausage.

236
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:11,304
-No, it's good.
-I'm sure it's good.

237
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:14,007
The cut edges are super snappy.

238
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,542
Are they octopus-shaped sausages?

239
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,244
It's not just stir-fried. The sliced parts

240
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,712
turn out extra snappy.

241
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,781
-That's what makes it so good.
-Let's order.

242
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,750
And ham and eggs.

243
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:26,519
That has nothing to do with Asahikawa.

244
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:29,422
Ham cutlet, red sausages,
and ham and eggs?

245
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,324
-What else?
-Hold on.

246
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,293
What are we even doing here?

247
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,763
You normally eat a lot of tasty--
I mean, these are also tasty…

248
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,599
-But let's get ham and eggs today.
-Ham and eggs.

249
00:11:40,186 --> 00:11:41,734
HAM CUTLET, RED SAUSAGES, HAM AND EGGS

250
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:45,138
ORDERED THREE DIFFERENT HAM DISHES

251
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:48,174
Let's see… What else?

252
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,643
Cream cheese with sanshozuke.

253
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,145
What is that?

254
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:57,483
It's eaten in inland Hokkaido
and some parts of Tohoku.

255
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,220
-You add green chili…
-Green chili peppers.

256
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:03,523
…malted rice, and soy sauce.
One sho, about 1.8 liters, each.

257
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,693
Since it's three sho in total,
it's called sanshozuke,

258
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,194
meaning "three sho pickle."

259
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,430
One sho of green chili peppers?

260
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,298
That's right.

261
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:14,400
Each ingredient is added in equal amounts.

262
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:17,670
It's not just mixed but fermented.

263
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,274
So the aroma spreads gently.

264
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:24,377
Since this one is from last year,
it'll be quite spicy.

265
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:25,778
-We'll have one.
-Okay.

266
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:30,116
Shouldn't we order more drinks?

267
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:31,651
-What would be good?
-Sake.

268
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,752
What should we get?

269
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:34,020
You have to order sake.

270
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,255
Okay.

271
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:36,756
I'll have "Whisper of the Wind."

272
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:40,059
We have to listen
to the whisper of the wind.

273
00:12:45,026 --> 00:12:47,133
SANSHOZUKE

274
00:12:47,562 --> 00:12:50,169
CREAM CHEESE

275
00:13:06,848 --> 00:13:11,411
CREAM CHEESE AND SANSHOZUKE
5,000 WON, 500 YEN

276
00:13:12,295 --> 00:13:16,362
WHISPER OF THE WIND (SAKE)
5,000 WON, 500 YEN

277
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:22,535
This is the only thing in Japan
you can actually get more of for free.

278
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:29,108
I once asked for a stronger pour
since the first one was too light,

279
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,711
-and they charged me double.
-Yes.

280
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:33,046
I see.

281
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,916
But sake is the only drink
where they give you a little extra

282
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,251
even if you order just one glass.

283
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,252
MORE SAKE IN HERE

284
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,987
I was so happy about it.

285
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,089
They pour it until it overflows.

286
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,892
I can have a glass
and enjoy a little more.

287
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,328
Go on. Let your mouth go meet it.

288
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,730
You can just let your mouth go to it.

289
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:57,603
I took a sip before you.

290
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,439
What did the wind whisper to you?

291
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,240
Whoosh.

292
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:10,950
You're right.

293
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,919
-Whoosh.
-Does it have a clean taste?

294
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:16,556
-You want to know, don't you?
-I do. Hold on.

295
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:24,797
I can smell the alcohol.

296
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,566
Then this…

297
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,234
Tell me how to eat this.

298
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:30,136
You can eat it however you want.

299
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:33,906
I take a bit of cream cheese
onto my plate,

300
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:37,910
put some sanshozuke over it,
and enjoy it little by little.

301
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,579
And this…

302
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:43,983
Looks like nikumiso, ground meat in miso.

303
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,120
Like this?

304
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,426
I can smell the spiciness
of the green chilies.

305
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:13,913
-It's good.
-It really is.

306
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,282
I'd save a little for ham and eggs.

307
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:18,651
Put some on the yolk and eat it.

308
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,757
So tasty.

309
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,994
-I think Koreans will like this.
-I see.

310
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,929
It's the perfect amount of spiciness.

311
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:31,864
Perfect amount of spiciness.

312
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,065
There are different kinds.

313
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,468
Since it completely depends on
who makes it,

314
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:37,904
the ones sold in stores
probably aren't fermented.

315
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:38,938
Really?

316
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:42,074
Some are just mixed together,
so you can taste the malted rice.

317
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,977
The spiciness lingers in your mouth.

318
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,547
Is sanshozuke only eaten in this area?

319
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:51,117
Even those living along the coast
might not know about it.

320
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:55,655
In summer, when green chilies
are in season, we start pickling them.

321
00:15:56,756 --> 00:16:00,460
If the malted rice hasn't
properly matured, it doesn't taste good.

322
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:03,896
The sticky texture
is what makes it better.

323
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,365
Sometimes people put it on tofu, too.

324
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:09,001
Isn't it a bit spicy
for the Japanese palate?

325
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:13,306
I'm fine with it, but a lot
of Japanese people probably find it spicy.

326
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,675
Still, I think
they'd enjoy this level of heat.

327
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:16,609
Right.

328
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:19,579
The spiciness lingers. It's still there.

329
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,014
I'm used to it and like it,

330
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:27,220
but at this level, my Japanese friend
would probably cry.

331
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:29,622
He'll think it's too spicy.

332
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,191
This is really good.

333
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:36,329
She made it herself,
but she can't handle the spice.

334
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,931
-I see.
-That is unfortunate.

335
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:45,538
She just keeps cooking.

336
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:48,174
Sometimes when I come in at night,
she sits over there and says,

337
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:50,109
"I'm so tired." It's really cute.

338
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:56,582
The ways cream cheese can change,
it's so versatile.

339
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:02,755
This is insane.

340
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:04,524
Insane.

341
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,760
This is insane.
We've got to save some for later.

342
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:09,495
I think it'd go well with soju.

343
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:10,863
Right.

344
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,099
It's so nice to meet you. It's like…

345
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:15,902
-Your own kind.
-I've met someone of my own kind.

346
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,703
-It's here.
-Ham cutlet…

347
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:22,608
The ham cutlet is here.

348

HAM CUTLET
4,000 WON, 400 YEN

349
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,949
-Cute.
-They're shaped like octopuses.

350
00:17:30,945 --> 00:17:34,120
RED SAUSAGE
2,000 WON, 200 YEN

351
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:35,755
We have fried eggs.

352
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:36,923
Fried eggs.

353
00:17:37,518 --> 00:17:39,545
HAM AND EGGS
4,000 WON, 400 YEN

354
00:17:40,421 --> 00:17:43,429
THREE HAM SET

355
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:45,965
This…

356
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:48,000
Do we dip it in sauce?

357
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,435
Can we have some mayo?

358
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,037
-Mayonnaise.
-Mayo!

359
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,506
Which one is Worcestershire sauce?

360
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,142
We don't have Worcestershire sauce,
only chuno sauce.

361
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,210
Chuno sauce! I'll take that.

362
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,079
Is that a Chinese-style sauce?

363
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:03,382
There's Worcestershire sauce,
which is the thinnest kind,

364
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:06,519
and then there's chuno sauce,
which is a medium-thick version.

365
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,388
-Chuno.
-Medium-thick.

366
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:11,290
Another one is tonkatsu sauce.

367
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:14,093
It is the thickest.

368
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,128
Preferences differ by region.

369
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:19,565
We people from Kyushu
like Worcestershire sauce.

370
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:21,267
The thinner one.

371
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:23,402
While here, they like chuno sauce.

372
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:38,217
I could have a hundred of these.

373
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:40,152
I'm glad you like it.

374
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,654
I could have a hundred of these.

375
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:53,199
You're getting greedy.

376
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,234
Sauce and mayo.

377
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,504
You'll be in trouble if you eat
a hundred of these like that.

378
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,679
It's good.

379
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:10,983
This is really amazing.

380
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,086
Why is this so good?

381
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,388
It's good.

382
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,894
Shake it down like this.

383
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:22,828
From the top.

384
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,296
Shake it down.

385
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,199
I know how to do it.

386
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,238
I just wish it had a lid.

387
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,174
Sorry.

388
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,121
I left some beer on purpose.

389
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,923
That's not fair!

390
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,258
I left some.

391
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:53,526
That's unfair.

392
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:59,031
-For the ham cutlet.
-For the ham cutlet.

393
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:00,499
Amazing.

394
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:11,510
It's good.

395
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,479
Do you get what I mean
about the curled-up edges?

396
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:17,917
The cut ends are snappy and bouncy.

397
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:20,553
Right. Nice catch.

398
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:21,787
That's the good part.

399
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:25,057
The smell of the crunchy part…

400
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:27,326
-Only these sausages have that smell.
-Yes.

401
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,596
Please poke some holes in the yolk.

402
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:35,234
I'm curious to know
how Koreans eat fried eggs.

403
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:36,602
It's different for everyone.

404
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:38,170
What do you normally put on eggs?

405
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,173
In Korea, we don't put soy sauce
on fried eggs.

406
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,408
Then what?

407
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:45,377
We just eat it as is or put ketchup on it.

408
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:47,980
-It's ketchup.
-That's unexpected.

409
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,216
Or just salt.

410
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:53,552
It's already salted, so we just eat it.

411
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,156
-Can I try this?
-Go ahead.

412
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,392
There we go.

413
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:03,562
I'll put some sanshozuke inside.

414
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,731
Like this.

415
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,580
It's already well-seasoned.

416
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:28,254
I get what you're talking about.

417
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:31,290
I like this.

418
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:41,600
I was wondering where
the ham was in this dish.

419
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,369
It was underneath.

420
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,539
The sanshozuke is really good.

421
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:50,276
When you put it on warm food,

422
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:53,712
the aroma becomes stronger.

423
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:57,883
The fermentation gives it
a nuttier aroma than soy sauce.

424
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,386
-It's good.
-It really is.

425
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,057
It doesn't feel like
a flavor unique to Asahikawa, though.

426
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:07,626
That's what I've been thinking.

427
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:11,730
Since the side dishes
keep coming out little by little

428
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,065
and they're incredibly delicious,

429
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:15,634
it doesn't feel like a place
you should introduce.

430
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,736
It feels like we should stay here
for a long time.

431
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:21,173
I have no choice but to keep drinking.

432
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,978
This is the kind of place where,
instead of tourists flocking in,

433
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:30,182
locals come and go daily,

434
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:32,218
always saying, "I'm back."

435
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,188
If this place were near my home,
I'd come every day.

436
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:38,524
I would, too.

437
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:42,394
Don't you want to keep this going
and eat some more?

438
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,096
Maybe an onigiri, rice ball…

439
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:45,598
Or omurice, omelet rice.

440
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:48,000
That sounds good, too.

441
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:50,035
-I'll have omurice, please.
-Okay.

442
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:53,105
What filling would be good for onigiri?

443
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:56,542
Pickled plum, dried bonito flakes,
cheese, or egg miso.

444
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:59,511
-Dried bonito flakes, please.
-Okay.

445
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:04,817
PUT DRIED BONITO FLAKES
IN THE CENTER OF THE RICE

446
00:23:06,314 --> 00:23:09,588
RUB NATURAL SALT ON HANDS

447
00:23:13,167 --> 00:23:19,239
AND SHAPE IT INTO A TRIANGLE

448
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:57,569
-Here's your onigiri and omurice.
-This?

449
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:06,178
OMURICE
5,000 WON, 550 YEN

450
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:08,347
Onigiri with bonito flakes.

451
00:24:09,343 --> 00:24:13,519
DRIED BONITO FLAKES ONIGIRI
2,000 WON, 200 YEN

452
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:16,622
Thank you for the food.

453
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:20,159
It smells so good.

454
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:23,829
The smell of the nori…

455
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,165
Crunchy.

456
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:36,842
Sometimes the onigiri orders pile up
just like in a restaurant.

457
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:42,047
They bring about four kinds of side dishes

458
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:46,418
along with onigiri up to the bar upstairs.

459
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:48,921
-Kind of like delivery.
-Yes.

460
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,123
-Sometimes they pick it up themselves.
-That's nice.

461
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:55,361
Would sake pair well with onigiri?

462
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:59,098
They're both made of rice.

463
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,399
They go well together.

464
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,637
It's a carb feast.

465
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,243
Cut it with your spoon.

466
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:13,979
Amazing.

467
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:26,258
-This is great.
-Really?

468
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:38,103
He closed his eyes.

469
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:42,107
All the memories of my 62 years

470
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:45,077
just flashed before my eyes.

471
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:46,311
Flash.

472
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,447
When I eat omurice,

473
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,617
I'm reminded of my childhood
and everything since.

474
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:54,953
This is amazing.

475
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,256
The price is too cheap.

476
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,725
If I increase the price,

477
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:01,493
my mother makes the portion bigger.

478
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:07,299
I don't know how her system works,
but she just wants to feed you a lot.

479
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:10,235
No, it's too cheap.

480
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:11,703
You need to make more profit.

481
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,506
At first, it was mini omurice curry.

482
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,707
It got bigger.

483
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:18,777
Yes, so we took the word "mini"

484
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:20,112
out of the menu.

485
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,317
This omurice is insane.

486
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:34,460
This is amazing.

487
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,661
This is insane.

488
00:26:36,662 --> 00:26:38,697
It doesn't make you go, "What the heck?"

489
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:41,400
-But it's so nice.
-The flavor seeps into you.

490
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:43,869
Some people actually drop by

491
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:47,072
just to have the omurice
in the middle of their drinking.

492
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:49,875
I would call this place

493
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:51,877
a base camp.

494
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,146
When you come to Asahikawa,

495
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:59,017
you can come here and eat something good
without a single complaint.

496
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:01,320
I can't believe it's daytime.

497
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,923
It feels like 8:45 p.m.

498
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:06,225
That's exactly how it feels.

499
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,827
I don't want to do the night shoot.

500
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:11,463
Just the two of us, then?

501
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,098
THE NEXT INSANELY GOOD SPOT

502
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:25,844
YOU CAN'T STOP ONCE YOU START

503
00:27:26,507 --> 00:27:29,348
ONE IRRESISTIBLE BITE
