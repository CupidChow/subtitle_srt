1
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:06,039
K-foodie meets J-foodie.

2
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:07,374
This is insane.

3
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:08,342
MINTEI

4
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:10,611
EPISODE 6

5
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,614
A BELOVED SPOT FOR 40 YEARS:
A LEGENDARY CHINESE RESTAURANT

6
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:20,254
-Where are we?
-We're at Shimokitazawa.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,989
SHIMOKITAZAWA

8
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,559
THE CENTER OF CULTURE AND ARTS

9
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:28,262
This is a theater called "The Suzunari."

10
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:29,830
SUZUNARI ALLEY

11
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:33,534
It's Tokyo's gateway
for aspiring theater actors.

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,068
Did you perform here as well?

13
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:37,137
I did perform multiple times.

14
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:40,374
A lot of people get into acting

15
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,309
because they want
to perform in this theater.

16
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:44,378
-They perform here.
-They have 150 seats.

17
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:47,281
Yes, it's a theater with 150 seats.

18
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,083
-And over there…
-Yes?

19
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,386
There was a small movie theater

20
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:53,954
called Cinema Shimokitazawa.

21
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:56,723
In this one-of-a-kind theater,
they often screened great films.

22
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,826
-Art films?
-Films exclusive to this theater.

23
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,762
We held some events there as well.

24
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:05,098
-Shimokitazawa used to be more crowded.
-I see.

25
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:08,969
There used to be trolleys and alleyways,

26
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,737
but now it's all underground.

27
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:14,107
And down that way, there was a boxing gym.

28
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,710
-I see.
-I used to deliver there a lot.

29
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:18,712
What do you mean by "deliver"?

30
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:20,647
You delivered food here?

31
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:23,050
Yes. I worked at a ramen shop.

32
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:27,254
It's a ramen shop called Mintei
which we're going to right now.

33
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:30,057
-So you chased your dream while working?
-Yes.

34
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,626
I wanted to perform on stage,

35
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:35,529
but making a living was hard
doing just that.

36
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:40,434
So I worked at a place
that provided meals for the staff.

37
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,169
This precinct has been here for a while.

38
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:43,570
SHIMOKITAZAWA PRECINCT

39
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:46,974
When the ramen shop made
a mistake with an order,

40
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,976
I would bring
the extra food here on the house.

41
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,044
I wanted to boast in front of the cops,

42
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,548
so I came here often.

43
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,550
-Right here.
-I see.

44
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,952
This place holds special memories for you.

45
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:03,156
The streets of Shimokitazawa
have changed a lot.

46
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,292
The scenery has changed completely.

47
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,293
-I see.
-Yes.

48
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:09,129
All the stores
that I used to go to are gone.

49
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,365
Except for that ramen shop.

50
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,100
-Is it here?
-It's here.

51
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,167
Mintei.

52
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:15,102
MINTEI

53
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,770
MINTEI, A 61-YEAR-OLD CHINESE RESTAURANT

54
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:20,974
THE RESTAURANT MATSUSHIGE
WORKED AT 40 YEARS AGO

55
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:25,278
Mintei has become a landmark
in the Shimokitazawa area.

56
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,048
What would it feel like

57
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:30,584
to come back to a ramen shop

58
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,619
you used to work at decades ago?

59
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,388
Shall we go inside?

60
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,023
Wow, this is amazing.

61
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,591
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

62
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,393
-Sorry to cause you trouble.
-It's okay.

63
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,129
-Excuse me.
-Pardon me.

64
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,598
-Come in.
-Yes, thank you.

65
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,834
-Gosh.
-This is nice.

66
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:51,738
-This place hasn't changed for 40 years.
-Wow.

67
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:53,740
This is exactly how it was back then.

68
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,676
I've never been to
a floor-seating ramen shop.

69
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:57,878
With tatami mats like this?

70
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:58,945
Yes.

71
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:02,349
This is a nice restaurant.

72
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:06,053
Miraculously, this place never changed.

73
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:12,092
-Most places get renovated after 40 years.
-Yes.

74
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:13,560
So they didn't change anything.

75
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:17,364
Even the tables are the same.

76
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:18,632
And this building…

77
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,034
-It's--
-…it's made of wood.

78
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:22,436
-Yes.
-It's traditional.

79
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,337
Nothing has changed.

80
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:26,840
Did they give you food
when you worked here?

81
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:28,542
They did. That's why I worked here.

82
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:32,746
So I ate as soon as I got to work,

83
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,182
then in the middle of the day,

84
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,117
and once more before I got off work.

85
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,585
Did you have stir-fried rice?

86
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,487
Yes, but we could eat whatever we wanted.

87
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:44,725
-That's nice.
-We would stir-fry it and eat it.

88
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:50,030
Since then, many aspiring actors

89
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:51,164
and band members

90
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,834
worked part-time here.

91
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,236
-People like that gathered around here.
-Yes.

92
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:58,739
They gathered around here

93
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:02,442
and came here to satisfy their hunger.

94
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,177
How much did you get paid?

95
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,113
It was about 600 yen per hour.

96
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,215
-How many hours?
-So 3,000 yen for five hours.

97
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:10,650
I got paid daily

98
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:13,620
and there was a bathhouse next door.

99
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,957
-A bathhouse.
-I would bathe there.

100
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:19,292
And I would spend all my money near here.

101
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:21,394
I was in my twenties.

102
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:24,631
I stayed here
from when I was 19 to 25, I think.

103
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,000
-Back then…
-So the owner…

104
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:28,034
He passed away.

105
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:28,969
-I see.
-Yes.

106
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:34,374
-Ms. Yoko's father used to own the place.
-I see.

107
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:39,246
-She's the second generation?
-Your husband owns the place now, right?

108
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:41,548
-Yes, he does.
-Yes.

109
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,284
Ms. Yoko was
a high school student back then.

110
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:45,619
-I see.
-I was a senior.

111
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,487
What was he like back then?

112
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:49,456
-What was he like?
-I haven't changed, right?

113
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,124
He hasn't.

114
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:52,559
-He was tall?
-He was tall.

115
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:53,693
And had a loud voice.

116
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,897
He was the type
who seemed more reliable

117
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,632
than the local band members.

118
00:04:58,765 --> 00:04:59,933
-Yes.
-He was diligent.

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,435
Did you know he'd become so famous?

120
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,037
I didn't.

121
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:05,605
-I…
-Were you

122
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:09,042
happy to see him on TV?

123
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:11,278
-In commercials?
-I was very happy.

124
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,647
We'd excitedly talk about
how he was on some TV show.

125
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,349
Yes.

126
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,219
Because nothing has changed,

127
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:21,888
it makes us…

128
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:23,490
Happy.

129
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:26,526
Shall we order a dish
filled with memories?

130
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,228
What would be good?

131
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:30,997
There's something called Edokko Ramen.

132
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,866
It's in a red box over here.

133
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:35,268
That's the most recommended dish
at this restaurant.

134
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,937
MOST RECOMMENDED DISH
EDOKKO RAMEN

135
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,405
Do other places have Edokko Ramen?

136
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:41,007
No, only the Utsunomiya branch has it.

137
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,176
-Then we should try it.
-Yes.

138
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:44,477
And the stir-fried rice.

139
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,447
-Which one…
-The red stir-fried rice is famous.

140
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:50,317
The rice is red?

141
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,354
RED STIR-FRIED RICE?

142
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,656
THE RED STIR-FRIED RICE IS EXCELLENT!

143
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,226
I HAVE NEVER SEEN RED RICE BEFORE

144
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:02,028
THE VISUAL IMPACT
OF THE RED STIR-FRIED RICE IS IMPRESSIVE

145
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,931
I WENT TO TRY THE FAMOUS
RED STIR-FRIED RICE

146
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:09,769
THE RED STIR-FRIED RICE IS FAMOUS
FOR ITS PHOTOS ON SOCIAL MEDIA

147
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,471
-Stir-fried rice.
-Yes.

148
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,640
-It's a must-have in Chinese restaurants.
-Yes, and…

149
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:17,277
-What about fried dumplings?
-Their dumplings…

150
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:19,512
There used to be

151
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,047
a dumpling master grandma.

152
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,782
-Her name was Hoshino Obaba.
-Right.

153
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:26,019
I even learned how to make dumplings

154
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:27,520
directly from her.

155
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:31,691
-You're still making it the same way?
-Yes.

156
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,059
Then can you make the dumplings?

157
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,227
-I can.
-Then…

158
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:36,463
-Then let's have ramen.
-Dumplings.

159
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:37,697
-And stir-fried rice.
-Yes.

160
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,332
-Those three, please.
-Okay.

161
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,767
-Okay.
-And…

162
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,136
-What about drinks?
-Drinks. Right.

163
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:44,638
-Shouldn't we have beer?
-We should.

164
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,306
-Yes.
-Then…

165
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:49,542
-I'll have carbonated barley.
-Okay.

166
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,511
I'll have a non-alcoholic beer.

167
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,513
Okay.

168
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,615
Is it okay to ask this?

169
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,151
Since when did you…

170
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:01,254
Did you want to become an actor
since you were young?

171
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,089
I originally came to Tokyo

172
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:07,027
to become a movie director.

173
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,163
-But making a movie costs a lot of money.
-Yes.

174
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,832
So I bought some film
with the money I made,

175
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,634
shot my movie,

176
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:19,013
and moved on to the next scene
when I earned enough money.

177
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:21,875
I was going to keep
making my movie like that,

178
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,743
but I couldn't afford it anymore.

179
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:29,215
-I see.
-So I gave up on becoming a director.

180
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,219
And after that,
I started to look for things

181
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,256
I could do in this industry,

182
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:38,258
so I thought of becoming an actor.

183
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:41,594
-I see.
-That's how I became a theater actor.

184
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:45,131
On the theater stage, as long as
the audience in front of you enjoys it,

185
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,766
that's enough.

186
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:51,838
And in the end,

187
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:55,442
films are also about wanting the audience

188
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:58,578
to enjoy what you've created.

189
00:07:58,645 --> 00:07:59,646
Right.

190
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:05,085
Making someone happy is my happiness.

191
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:09,322
I think that's the foundation
of film and theater.

192
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:11,925
Have you directed

193
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,827
any other films before this one?

194
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:16,029
Well, after I decided

195
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:18,631
to give up on being a director,
I didn't direct for 40 years.

196
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,433
-So this movie is…
-My first one.

197
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,335
Wow, that's…

198
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:23,870
-It's--
-Your dream came true.

199
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:26,272
If I think about it,
my dream did come true.

200
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,342
Back then, I thought
I would never direct again.

201
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:31,111
-That's nice.
-Well…

202
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:34,347
I thought, "So fate like this exists too."

203
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:35,849
It's fascinating.

204
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:39,085
My signature is there.

205
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,387
Right.

206
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:43,223
"This place was my beginning."

207
00:08:43,685 --> 00:08:47,127
THIS PLACE WAS MY BEGINNING

208
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,262
The signature on the left

209
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:52,532
belongs to Hiroto Kōmoto
from The Cro-Magnons,

210
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:55,935
who worked part-time with me
and is the music director for the film.

211
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,304
That's nice.

212
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,641
DEBUT AS A THEATER ACTOR IN 1982

213
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:04,844
30 YEARS LATER, HE GOT
HIS FIRST LEAD ROLE IN 2012

214
00:09:05,432 --> 00:09:08,314
IN 2025, HE MADE HIS DEBUT
AS A MOVIE DIRECTOR

215
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:10,917
HIS DREAM CAME TRUE AFTER 40 YEARS

216
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,318
Matsushige!

217
00:09:12,748 --> 00:09:15,842
A NOSTALGIC PLACE UNCHANGED FOR 40 YEARS

218
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,792
-Okay, then let's…
-Okay.

219
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,026
-What was…
-Jjan.

220
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,328
-Jjang.
-Jjan.

221
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,596
-Jjan.
-Yes.

222
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:25,598
Cheers.

223
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:38,978
The dumplings here
go really well with beer.

224
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,281
Yes, please let me try some.

225
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:43,116
-Try some.
-Okay.

226
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,552
-Here you go.
-The dumplings are here.

227
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:48,788
-Fried dumplings.
-These are the dumplings

228
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:50,390
you know how to make.

229
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:53,626
-Yes.
-The dumplings with decades of history.

230
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,929
It's been decades, but it hasn't changed.

231
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:56,930
-Thank you.
-No problem.

232
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,799
-This is the sauce for the dumplings.
-I see.

233
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:01,968
You can add vinegar if you want.

234
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:06,239
-I'll have vinegar with black pepper.
-I do like vinegar with black pepper.

235
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,011
This is sour.

236
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:13,847
I'll take a picture.

237
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:24,591
MMM!

238
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,764
-Does it taste the same?
-Yes, it hasn't changed.

239
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:35,301
Mintei dumplings have

240
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,637
the best balance between
the meat and vegetables.

241
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,040
-I'll start eating now.
-Go ahead.

242
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,642
It will be great with beer.

243
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,614
Didn't it just touch your nose?

244
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:49,115
No.

245
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:50,750
-It almost did.
-I see.

246
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:54,821
You ate it in one bite.

247
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:05,298
Is it good?

248
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,534
It's good.

249
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:11,504
-There are smaller dumplings these days.
-Yes.

250
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:14,207
But I like this size.

251
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:17,203
-It's very satisfying.
-Yes.

252
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,746
But it's actually not that big either.

253
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:24,184
It's good.

254
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,855
-It's done.
-I like this size.

255
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:30,256

00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,696

00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:48,474
It's chashu seasoned red.

00:11:56,211 --> 00:11:58,785
MADE WITH RED-COLORED CHASHU

266
00:11:58,918 --> 00:11:59,886
-This here.
-It's rare.

267
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:02,655
-Small chashu pieces are called chankoma.
-Okay.

268
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,058
-That's what makes it red.
-Yes.

269
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,293
-It's really red.
-It is.

270
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,566
-Try it with your eyes closed.
-Yes.

271
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:15,568
It tastes just like
the old Mintei stir-fried rice.

272
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:16,970
-The flavor?
-Yes.

273
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:18,705
-I'll try it then.
-Yes.

274
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,773
-Amazing.
-The red doesn't change the flavor.

275
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,508
It's just like normal stir-fried rice.

276
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:25,878
-Try the broth. It's good.
-Okay.

277
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,513
-Really…
-It's the broth.

278
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,183
-How is it?
-With just the stir-fried rice…

279
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,555
Stir-fried rice in Korea…

280
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,759
It's not oily

281
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,729
and it feels very healthy.

282
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:43,796
-Really?
-Stir-fried rice--

283
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:44,964
Does it feel healthy?

284
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:47,233
You feel guilty eating stir-fried rice

285
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,535
because of the oil and seasoning.

286
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,271
But this tastes light and clean.

287
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:54,741
Back in the day, when this place
closed during the holidays,

288
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,409
there was nowhere to eat outside

289
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,645
during the Lunar New Year.

290
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,380
-We didn't have convenience stores.
-Right.

291
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,548
I would take some of the chankoma

292
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,518
and make stir-fried rice at home.

293
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:07,053
-Was it big?
-I'd get this much.

294
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,054
-Big size?
-Yes.

295
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,690
If you stir-fry it with rice

296
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:12,659
you can make stir-fried rice at home.

297
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,294
I ate it throughout the Lunar New Year.

298
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,862
-It wasn't red back then?
-It wasn't.

299
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:22,201
-This is Edokko Ramen.
-Edokko Ramen.

300
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,403
Enjoy.

301
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,804

It's 880 yen with taxes.

310

-How much did it used to cost?
-About 450 yen.

311
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,496
-Was it?
-I knew right away. It was 450.

312
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,832
I don't remember.

313
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,834
-So 45…
-The dumplings…

314
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,669
Were they 400 yen?

315
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,905
-Wow.
-You have a good memory. Amazing.

316
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:01,174
I'll try the broth first.

317
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,281
-This isn't an acquired taste.
-Yes.

Everyone will like it.

319
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,720
It has a mild and balanced flavor.

320
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:17,256
Try the noodles.

321
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,093
Okay.

322
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,730

00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,231
-I am.
-Right.

324
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:26,799
I thought you would've noticed by now,

325
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,001
-from what you've seen.
-Yes.

326
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,170
He asks how it is before I take a bite.

327
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,538
-He asks me if it's good.
-Yes.

328
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,574
I want an answer right away.

329
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,043
You're eating it very strangely.

330
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,945
Just eat it.

331
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,547
-I wanted to eat it together.
-Really? You can just eat it.

332
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:42,982
Slurp it directly from the bowl.

333
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,317
-Would that be okay?
-Yes.

334
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,954
-Why would you put that back?
-Then what do I do?

335
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,822
-Just eat it.
-But…

336
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,258
-What do I do?
-Just eat it.

337
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:53,860
Just hurry up and taste it.

338
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,512
I don't know why,
but it's called Edokko Ramen.

339
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,986
Just think about what you want to eat.

340
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:24,424
Wow.

341
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:28,327
Koreans would love this.

342
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:29,829
-It's not an acquired taste.
-Really?

343
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:33,099
-But really rich tonkotsu ramen…
-Yes.

344
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:34,600
…or miso ramen

345
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,603
-that's unfamiliar can surprise Koreans.
-Right.

346
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,340
-But this is something Asians would like.
-Right.

-It just warms you through.

348
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,877
That's good.

349
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,952
-I like how thin the noodles are.
-Yes.

350
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:56,422
I'm not the biggest fan of thick noodles.

351
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,791
-I don't like thick noodles either.
-Yes.

352
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,527
When I first came to Tokyo, the ramen…

353
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:02,929
-Tokyo ramen is like that.
-Yes.

354
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,498
Most of them had thick noodles.
Yours were always thin, right?

355
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:06,566
Yes.

356
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,234
The noodles are thin and straight.

357
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,437
It's mild yet addictive.

358
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,906
This is really good.

359
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,511
It's good.

360
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,013
The dumplings are good too.

361
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,021
-I'm not lying. It's so good.
-Yes.

362
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,723
-I like this ramen.
-You do?

363
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,892
-That's good.
-This is good ramen.

364
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:33,826
Yes.

365
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,362
This ramen is really good.

366
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,931
-It's light but pretty good.
-Yes.

367
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,200
The flavor hasn't changed in 40 years.

368
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,137
If someone who comes here solo
wants both ramen and stir-fried rice,

369
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:49,342
there's a half-and-half menu
called Lajjang.

370
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:52,445
I think I'd be able to drink

371
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,514
all the broth by myself like this.

372
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:58,017
Can I do it like this?

373
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:00,920
I don't think that's necessary. The broth…

374
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:02,388
SI-KYUNG'S COMBO: RICE WITH BROTH

375
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:04,323
You can eat the rice first then the broth.

376
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:06,459
Sure.

377
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,462
Wow, this is insane. It is the best.

378
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:14,267
In Korea, we have stir-fried rice
and jjamppong.

379
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,068
If you have stir-fried rice

380
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:19,505
in the jjamppong broth,

381
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:21,173
it is out of this world.

382
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,875
But it is fattening.

383
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:24,477
Right.

384
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,747
My old manager weighed 130kg, and one day

385
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,049
he called me, and I asked, "What?"

386
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:33,019
He asked me if I'd tried
stir-fried rice in jjamppong broth.

387
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,021
He told me it's really good.

388
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:36,756
-So I tried it.
-Yes.

389
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:37,757
I gained about 8kg.

390
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,025
-You gained weight?
-Oh, no.

391
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,827
-It's addictive.
-It must be good.

392
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,362
I don't know why,

393
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,500
-but the oiliness of the fried rice…
-Yes.

394
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:51,103
-…it spreads more as it gets hotter.
-Right.

395
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,205
-Like a flower blooming.
-Yes.

396
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:57,109
-So stir-fried rice with broth is okay.
-I see.

397
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:00,146
-But it's fattening.
-That's not good.

398
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:04,083
Why don't we invite the film crew

399
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,652
to have dinner here

400
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,322
since we're at a restaurant
I used to work at?

401
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,157
-That would be nice.
-Right?

402
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:13,125
There are a lot of other dishes.

403
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:16,128
-Let's all eat here together.
-Okay.

404
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:17,129
-Good idea.
-Right?

405
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,066
Can you wear the uniform
and serve us like the old days?

406
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,234
-Shall I roll up my sleeves?
-Really?

407
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,070
-Shall I?
-That would be nice!

408
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:25,438
Then I'll serve.

409
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:28,708
He said he'll serve the food
for everyone here.

410
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,946
-I will serve.
-That would be the best.

411
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:37,216
Mr. Matjjigae will be serving us food.

412
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,584
-Come on in.
-Okay.

413
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,860
You seem like the owner,
not a part-time worker.

414
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,762
-Me?
-You look cool.

415
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,532
MR. MATJJIGAE'S DUTIES

Excuse me.

No, no.

418
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,605
You don't need to cheer for a part-timer.

419
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:02,008
The hourly wage is 600 yen.

420
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,943
-It's 600 yen.
-The hourly wage is 600 yen.

Vinegar and soy sauce together is good.

424
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,483
Vinegar with black pepper is also good.

425
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:14,387
Have some. You can only have it at Mintei.

426
00:19:14,582 --> 00:19:15,721
3. TAKING CARE OF SI-KYUNG

427
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:18,057
You can't do that here, sir.
What do you need?

428
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:20,026
-I'm also working.
-Oh, you're working.

429
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:20,993
It's not…

430
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,148
SI-KYUNG ALSO HELPS

431
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:23,129
Two bottles of beer.

432
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,232
What?

433
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:28,668
Mr. Matjjigae.

434
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,803
-You forgot the spoons.
-I forgot.

435
00:19:31,808 --> 00:19:32,838

-It's the best.

446
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:56,095
-Let me know if you need anything.
-Thank you.

447
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:59,165
Is there anything else you'd like to eat?

448
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,266
Does anyone need dumplings?

449
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,400
-We'd like a serving.
-Four.

450
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,569
Mr. Matjjigae, shouldn't you take a break?

451
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,204
You should take a break.

452
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,339
It's okay.

453
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:09,809
I'm fine.

454
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,211
-I'm comfortable here.
-He's comfortable.

455
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,780
When I used to work part-time,

456
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:17,450
eating over there felt uncomfortable.

457
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:23,122
Thank you for coming
all the way to Japan from Korea.

458
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:26,792
I had a nice time thanks to you.
Thank you.

459
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:30,496
He's grateful you came to Japan
and he had a nice time.

460
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:33,632
I'm curious what I will get in Korea

461
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,802
and what Si-kyung will treat me to.

462
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,771
He's curious what food
he'll get to have in Korea

463
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:42,308
and what food I will treat him to.

464
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,844
To the success of K-foodie meets J-foodie.

465
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,945

MR. MATSUSHIGE UPLOADED A NEW POST

Let's start the Korean episode.

485
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,119

486
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,854

This place has the best naengmyeon.

489

INSANE PYEONGYANG NAENGMYEON

490
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:36,195
He likes gopchang,
so we must have grilled gopchang.

491
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:37,563
INSANELY GOOD GOPCHANG SPOT

492
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:39,832
REVEALING SI-KYUNG'S INSANELY GOOD SPOTS

493
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:41,634
Japanese people would love this.

494
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,502
You have to try this.

495
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:45,137
It's so good that you'll pass out.

496
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,773
It's good.

497
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:50,543
It's like there's
a meat switch in my brain.

498
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:52,344
It's good. It's really good.

499
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:54,480
-It's delicious.
-Yes!

500
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,115
I was worried he might not enjoy it.

501
00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:57,850
I can't stop eating.

502
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:59,485
My stomach just keeps expanding.

503
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,120
It's insane.

504
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:02,922
You have to wrap the meat up like this.

505
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:04,824
-Open wide.
-You think I'll do that?

506
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:09,762
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

507
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:11,897

00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:15,879
-Si-kyung.
-Yes?

510
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:20,940
It's delicious.
