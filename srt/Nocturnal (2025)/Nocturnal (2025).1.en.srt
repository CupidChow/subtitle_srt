00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,000
What the hell?

5
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,625
The fuck, man.

6
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,708
Go after him.

7
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,083
Son of a bitch.

8
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,041
OSLO KARAOKE

9
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,875
Wait a minute.

10
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,791
Isn't this Moon-young's karaoke?

11
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,625
That must've been Seok-tae.

12
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:58,375
He probably got high somewhere.

13
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:01,958
So, should we fuck him up today?

14
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:05,541
Not today, let's do it another day.

15
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,875
Goddamn bastard…

It's raining, get your laundry!

YOU HAVE A NEW VOICE MESSAGE
PRESS CALL BUTTON TO LISTEN

20
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:10,875
Min-tae, I think I fucked up.

21
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,875
Come home.

22
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,458
Fucking moron…

23
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:52,583
You made us work, so pay up!

24
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,583
It's already been months!

25
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,875
How can they stiff pay
in this day and age?

26
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,583
Get the boss out here!

27
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,375
I think they'll pay this time,
please go back home.

28
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:10,625
There he is!

29
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,333
So many of you are here.

30
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,250
Gents!

31
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:20,208
It's a cold day, why are you
causing a scene so early?

32
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,875
If we got paid on time, would we be here?

33
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:23,958
Can't you tell?

34
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,083
Do you know how much you owe us?

35
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:29,208
I don't know, how should I know that?

36
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,833
We can't pay right now!

37
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:37,625
Go home and wait, I'll call you, okay?

38
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,250
Who the fuck are you?

39
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,666
Hey.

40
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,125
Don't fuck around.

41
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,375
Pay me half of what you owe.

42
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,000
Got it?

43
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,791
I'll leave it up to you, chief.

44
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:26,750
Yes, sir.

NOT A LOT OF WORK THIS MONTH,
SENT YOU HALF

49
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:14,083
AND SEOK-TAE IS NOT ANSWERING HIS PHONE

50
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,583
I'll give you three days.

51
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,875
I don't care about anything,

52
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,375
just grab the guy
who was with the CEO's son.

53
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,500
We'll get something out of him.

54
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:36,166
He could've tried to kill him,
or maybe something else.

55
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,958
Three days won't be enough,
I'm short-staffed too.

56
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,791
Capt. Park.

57
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:46,416
The son of a powerful exec
got knifed and is in a coma,

58
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,708
crime scene's full of dope and needles,

59
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:55,041
we have to take care of this
before it leaks,

60
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:59,375
if this goes upstairs,
we'll have to clean up the mess.

61
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,666
Who's he?

62
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,041
Bae Seok-tae, a local gangster,

63
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,958
he was one of Chang-mo Clan's boys.

64
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,416
He was likely with
the CEO's son at the time.

65
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,625
Yeah?

66
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:20,000
If we grab Bae Seok-tae,
we may get something.

67
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,500
CHA MOON-YOUNG

68
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,333
Any family?

69
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,375
He wasn't married
but he lived with a woman.

70
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,166
She's not reachable either?

71
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:45,333
Intentionally or not,
she's not answering her phone.

72
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,458
His brother had a prior?

73
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:49,833
His name is Bae Min-tae,

74
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:53,041
he was also part of the Chang-mo Clan,

75
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,500
but looks like he got out of it.

76
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:58,041
He wanted a clean slate?

77
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,458
I'm not sure about that…

78
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:04,708
But after his release,
he stopped coming around.

79
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,125
Why was he locked up?

80
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:11,291
What's funny is that,

81
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,625
he fucked up a guy
who stabbed Bae Seok-tae.

82
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:18,583
He avenged his brother's
attacker and went to jail?

83
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,416
I heard the younger one was a roughneck,

84
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,708
but Bae Min-tae was
doing well for himself.

85
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,583
The younger one shits,
and the older one wipes.

86
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,166
Beautiful.

87
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,791
Moon-young.

88
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,625
I don't know what to say about her.

89
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,208
She must be connected
to the man who lived here.

90
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,083
His wife, probably.

91
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,583
Or maybe not.

92
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,333
When was the last time
you saw either of them?

93
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,541
Well,

94
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,500
I rarely got to see them…

NOCTURNAL

96
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,916
By the way, did something happen to her?

97
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,750
No, it's nothing like that.

98
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,708
Why? Would something happen to her?

99
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:16,041
He'd constantly beat her,
like he owned her.

100
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,375
He was brandishing a knife recently.

101
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,333
He sounds like a bad guy.

102
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:27,291
He's a scoundrel for sure.

103
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,583
She actually had a kid,

104
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,666
but he was so bad to her that

105
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:36,000
she left the kid with a friend
for the sake of the youngster.

106
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,666
Did anyone come by?

107
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,916
Someone sure did.

108
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,125
Who?

109
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:45,750
His brother came by just now.

110
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,583
Why didn't you tell us that earlier?

111
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,166
When else should I tell you?

112
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:57,791
Sir.

113
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,375
Isn't that Min-tae?

114
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,375
Still working in construction?

115
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:23,666
Yeah.

116
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:28,583
Is Seok-tae having a tough time lately?

117
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,583
Seok-tae?

118
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:31,958
What about him?

119
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:34,000
I can't reach that idiot.

120
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,958
He ghosted us one too many times.

121
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,541
Probably hiding out
after causing some trouble.

122
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,875
No problems with Kang-ho Clan lately?

123
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,000
Buddy.

124
00:15:57,083 --> 00:16:01,125
You're not with us anymore,

125
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,541
if you suddenly drop in
and interrogate me,

126
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,458
should I spill my guts out to you
in vivid detail?

127
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,541
I'll go see Kang-ho's boys
and hear them out.

128
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:17,541
Things are bad around here,

129
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:22,708
it won't do anyone any good,
if you mess with Kang-ho's boys.

130
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,375
Stay put and wait it out,
I'll look into it myself.

131
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:32,166
I didn't come here
to ask you for permission.

132
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,125
Yeah?

133
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,250
Then why are you here?

134
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,500
I thought you should know.

135
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,875
That's it, Min-tae.

136
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:55,125
That's how you should work,
sharing and helping each other.

137
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:59,250
You can't head butt whoever
on a whim like before.

138
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:03,541
It's time for you to live a proper life.

139
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,083
Am I right?

140
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,875
Sure, understood.

141
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,250
Good.

142
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:15,625
Do well.

143
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,000
Sir.

144
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,125
Sir!

145
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:37,333
Stop poking around looking for Seok-tae.

146
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:40,208
It'll be difficult to clean up your shit.

147
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,916
What did you say? I didn't hear you.

148
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:49,958
Honestly, we've been cleaning
after Seok-tae's troubles,

149
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,750
and if you cause more stink,
who's gonna clean up that mess?

150
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:56,708
All right.

151
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,250
Fucking asshole.

152
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,250
Goddammit.

153
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,875
You guys head back.

154
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,166
What's wrong, sir?

155
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,791
Just go.

156
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,041
Yes, sir.

157
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,583
Young-seob, get over here.

158
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:51,541
I'll just stay over here,
I can hear you clearly.

159
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,791
Get over here, I can't hear very well.

160
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,875
Sir…

161
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:13,458
You know you shouldn't
be in my neck of the woods.

162
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:16,375
It doesn't matter, I'm a civilian now.

163
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,083
What brings you here?

164
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,416
Have you seen Seok-tae recently?

165
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:26,875
Seok-tae?

166
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:34,875
Yeah, I saw him in front of
of Cha Moon-young's karaoke

167
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,041
a few days ago.

168
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,250
-You sure?
-Yeah.

169
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,416
Where's Kang-ho?

170
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,250
Don't look for him.

171
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:50,208
He's got a lot on his plate.

172
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:53,041
He'll only get worked up seeing your face.

173
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:58,208
All right, I get it.

174
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:04,000
Bud, I'll be back tomorrow,

175
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,416
so let him know.

176
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,416
What a fucking poser…

177
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,458
Don't go too far, Mang-chi!

178
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,625
Blood was discovered
at Cha Moon-young's karaoke.

179
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:46,541
Do I need to dye my hair black?

180
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,375
Do whatever.

181
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,125
Should I cut it short?

182
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,083
I hope I'm doing the right thing…

183
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:57,833
As you were.

184
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,500
So, you're Seok-tae.

185
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:08,666
You seem like a handful.

186
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:10,291
Greet him.

187
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,166
Hello, I'm Bae Seok-tae.

188
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,125
Okay, sit, sit.

189
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:25,208
What are you good at?

190
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:27,875
Well, I…

191
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:31,166
I'll take him around,
and see what he's good at.

192
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:35,458
Very well, do it.

193
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:37,625
I'll do my best, sir.

194
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:38,541
Sure.

195
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:50,583
Do you know Cha Moon-young?
She lived with your brother.

196
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:54,208
Do you know?

197
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:57,250
Do you know Cha Moon-young?

198
00:22:57,333 --> 00:23:01,541
I heard you were recently released,
were you in Chungju Pen?

199
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,625
Yes, why?

200
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:08,208
We understand what you're going through,

201
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:11,666
and we can only wrap it up
with your cooperation.

202
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:14,583
Yes, of course.

203
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,708
I'm asking just in case,

204
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:21,750
you're not thinking of
doing something in retribution?

205
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:28,375
From what I hear,
you've caused problems in the past.

206
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:31,416
If you're done with questions,
I'll be out of your way.

207
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:54,666
Byung-gyu.

208
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,833
Yes, sir?

209
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:59,000
Work with me for a few days.

210
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:02,583
I'm really sorry…

211
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:07,208
If the boss finds out,
he won't be too happy.

212
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:10,875
Things aren't what they used to be.

213
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:14,208
Why?

214
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:17,583
He told you to shun me?

215
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:19,791
No, it's not like that.

216
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:29,666
Is this Chang-mo's joint too?

217
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:31,958
Yes.

218
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:34,250
Is he taking good care of you?

219
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:41,125
All right.

220
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:43,666
Sir.

221
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:47,500
Is Seok-tae really dead?

222
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:09,291
Young-seob, is Kang-ho here?

223
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:15,958
What's with you? No means no.

224
00:25:19,291 --> 00:25:21,083
Come on…

225
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:29,625
Do you take me for a fool
because I played nice?

226
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:31,375
Young-seob.

227
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,625
This is where it happened?

228
00:27:07,708 --> 00:27:11,083
The main event happened here.

229
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:13,208
And then…

230
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:16,750
some blood was spilled
while moving the body.

231
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:20,208
Was this premeditated
or a spur of the moment?

232
00:27:20,291 --> 00:27:24,833
It's too clean to be a spur of the moment,

233
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:29,291
but too clumsy to be premeditated.

234
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:31,416
What the hell are you saying?

235
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,000
I'm not sure yet.

236
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:39,541
Why are you here?

237
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:44,625
Sir, while digging into
Cha's financial records

238
00:27:44,708 --> 00:27:48,666
I found out that her account
was emptied after Bae's death.

239
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,833
You sure?

240
00:27:49,916 --> 00:27:52,666
There's not a penny left.

241
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,958
Security cam?

242
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:55,333
It's been smashed.

243
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:58,666
Someone went nuts on it,
it can't be restored.

244
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:06,583
And Det. Min will replace me from here on.

245
00:28:06,666 --> 00:28:08,625
Why'd narcos get involved in this?

246
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:12,000
The chief wanted us to
cooperate with narcos.

247
00:28:12,083 --> 00:28:17,125
There's a ton of pressure
from above to take care of this.

248
00:28:17,208 --> 00:28:20,291
What about Cha's last known contact?

249
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:23,250
I filled in Det. Min with that…

250
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:24,708
-Det. Min?
-Yes?

251
00:28:24,791 --> 00:28:25,708
What's going on with that?

252
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:31,375
"Sound of his footsteps
in the distance feels like,"

253
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:33,875
"Getting needle poked all over my body."

254
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:36,791
"Narrowing distance between him"

255
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:41,166
"Means torturous moments
with him are near."

256
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:44,541
"Like a revolving door of ruthless dicks,"

257
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:48,958
"They are always within my reach,
gnawing my life away."

258
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:50,500
"Bastards…"

259
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,500
BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF NOCTURNAL
LECTURE BY KANG HO-RYUNG

260
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:23,125
Do you know Cha Moon-young?

261
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:24,083
NOCTURNAL

262
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,333
What's going on?

263
00:29:26,416 --> 00:29:28,958
We checked her call logs,

264
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:32,500
and you were the last person she called.

265
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:34,958
I haven't spoken to her recently.

266
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:38,166
Yes, the call never connected,

267
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:42,250
she called but you didn't pick up.

268
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:47,458
What do you want to hear from me?

269
00:29:47,541 --> 00:29:51,583
We're here because
her live-in boyfriend is dead,

270
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:52,916
and she's not reachable.

271
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,208
We were wondering if you
contacted her or met her recently.

272
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:05,125
No, not since last year.

273
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:06,583
Is that so?

274
00:30:08,583 --> 00:30:10,333
What is your relation to her?

275
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:16,458
We met at the cultural center.

276
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:21,250
She attended a few of my lectures.

277
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:26,541
And then?

278
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:29,250
What?

279
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:34,916
She attended a few lectures,
anything else afterwards?

280
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:40,583
Do I need to disclose
all my private events?

281
00:30:40,666 --> 00:30:43,875
No, you don't need to tell me everything.

282
00:30:48,666 --> 00:30:49,916
Very well.

283
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,041
If we have any more questions,
we'll give you a call.

284
00:31:19,791 --> 00:31:21,250
Sir.

285
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:25,291
Having a nice meal after
making all that mess?

286
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:30,958
Some of my boys are
cripples because of you.

287
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:40,541
Kang-ho.

288
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,250
Where the hell do you get those?

289
00:31:52,958 --> 00:31:55,291
I'm not here to shoot shit.

290
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,458
Tell me, why did you do it?

291
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,833
Seok-tae's dead.

292
00:32:01,916 --> 00:32:04,583
You serious? Why?

293
00:32:04,666 --> 00:32:07,500
Your turn to explain yourself.

294
00:32:17,958 --> 00:32:21,666
I think you're barking up
the wrong tree this time.

295
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:25,875
Go ask Moon-young instead of me.

NEW EMAIL

299
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:15,541
NO TITLE

300
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:17,458
NO NAME

301
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:22,083
You can take it slow.

302
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:28,333
When did you first thought about
wanting to kill him?

303
00:33:29,666 --> 00:33:31,500
When he's sleeping,

304
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:35,791
I have those thoughts
as I stare at his face.

305
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:41,375
'I wish his eyes were shut for good,'

306
00:33:41,458 --> 00:33:44,041
'I wish he didn't move anymore.'

307
00:33:46,416 --> 00:33:48,916
I ran away from home once,

308
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,916
but he found me in the end.

309
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,958
That's when I thought,

310
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:57,166
'I can only escape from here
once he's dead,'

311
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:01,708
'I wish he was dead.'

312
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,958
'I really wish he was dead.'

313
00:34:08,416 --> 00:34:12,291
Or 'I hope someone would kill him.'

314
00:34:12,916 --> 00:34:17,916
Jae-cheol, I'm forwarding you
an email, track its IP for me.

315
00:34:24,916 --> 00:34:29,541
OSLO KARAOKE

316
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:36,541
Go check it out.

317
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:37,875
Yes, sir.

318
00:35:07,666 --> 00:35:09,333
Seok-tae was likely killed at the karaoke.

319
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,125
Cops are suspecting Moon-young.

320
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:18,875
Shit, does that make sense?

321
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,041
-Christ…
-Welcome.

322
00:35:30,791 --> 00:35:33,125
-What'd you like?
-1 regular meal, please.

323
00:35:33,916 --> 00:35:35,166
1 regular in the hall.

324
00:35:37,916 --> 00:35:42,166
Do you know the woman
who worked at the karaoke?

325
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:44,250
Who?

326
00:35:45,291 --> 00:35:47,416
Her name is Cha Moon-young.

327
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:53,041
I'm not sure.

328
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:10,750
Excuse me!

329
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:18,375
This way, please…

330
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:27,375
You're that writer, right?

331
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:29,375
Yes.

332
00:36:29,458 --> 00:36:31,583
Moon-young told me about you.

333
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,416
What happened to her?

334
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:42,500
I don't know exactly what happened.

335
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:33,333
CITY GAS
PAYMENT OVERDUE

336
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:04,791
NOCTURNAL

337
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,875
Continue what you were doing.

338
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:20,958
I'm sorry.

339
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:25,458
My friend lives here,
but I couldn't reach her.

340
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:33,666
How do you know Moon-young?

341
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:40,041
Well, we got to know each other somehow…

342
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:41,958
Goddamn…

343
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:44,625
How the hell do you know her?

344
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:48,291
Who are you?

345
00:38:50,958 --> 00:38:52,041
What's this?

346
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,958
Why are you here?

347
00:38:57,541 --> 00:38:58,375
I, uh…

348
00:39:00,416 --> 00:39:01,708
Sorry for the intrusion.

349
00:39:01,791 --> 00:39:03,541
Are you kidding me?

350
00:39:04,916 --> 00:39:06,708
You were searching her things earlier!

351
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:07,875
Why did you?

352
00:39:10,375 --> 00:39:12,708
Hey! Stop!

353
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:15,375
If I asked you a question,
at least answer me!

354
00:39:15,458 --> 00:39:17,375
What… what are you doing?

355
00:39:17,458 --> 00:39:19,125
Moon-young?

356
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,666
Look, I told you it wasn't her.

357
00:39:33,208 --> 00:39:36,208
What's everyone doing here?

358
00:39:37,791 --> 00:39:39,208
Why did you enter her home?

359
00:39:40,833 --> 00:39:44,833
She wasn't reachable, so I was worried.

360
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:48,041
Even so, you know better,

361
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:49,875
how could you trespass?

362
00:39:54,541 --> 00:39:58,125
By the way, that novel you wrote,

363
00:39:58,666 --> 00:40:00,083
'Nocturnal', was it?

364
00:40:00,166 --> 00:40:02,458
Is that the right title, Det. Min?

365
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:04,416
-Yes?
-Talk about that book.

366
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:14,666
There are some similarities

367
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:19,541
between the protagonist
and Cha Moon-young.

368
00:40:22,583 --> 00:40:23,958
What similarities?

369
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:28,750
Drug addict husband dies
and the wife disappears.

370
00:40:28,833 --> 00:40:33,083
These are quite similar
to our current case,

371
00:40:33,166 --> 00:40:36,625
so we were wondering
if you did not tell us anything.

372
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:42,458
Detectives, that's utter nonsense,

373
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:46,791
if you plan on accusing me,
you should do so.

374
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:50,541
You may go.

375
00:40:51,291 --> 00:40:52,291
What?

376
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:54,333
You can leave today.

377
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:07,625
But how did you know?

378
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:10,583
That Bae Seok-tae would die?

379
00:41:12,541 --> 00:41:14,625
Isn't that how the story goes in the book?

380
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:16,333
The wife kills him, right?

381
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:31,208
You there!

382
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:34,958
Could I have a word?

383
00:41:36,541 --> 00:41:38,666
-Buddy!
-Don't touch me!

384
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:43,041
What was that about some book?

385
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,458
What's that about?

386
00:41:44,541 --> 00:41:46,208
It's just a novel.

387
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:48,708
Goddammit.

388
00:41:48,791 --> 00:41:52,708
How did you know my brother would die?

389
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:56,500
Why are you asking me
about your dead brother?

390
00:41:56,583 --> 00:41:59,375
Go ask the detectives,
I got nothing to do with it.

00:43:32,416 --> 00:43:34,000
Not you, asshole.

407
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:37,375
Sorry, sir.

00:43:38,666 --> 00:43:40,458
Kang Seung-gu.

409
00:43:41,291 --> 00:43:45,416
Seung-gu, you have attended
the writer's lecture, right?

410
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:48,083
Which writer…

411
00:43:48,166 --> 00:43:50,666
The one that wrote that book, Nocturnal.

412
00:43:51,708 --> 00:43:52,541
Yes…

413
00:43:53,916 --> 00:43:56,250
During that lecture,

414
00:43:57,666 --> 00:44:02,125
did he ever mention that
it's based on his experience,

415
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:03,583
or that he heard it?

416
00:44:04,833 --> 00:44:07,208
It's a bit complicated…

417
00:44:09,041 --> 00:44:12,208
Keep it short, then, they're busy men.

418
00:44:12,291 --> 00:44:13,125
Shut up!

419
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:27,291
I don't know where to begin,

420
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:35,000
he did talk about the story
as if it happened to him.

421
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:45,125
The protagonist had
a difficult life in the book,

422
00:44:45,833 --> 00:44:48,458
she lived with an addict,

423
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,791
who always threatened to kill her.

424
00:44:54,666 --> 00:44:59,708
When she left home, his brother found her.

425
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:01,166
You take me for a fool?!

426
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:04,041
I said no!

427
00:45:05,041 --> 00:45:07,791
-Shut the fuck up.
-Oh man…

428
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:12,916
You think I wouldn't find out
that you're fucking around?

429
00:45:13,958 --> 00:45:15,750
Just stop it,

430
00:45:16,541 --> 00:45:19,000
you're suffocating me!

431
00:45:21,458 --> 00:45:23,958
I won't kill you, bitch!

432
00:45:25,833 --> 00:45:29,958
You wish I was dead, right?

433
00:45:30,041 --> 00:45:34,166
Yeah! I wish you were, you son of a bitch!

00:47:20,583 --> 00:47:22,541
Don't you recognize me?

453
00:47:22,625 --> 00:47:24,583
You wrote about me.

00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:30,208
"She had a younger brother
who hadn't fully grown up."

It was you, wasn't it?

456
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:35,958
That Bae Seok-tae had to die.

457
00:47:38,458 --> 00:47:42,416
That's what Moon-young said?
That I told her to kill him?

458
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:45,458
No, you didn't tell her to kill.

459
00:47:47,208 --> 00:47:51,625
There's such a thing as
'giving false hope.'

460

everything will work out.'

462
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:07,250
You've given my sister a seed of hope,

463
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:09,791
and she stupidly planted it.

464
00:48:12,875 --> 00:48:14,541

I mean,

467
00:48:19,375 --> 00:48:20,750
where is Moon-young now?

468
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:24,583
You all ignored her when she needed help…

469
00:48:26,458 --> 00:48:28,458
why is everyone looking for her now?

470
00:48:33,375 --> 00:48:34,708

475
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,291
Have a drink.

476
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:13,291
Where's your sister?

477
00:50:15,958 --> 00:50:16,916
I don't know.

478
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:27,625
I know she's tormented over this,

479
00:50:27,708 --> 00:50:30,875
and I know you resented Seok-tae,

480
00:50:34,375 --> 00:50:36,416
but even so,

481
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:39,041
she shouldn't have done that
to him, am I right?

482
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:41,875
How would I feel?

483
00:50:41,958 --> 00:50:44,166
Isn't he better off dead?

484
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:47,875
He'd have sucked her dry if he was alive…

485
00:50:58,458 --> 00:51:01,041
Look, this is Su-min, right?

486
00:51:02,291 --> 00:51:03,166
Where is she?

487
00:51:09,125 --> 00:51:12,666
All right, don't tell me.

488
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,583

She'll be happy if you just let her be!

Even now, when he's high with drugs,

Yes.

529
01:00:05,291 --> 01:00:10,541
If she could go back in time,
when would that be?

I understand, boss.

He has a brother named Bae Min-tae,

541
01:00:54,791 --> 01:00:58,750
if something happens
to Seok-tae, he won't stay put.

542
01:00:58,833 --> 01:01:01,166
That man will kill for his brother.

543
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:03,791
So, what then?

01:01:07,625 --> 01:01:10,916
Please track locations for

find Cha Moon-young.

546
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:07,333
Sir.

547
01:02:09,375 --> 01:02:12,875
If Moon-young killed him,
what will you do?

548
01:02:17,583 --> 01:02:19,500
I'll send her to where Seok-tae is.

549
01:02:44,166 --> 01:02:45,208
Should I come with you?

550
01:02:45,291 --> 01:02:46,500
Stay put here.

551
01:02:50,375 --> 01:02:52,625
LOVER'S COFFEE SHOP

552
01:02:58,208 --> 01:02:59,375
Welcome.

553
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:15,708
What's up?

554
01:03:17,583 --> 01:03:18,916
He doesn't look like a local.

555
01:03:36,375 --> 01:03:38,291
Could you take my order?

556
01:03:52,041 --> 01:03:53,416
What can I get you?

557
01:03:54,083 --> 01:03:55,541
I don't see Moon-young around.

558
01:03:57,916 --> 01:03:58,958
Who?

559
01:04:03,458 --> 01:04:04,500
Give me a Sprite.

560
01:04:09,416 --> 01:04:12,458
Ma'am, do you know him?

561
01:04:20,416 --> 01:04:23,500
Look at you, sitting all pretty.

562
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:30,125
Why are you kicking up dust
and poking around?

563
01:04:35,125 --> 01:04:35,958
Geez…

564
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:39,500
You laugh?

565
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,375
Do you not hear me?

566
01:04:50,458 --> 01:04:51,541
Where are you from?

567
01:04:54,875 --> 01:04:55,833
Seoul?

568
01:04:56,833 --> 01:04:58,041
Walk away.

569
01:05:00,625 --> 01:05:02,791
If someone talks to you,
be a little courteous.

570
01:05:04,458 --> 01:05:05,708
Motherfucker…

571
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:07,333
What the fuck did you…

572
01:05:10,208 --> 01:05:11,208
You son of a bitch!

573
01:05:19,625 --> 01:05:20,750
Bastard…

574
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:25,583
Stay back, asshole…

575
01:06:07,291 --> 01:06:08,208
Sprite, please?

576
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,750
What in the world is going on?

577
01:06:54,791 --> 01:06:57,250
Ma'am, another Sprite, please!

578
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:04,541
MOON-YOUNG,
THAT MAN CAME TO THE SHOP

579
01:07:18,875 --> 01:07:20,083
What brings you here?

580
01:07:21,125 --> 01:07:22,375
To the farthest end of the country.

581
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,208
You're a busy man.

582
01:07:32,333 --> 01:07:33,500
To meet Moon-young?

583
01:07:39,583 --> 01:07:40,916
All right, don't talk.

584
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:47,000
In your book, she killed my brother.

585
01:07:47,083 --> 01:07:49,333
What was the reason? Why did she kill him?

586
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:53,250
Are you really oblivious,

587
01:07:54,625 --> 01:07:56,333
or just pretending to be?

588
01:07:57,166 --> 01:07:59,083
Shit, how would I know?

589
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,583
You know better.

590
01:08:08,458 --> 01:08:14,250
You know what your brother
was like and how he lived.

591
01:08:16,291 --> 01:08:17,875
That's why she wanted him dead?

592
01:08:21,291 --> 01:08:22,666
So hungry.

593
01:08:23,791 --> 01:08:28,083
Since Moon-young's back,
should we have a feast?

594
01:08:28,166 --> 01:08:31,791
What are you saying? Go mop the floor.

595
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:33,208
Why?

596
01:08:54,125 --> 01:08:55,083
Where's Moon-young?

597
01:09:00,916 --> 01:09:03,500
She's at home, my home…

598
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:27,125
CHA MOON-YOUNG

599
01:09:56,583 --> 01:09:57,666
Where's your boss' home?

600
01:09:59,291 --> 01:10:00,500
Where is it?!

601
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:04,666
Upstairs…

602
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:12,416
Yes, boss.

603
01:10:13,625 --> 01:10:14,958
I think we found her.

604
01:10:21,833 --> 01:10:22,666
Sir.

605
01:10:24,166 --> 01:10:25,458
We may have found her.

606
01:10:32,958 --> 01:10:34,666
Byung-gyu.

607
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:37,541
Madame, what brings you here?

608
01:10:37,625 --> 01:10:39,791
I didn't order coffee.

609
01:10:48,958 --> 01:10:51,208
Mister, who are you?

610
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:55,666
Wrong house, I guess.

611
01:10:59,916 --> 01:11:00,916
Is this your home?

612
01:11:04,375 --> 01:11:07,916
It is indeed, can I help you?

613
01:11:09,166 --> 01:11:10,541
Fucking hell…

614
01:11:17,541 --> 01:11:20,250
I'M HEADING TO THE TERMINAL
I'LL CALL YOU FROM THERE

615
01:11:52,083 --> 01:11:52,958
Turn the car around!

616
01:11:53,041 --> 01:11:54,458
-What?
-Turn it around!

617
01:11:54,541 --> 01:11:56,166
-What is it? Who was that?
-That writer bastard.

618
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,166
Shit head…

619
01:12:14,666 --> 01:12:15,833
What the…

620
01:12:22,083 --> 01:12:24,208
Come on…

621
01:12:24,291 --> 01:12:25,500
What should I do, sir?

622
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:30,916
Could you open the door?

623
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,333
I'm not mad, let's talk.

624
01:12:33,416 --> 01:12:35,791
Open the door!

625
01:12:35,875 --> 01:12:40,500
Let me cut your throat open, so open up!

626
01:12:40,583 --> 01:12:42,875
You fucking bastard!

627
01:12:45,791 --> 01:12:47,708
Open! Open up!

628
01:12:48,416 --> 01:12:50,125
Son of a bitch!

629
01:12:50,208 --> 01:12:51,625
Let him go!

630
01:13:05,875 --> 01:13:06,875
Shit…

631
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,125
So, you think you killed Oh Ha-sung,
the son of D.K. Corp's CEO?

632
01:13:59,291 --> 01:14:00,666
Yes…

633
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:03,458
Goddamn, Seok-tae,

634
01:14:05,041 --> 01:14:06,375
we're so fucked.

635
01:14:07,875 --> 01:14:09,625
Is he really dead?

636
01:14:14,791 --> 01:14:17,750
I told you not to give him dope.

637
01:14:17,833 --> 01:14:22,333
Did I not say if his daddy finds out,
we are all fucking dead!

638
01:14:28,541 --> 01:14:31,250
So, why did you kill him?

639
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:35,541
I'm not sure if he's dead…

640
01:14:36,458 --> 01:14:37,958
Fucking bastard!

641
01:14:39,875 --> 01:14:41,541
You just said he's dead!

642
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:53,750
That fucker wanted to fuck Moon-young…

643
01:14:56,125 --> 01:14:56,958
What?

644
01:15:00,958 --> 01:15:02,000
Shit…

645
01:15:08,916 --> 01:15:10,625
D.K. MR. HAN

646
01:15:19,166 --> 01:15:20,000
Yes?

647
01:15:25,166 --> 01:15:26,000
Yes.

648
01:15:35,875 --> 01:15:37,041
I understand.

649
01:15:39,291 --> 01:15:40,125
Yes.

650
01:16:17,833 --> 01:16:18,708
Moon-young.

651
01:16:38,416 --> 01:16:39,458
Never mind.

652
01:17:10,583 --> 01:17:15,041
Have you met anyone on the way here?

653
01:18:00,041 --> 01:18:00,916
Let go.

654
01:18:41,458 --> 01:18:42,500
Close up shop.

655
01:18:46,166 --> 01:18:49,291
Did you hear me?! Close up!

656
01:19:07,625 --> 01:19:08,708
Moon-young.

657
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:11,958
What do you want to do?

658
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:20,041
Do you want to end
your miserable life here?

659
01:19:21,833 --> 01:19:23,750
Or go away and live under a rock?

660
01:19:28,083 --> 01:19:29,250
Listen carefully.

661
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:35,625
If you get caught
by the police or Min-tae,

662
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:40,458
you are as good as dead.

663
01:19:42,166 --> 01:19:45,625
Your daughter as well.

664
01:19:49,791 --> 01:19:50,625
Understand?

665
01:20:52,666 --> 01:20:53,875
Byung-gyu.

666
01:20:57,625 --> 01:20:59,375
It's Chang-mo.

667
01:21:02,166 --> 01:21:03,000
Yes.

668
01:21:04,625 --> 01:21:06,083
I understand, boss.

669
01:21:26,791 --> 01:21:32,166
The Haenam Express bound for Seoul

670
01:21:32,250 --> 01:21:34,166
is about to depart soon.

671
01:22:29,916 --> 01:22:31,291
There he is! It's that bastard!

672
01:23:02,041 --> 01:23:02,875
Moon-young!

673
01:23:15,916 --> 01:23:17,166
Byung-gyu!

674
01:23:38,583 --> 01:23:39,500
Byung-gyu!

675
01:23:41,291 --> 01:23:42,250
Hey!

676
01:23:43,166 --> 01:23:44,166
Get out, asshole!

677
01:25:10,083 --> 01:25:11,458
Don't…

678
01:25:11,541 --> 01:25:13,125
Don't follow me asshole!

679
01:25:18,541 --> 01:25:20,666
Stay away! Fucker!

680
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:31,833
Dammit…

681
01:25:55,291 --> 01:25:57,541
Get out of there.

682
01:26:04,083 --> 01:26:06,083
Get out!

683
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:12,958
-Byung-gyu…
-Sir…

684
01:26:13,041 --> 01:26:17,125
Why did you do it, tell me!

685
01:26:17,208 --> 01:26:18,875
Why?!

686
01:26:20,791 --> 01:26:22,041
I'm sorry, sir…

687
01:26:25,833 --> 01:26:27,083
I'm so sorry…

688
01:26:27,166 --> 01:26:28,875
Did Chang-mo order you?

689
01:26:31,625 --> 01:26:32,708
I'm sorry…

690
01:26:36,125 --> 01:26:37,416
I'm so sorry…

691
01:26:38,625 --> 01:26:40,000
Why did you do it?

692
01:27:26,166 --> 01:27:28,333
Just send out an APB!

693
01:28:41,166 --> 01:28:44,041
A tomorrow I've never seen

694
01:28:44,125 --> 01:28:48,916
It felt like I had everything

695
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:54,458
Living as an adult in this world

696
01:28:54,541 --> 01:28:59,000
When it sometimes feels too hard

697
01:28:59,083 --> 01:29:03,833
I call out to you

698
01:29:03,916 --> 01:29:06,666
As a friend…

699
01:30:34,833 --> 01:30:37,166
Sir, does the drink taste good?

700
01:30:38,416 --> 01:30:40,291
Would you like some more?

701
01:30:45,416 --> 01:30:46,875
Where's Chang-mo?

702
01:30:49,958 --> 01:30:53,958
Finish up and head back quietly.

703
01:33:51,625 --> 01:33:54,125
So fucking tired…

704
01:34:07,416 --> 01:34:09,375
What brings you here?

705
01:34:11,333 --> 01:34:12,708
I came to see you.

706
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:20,666
You didn't need to come so far
to see my ugly face.

707
01:34:22,333 --> 01:34:23,166
Indeed.

708
01:34:28,125 --> 01:34:28,958
Boss.

709
01:34:30,041 --> 01:34:32,166
Where are Seok-tae's legs?

710
01:34:43,916 --> 01:34:46,625
You saw his face, isn't that enough?

711
01:35:35,583 --> 01:35:37,375
D.K. MR. HAN
