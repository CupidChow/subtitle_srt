(Please call the cops if you find them.)

171
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,320
You should remove your hat.

172
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,200
It's drenched.

173
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,080
Thank you, Concubine Rong.

174
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,600
You should remove your wig.

175
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,440
I'm sure it feels disgusting.

176
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,280
Everything that we have
is given by our parents.

177
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,960
How could it be fake?

178
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,280
My hair is real too.

179
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,560
His Majesty's hair

180
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,840
is carefully conditioned with

181
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,400
18 essential oils by the maidservants.

182

these two are mental patients?)

I think the rain isn't as heavy anymore.

189

You two

190
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,480
can leave now.

191
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,480
Concubine Rong.

192
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,200
I think I should get you guys
a hair dryer.

193
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,240
Concubine Rong.

194
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,520
Concubine Rong!

195
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,600
Ah!

196
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,720
Concubine Rong!

197
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:47,920
Don't come near me!

198
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,260
Concubine Rong,

199
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,440
I'm Qin Yu.

200
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,880
I don't know
if you've forgotten about me,

201
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,080
but I've crossed thousands of miles

202
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,220
for your sake.

203
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
I came here to...

204
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,480
Don't move!

205
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,560
You two lunatics!

206
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,400
I'll call the cops on you two

207
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,600
if you come any closer!

208
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,080
Concubine Rong,

209
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,560
did you truly forget about me?

210
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,680
You two

211
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,960
are worrisome indeed.

212
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:39,600
(Please Don't Spoil Me)
Come in.

213
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,440
Why is this happening?

214
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,620
Who are you?

215
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,360
I'm IP World's librarian.

216
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,680
They come from

217
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,520
your novel.

218
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,440
One of them is the male lead, Qin Yu.

219
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,000
The other one is his attendant,
Li Zhiduo.

220
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,080
Are you serious?

221
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,120
As Qin Yu cannot accept the pain

222
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,360
of losing Concubine Rong in the ending,

223
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,120
his love for you has broken the system.

224
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,520
That's why he's able to be here.

225
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,160
And, his attendant, Li Zhiduo,
swears his loyalty to him.

226
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,840
Your energy is bound to them too.

227
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
If I take them away by force...

228
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,760
What's going on?

229
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,240
We have an issue here.

230
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,600
Due to them,

231
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,400
a bug has appeared

232
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,640
in our library system.

233
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,360
They have to stay here for some time.

234
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,360
They have to stay here?

235
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,120
You have to get rid of their obsession

236
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,360
within 100 days of system restoration.

237
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,640
You have to make them
return to their own world willingly.

238
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,060
And,

239
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,520
their identities

240
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,360
mustn't be revealed to others.

241
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,360
If not, you,

242
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,360
Qin Yu,

243
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,360
and Li Zhiduo,

244
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,560
all three of you

245
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,040
will be erased from existence.

246
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,200
And, there's another thing...

247
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,160
What's going on?

248
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,400
Concubine Rong.

249
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,720
Let go of me!

250
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,360
Let go of me!

251
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:08,680
Stop!

252
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,600
- Concubine Rong!
- Stop!

253
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,600
Stop! What are you doing?

254
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,360
Such audacity!

255
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,380
How dare you show such rudeness?

256
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,880
This is...

257
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,460
Who are you two?

258
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,640
What's going on?

259
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,040
Did he

260
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,600
just ask us who we are?

261
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,920
Isn't it obvious enough?

262
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,160
They're security guards.

263
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,040
They were called constables in the past.

264
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,040
No.

265
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,640
They were called guards.

266
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,520
Guards?

267
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,440
Who rang the alarm just now?

268
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,380
Me.

269
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,280
It's like this.

270
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,320
I'm a novelist.

271
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,880
Just now, when I was

272
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,760
discussing ideas with my boyfriend,

273
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,760
we had an argument,

274
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,840
and we almost got into a fight.

275
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
That's not a big deal.

276
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,200
We could've settled this ourselves.

277
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,240
Why did you have to
trouble other people?

278
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:51,960
I, Your Majesty...

279
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:52,720
Your Majesty?

280
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,140
Your Majesty?

281
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:53,800
(Oh no!)

282
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,640
(They'll find out soon!)

283
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Look at you!

284
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,360
You're still into your character.

285
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,960
I told you that I was
the novelist of this novel.

286
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,480
I wanted to write about a modern story
with no emperors in it.

287
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,280
The emperor you mentioned

288
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,000
had already relinquished
his throne in the past.

289
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,080
The current me

290
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,680
has come to the modern society
in search of my true love.

291
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,240
You've gone berserk.

292
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,240
Let go of me!

293
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,460
What are you doing?

294
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,320
Such audacity!

295
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,040
You two are mere guards!

296
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,240
How dare you commit
such an audacious act?

297
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,120
Calm down!

298
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,840
Return Concubine Rong to us!

299
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,840
Your Majesty!

300
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,560
Calm down.

301
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,060
We can't

302
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,720
handle this.

303
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,680
Call the cops immediately.

304
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,680
Calm down.

305
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,700
Two of you, please calm down.

306
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,680
