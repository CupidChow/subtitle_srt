Your Majesty,

9
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:40,039
that person looked just like Lord Ying.

10
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:42,920
Is he your boss?

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,840
So, in your world,

12
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:47,520
my boss looks just like Lord Ying?

13
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:49,159
This is amazing.

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,520
This is magical.

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,799
When I first started writing that novel,

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,920
I modeled Lord Ying after my boss.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,840
So, art is indeed a part of life.

18
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,359
And, life is a part of art too.

19
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,119
I, Yan Yiyi, am truly amazing.

20
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:03,759
I actually came up
with such a realistic character.

21
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:06,519
So, do I have a prototype as well?

22
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,920
Is there someone in this world
who looks just like me?

23
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,879
You're the imaginary boyfriend
I fantasized about.

24
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:14,719
If there's someone like you

25
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:16,200
in this world,

26
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,599
I wouldn't need to
stay single until now.

27
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:19,599
So, I'm your ideal boyfriend?

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,159
That is, if you're not
just a character in my novel.

29
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,040
Li Zhiduo!

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,840
Yes, Your Majesty.

31
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:26,719
Get me the finest wine you can!

32
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:27,879
I will celebrate this occasion.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

34
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,879
What occasion?

35
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,400
Our reunion.

36
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,480
We should hold a celebration today.

37
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:37,640
I, Yan Yiyi, am amazing.

38
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,599
I actually came up with
such an ideal boyfriend.

39
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,079
Concubine Rong,

40
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:48,519
let me do it.

41
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,159
It's fine.

42
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:50,959
Here.

43
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,719
Have a seat.

44
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:53,840
Li Zhiduo,

45
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,000
you should join us.

46
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,159
No!

47
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,560
I dare not share a meal with His Majesty

48
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,000
and you, Your Highness.

49
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,959
This is modern society.

50
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,159
Everyone is equal here.

51
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:04,719
Just sit down.

52
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,200
It's fine, Li Zhiduo.

53
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,280
Just do as the Romans do.

54
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,879
Try it.

55
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,719
This is the white wine we have.

56
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:17,599
Here.

57
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:18,360
Try this.

58
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,879
This is beer.

59
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:24,599
Protect His Majesty!

60
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,080
I just opened

61
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,599
a can of beer.

62
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,000
Try it.

63
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:37,960
There's one more.

64
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,039
This is red wine.

65
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:39,719
You guys should try it too.

66
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,280
Red wine?

67
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,199
At night, fine wine is poured into

68
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,000
a glistening cup.

69
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,639
Here.

70
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:54,919
Li Zhiduo?

71
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,280
What are you doing?

72
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,360
I'm checking whether
it's glistening or not.

73
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,400
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

74
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:09,840
Your Majesty.

75
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:15,360
Qin Yu.

76
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,280
You have

77
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,280
to leave.

78
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,280
There's no place for you

79
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:22,639
in this world.

80
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:24,599
How would you know

81
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,840
without giving it a try?

82
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,560
I'm serious.

83
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,240
And, it's more than that.

84
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,080
If you don't leave,

85
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:33,479
you,

86
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:34,719

Concubine Rong,

91
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,840
don't worry.

92
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,879
I will never let any harm come to you.

Qin Yu,

00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,360
let me ask you something.

96
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:04,039
As the male lead of my novel,

97
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,080
what do you like the most
about the Yin Empire?

98
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,240
The Yin Empire?

99
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,039
I like the Cold Palace

100
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:14,919
the most.

101
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,540
(Qin Yan)

102
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,279
What a boring guy.

103
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:30,879
You only like it because Concubine Rong

104
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,199
is in it.

105
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,000
Under the Cold Palace's roof,

106
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,240
the wind chimes ring.

107
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,959
Ding, ding.

108
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,600
There's a cherry blossom tree

109
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,879
outside the palace too.

110
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,319
Whenever it blooms,

111
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,519
the petals will get inside.

112
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,759
They will get on your shoulders.

113
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,920
I will dust them off

114
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,639
gently for you.

115
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,240
And, you will recite a poem
while smiling.

116
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,439
You recited:

117
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,199
"At this time when the southern
landscape is at its best,"

118
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,319
"we meet again
when the flowers blossom."

119
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,920
I like anywhere

120
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,079
as long as you're there.

121
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,279
I knew it.

122
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,920
The location isn't important.

123
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:23,360
The important thing

124
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,839
is the person

125
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,519
you're together with.

126
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,720
I'm getting envious of
the female lead I created.

127
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:35,759
Concubine Rong,

128
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,120
you just forgot about our past.

129
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,680
I will help you recall them.

130
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,680
Losing my memories

131
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,560
and having no prior experience

132
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,399
are two different things.

133
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,279
Why can't you understand?

134
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:49,639
Concubine Rong,

135
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,480
we cannot falsify truth,

136
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,720
nor verify lies.

137
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,279
Our moments together

138
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,879
have been deeply imprinted in my head.

139
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,560
I'm willing to cast everything away.

140
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,759
I'm not afraid to
break through the norms.

141
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,680
I'm willing to learn

142
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:03,920
and shave my hair for you.

143
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,319
As long as you're here,

144
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,680
I will have the courage to persevere.

145
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,720
Since you're that infatuated with me,

146
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,120
there's no time like the present.

147
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,480
Li Zhiduo!

148
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,040
Yes, Your Highness.

149
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,480
Today,

150
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,600
I,

151
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,959
Yan Yiyi.

152
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:30,319
Your turn.

153
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:32,240
I,

154
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,040
Qin Yu.

155
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,639
Under God's presence,

156
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,560
we shall swear fealty to one another.

157
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,480
From now on,

158
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:39,639
just leave the search for
your future wife

159
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,560
to me, your sister.

160
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,079
No, I mean your brother.

161
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,319
Okay?

162
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,560
That won't do.

163
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,519
Lovers shall become

164
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,040
brothers...

165
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,040
Shall become siblings in the end?

166
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,120
No!

167
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,319
You mustn't do this!

168
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:56,800
Qin Yu.

169
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm here.

170
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,480
We may not be born

171
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,199
on the same date,

172
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,759
but we shall die together.

173
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:06,720
All right.

174
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,839
Sorry about that.

175
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:20,759
It's...

176
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,160
It's pretty...

177
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,160
It's pretty tough.

178
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:26,199
Your Highness,

179
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,680
we need a master of ceremony

180
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,879
for all ceremonies.

181
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,040
Let's start again.

182
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,360
Your Majesty.

183
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,920
Your Highness.

184
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,480
Bow to Heaven and Earth.

185
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:44,839
Wait, something's off.

186
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,319
Bow to your parents.

187
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,580
(Yan Erer, Yan Yiyi's Younger Brother,
Stubborn, Good-For-Nothing)

188
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,560
Yan Yiyi!

189
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,279
Are you Yan Yiyi?

190
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:02,920
Get out of my way!

191
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,800
What are you doing?

192
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,040
Who are they?

193
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,480
Are you getting married?

194
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,959
Yan Erer!

195
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:10,839
Don't spout nonsense!

196
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,920
Oops, seems like I found out.

197
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,560
You must be furious.

198
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:20,160
You must be enraged, huh?

199
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,240
Who told you to bully me all the time?

200
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,800
When I head back, I'll tell Mom and Dad

201
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,120
that you're keeping a man in your unit.

202
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,920
If you dare to tell Mom
and Dad about that,

203
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,480
I'll tear your lips apart!

204
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,720
Let go.

205
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,199
No.

206
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,279
Let go!

207
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,240
Let go!

208
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,240
Let go!

209
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,919
Ouch!

210
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,679
Let go!

211
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,559
Yan Erer!

212
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,519
Dad, Mom,

213
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,919
Yiyi is keeping a...

214
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,519
How dare you come
to your sister's house?

215
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,080
You brat!

216
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,399
Dad? Mom?

217
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,759
Do you think I'll let you off

218
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:52,519
just because you're here?

219
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,200
He's a murderer!

220
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:00,399
Wait. Yan Erer, what did you do?

221
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,840
It was running around in the basement.

222
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,000
When I was watering the plants,

223
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,080
I slipped

224
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,919
and flattened it.

225
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,639
All this while,

226
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,960
I always raised Ke

227
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,799
like my own granddaughter!

228
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,480
I always cared for it!

229
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,639
Now, I'll cease to
be a grandmother again!

230
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,080
When will you two

231
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,600
make me a grandmother?

232
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,080
Mom,

233
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,799
can you stop shifting the topic?

234
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:34,799
We...

235
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,200
(Oh no.)

236
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,279
(If Mom finds Qin Yu,)

237
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,000
(she'll use the opportunity
to force me to get married.)

238
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:45,840
Mom,

239
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,960
there's no one here.

240
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:52,320
Mom, I...

241
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,000
Stop right there.

242
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,080
Your Majesty!

243
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:58,399
You're stepping on my foot!

244
00:09:58,679 --> 00:09:59,240
Don't move!

245
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,480
I can't take it anymore!

246
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,720
