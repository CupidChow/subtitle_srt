You better don't overthink it.

To put it more accurately,

I'm the author of this novel.

of your relationship

To put it bluntly,

17
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:09,959
you got the wrong person.

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,840
So, can you please

before you head back,

28
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,840
you need to remember

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,519
that this is the modern society.

30
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:29,000
It's completely different
from the Yin Empire.

31
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:30,920
If you wish to survive in this society,

32
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,480
you have to follow the rules.

33

I'm willing to do so as long as

I can be with you.

Second,

39
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,280
you're not allowed to reveal
your identity to anyone else.

40
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,680
If not, you'll bring us endless trouble.

41
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,959
All right. I will promise you that.

42
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:46,959
Since you have to live in
this society for the time being,

43
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,400
you have to learn how to
integrate yourself into society.

Don't worry.

00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,079
her boyfriend.

171
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,240
He's a typical

172
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,160
handsome.

173
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,639
And, he has

174
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,439
the figure

175
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,199
of a superstar.

176
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,839
When it comes to his assets,

177
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,319
how do I put it?

178
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,240
He's fabulously rich.

179
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,279
The hairpin on his hair

180
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:06,480
is worth at least 20,000 yuan.

181
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,319
Really?

182
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,920
A man? Wearing a hairpin?

183
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,480
Ding Xiaoxiao,

184
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,839
stop boasting for her.

185
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,759
What are you saying?

186
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:15,279
Huh?

187
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:16,120
Yiyi!

188
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:27,720
That's

189
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,360
Yiyi's boyfriend.

190
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:34,600
I think he's more handsome
in a modern outfit.

191
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:44,440
♪I have told you too many of my secrets.
I am being too sweet♪

192
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,360
Did I arrive

193
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,800
at the right timing?

194
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,560
Everyone,

195
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,040
I assume you all are her friends.

196
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,079
Thank you

197
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,000
for taking care of Yiyi all this while.

198
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:55,199
I, Your Majesty...

199
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:56,360
Your Majesty?

200
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:56,839
Your Majesty,

201
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,399
this is a class reunion.

202
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:01,800
I'm truly grateful to you all.

203
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,800
This meal

204
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:04,680
is on the house.

205
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,120
Feifei,

206
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,319
that's the latest model, right?

207
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,319
You found yourself a good boyfriend.

208
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,959
That's why you get to enjoy life.

209
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:14,399
At least

210
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,439
he won't let you go out with
an older model.

211
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,000
Look at the size of that pearl.

212
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,519
(This is too much.)

213
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,879
I always wanted to present this to you.

214
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,960
It's because it will only shine

215
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,960
when you wear it.

216
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,960
I told you already!

217
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,720
I hate jewelry!

218
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,840
You just had to buy it for me, huh?

219
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,559
Especially this top-grade pearl
from the South Sea.

220
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,639
Don't buy it for me again.

221
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:57,679
All right.

222
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,240
I'll remember that.

223
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,200
I won't buy you pearls again.

224
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:02,919
I'll buy you diamonds next time.

225
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,480
They kept bullying me

226
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,759
when I was in university.

227
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:08,240
Now, I've finally gotten even with them.

228
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:09,759
However,

229
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,120
I need to thank you for what you did.

230
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,399
I need to thank myself

231
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,120
for creating such a fabulous

232
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,000
male lead as well.

233
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,720
Why don't you tell me how fabulous I am?

234
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,679
You're not modest at all.

235
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,240
There's nothing to be modest about.

236
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,200
I'm already your husband.

237
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:24,919
What are you saying?

238
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,240
Don't spread baseless rumors.

239
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:28,960
Just now, I was speaking

240
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,240
from the bottom of my heart.

241
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,799
Don't do that.

242
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,759
Yiyi.

243
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,519
Hi.

244
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,820
(Qi Chuan, President of Jing Yang
Enterprise, Warmest Prince Ever)

245
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:45,799
Brother?

246
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,279
President Qi,

247
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:49,360
don't mind him.

248
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:50,120
He

249
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,720
was

250
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:51,720
calling for someone else.

251
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,399
You mistook him for the wrong person.

252
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,240
He's our boss.

253
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:55,879
He's not your brother.

254
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,200
This is?

255
00:09:58,519 --> 00:09:59,039
He's my friend.

256
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,960
He's just a normal friend.

257
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,320
A normal friend?

258
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,240
I'm your husband...

259

You haven't escaped from my novel yet.

260

Mind your identity.

261
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,759
So,

I can send you there.

270
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,120
Thank you, President Qi.

271
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,919
I will escort Concubine Rong.

272

You need not trouble yourself.
