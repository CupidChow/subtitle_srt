He's Qin Yu's secretary.

I'll get you guys some tea.

You're young and talented indeed.

00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:03,840
So,

00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,079
what do you do for a living?

How long have you guys been together?

31
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,000
We got to know each other through work.

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,799
We just started dating each other.

33
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:20,640
I'm talking to him.

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,280
Don't interrupt.

Tell me your part of the story.

37
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,719
I admired Yiyi's talent.

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,760
I started admiring her

39
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:31,040
ever since I read her novels.

40
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,799
Before this, I was wondering

41
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,920
how she could be so talented.

42
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,319
Now that I've seen Uncle and Aunt,

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,560
I'm sure she only
got to where she is today

44
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,239
because of you two.

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,359
That's right.

46
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,319
What a boot licker.

47
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:45,840
Squat down.

48
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,000
Squat!

49

Squat!

50
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,239
Qin,

51
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,159
I can tell

52
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,439
at first glance

53
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:57,799
that you're innocent and kind.

54
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,439
If that's the case,

55
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:00,519
why don't you

56
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,760
invite your parents?

57
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,560
We can meet each other

58
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,680
and discuss further details.

59
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,400
What?

60
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:09,400
Qin looks like a great kid.

61
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,919
The more I look at him,
the more I like him.

62
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,199
Why don't we

63
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:12,919
pick an auspicious date

64
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,280
and meet our in-laws?

65
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,840
We can plan their wedding after that.

66
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,319
Good.

67
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,240
Wait.

68
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:17,840
Mom,

69
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,120
calm down.

70
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,560
We need to take this slowly.

71
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:21,639
Calm down?

72
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:24,120
How are you calmer than me
even when you're in love?

73
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:25,759
Wait.

74
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,319
I know you guys like Qin Yu.

75
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,960
But what if his parents don't like me?

76
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,159
That's impossible.

77
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,520
Li Zhiduo.

78
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,360
Uncle, Aunt, it's my biggest honor

79
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,000
to acquire your trust.

80
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,719
Thank you for entrusting Yiyi to me.

81
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,960
Today, I shall present one-half

82
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,520

through sincerity.

91

May we understand each other,

92
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:07,800
and allow me to stay by your side.

93

Yiyi.

97

I will never let her down.

98

Take it.

Hurry up.

100
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,759
Actually, I wanted
to return this jade pendant

101
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,879
to you after we reunited
with each other.

I don't think their presence

What's an energy backlash?

134
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,360
The characters of your novel

135
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,600
have broken the energy balance
between the two worlds.

136

However,

137

your energy flows within them.

138
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,480
The difference between energy

139
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,480
will be reflected upon your body
as energy backlash.

140
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,600
Although I don't know
the true consequences behind it,

141
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,000
it's definitely

142
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:02,680
detrimental to your health.

your parents yesterday.

173
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:21,560
Qin Yu,

174
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,439
I did all that yesterday

175
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:25,279
because I was afraid they might find out

176
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,040
that you were a character from my novel.

177
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,759
That's why I went along with them.

178
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:29,920
Oh yeah.

179
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,439
By the way,

180
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,720
you can have this back.

181
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:45,519
Qin Yu,

182
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,680
I'm really sorry.

183
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,199
But I'm not Concubine Rong.

184
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,839
Concubine Rong?

185
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,480
(Don't blame me for being ruthless.)

186
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,319
(I have no choice but to do so.)

187
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,860
(Encounter Love)

188
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,079
Xiaoxiao!

189
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,519
Hey.

190
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,199
You look like a goddess today.

191
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:35,040
Are you sure you're not here
to steal my dates from me?

192
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:36,600
Don't worry.

193
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,959
You're the main lead for today.

194
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:39,920
If so,

195
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,360
does Qin Yu know
that you'll be joining me

196
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:42,399
for the blind date party?

197
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,439
He won't be angry, right?

198
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,800
It's better if he's angry.

199
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,879
So, you're trying to make him
jealous on purpose?

200
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,360
You're such a sadist.

201
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,759
I didn't say that.

202
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,120
Hi.

203
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,199
Pretty lady,

204
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,240
can we know each other?

205
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,319
Of course.

206
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,079
What about that lady?

207
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:00,959
I...

208
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,240
Please add me on WeChat if it's okay.

209
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,199
I can chat with you two
at the same time.

210
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,399
It'll be more efficient.

211
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,000
No thanks.

212
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,800
Don't you think it's too lowly of him

213
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,480
to do so?

214
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,759
What's going on?

215
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,079
Yiyi,

216
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,439
look over there.

217
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,720
He looks like a sunny guy.

218
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,160
I saw him when I first entered the room.

219
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,879
He kept talking non-stop.

220
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:27,519
He always interrupted her
when she was speaking.

221
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,279
He looks like a narcissist to me.

222
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:29,800
He's no good.

223
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:31,560
Yeah, yeah.

224
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,120
Your Qin Yu is the best.

225
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,919
Where can I find
a perfect boyfriend like him?

226
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:36,600
You're

227
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,600
taking him for granted here.

228
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,200
(Will he come after me?)

229
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,559
(Did he return
to the novel out of spite)

230
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,480
(after realizing that
I fell for someone else?)

231
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,120

232

the book officer said.)

Excuse me.

237
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,240
I'm not interested in you.

240
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,840
can I add you on WeChat?

241
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,720
Sorry about that.

242
