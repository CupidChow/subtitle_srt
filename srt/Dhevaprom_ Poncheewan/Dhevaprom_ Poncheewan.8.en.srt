1
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,440
Don't say that we kissed.

2
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,200
Our mouths just bumped into each other.

3
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,960
I've never kissed anyone.

4
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,640
Never.

5
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,400
I can tell who it is at a glance.

6
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,680
This is a hotel.

7
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,800
You might be forced into marriage.

8
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,160
No, I don't want that.

9
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,280
I won't get married.

10
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,320
I won't get married no matter what.

11
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,240
I don't want to be responsible
for the royal duties.

12
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,720
Saruj, please help me.

13
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,320
Poncheewa ran away to Pattaya with Simon.

14
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,880
Simon, flip it now.

15
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,000
Simon.

16
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,680
I have some business to attend to.

17
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,040
Your parents will pick you up
this evening, right?

18
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,600
Yes.

19
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,720
They'll probably come in the evening.

20
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,520
I'll help you talk to them,

21
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,960
so don't run away,

22
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,560
and don't worry too much.

23
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,000
Let's go.

24
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,160
Thank you.

25
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,160
Let's go.

26
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,760
There you are, you troublemaker.

27
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,040
Do you know how shocked we were?

28
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,480
Hold on. What are you talking about?

29
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,360
We all know what's going on,

30
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,880
so I called Mrs. Ked and Mr. Chinnakorn
to deal with you.

31
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,040
My mom went to the house in Pattaya

32
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,120
and heard everything.

33
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,960
Is it true

34
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,240
that you're pregnant?

35
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,240
Yes.

36
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,680
Dad.

37
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,480
I'm sorry.

38
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,160
I'm sorry.

39
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,560
Mom,

40
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
please forgive me.

41
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,720
Hey,

42
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,280
do you know how much
you have disappointed us?

43
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,520
You shouldn't have done
such an inappropriate thing.

44
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,280
But anyway, saying this won't make
the baby in your belly disappear.

45
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,520
Let's find a way
to solve this problem, Madam Orn.

46
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,320
How did it happen?

47
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,800
It happened in Switzerland, right?

48
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,320
Who is the child's dad?

49
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,080
I can't tell you.

50
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,120
What?

51
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,040
Why are you saying this?

52
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,360
You still don't realize you've done wrong.

53
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,680
Tell us who it is
so we can arrange your wedding.

54
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,360
Is getting married the only solution
to this problem?

55
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,560
Of course.

56
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,800
Luckily, it's your first baby,
so it doesn't really show,

57
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,760
but it will, eventually.

58
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,760
How embarrassed will your parents be

59
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,960
if you walk around
with your belly bulging?

60
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,760
I really can't tell you.

61
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,000
Your parents are right here.

62
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,800
Spare a thought for them.

63
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,280
Are you going to tell us or not?

64
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,600
If not, you'll get it.

65
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,440
I can't tell you, even if you kill me.

66
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,360
Goodness, why are you saying this?

67
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,200
This is bad.

68
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,400
My gosh, please calm down, everyone.

69
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,960
She's like a niece to me.
Let me deal with her.

70
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,880
But I beg you not to use force with her.

71
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,040
Hold on. Who is using force here?

72
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,720
No one does that here.

73
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,960
Don't be so rude.

74
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,440
Adults are talking
about an important matter.

75
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,240
It has already given me
a terrible headache.

76
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,720
I'm so confused.

77
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,720
Why is it Poncheewa who did this?

78
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,400
I wouldn't be so surprised
if you had done something so awful.

79
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,960
Fine, I won't talk anymore.

80
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,160
Jaew.

81
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,200
Yes?

82
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,440
I want to make some snoop… No.

83
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,880
I mean soup.

84
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,920
Would you like some?

85
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,360
What soup are you talking about?

86
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,480
Mom,

87
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,640
I think you should be quiet
and let her parents talk.

88
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,440
Hey, we must help them with this.

89
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,640
Aren't we like family to them?

90
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,240
This is serious.

91
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,640
Cheewa has acted improperly
and sullied their name.

92
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,159
Tell us who the baby's dad is.

93
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,840
Why didn't you think
of your parents when you did it?

94
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,480
-Tell us what you were thinking.
-Enough!

95
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,240
Please stop.

96
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,039
I can't take this anymore.

97
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,600
Dad.

98
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,840
Dad.

99
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,800
-Cheewa!
-Cheewa!

100
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,200
-Cheewa!
-Cheewa!

101
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,640
-Cheewa!
-Get an inhaler.

102
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,720
-Cheewa.
-Get her an inhaler.

103
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,080
-Cheewa.
-Stay with me, Cheewa.

104
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,000
-Here is an inhaler.
-Hang in there, dear.

105
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,040
Cheewa.

106
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,720
EMERGENCY

107
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,120
Ma'am, we need a relative
to fill in the patient's details.

108
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,680
Sure.

109
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,680
Will you stay with her?

110
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,880
Sure.

111
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,680
This way, please.

112
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,360
Cheewan.

113
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,360
Can I talk to you?

114
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,960
Okay.

115
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,760
PREGNANT WOMEN

116
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,280
I want to apologize to you.

117
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,320
I didn't know.

118
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,240
I shouldn't have taken my mom there.

119
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,520
It's okay, Venus.
It had to come out eventually.

120
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,720
But my mom went too far.

121
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,560
She shouldn't have interfered
in their family matters.

122
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,440
Cheewan, we have a big problem.

123
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,680
Cheewa isn't in the emergency room.

124
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,920
-What?
-She had gone when I went in.

125
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,280
-Gosh.
-What do we do?

126
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,400
Has Cheewa run away?

127
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,720
That's right.

128
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,400
Great-Grandma already told me everything.

129
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,080
She sent me to check on Cheewa.

130
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,200
Why did she run away?
We already talked about this.

131
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,440
Let's split up.

132
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,080
I'll go to the information desk.

133
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,840
-You drove here, right?
-Yes.

134
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,200
Please help me search the area.

135
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,440
Can you two look for her in front
of the hospital? I'll join you later.

136
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,160
-Sure.
-Go now.

137
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,120
-Okay.
-Let's go.

138
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,360
Let's go.

139
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,080
EMERGENCY

140
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,960
INFORMATION

141
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,520
Can you make an announcement
for a patient named Poncheewa?

142
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,080
Please tell her to meet me here.

143
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,000
Sure.

144
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,240
Excuse me.
Have you seen a woman around my age?

145
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,640
She was in the emergency room.

146
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,600
She has a fringe
with hair about this long.

147
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,760
-She's wearing--
-She's wearing a pink shirt and…

148
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,160
She's wearing black slacks with flats.

149
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,560
-Yes, flats.
-I haven't seen her.

150
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,480
-Okay, thank you.
-No worries.

151
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,480
You're Poncheewa's child.

152
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,040
You've been crying all day
because you're scared, right?

153
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,320
Tell me where you are.

154
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,480
Tell me.

155
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,240
Tell me.

156
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,560
Cheewa.

157
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,320
Mrs. Kedsara is looking
everywhere for you.

158
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,680
I just wanted to take a walk
and think things over alone.

159
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,480
I heard a child jumping into the water.

160
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,560
I almost had a heart attack. I thought…

161
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,320
I was already on a bridge.

162
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,720
What?

163
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,120
This flower

164
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,640
reminded me of what we talked about.

165
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,720
It's normal for people
to be weak sometimes.

166
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,000
But when the time comes,

167
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,319
a strong person will always choose
to be strong.

168
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,440
You're that kind of person.

169
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,000
My strong Poncheewa is back.

170
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,800
If I don't get up and fight,

171
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,440
I'll die.

172
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:30,480
There are only two choices.

173
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,800
Therefore,

174
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,640
I have to get up.

175
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,000
I have no other choice.

176
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,840
When Great-Grandma Orn told me
what had happened,

177
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,080
I wasn't surprised at all.

178
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,520
Actually, I felt relieved.

179
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,040
About my pregnancy?

180
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,000
I've been hearing a child crying
for some time now.

181
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,240
I heard it again this morning.

182
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,640
I also heard you, just like before.

183
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,120
When I got off work,

184
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,400
I went straight to Great-Grandma's house
to see you.

185
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,640
It's not just a lump of flesh.

186
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,440
It can communicate.

187
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,920
I'm relieved to know
where the voice is from.

188
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,240
It's been trying to tell me
to help its mom.

189
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,000
It loves its life.

190
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,760
It loves its mom.

191
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,560
So you must fight.

192
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,600
You must live for it.

193
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,160
Mrs. Ked.

194
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,720
Cheewa.

195
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,480
Cheewa, my dear!

196
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,960
I'm sorry, Mom.

197
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,040
It's all right, dear.

198
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,240
Let's go home.

199
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,920
Poom called and told me

200
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,960
that Poncheewa had gone home with Kedsara.

201
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,920
I'm relieved to hear that.

202
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,440
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able
to sleep tonight.

203
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,680
I see.

204
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,400
Here he is.

205
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,280
I brought him from Mr. Nava's house.

206
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,280
Take a seat.

207
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,600
This is Mod, Nat's close friend.

208
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,960
All right, tell everyone what happened.

209
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,440
Tell them what?

210
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,840
About Poncheewa's pregnancy.

211
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,920
Tell us who the dad is.

212
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,480
Isn't it your friend?

213
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,200
I told you
I don't know anything about this.

214
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,120
But I suspect it's Nat. Is it him?

215
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,080
At first, I thought the same,

216
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,880
but Nat doesn't seem
bothered by it at all,

217
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,480
so I don't think it's him.

218
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,960
Tell us who was in your batch of students.

219
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,360
Gosh, old lady. I'm not a civil registrar.

220
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,680
How am I supposed to know this?

221
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,680
Address me properly, will you?

222
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,480
Let's do this. Let's call them.

223
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,960
You must have your friends' numbers.
Give them to us.

224
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,440
Call each and every one of them.

225
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,600
Call them in front of Madam Orn
so we can all hear it.

226
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,680
Do you understand?

227
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,680
You can give me the numbers.
I'll call them.

228
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,720
That's enough.

229
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,720
I'm the dad of Poncheewa's baby.

230
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,400
Mr. Saruj.

231
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,840
Saruj.

232
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,640
Are you having a baby with Poncheewa?

233
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,880
Yes.

234
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,880
That's not true. It's impossible.

235
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,920
I looked into it. You two aren't together.

236
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,920
It's complicated,

237
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,480
so we didn't explain this to anyone.

238
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,320
Is it true?

239
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,400
Please don't worry about this.

240
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,440
This baby is a Jutathep.

241
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,920
You can call anyone you want.

242
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,440
Call them now and expose us.

243
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,920
We're proud of our family
whatever happens.

244
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,560
Poncheewa didn't say it was you.

245
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,600
Stay out of this

246
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,120
and leave it to Mrs. Kedsara

247
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,920
and Mr. Chinnakorn.

248
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,920
Keep your nose out of this.

249
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,080
Are you insulting me?

250
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,320
Yes,

251
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,040
and if you don't stop,

252
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,000
I'll have to tell
Permanent Secretary Narong.

253
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,440
This is so delicious. It's so satisfying.

254
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,920
It's really satisfying.

255
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,920
-Yes, ma'am.
-Madam Orn.

256
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,080
Jaew's dessert is so good.

257
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,560
It's so satisfying. You should try it.

258
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,280
Yes.

259
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,160
You were too harsh, Mr. Saruj.

260
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,120
I only mean well.

261
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,440
Can't you see that?

262
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,160
Not if your well-meaning
has malicious intent.

263
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,480
Gosh, I can't help but clap my hands.

264
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,400
The dessert is good.

265
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,840
I'm clapping for the dessert.

266
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,840
It's delicious.

267
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,880
Mr. Saruj.

268
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,800
You seem quiet and reserved,

269
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,400
but you're quite something.

270
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,280
What? Wait up.

271
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,840
What about me? Take me with you.

272
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,440
Who will pay me for the time
I have wasted?

273
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,800
I guess I'm not getting paid.

274
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,800
I've let you down.

275
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,880
I'm sorry.

276
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,800
Come and sit with me, dear.

277
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,120
It's fine if you don't want to tell me
who the baby's dad is,

278
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,880
but tell me…

279
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,880
if he was your boyfriend.

280
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,600
Did he force himself on you?

281
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,720
No, he didn't.

282
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,080
He didn't force himself on me.

283
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,720
It happened out of love, right?

284
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,640
Yes.

285
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,360
It happened out of love.

286
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,040
Okay.

287
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,200
As your parent,

288
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,040
that is all I need to hear.

289
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,600
All this time,

290
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,920
you must have been miserable

291
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,840
and anxious because of this, right?

292
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,440
If you want to tell me off or hit me,

293
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,640
you can do it all you want,

294
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,920
because I've made a terrible mistake.

295
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,400
I love you, Mom.

296
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,720
I love you too.

297
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,960
Your dad also loves you.

298
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,920
He loves you so much. Do you know that?

299
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,360
I'm sorry.

300
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,640
She must have been afraid
she'd get scolded.

301
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,680
You're right.

302
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,400
She deserves it, don't you think?

303
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,800
-Yes, ma'am.
-Madam Orn.

304
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,880
I want to have your coconut soup
with lotus stems.

305
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,000
I'll get some lotus stems from the pond.

306
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,600
Okay, go.

307
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,360
If Saruj had told us he was
the dad from the beginning,

308
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,400
no one would have said anything.

309
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,280
We should be glad.

310
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,280
Yes, ma'am.

311
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,760
What are you talking about?

312
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,520
Didn't Poncheewa tell you

313
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,280
that the baby's dad is Saruj?

314
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,240
What?

315
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,600
Poncheewa and Mr. Saruj?

316
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,280
I don't think so.

317
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,680
It's true.

318
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,400
Mr. Saruj said it himself
yesterday evening.

319
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,560
Mr. Saruj?

320
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,000
Did he say it himself?

321
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,400
Yes.

322
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,000
They must have fought

323
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,840
like they do in novels,

324
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,280
where the female protagonist refuses

325
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,720
to tell the male protagonist
about her pregnancy

326
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,840
and runs away to a garden house.

327
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,480
It's like what happens in Sawan Biang.

328
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,960
This is the fifth
Jutathep and Dhevaprom couple.

329
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,960
Gosh, it must be destiny.

330
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,960
Oh my, I'm so happy.

331
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:23,440
I want to invite Kedsara over
to talk about the wedding now.

332
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,840
I'm so excited.
I don't know how to explain.

333
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,640
-Yes.
-Right?

334
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,200
-Hello.
-Hello.

335
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,040
May I speak to Poncheewa?

336
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,400
She's not at home.

337
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,040
She has gone for a check-up
with Mrs. Kedsara.

338
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,400
May I ask if this is Ms. Cheewan speaking?

339
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,600
Yes.

340
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,560
Please tell her

341
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,080
I'll go see her tomorrow.

342
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,520
Yes, ma'am.

343
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,320
The Ministry of Commerce has suggested
attendees for the bilateral meeting.

344
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,600
Already?

345
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,080
Go away.

346
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,040
Who did they suggest?

347
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:30,200
They suggested two companies
under the Thai Chamber of Commerce

348
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,800
and two from the Farmers' Association.

349
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,360
That's fine by me,

350
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,200
but make sure they send
senior representatives

351
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,800
with decision-making power to the meeting.

352
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,200
Last time, no one could make a decision.
It was a waste of time.

353
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,920
Yes, sir.

354
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,120
I'll get back to them tomorrow.

355
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,280
Mr. Saruj.

356
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,240
What brings you all the way here?

357
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,880
Are you really the child's dad?

358
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,720
Why did you say that?

359
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,560
How did you feel when you found out?
Can you tell me?

360
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,320
Well…

361
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,520
Were you hurt?

362
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,800
No, I wasn't hurt.

363
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,720
Not at all. What's pain?

364
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,560
You didn't feel hurt.

365
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,840
So why did you come
all the way here to see me?

366
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,680
Well, I wanted to know.

367
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,040
You couldn't wait a few more hours
for me to get off work.

368
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,560
Are you sure you just wanted to know this?

369
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,000
Yes, I'm sure.

370
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,480
Okay,

371
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,720
if you say so.

372
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,960
I still have an hour to go.

373
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,600
Will you join me for lunch?

374
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,840
Excuse me, sir.

375
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,160
-Yes?
-Here you go.

376
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,440
Thank you.

377
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,840
This is my cousin.

378
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,320
She's my favorite.

379
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,040
Isn't she cute?

380
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,800
She's your cousin?

381
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,040
Yes.

382
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,400
Is she a Jutathep?

383
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,120
Yes.

384
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,440
Well,

385
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,560
I'm a distant relative.

386
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,560
Actually, I'm a servant at the palace.

387
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:50,120
I'll excuse myself. I still have
to collect lotus stems.

388
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,400
Goodbye.

389
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,040
Gosh.

390
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,000
I'm sorry, Dad,

391
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,200
Vit,

392
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,640
Ploy,

393
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,080
and Lisa,

394
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,400
for bringing shame on our family.

395
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:29,960
My reputation has long been ruined,
so it's fine.

396
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,720
Right, Lisa?

397
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,160
I'm sorry.

398
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,200
I shouldn't have interrupted.

399
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,960
Since you found out,

400
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,760
you haven't said a word to me, Dad.

401
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,880
You've been to the doctor, haven't you?

402
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,760
How did it go?

403
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,800
Both the mom and the baby are healthy.

404
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,960
We have already signed up
for antenatal care.

405
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,560
I was mad that day

406
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,320
because I was upset.

407
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,639
I couldn't accept that you really did it.

408
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,880
And you chose to run away
to Madam Orn's house

409
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,280
instead of telling us about it.

410
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,080
I was scared.

411
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,639
I knew many people would ask you about it.

412
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:35,560
I didn't want you all
to have to answer questions about me.

413
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,320
The problem is
you made assumptions about us.

414
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,920
Those people don't support us.
Why would we care about them?

415
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:47,360
I was furious with Lady Veena that day,

416
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,199
but Madam Orn was there.

417
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,920
Otherwise, I wouldn't have spared her.

418
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,920
I've been through
something like this before.

419
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,840
People won't talk about it for long.

420
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,840
They'll move on from you
when something new comes along.

421
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,560
But you still have to live

422
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,640
with the vile things
other people have said about you.

423
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,720
Listen, you must all remember

424
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,640
to trust your family

425
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,840
and tell us whenever you make a mistake.

426
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,960
When it comes to family,

427
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,880
you always forgive each other,
no matter how much you fight.

428
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,760
That's because family

429
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,520
is unconditional love, right?

430
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,960
Yes.

431
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,680
In our family,

432
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,160
we stand by each other.

433
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,320
Let them gossip about you
or judge you all they want,

434
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,640
because we know ourselves

435
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,200
and our own values.

436
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,960
Come here.

437
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,000
I'd like to welcome
the newest member of the family.

438
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,960
We promise

439
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,560
to do our best to take care of this child.

440
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,200
Don't worry.

441
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,840
Welcome, Cheewa,

442
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,640
the brand-new single mom.

443
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,840
Cheewa.

444
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,760
It might be difficult at first,

445
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,800
but I'm confident that you can do it.

446
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,880
I'm sorry again, Dad and Mom.

447
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,640
I have an auspicious time for the wedding.

448
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,440
The best day is the most convenient day.

449
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,960
Hold it whenever you like.

450
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,080
You said you already talked to Saruj.

451
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,400
Yes, I talked to him this morning.

452
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,280
I know you want me to marry Poncheewa,

453
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,240
but what's the hurry?

454
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,280
Well,

455
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:47,000
aren't you the baby's dad?

456
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,080
Yes.

457
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,400
Then you must get married.

458
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,640
It's up to you.

459
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,120
The same goes for Poncheewa.

460
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,440
I just talked to her this morning.

461
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,880
Is Saruj the child's dad?

462
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,480
Right.

463
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,040
I haven't talked to Saruj about this.

464
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,880
What did you say?

465
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,880
Does he not know about this?

466
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:21,280
Do you two really not talk to each other?

467
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,280
I've been busy,
so I totally forgot about it.

468
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:31,560
I think we should put off
the wedding for now.

469
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,480
Let me talk to him first.

470
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,200
So Poncheewa doesn't want
to get married either?

471
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,080
What's going on with them?

472
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,920
They probably haven't talked
to each other.

473
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,040
Saruj probably didn't know
about her pregnancy.

474
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,560
He'd have dealt with it
from the beginning if he'd known.

475
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,200
He must have learned about it
at the same time as us.

476
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,760
We must talk about this
as soon as possible.

477
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,600
They can't put it off for too long.

478
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,720
The longer they put it off,

479
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:05,560
the bigger her tummy gets.

480
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,160
Well then, we need an intermediary

481
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,560
who is close to both of them
and who can get them to talk it out.

482
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,200
Yes. There is only one person.

483
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,800
You want me to be the intermediary
between Mr. Saruj and Poncheewa?

484
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,400
Yes, we suspect that

485
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,160
Mr. Saruj and Cheewa used to date,

486
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,040
but they fought and broke up,

487
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,840
so she didn't tell him

488
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,600
that he was the baby's dad.

489
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,240
Did they date and break up?

490
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,200
I think it must have been in Switzerland.

491
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,960
Do you think so?

492
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,200
Cheewan.

493
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,040
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

494
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,000
I miss you.

495
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,480
Wait a second.

496
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,000
Is there someone in there?

497
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,400
No, I'm alone.

498
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,320
You must have a guest.

499
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,240
There are two glasses.

500
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,840
Well?

501
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,000
That man.

502
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,920
Could it have been Mr. Saruj?

503
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,680
Cheewa and I stayed in different cities.

504
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,400
We only met on weekends.

505
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,560
And you told me once

506
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,600
that Mr. Saruj and Cheewa
didn't really get along.

507
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,400
But now that she's pregnant,

508
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,440
they have no choice
but to talk to each other.

509
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,800
I was planning to visit Poncheewa today,
but she wasn't home.

510
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,360
She went to the hospital
for a parenting class,

511
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,920
so I still haven't talked to her.

512
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,960
Well, Poncheewa told everyone

513
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,720
not to ask her about the child's dad.

514
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,960
I think she's avoiding you
because she doesn't want to tell you.

515
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,160
Whatever happens,
you must get them to talk first.

516
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,440
Okay.

517
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,640
What does Madam Orn need us to do?

518
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,080
Hey, Cheewa.

519
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,120
I came to thank you

520
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,080
for protecting my name.

521
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,080
No worries.

522
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,400
I want you to know

523
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,360
that there are many people who love you.

524
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,960
You have a big family.

525
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,200
I'm just one person

526
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,480
who is here for you
to help you through this.

527
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,240
But people are getting
the wrong idea about this

528
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,640
and they want to hold a wedding for us.

529
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,080
I didn't think about this when I said it.

530
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,480
I was mad at Lady Veena.

531
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,800
I knew it.

532
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,360
I knew you had your reasons.

533
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,240
Actually, I already told my mom
I don't want to get married.

534
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,880
I'll talk to Madam Orn.

535
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,120
Can you not talk to her just yet.

536
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,680
What?

537
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,200
I want you to pretend

538
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,400
that I'm the baby's dad for a while.

539
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,800
Why?

540
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,240
I want to test someone's feelings.

541
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,720
Whose?

542
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,320
Venus has invited us to a party.

543
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,920
Okay.

544
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,720
Aunt Kedsara wants you
to live your life like before

545
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,720
and hang out with friends sometimes.

546
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,720
Okay.

547
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:52,200
Madam Orn also wants you two
to spend time together

548
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,600
and talk to each other like right now.

549
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,840
I see.

550
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,760
I see.

551
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,040
Is that it?

552
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,240
Is this all you have to say?

553
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,800
Hey,

554
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,560
be honest with me.

555
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,400
You two barely talk to each other.

556
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,960
How on earth did you make a baby together?

557
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,400
-Come on.
-Come.

558
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,880
Now,

559
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,000
my parents went abroad
for a week for a meeting.

560
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:38,120
Nop has been with me here
for a few days already.

561
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,840
Let's play football.

562
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,720
Gosh,

563
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,800
it's nice to exercise, isn't it?

564
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,000
We're both going to the World Cup.

565
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,440
Are you that serious?

566
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,320
I thought exercising
would make you strong and fresh.

567
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,480
But why do you have
dark circles around your eyes?

568
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,160
-My gosh.
-Gosh.

569
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,600
They are pretty dark.

570
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,440
This is the latest game.

571
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,880
It's so much fun.

572
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,520
We have been playing it
for two days and nights already.

573
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,160
Today, we're going to compete

574
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,600
to find out once and for all

575
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,600
who is the real champion.

576
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,440
It'll be me, obviously.

577
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,640
-Are you sure?
-But the loser

578
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,360
must treat the winner to a movie at Siam.

579
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,800
Of course.

580
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,440
By the way, Cheewan told me
that you and Cheewa

581
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,080
need to talk.

582
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,440
Please make yourselves at home.

583
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,840
You can tell my maids
if you need anything.

584
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,560
Life without parents

585
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,680
is so much fun.

586
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,760
Gosh, Venus has prepared
so much food for us.

587
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,520
What would you like?

588
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,600
-Nothing right now.
-Yes, ma'am.

589
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,560
Shall we play a game?

590
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,120
I haven't played one for so long.

591
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,120
Let's play this game.

592
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,120
I used to play it with Cheewan every day.

593
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,640
Let me help.

594
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,040
Do you want to start?

595
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,240
You can start.

596
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,760
You're picking a difficult one
right from the start.

597
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,160
Poncheewa would be perfect

598
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,440
as an ambassador's wife like Mrs. Rasa.

599
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,320
They're suitable for each other
like Madam Orn says.

600
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,880
I can't compete with Cheewa.

601
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,240
What are you doing? Hey.

602
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,120
-Gosh.
-Gosh, your elbow.

603
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,800
-Let me elbow you.
-Gosh.

604
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,720
Did you two date
and then fall out in Switzerland?

605
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,040
What did you fight about?

606
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:05,520
Cheewan tried
to match us up in Switzerland.

607
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,120
Did you really do that?

608
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,720
Madam Orn made her do it.

609
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,320
But she didn't ask me, her close friend,

610
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,520
if I was okay with it.

611
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,200
Well…

612
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,760
back then…

613
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,560
Madam Orn…

614
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,400
She wanted to see us

615
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:32,040
hold hands like this

616
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,520
and look lovingly
into each other's eyes like this.

617
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,240
Yes.

618
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,640
You never talked about the baby's dad.

619
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,920
You must have been furious at Mr. Saruj,

620
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,880
so I want you two
to make up with each other today.

621
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,480
Don't hold a grudge.
Just talk to each other.

622
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,560
Don't run away.

623
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,760
Sit down.

624
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:14,520
Don't you have to report
what we talk about to Great-Grandma Orn?

625
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:21,040
Does she have to report it to Madam Orn?

626
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,560
Cheewan and the others

627
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,400
want us to talk about our wedding.

628
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,440
No. I'm not getting married.

629
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,480
Let's do this then.

630
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,320
Can you tell me what you two fought about?

631
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,360
I'll mediate for you.

632
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,120
We didn't fight.

633
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,520
I don't mind if we get married.

634
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,200
Let's talk about our wedding.

635
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,000
What do you want it to be like?

636
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,600
How about this?

637
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,040
I'm sure women dream about their weddings.

638
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,280
What color is your dream wedding?

639
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,680
Well…

640
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,800
I guess it's cream and white.

641
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,880
What about you, Cheewan?

642
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,360
What?

643
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,760
Did you never dream about it
when you were small?

644
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,240
Like you're a princess or something?

645
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,040
Let me ask you this.

646
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,880
What would your dream wedding be like?

647
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,720
Well,

648
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,600
there would be a lot of trees.

649
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,320
What did you say?

650
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,600
Do you want a wedding with a lot of trees?

651
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,280
I'll arrange that for you.

652
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,440
Nop.

653
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,800
If you've got what you came for,
then leave.

654
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,320
I'll never marry you.

655
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,040
It'll never happen.

656
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,040
What?

657
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,120
Go on.

658
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,040
Okay.

659
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,840
I want to drink something
stronger than this.

660
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,800
What are you doing?

661
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:48,480
Nop and Venus want to have
pad kaprao for dinner.

662
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,680
This is the herb garden.

663
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:56,960
Cheewan.

664
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,040
Do you really want me to marry Poncheewa?

665
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,320
Yes.

666
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,400
Two people I love are getting married,

667
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,280
so I'm happy.

668
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,440
Do you really love me?

669
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,280
Well,

670
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:22,760
you're an adult who I love and respect.

671
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,520
That's it.

672
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,720
Does that mean

673
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,800
you really do love me then?

674
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:39,400
My cousins are all married.

675
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,840
I attended all of their weddings.

676
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,920
I love weddings so much.

677
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,520
Weddings?

678
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,800
After you get married,
you need to buy a house.

679
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:53,240
The wife must take care
of the house and her husband.

680
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,960
And their children.

681
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,440
She has to take care
of the children for decades.

682
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,200
Then she just grows old.

683
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,760
Let me ask you this.

684
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,880
When does a woman get
to live her own life?

685
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:09,320
She shares her life with her husband
and their family. What's wrong with that?

686
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,440
Two people

687
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,040
with different ideas and dreams

688
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,000
must share a life.

689
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,360
One plus one now equals one.

690
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,680
Two dreams become one.

691
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,160
It's a very tough job.

692
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,760
One plus one isn't one.

693
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,640
Two dreams don't become one,

694
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,440
they multiply.

695
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,360
This means,

696
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,640
if there's love

697
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:40,880
and understanding,

698
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,280
one person will support

699
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,360
the dreams of the other person.

700
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,000
They'll encourage each other.

701
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:50,360
And all of their dreams will come true.

702
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,120
Hold on.

703
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,880
Let's go again.

704
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:58,080
You and Poncheewa were in a relationship
and she got pregnant.

705
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,800
And then you had a fight

706
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,280
and you drifted apart. Is that right?

707
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,120
Yes.

708
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,240
And now you're having a baby together.

709
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,920
You two should talk it out

710
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,880
and be good parents to this child.

711
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,720
Do you intend to do that?

712
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,760
Then let me be honest with you.

713
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,600
You're terrible.

714
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,920
You don't care about Poncheewa at all.

715
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,760
You should take responsibility
for your actions.

716
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,960
It was fine when you didn't know
she was pregnant, but now you do.

717
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,920
You should be doing more,

718
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,120
not playing around like this.

719
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,440
So what should I do?

720
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,480
I wonder

721
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,840
what I should do.

722
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,280
I have no idea.

723
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,160
Nop.

724
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,280
Thank you.

725
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,760
-Nop.
-Hey.

726
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,240
Hello.

727
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,440
-Hello.
-Hello.

728
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,040
Poom, you came.

729
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:23,520
Venus, is it okay if I join you?

730
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,280
Of course.

731
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,240
Thank you.

732
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,000
Let's play a match.

733
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,000
Sure.

734
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,040
When I found out,

735
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,720
I was very shocked.

736
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,280
Is Saruj really the child's dad?

737
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,760
I left my base and came here right away.

738
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,760
I don't think Saruj and I…

739
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,200
Don't you want to marry him?

740
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:10,000
I knew it wasn't him.

741
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,520
Saruj wants to test Cheewan's feelings,

742
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,600
but please don't tell anyone.

743
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:18,880
Okay.

744
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,200
So he's not the dad,

745
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,080
but once things have settled down,

746
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,640
can I be the baby's dad?

747
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,240
Not you as well.

748
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,480
I can take care of myself and my baby.

749
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,760
I don't need anyone to pity me.

750
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:37,680
I'm not pitying you. I just…

751
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,560
Do you know what's funny?

752
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,440
When this baby was dadless,

753
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,160
everyone made a big deal out of it
as if it was the end of the world.

754
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,680
But as soon as Saruj said he was the dad,

755
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,440
everyone was relieved
as if the problem had disappeared.

756
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,480
Isn't that correct?

757
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,040
No.

758
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:57,320
Do you think it's right
for two people to get married

759
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,280
out of responsibility

760
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,080
when they don't love each other?

761
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:04,160
You're still so young.
How are you so strong?

762
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,360
Let me be honest with you, Cheewa.

763
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,560
I feel a connection with this child.

764
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,320
I sense that…

765
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,880
I won't get to be the baby's dad
because I pity you.

766
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,040
I'm much stronger now.

767
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,440
All of you have really helped me.

768
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,760
Thank you for everything, Poom,

769
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,520
but I'm all good now.

770
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,920
Why are you pushing me away?

771
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,440
Am I not like your brother?

772
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,560
I just want to train myself to be strong.

773
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,880
I want to stand on my own two feet.

774
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,160
You'll have your own life

775
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,200
and family in the future.

776
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,440
Both you and Saruj.

777
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:52,160
So wouldn't it be better
for me to try standing on my own now?

778
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,040
I beat Nop, Cheewa!

779
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,600
No, it was just a fluke.

780
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,000
-Clearly a fluke.
-How about another match?

781
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,280
-Do you want to?
-Let's go.

782
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,000
-Come on then.
-Hey, wait up.

783
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,400
They remind me of you when you were young.

784
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,080
When I was young?

785
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,280
What do you mean?

786
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,400
Mr. Dirty.

787
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:27,240
-Yes.
-That's it. Go to the right.

788
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:28,840
-Go to the left.
-That's it.

789
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,680
-Pass it to me.
-That's it. Shoot.

790
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,720
That's it.

791
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,120
-Let's play another game.
-Sure, let's go again.

792
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,520
We can't lose.

793
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,920
Let's go to the left first.

794
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,360
-Right.
-Easy.

795
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,440
-That's it.
-Pass it here.

796
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,640
Judging from the knock, it must be…

797
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,800
-Poncheewa.
-Poncheewa.

798
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,920
It's time for dinner.

799
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,680
Go and have it now.

800
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:01,240
We'll play one more game, then we'll go.

801
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,400
Hey.

802
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,880
-Cheewa, I haven't saved the game.
-Hey.

803
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,240
Do you want me to confiscate it?

804
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:11,880
Vit.

805
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,400
Let her confiscate it.
I'll bring mine here.

806
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:15,520
-Right.
-Yes.

807
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:19,200
Were you planning
on going home at all, Ronnapoom?

808
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,360
You have been here two nights already.

809
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,920
You haven't showered or washed your hair.

810
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,040
And the room is a mess.

811
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,400
You're so dirty.

812
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,960
You two don't seem very noble to me.

813
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,480
She's so fierce.

814
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,200
Is she my sister or my mom?

815
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,280
She's your mom. She's so fierce.

816
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,200
But let's not waste our time.

817
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,200
-Let's plug it in and continue our game.
-Yes.

818
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,960
-Let's play.
-Don't let her take it.

819
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,200
Actually, you're not a dirty person.

820
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,680
You're determined.

821
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,440
You can do things
you're passionate about all day.

822
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,400
You forget everything else.

823
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,280
Otherwise, you wouldn't be an F-16 pilot.

824
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,560
You really seem to know me,

825
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,440
even though we hardly ever talk.

826
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:16,640
Now I regret not taking the chance
to get to know you better.

827
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,400
And now that we've met again,

828
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,440
you've already grown up.

829
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,240
You trained so hard.

830
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:27,400
Vit always complained
that you had no time for him.

831
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,760
Cheewa.

832
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,440
I want to talk to you
about the baby's dad.

833
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,440
Stop right there.

834
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,960
Don't mention him

835
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,480
or I'll leave.

836
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:45,320
Can I just ask you a simple question?

837
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:46,880
Please don't ask me

838
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,280
or else, I won't talk to you.

839
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,920
I just wanted to ask you

840
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,480
if you had thought of giving
the dad a chance.

841
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,400
I already gave him a chance.

842
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,880
It was the time
I suffered the most in my life.

843
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:08,560
I waited for him,

844
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:12,360
but then I found out that he deceived me.

845
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:54,360
What's the time?

846
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:01,560
Nop.

847
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:05,520
Are you still thinking about it?

848
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,480
Cheewan didn't mean it.

849
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:15,640
Do you know what I'm mad about?

850
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:21,080
Cheewan is in a bad mood today.

851
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:23,960
If you love her,

852
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:26,320
you must continue trying.

853
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,440
Even though she said
she won't marry you today,

854
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,880
she will in the future.

855
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,800
She turned me down,

856
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,200
so I can't help but feel discouraged.

857
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,440
Come on, Nop.

858
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:47,440
You're handsome

859
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,720
with a degree in engineering.

860
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:52,040
You also own a business,

861
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,480
even though you haven't graduated yet.

862
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,840
A guy with qualifications like you

863
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:02,400
can't get easily discouraged like this.

864
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:13,400
If Cheewan isn't interested in you,

865
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:16,680
there are still many women out there

866
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,440
who are interested in you.

867
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:21,280
There's one sitting here

868
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,160
next to you.

869
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:27,920
You're drunk.

870
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,920
No, I'm not drunk.

871
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,680
I'm serious.

872
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:41,520
I really love you.

873
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:49,000
I hope you'll love yourself more

874
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:52,000
and not sulk like this.

875
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,480
Please, Nop.

876
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,680
My Nop.

877
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:05,000
Why do we have to make our lives so hard?

878
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,200
We just have to love
the person who loves us.

879
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:12,040
-Isn't that enough?
-Yes.

880
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:15,160
Loving someone who sees our value

881
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:17,760
is much easier.

882
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,120
Venus.

883
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:31,600
Nop.

884
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,760
So what's going on?

885
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,640
I don't know.

886
01:03:58,440 --> 01:03:59,480
What about you, Chat?

887
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:05,000
What about you?

888
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,080
No idea.

889
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,960
Why did it turn out to be Cheewa?

890
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:16,160
Hey, he's here.

891
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,400
So what happened?

892
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:33,440
Why are you all here today?

893
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:36,560
Well, there's a big problem.

894
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,680
What did you expect us to do?

895
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:41,720
I'm confused.

896
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:45,200
You're marrying Poncheewa
all of a sudden, not Cheewan.

897
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,720
Explain what's going on right now.

898
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:52,040
If you try giving us
the silent treatment again,

899
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:55,440
I'll kick your ass for real.

900
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,040
What's really going on?

901
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:02,440
Is it a love triangle between you,
Cheewan, and Cheewa?

902
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:06,640
It's not.

903
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,320
Poncheewa doesn't love me.

904
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,200
She isn't interested in me.

905
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:13,760
Hold on.

906
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,080
Does that mean

907
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:20,920
you're not the dad of Poncheewa's baby?

908
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,160
I'm not,

909
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:27,920
but I told Poncheewa
that I'd be her baby's dad.

910
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,360
Great-Grandma should be happy

911
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:32,600
because she tried to match us up.

912
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,920
Don't marry her.

913
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,520
I'll talk to Great-Grandma for you.

914
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,080
It's okay.

915
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,360
This is for the best.

916
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:41,800
-What?
-What?

917
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:46,840
Cheewan turned me down.

918
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,840
She's scared of being tied down.

919
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:50,680
She's terrified of it.

920
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:52,200
But I think that…

921
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,280
she has feelings for me.

922
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:57,400
She has feelings for you,

923
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,240
but she doesn't want
to be your girlfriend?

924
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,600
Well, she's still young.

925
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,720
Young women these days are skillful
and smart.

926
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,640
They don't agree to marriage easily.

927
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:12,240
Take Kwanruetai, for example.

928
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,760
That was such hard work.

929
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:17,360
But I'm not young.

930
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,160
I can't wait anymore.

931
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:23,400
I must make her realize her own feelings

932
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,760
and my importance to her.

933
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,760
By making her jealous

934
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:31,040
and making her fight for you?

935
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:34,160
I see.

936
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,360
You're smart, aren't you?

937
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,440
Who is it?

938
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:46,680
Don't disturb us. We're busy.

939
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:50,600
It's me, Cheewan. I'll come back later.

940
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:53,640
Hey, no. Come back here.

941
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:55,360
What do you want to tell us?

942
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:00,920
Cheewan, stop right there.

943
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:05,560
Just tell us what you want to say.

944
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,840
I only want to talk to Mr. Saruj.

945
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:13,000
No, just say it out loud.

946
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,640
We want to know too.

947
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:19,440
Madam Orn wants to see you.

948
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:23,600
She wants to know how the plans
for your wedding are going.

949
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,800
I see.

950
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:29,680
I'll go there when I'm free.

951
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,560
Okay.

952
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,120
Hold on, Cheewan.

953
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,960
You're a great cook.

954
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,720
We all love your food.

955
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:45,200
What does Saruj like to eat?

956
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,480
Lon puu kem.

957
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:48,880
I see.

958
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,520
What about me?

959
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:56,880
I don't know.

960
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:00,360
What? Why do you remember his favorite

961
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:02,200
but not mine?

962
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:08,960
And what about me? What do I like to eat?

963
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:12,080
You…

964
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,359
I'm not sure.

965
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:19,760
-Come on.
-Gosh.

966
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:22,760
Chat, she doesn't love me.

967
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:24,600
Help me, Chat.

968
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:29,000
And what about my favorite dish?

969
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:33,160
I don't know.

970
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:36,680
My gosh, you don't remember.

971
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:38,399
Cheewan doesn't love me either.

972
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:40,359
-This hurts.
-There, there.

973
01:08:40,439 --> 01:08:41,960
-It's okay.
-It's okay, Petch.

974
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:44,840
Why don't you ask your wives for love?

975
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,279
Why are you asking me for it?

976
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,080
Well…

977
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,960
She's right.

978
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,520
What about mine?

979
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:56,760
You played with me the most
when you were young.

980
01:08:57,279 --> 01:08:58,439
You must remember.

981
01:08:58,520 --> 01:08:59,560
That's right.

982
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,279
Is it omelet or sour soup?

983
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:07,479
I don't like either of them.

984
01:09:08,359 --> 01:09:10,279
Cheewan doesn't love me, Saruj.

985
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:12,240
Come here.

986
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:15,040
And who do you love?

987
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,080
Right.

988
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:18,560
Who do you love?

989
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:20,120
Who do you love?

990
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:22,960
-Right. Who do you love?
-Who do you love?

991
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:26,040
-I don't know either.
-Is it someone around here?

992
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:32,520
You love me.

993
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,240
What?

994
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,200
That's right.

995
01:09:36,279 --> 01:09:38,160
You love Saruj.

996
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,120
You love Saruj.

997
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,640
That's right. You all heard it, right?

998
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,279
Cheewan loves Saruj.

999
01:09:44,359 --> 01:09:45,359
-Yes.
-Yes.

1000
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:49,000
That's not true. No. I don't love him.

1001
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:50,760
She doesn't love us.

1002
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:52,359
She only loves Saruj.

1003
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,920
Did you all hear

1004
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,440
that Cheewan loves Saruj only?

1005
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,200
My gosh.

1006
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:04,040
You're crazy.

1007
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:05,320
What are you playing at?

1008
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,920
You're all crazy.

1009
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,160
You're just crazy.

1010
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:11,160
Gosh, I'm not talking to you anymore.

1011
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:16,320
Hey, be careful.

1012
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:17,720
Come.

1013
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:21,120
-Five monkeys!
-Five monkeys!

1014
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,280
For an evil plan like this,

1015
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:30,880
our dads can't compete with us.

1016
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,000
That's why we're called the five monkeys.

1017
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,520
Hold on.

1018
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,040
I think you should go for her.

1019
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:39,360
-You'll get her for sure.
-That's right.

1020
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:06,600
You had a lawyer file for divorce
so you can be with your lover?

1021
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,560
Watch your mouth.

1022
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,200
I'm going to sue you too.

1023
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:11,880
Mrs. Mus will be single soon.

1024
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:14,000
You can be with her
as you wish after that.

1025
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,360
I can't take this anymore.

1026
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:18,120
-Take this!
-Gosh, Cheewan.

1027
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:21,440
You're finally getting
your first and only love.

1028
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:22,800
Is this for Poncheewa's sake?

1029
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,160
Yes, I'm so angry I'm burning.

1030
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:25,880
No, I don't love you.

1031
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:28,360
I don't love you.

1032
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:30,040
That's your problem,

1033
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:31,400
but I love you.

1034
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:33,640
Saruj did that to me.

1035
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:36,120
Why didn't he just kill me?

1036
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,640
-Cheewan.
-Come on.

1037
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:38,960
What's with him?

1038
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:42,120
-Cheewan, don't do that.
-No, Cheewan.

1039
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:12,360
