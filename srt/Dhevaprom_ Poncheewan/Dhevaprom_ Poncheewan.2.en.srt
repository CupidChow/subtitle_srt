1
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,000
That means you prefer Thai women, right?

2
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,480
See? He said yes!

3
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,800
- I didn't answer.
- He didn't answer.

4
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,880
I heard that when this happens,
you should put your thumbs together…

5
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,640
and make a wish.

6
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,560
Your wishes will come true.

7
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,600
What are you doing?

8
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,400
Do you think you'd pass a urine test?

9
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,160
Cheewa got herself a boyfriend.

10
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,760
And that man is

11
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,640
Mr. Saruj!

12
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,160
The Jutathep era is over.

13
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,040
- I'll make sure you--
- No.

14
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,720
Cheewa.

15
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,120
Cheewa.

16
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,560
Can you do this quiz for me?

17
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,240
This one.

18
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,840
"What kind of person is your soulmate?"

19
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,960
What is this?

20
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,400
Just fill it out for fun.

21
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,920
How have you been recently?

22
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,920
I'm good.

23
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,520
How about we go
on a boat trip this Saturday?

24
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,000
Can you afford it?

25
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,520
Have you come into some money?

26
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,680
I'll invite Mr. Saruj.
I'm sure he'll pay for it.

27
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,240
Sure.

28
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,279
Okay.

29
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,880
Mr. Saruj.

30
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,160
Hello.

31
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,680
Aren't you going to stand up?

32
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,760
I was waiting for you to say that.

33
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,800
Where is Poncheewa?

34
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,680
I told her to meet us here.
She'll be here soon.

35
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,600
I'll go and buy the tickets then.

36
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,080
Okay.

37
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,400
My gosh.

38
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,320
Gosh.

39
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,920
My stomach hurts.

40
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,720
It must be diarrhea.

41
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,760
What?

42
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,880
You two get on the boat first.

43
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,200
I'll wait over there.

44
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,040
Just go.

45
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,960
I can't hold it anymore.

46
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,920
What's wrong with her?

47
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,400
Let's go.

48
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,560
Okay.

49
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,080
You may not want to talk to each other,

50
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,800
but you will have to

51
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,360
if you're on the boat together.

52
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,640
Why is Cheewa still not here?

53
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,400
The boat leaves in five minutes.

54
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,280
Can I borrow your phone?

55
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,240
Thank you.

56
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,400
I'm sorry,

57
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,080
but today, I…

58
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,040
I have diarrhea.

59
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,120
What? You can't do this.

60
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,160
I'm supposed to have diarrhea.

61
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,160
- What?
- Can you really not make it?

62
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,960
I'm sorry, Cheewan.

63
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,400
Please tell Saruj I'm sorry.

64
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,280
What am I going to do?

65
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,320
Let's do some quizzes.

66
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,480
Women seem to love those things.

67
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,960
You even have books of them.

68
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,600
I'll ask you questions.
All you need to do is answer me.

69
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,080
"How do you like your food?"

70
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,240
"A. Bland."

71
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,040
"B. Flavorful."

72
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,560
"C. Depends on the food."

73
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,120
You aren't trying to gather
my personal information, are you?

74
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,920
No.

75
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,040
I'm not.

76
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,920
Depends on the food.

77
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,440
"Where do you like to go on holiday?"

78
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,640
"A. The mountains."

79
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,680
"B. The beach."

80
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,240
"C. The forest."

81
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,880
The beach.

82
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,880
"What kind of person
do you like to chat with?"

83
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,120
"A. Someone who talks less than you."

84
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,080
"B. Someone who talks more than you."

85
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,800
"C. Someone who talks as much as you."

86
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,679
Someone who talks more than me.

87
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,159
He likes someone who talks more than him?

88
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,280
Oh dear, Cheewa isn't talkative.

89
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,640
What was her answer again?

90
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,960
What?

91
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,880
She also likes someone
who talks more than her.

92
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,560
My goodness.

93
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,640
So you like someone
who talks more than you?

94
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,640
Yes.

95
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,440
I like someone
who keeps the conversation going.

96
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,440
Someone who can be serious,

97
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,240
but also talks nonsense.

98
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,320
Is that so?

99
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,880
Well then,

100
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,040
let's go to the next question.

101
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,120
"What kind of person is pretty
in your eyes?"

102
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,720
"A. Someone who is prim and gentle."

103
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,040
"B. Someone who is elegant and perfect."

104
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,640
"C. Someone who is upbeat

105
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,200
and has a sense of humor."

106
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,960
Someone who is upbeat
and has a sense of humor.

107
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,640
This means Poncheewa isn't his type.

108
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,680
If he liked her, he would have said
someone elegant.

109
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,680
What did you answer again, Cheewa?

110
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,720
Saruj is B,
because he's elegant and perfect.

111
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,800
But Cheewa picked C. She also likes
someone with a sense of humor.

112
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,640
Gosh.

113
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,960
Well then,

114
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,040
let's move on to the next question.

115
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,760
"What kind of person
do you like to spend time with?"

116
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,200
"A. A skillful person."

117
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,040
"B. A funny person."

118
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,520
A funny person who is smart.

119
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,400
Who is Cheewa talking to?

120
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
She's all smiles.

121
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,920
I grew up with her
but I've never seen her like this.

122
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,640
I need to go.

123
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,960
Hey, Cheewan.

124
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,920
Who were you talking to?

125
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,880
A friend.

126
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,800
A girl or a guy?

127
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,320
Why?

128
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,840
Forget it. Let's go and see Mr. Saruj.

129
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,840
Let's go.

130
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,280
Why don't we talk about our childhood?

131
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,120
Cheewa, tell us.

132
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,720
What do you remember about Mr. Saruj?

133
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,920
The New Year party.

134
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,720
We had celebrated every day
since Christmas.

135
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,600
It went on for a week.

136
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,240
That's right.

137
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,600
Great-Grandma Orn knew
my family would be free,

138
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,520
so she threw a big party

139
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,320
as she wanted us to meet our relatives.

140
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,440
Does anyone want some cake?

141
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,160
Gosh, help me.

142
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,800
- Merry Christmas.
- Hey.

143
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,200
I'm here.

144
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,240
- It was so fun.
- It was so exhausting.

145
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,240
- I wish you happiness.
- I wish you happiness.

146
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,280
For Cheewa, it was a happy time.

147
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,120
For Cheewan, it was exhausting.

148
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,840
You were both in the same place,

149
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,880
but you have different perspectives on it.

150
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,800
What about you?
What do you remember of that day?

151
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,320
You don't remember me, do you?

152
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,440
Here you go, Mr. Phu.

153
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,320
- Thank you.
- Gosh.

154
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,880
- It looks good.
- I want one.

155
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,200
- I want one.
- There's no more ice cream.

156
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,160
I'm sorry.

157
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,800
- Come on, Cheewan.
- We waited so long.

158
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,160
- I want some.
- I didn't get any.

159
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,880
- I want some.
- I was waiting.

160
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,720
- Phu.
- Come here.

161
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,760
- Come here.
- Share it with us.

162
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,640
Help.

163
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,080
Share it with me. If not,
I won't count you as my cousin anymore.

164
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,320
Give it to me, Phu.

165
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,440
- Jon.
- Yes.

166
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,720
Can you order some more ice cream?

167
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,880
Take it to Cheewan
at Great-Grandma Orn's house.

168
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,320
Okay.

169
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,880
- Thank you.
- No worries.

170
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,560
Ms. Cheewan.

171
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,920
What is it, Jon?

172
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,440
Come here.

173
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,680
Here you go.

174
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,760
My master ordered some ice cream for you.

175
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,480
My gosh, is this really for me?

176
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,880
Yes.

177
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,240
What are you laughing about?

178
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,520
It's nothing.

179
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,960
Just finish your food.

180
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,200
There's a letter from Thailand for you.

181
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,360
Thank you.

182
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,000
I met with Cheewa the other day,

183
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,800
but I didn't tell you about it.

184
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,040
Really?

185
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,920
I gave her some French CDs

186
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
because she needed some music
for an assignment.

187
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,160
I see.

188
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,800
I asked her about Mr. Saruj.

189
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,080
She said they're not dating.

190
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,320
What? Did Cheewa say that?

191
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,600
I was so relieved and happy.

192
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,880
I wanted to ask your permission

193
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,280
to date Poncheewa.

194
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,160
Well, it's up to her. I'm just her friend.
I don't have a say in it.

195
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,960
Thank you.

196
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,560
The sky is really beautiful today.

197
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,840
It's really pretty. Look at it.

198
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,040
His face looks exactly
like Cheewa's the other day.

199
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,360
Was that guy Simon?

200
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,440
I've already checked
with people at the embassy.

201
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,880
Poncheewa never comes here.

202
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,520
She isn't his girlfriend.
They're not together.

203
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,040
Hey, listen.

204
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,200
You should get to work in his office now.

205
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,760
Mr. Saruj will be here soon.

206
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,600
Work hard.

207
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,000
I'll do my best.

208
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,080
Very well, my dear.

209
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,320
Good morning, Mr. Saruj.

210
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,000
Hello.

211
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,320
Hello.

212
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,280
I'm really sorry I put a desk

213
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,800
in your office without asking you first.

214
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,720
What's going on?

215
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,760
Venus is doing an internship here.

216
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,040
With me?

217
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,320
That's right.

218
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,400
She's the daughter
of a permanent secretary.

219
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,520
If she does her internship
with somebody else,

220
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,320
they'll say I sent my daughter
to find fault in what they do,

221
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,440
so I thought it'd be better
if she worked in the same office as you.

222
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,480
Okay.

223
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,960
Anything you need help with,

224
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,440
she can assist you.

225
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,520
Now that you two will be alone together,

226
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,760
take this opportunity
to get to know each other.

227
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,640
Since you're still single,

228
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,920
why don't you give Venus a chance?

229
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,240
Okay.

230
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,200
You must go there once.

231
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,160
Come on, Cheewan.

232
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,080
I'm sorry to interrupt.

233
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,440
What is it, Ms. Chaluay?

234
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,680
Mr. Saruj needs your help urgently
at the embassy.

235
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,760
Help with what?

236
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,200
"It's a terrible business.

237
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,880
Only Cheewan can do it."

238
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,640
He said that.

239
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,080
- Like that?
- Yes.

240
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,440
Let's go before it's too late.

241
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,640
Let's go.

242
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,160
Venus is a smart girl.

243
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,160
I spent a million baht
on her programming degree.

244
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,280
I want her to get a job
that's suitable for her.

245
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,680
This gongchak stamp is so pretty.

246
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,480
Every envelope looks great.

247
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,000
Be it Pascal, C,

248
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,680
or algorithms,

249
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,320
she can do all of it.

250
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,680
Dear Lord,

251
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,080
since I'm doing this so perfectly

252
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,720
and helping the temple out,

253
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,800
please bless me with wealth.

254
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,400
She can also use DOS and Windows.

255
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,640
Hey, I changed the position,

256
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,440
but it's still perfect.

257
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,680
Look at this, Mom.

258
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,640
Just do whatever it is you're doing.
Sit there and do it.

259
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,080
Sure.

260
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,160
I'll leave her to you.

261
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,920
Please make way for a human removal unit.

262
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,240
I mean insects.

263
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,880
Who are you?

264
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,080
Cheewan?

265
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,760
I'm sorry, I forgot to inform you

266
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,080
that today is
the annual pest control inspection.

267
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,920
My gosh.

268
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,120
Hey.

269
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,240
That's enough. Stop it.

270
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,720
Stop it. That's enough.

271
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,680
Can't you wait
for us to leave the room first?

272
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,920
- Gosh.
- Please hurry up.

273
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,520
I still have a lot to do.

274
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,120
Is the embassy closed today?

275
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,000
No, I'm only doing this room

276
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,640
because there are some pests in here.

277
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,760
I'm really sorry about this,

278
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,840
but please leave the room now.

279
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,520
There's not much space outside.

280
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,200
How about we go to your apartment?

281
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,080
I'll have to spray his apartment too.

282
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,920
I told you there are pests there too.

283
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,120
Okay, fine.

284
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,120
Tomorrow is a holiday.

285
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,800
Let's meet at your apartment.

286
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,840
I have to clean my apartment tomorrow.

287
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,120
Cheewan is doing it for me. Right?

288
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,760
That's right.

289
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,520
I need to get rid of all the pests.

290
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,360
Poncheewa will also be there tomorrow,

291
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,360
so he can't receive other visitors.

292
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,520
Just you wait. I won't give up just yet.

293
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,840
Venus, that's enough. Let's leave.

294
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,520
What? I'm having fun here.

295
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,120
We're going home. Now.

296
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,120
Okay.

297
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,800
Come on.

298
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,080
This way, please.

299
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,920
We did it.

300
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,640
My gosh, you're the best guard dog.

301
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,080
You made the right decision
choosing her for this job.

302
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,840
The position sounds so honorable,
Ms. Chaluay.

303
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,880
Please pay me a salary too.

304
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,960
You did a great job. Thank you.

305
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,840
So do you really want me

306
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,480
to clean your apartment?

307
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,480
Of course.

308
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,280
I'm sorry to ask this,

309
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,600
but you'll pay in cash, right?

310
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,320
Yes! Can I be your regular cleaner?

311
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,240
I have an exam.

312
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,480
You go to Saruj's house on your own.

313
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,560
Can't you come?

314
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,960
Come on.

315
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,760
I failed my test last time
because my music lacked emotion.

316
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,880
Emotion in your music?

317
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,440
What emotion?

318
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,920
Love.

319
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,120
In that case, why don't you do this?

320
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,160
Come to Mr. Saruj's place tomorrow.

321
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,160
Let him explain it to you.

322
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,640
Have Saruj explain love?

323
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,120
I have an exam tomorrow.

324
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,600
Don't forget to root for me. Bye.

325
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,280
What?

326
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,080
Gosh, Cheewa.

327
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,080
With your encouragement,

328
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,640
I'll pass this exam.

329
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,200
I'm sorry.

330
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,680
PONCHEEWA

331
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,520
Madam Orn told me
all your cousins have girlfriends now.

332
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,000
What about you?

333
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,760
Have you ever had a girlfriend?

334
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,480
Look at you.

335
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,320
You're smiling.

336
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,240
Is that a diplomat's way of saying maybe?

337
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,320
And now your smile is even wider.

338
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,120
That means yes, right?

339
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,920
I remember now.

340
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,720
Someone told me you once had a girlfriend.

341
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,880
You were in high school together

342
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,800
and went to study overseas together.

343
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,600
You're looking away.

344
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,480
Are you going to say you never had one?

345
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,840
It means I'm sad.

346
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,760
It's a sad story.

347
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,160
I'm sorry.

348
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,840
That woman ditched me
to marry someone else.

349
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,720
I'm sick and I had to go and see
a doctor by myself.

350
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,520
What's wrong? What did the doctor say?

351
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,680
Saruj.

352
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,760
We came here to study by ourselves,

353
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,000
but you left me on my own.

354
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,320
I had to do some work for the embassy.

355
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
You study and work

356
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,200
for more than ten hours a day.

357
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,280
You act like I'm not important to you.

358
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,600
Are you bored of me?

359
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,040
No.

360
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,320
I just had to work on an important project
the ambassador assigned me.

361
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,600
I've never been bored of you.

362
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,080
I always do things for you.

363
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,960
You've never sent me flowers

364
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,560
or cards…

365
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,920
or even told me you love me.

366
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,680
Is that word important?

367
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,280
I love you.

368
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,760
We've always been so close.

369
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,840
We were friends at school.

370
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,120
We've been this way since we were kids.

371
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,280
- So I thought--
- You thought I didn't need your attention.

372
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,480
Is that what you think?

373
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,480
You only think of your boss,

374
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,480
your studies, and your work.

375
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,280
You never think of me.

376
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,520
I've never been important to you.

377
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,440
I can't take this anymore.

378
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,960
I can't.

379
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,960
People think the Jutatheps are perfect.

380
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,720
We're not.

381
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,760
If you get to know me properly,

382
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,200
you see I'm just a boring person.

383
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,880
I don't think so.

384
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,880
You're not boring.

385
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,720
I'm not good at talking
and I don't know how to please others.

386
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,000
I forget about everything
when I'm working.

387
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,240
I don't think any woman could tolerate me.

388
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,840
That's not true.

389
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,800
She just picked the wrong person.

390
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,640
You don't need to console me. I'm okay.

391
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,680
They say one thing,

392
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,440
you say something else.

393
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,800
Do you get what I mean?

394
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,240
What does that mean?

395
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,640
Do you want to know?

396
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,760
Let's play head, shoulder, butt first.

397
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,800
- I'll jump straight to the punishment.
- Gosh.

398
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,560
You're supposed to use a tray,
not your fist.

399
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,600
Gosh, were you trying to kill me?

400
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,360
You're so mean.

401
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,520
European students are all rich.

402
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,440
I feel so inferior to them
because I'm poor.

403
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,200
One time,

404
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,040
when I was sweeping the floor,

405
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,680
someone threw a piece of trash
and it hit my head.

406
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,360
They didn't apologize.

407
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,640
They didn't even look at me.

408
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,440
Didn't you say not to dwell on things?

409
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,320
Are you really upset about it?

410
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,160
I'm a human.

411
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,080
I do have feelings.

412
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,560
I didn't feel this way
when I lived in the countryside.

413
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,760
But when I went to Bangkok,

414
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,200
to Jutathep Palace,

415
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,320
I saw people with beautiful things

416
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,320
that I didn't have.

417
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,360
But I just have to accept it.

418
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,440
I'm just a servant.

419
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,720
Mrs. Kratin is a Mom Luang

420
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,560
and your dad owns a rubber plantation.

421
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,360
But my mom said
I'm different from all of you.

422
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,040
It's true.

423
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,080
We're completely different.

424
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,760
I wouldn't dare consider myself
your relative.

425
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,920
No wonder

426
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,880
you're so formal with me.

427
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,719
Whenever I'm sad,

428
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,639
I tell myself this.

429
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,480
They may say I'm poor,

430
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,960
but does that mean
I have to think of myself that way?

431
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,800
No.

432
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,440
It doesn't matter what they say.

433
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,880
What's important is what I tell myself.

434
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,360
And what do you tell yourself?

435
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,440
When they say I'm poor,

436
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,600
I tell myself I'm a fighter.

437
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:47,000
When they say I'm disgusting,

438
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,600
I tell myself I'm good.

439
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,840
I persevere for a better future.

440
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,639
When they say I'm boring…

441
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:57,520
You should just say you're a bit serious.

442
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,200
When they say they're going to ditch me…

443
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,640
Tell them to go ahead

444
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,840
because you can find a new one.

445
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,320
Your eyes are sparkling.

446
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,760
You like it, right?

447
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,720
That will be five francs.

448
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,200
Here you go.

449
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,120
I just finished it.

450
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,760
Throw it away for me.

451
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,040
Mr. Saruj, this is trash.

452
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,680
It's not five francs.

453
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,240
It's not even one franc.

454
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,800
Do you feel better now?

455
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,800
Cheewa.

456
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,040
Hey, watch out.

457
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,680
I took a train here

458
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,920
to give you

459
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,160
some flowers.

460
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,960
They're so pretty.

461
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,280
Do you like them?

462
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,720
Today,

463
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,120
you look very pretty.

464
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,640
I need to go to class now.

465
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,880
Okay.

466
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,440
Goodbye.

467
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,080
Bye.

468
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,320
You've finished your exams, right?
You can come to Mr. Saruj's house now.

469
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,720
I haven't finished yet.

470
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,760
Why don't you go and see Saruj?

471
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,480
Hey, Cheewa.

472
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,680
Are you dating--

473
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,960
No, I'm busy with my studies.

474
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,200
I'm going then.

475
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,400
Can you be quiet?

476
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,680
I'm sorry.

477
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,880
Sometimes, Mr. Saruj is very strict.

478
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,680
Would Cheewa like a strict guy?

479
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,720
On weekdays, he works until late at night.

480
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,400
He also does this on weekends.

481
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,280
When will he have time to court someone?

482
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,480
How will I set him up with Poncheewa?

483
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,320
Here is your food.

484
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,800
Here you go.

485
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,240
Why don't you eat with me?

486
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,320
It's okay. You go ahead.

487
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,120
Go and get your food

488
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,440
and join me.

489
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,520
Sure.

490
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,880
That's better.

491
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,840
Is it good?

492
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,560
Yes.

493
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,360
I made it specially for you.

494
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,600
You're a good cook.

495
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,960
Thank you so much.

496
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,760
Your compliments won't fill my stomach.

497
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,360
But a tip

498
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,440
would work.

499
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,400
Why are you laughing?

500
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:22,040
You're so cute when you smile and laugh.

501
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,160
You should do it more often.

502
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,160
Do you mean it?

503
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,520
Yes.

504
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,920
Hey, Poncheewa said
she had a fever yesterday.

505
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,440
I thought I'd visit her this evening.

506
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,200
Do you want to come with me?

507
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,880
Do you think this is going to work?

508
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,640
What did you say?

509
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,920
That look

510
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,240
is really quite scary.

511
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,680
You don't even have to say anything.

512
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,840
Are you going to tell me?

513
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,680
Tell you?

514
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,840
Tell you what?

515
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,360
Do everything you can

516
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,600
to make sure
Saruj falls in love with Poncheewa.

517
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,640
Say it.

518
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,160
Don't tell anyone about this.

519
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,720
Say it?

520
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,520
It's nothing.

521
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,440
It's nothing at all.

522
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,000
Here is your porridge.

523
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,440
Here you go.

524
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,600
It stinks.

525
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:17,920
It stinks?

526
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,200
No, it doesn't.

527
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:26,040
You don't look well.

528
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,760
Do you want to see a doctor?

529
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,640
I don't have a fever. It's okay.

530
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,160
How about a herbal drink?
The one Madam Orn drinks.

531
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,240
Sure.

532
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,320
Okay, wait a second.

533
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,560
Wait!

534
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,960
It's not in this bag.
The first aid kit is over there.

535
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,120
Okay.

536
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,040
Where is it?

537
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,320
Here it is.

538
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,400
You go and sit down

539
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,520
while I make it for you.

540
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,920
Slowly.

541
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,720
That was good.
No wonder Madam Orn made me bring it.

542
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,840
I don't want to leave you alone,

543
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,120
but I have an exam tomorrow.

544
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,280
I'll be fine.

545
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,240
Just go.

546
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,440
Are you sure you'll be all right?

547
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,040
Of course.

548
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,280
You should go.

549
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,840
It's late.

550
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,720
You might miss the last train.

551
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,480
Take care of Cheewa for me.

552
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,920
Do you understand?

553
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,640
Just go.

554
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,320
Bye.

555
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,960
I'm pregnant.

556
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,520
I'm pregnant.

557
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,840
No.

558
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:40,800
Mr. Saruj, there is
a big problem in Thailand.

559
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,440
The Thai government announced
that they will float the Thai baht.

560
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:23,320
I should explain that in the past

561
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,200
Thailand used a fixed exchange rate
of 25 baht to the dollar.

562
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:31,160
After floating it,
the baht will depreciate to around 52.

563
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,160
This is the biggest economic crisis
the country has faced.

564
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,120
Billions of baht
of wealth is set to be lost.

565
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,160
Many businesses will have to close down.

566
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,960
A million people will be unemployed.

567
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,880
This is bad.

568
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,320
How badly will this affect us?

569
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,120
It will probably be bad.

570
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,000
Most businesses
won't have seen this coming.

571
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:58,920
This will also affect the money markets
in Asia, Europe, and the United States.

572
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,760
I can't think right now.

573
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,720
…of the stock market
in New York yesterday.

574
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,800
This is the result
of the downturn in Hong Kong.

575
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,600
This shows that…

576
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,880
Hello,

577
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,680
did you see the news?

578
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,040
I'm really sorry,

579
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,320
but can you return to Thailand?

580
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,640
What if I say that I can't?

581
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:58,840
Cheewa, things have been
chaotic in Thailand

582
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:02,360
since the Thai baht was floated.

583
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,000
Our family businesses

584
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,800
all have outstanding loans in dollars.

585
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,320
We're all in trouble right now.

586
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,440
I really can't go back.

587
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:14,520
Cheewa,

588
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,800
don't worry about university.

589
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:17,880
I've talked to them.

590
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,280
They said you can take some time off

591
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:24,000
and go back when we're ready.

592
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,760
Cheewa, I'm begging you.

593
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,240
Just come back to Thailand.

594
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:53,440
BAHT DEPRECIATES
FOREIGN DEBT UP 2 BILLION BAHT

595
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,320
Madam Orn sent me a ticket,

596
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,720
telling me to return to Thailand.

597
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:55,040
My mom wouldn't listen to me.

598
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:57,920
She kept telling me
to go back to Thailand.

599
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,280
I still haven't finished my studies.

600
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,160
I haven't even passed my English exam.

601
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,160
I can't go back.

602
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,840
I really can't.

603
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:21,080
Madam Orn can't sponsor me any longer.

604
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,160
I think I'll have to return to Thailand.

605
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,080
Goodbye.

606
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,000
The servant of the Jutatheps.

607
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,880
Cheewan.

608
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,320
Mr. Saruj.

609
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,760
I didn't think I would make it in time.

610
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,040
Did Great-Grandma Orn contact you?

611
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,160
She asked someone to buy me a ticket.

612
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,840
I'm leaving tomorrow.

613
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,400
Did you run here?

614
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,440
What if I said
I would pay your tuition fees?

615
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,640
You wouldn't have to leave.

616
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,160
Would that be a good idea?

617
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,320
The Jutatheps have many businesses.

618
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,520
With the state of the economy,
they'll have lost millions.

619
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,360
Do you want to continue your studies?

620
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,240
I want to,

621
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:48,800
but not if it causes trouble for others.

622
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,680
I'm over it.

623
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:55,080
Whether I get my degree in Thailand
or abroad, it makes no difference.

624
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,080
I just need to work to get it.

625
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,640
I haven't been doing that well here.

626
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:04,200
Let me try again in Thailand.

627
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,040
We won't get to see each other
for a long time then.

628
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,720
There's one more thing.

629
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,440
What about it?

630
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,440
I'll be working here for four years
before I return to Thailand.

631
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,520
I want to get this straight.

632
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,840
Can you just call me Saruj

633
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,760
and drop the formality?

634
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:38,160
But it's how I address all of you.

635
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,920
Ever since we were small.

636
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,000
Well, you wrote here
that you're the servant of Jutatheps.

637
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:44,520
I didn't ask you to clean my place

638
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:48,400
and take care of it for me
because I see you as a servant.

639
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,920
Don't get me wrong.

640
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,280
Is that all you're worried about?

641
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,400
I needed money,

642
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,120
so you hired me.

643
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,760
That's all it was.

644
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,560
I didn't think anything of it.

645
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,160
I don't see you as my servant.

646
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,880
What you wrote is wrong.

647
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,320
I don't like it.

648
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,280
I mean, I think of you as…

649
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,000
As what?

650
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,560
Like my sister.

651
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,480
You're my little one.

652
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,560
From now on,
I'll talk more casually with you

653
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,400
and address you like a sister.

654
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:33,720
So

655
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,840
can you drop the formality?

656
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:43,320
My gosh, Mr. Saruj.

657
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,200
Thank you.

658
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,640
I really appreciate it.

659
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:00,120
We'll have half of the world
separating us now.

660
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:02,840
I don't know
when I'll get to see you again.

661
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:17,720
An ambassador who is never in Thailand

662
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:21,480
and a girl from the country.

663
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,480
It would never work.

664
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:33,000
I'll cherish the good memories
we made together.

665
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:39,120
I'll do that too.

666
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:44,640
Switzerland will always have a place
in my heart.

667
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:18,120
I wonder how she is.

668
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:22,160
Cheewa.

669
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,400
Dad. Mom.

670
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:28,400
Gosh, I miss you so much.

671
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,840
Let me look at you.

672
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,880
I thought you would've put on weight.

673
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,640
Why are you still so slim?

674
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,960
Give me a hug. I miss you so much.

675
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,240
Dad.

676
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,560
Why are you such a crybaby?

677
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:55,160
Why are you crying?

678
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:57,640
What happened? Were you homesick?

679
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:02,160
Maybe she's afraid
she won't get to go back.

680
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,000
Don't worry, Cheewa.

681
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:10,800
The university agreed to let you go back
whenever you're ready.

682
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:15,600
No, don't cry, dear. Come here.

683
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,480
Why are you acting like a child?

684
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,080
I miss you so much.

685
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:32,960
Greetings, dear.

686
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,160
I'm sorry

687
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:39,000
I didn't keep my word

688
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:42,960
and sponsor your studies until the end.

689
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:46,080
I know the Jutatheps
have a real estate business

690
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,680
which has been badly hit.

691
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:51,400
I wouldn't want to put you out.

692
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:54,040
Many companies have closed down

693
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:57,680
and many banks will close too.

694
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,560
That's right.
A million people have lost their jobs.

695
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:05,720
Rich people are selling off their assets.

696
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:09,120
Now they call them "the once-rich people."

697
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:15,400
What did the university say
about you coming home?

698
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,920
Poncheewa can take some time off,

699
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,960
but I can't.

700
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:23,040
What?

701
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:31,880
It's because I only took
language courses there.

702
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:34,040
- I see.
- Gosh.

703
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,320
Why are you so dumb?

704
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:37,800
Come on.

705
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,560
She got some experience

706
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:43,000
and learned some language. That's enough.

707
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:48,160
I'm thinking of enrolling
at Ramkhamhaeng University.

708
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,920
I'll put more effort into it.

709
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,640
That's good.

710
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,560
You don't need to find somewhere to stay.

711
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,120
Stay here with me.

712
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,320
All right?

713
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,280
Thank you so much.

714
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:04,080
Thank you so much, Madam Orn.

715
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,280
You're welcome.

716
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:10,160
Cheewan, you must earn your keep
while staying here.

717
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:13,880
Help Jaew with the housework.
Do you understand?

718
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:15,280
Yes.

719
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:29,800
I called a family meeting today

720
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:31,560
because you've seemed down

721
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:33,600
since you came back from Switzerland.

722
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,040
Cheewa.

723
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,320
Don't be sad.

724
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:44,920
Give us about a year

725
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,840
and you can go back
and resume your studies.

726
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,000
Don't be sad.

727
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,720
It's only a year.

728
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:58,760
There are many people
in a worse situation than us.

729
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:01,280
That's right. Yesterday,

730
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:03,680
I went to a flea market.

731
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:07,080
A woman turned up in a Mercedes-Benz
to sell her Louis Vuitton bags.

732
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,040
You don't have to be embarrassed.

733
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:13,120
That's right. What about that rich guy
who is selling sandwiches now?

734
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,800
We're still alive,
so we have to continue striving.

735
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:23,720
Cheewa, why are you crying again?

736
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:26,360
That's enough. Don't cry.

737
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:30,480
Don't cry anymore.

738
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:31,840
Cheewa.

739
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,280
We're so proud of you.

740
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:35,840
Ever since you were young,

741
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,200
you've been a good girl.

742
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,600
You did well at school.

743
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,760
Meanwhile,

744
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:43,560
I misbehaved and acted out.

745
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:45,960
As for me, I'm dull.

746
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,280
I failed all my exams.

747
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:49,280
You were always top of the class

748
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:51,080
and excelled in everything.

749
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:53,240
You also received many prizes.

750
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:58,800
Don't tease her.

751
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,800
I'm just trying to tell her

752
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,360
that this is a temporary challenge.

753
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:07,040
I guarantee you have a bright future

754
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,000
ahead of you.

755
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:11,440
Don't cry, dear.

756
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:14,560
Excuse me.

757
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,240
Not anymore.

758
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,520
There's no more bright future for you.

759
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,560
Not anymore.

760
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,040
From now on,

761
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:04,480
you're a disgrace to your family.

762
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:08,240
Why, Cheewa?

763
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,600
Why?

764
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:36,840
I brought the owner
of a major construction company.

765
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:39,240
Hey, isn't that the woman in the photos?

766
01:08:39,319 --> 01:08:40,200
Saruj's ex-girlfriend.

767
01:08:40,279 --> 01:08:42,080
I'll give you 500.

768
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:43,120
What's the job?

769
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:46,640
Don't let that flame get reignited.

770
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,680
Is it appropriate for a married woman

771
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:51,680
to hold hands
with her ex-boyfriend in a private place?

772
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,120
Who are you?

773
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:56,520
I'm Cheewan, Madam Orn's servant.

774
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,399
Aren't you afraid he'll get back at you

775
01:08:58,479 --> 01:08:59,880
for having an affair with his wife?

776
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:01,680
That's nonsense.

777
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:03,319
My little one.

778
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:04,600
Hey!

779
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:10,760
Sweet dreams, my little one.

780
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:12,560
Sweet dreams,

781
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:15,120
Mr. Saruj.

782
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:45,040
