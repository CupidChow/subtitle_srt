1
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,040
And I'm Hero Saruj!

2
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,240
I'm Hero Chatklao!

3
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,040
I'm Hero Ronnajak!

4
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,440
Hold on. This is meant to be
the five monkeys. What about you?

5
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,120
Why are you here?

6
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,960
-Mus.
-Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

7
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,280
Mr. Nava won't divorce you.

8
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,800
If I have to die,

9
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,400
then I'll take you with me.

10
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,960
You're crazy.

11
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,200
We'll do our best

12
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,760
to bring Saruj back to Thailand.

13
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,800
What is it, Cheewan?

14
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,880
She said Saruj would be here
for a meeting and for work.

15
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,960
Gosh, date, time, and meeting venue?

16
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,040
Did you get it all?

17
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,120
Yes.

18
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,120
You want to withdraw your savings
to buy a plane ticket?

19
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,480
But don't you have exams coming up?

20
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,680
I'm free for five or six days.

21
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,440
I'll be right back.

22
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,520
I thought you said
you couldn't contact Mr. Saruj.

23
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,920
What if he won't come back?

24
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,560
You'll have wasted all that money.

25
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,520
I never knew

26
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,040
that you loved him so much.

27
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,960
You don't want me to aim high

28
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,160
because you're afraid I might get hurt.

29
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,280
But Mom,

30
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,920
if I have a chance to find love…

31
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,200
but it means I might get hurt,

32
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,600
get divorced,

33
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,160
or separated,

34
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,760
I still think it'll be worth it.

35
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,800
You've changed a lot.

36
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,000
I tried, Mom.

37
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,720
I really did try.

38
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,280
I tried my best

39
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,080
to ignore him,

40
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,120
but the more I tried
to suppress my feelings,

41
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,400
the more I thought about him

42
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,760
and the more I loved him.

43
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,080
This doesn't work, Mom.

44
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,000
If I don't fight for my love

45
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,800
or get to confess my love,

46
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,400
all I'll feel is pain.

47
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,120
It really hurts, Mom.

48
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,720
I'm sorry.

49
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,320
I'm sorry that I couldn't do
what you told me.

50
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,360
Don't apologize to me, dear.

51
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm the one in the wrong.

52
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,320
I assumed…

53
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,320
that we were the same.

54
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,400
I can't force my opinions

55
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,680
and beliefs…

56
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,200
onto you.

57
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,960
I'm sorry, dear.

58
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,520
Even if you were of equal status,

59
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,120
we still couldn't guarantee

60
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,240
that your marriage would work out.

61
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,960
Just do your best every day.

62
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,320
That's enough.

63
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,640
Go now, dear.

64
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,720
You have our permission.

65
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,840
Thank you, Mom.

66
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,480
Stop crying, dear.

67
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,440
Don't cry.

68
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,880
I'm okay.

69
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,160
You should go now, my dear.

70
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,880
Go and tell him that.

71
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,720
Don't cry.

72
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,000
Okay.

73
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,960
FIRST DAY

74
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,640
Thank you for coming with me.

75
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,760
I had to come.
I'm not sure about him, though.

76
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,640
-Why did you come?
-Well,

77
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,280
last time you went back to Thailand
with so many boyfriends.

78
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,400
How could I let you come alone?

79
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,800
Poom.

80
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,440
We'll only be here for a few days.
How am I supposed to get one?

81
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,600
So, we're here.

82
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,400
Yes.

83
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,280
You two wait here.

84
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,840
I'll go and check if Saruj is here.

85
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,200
-Okay.
-Okay.

86
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,880
Good luck.

87
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,480
Thank you.

88
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,520
How about we go and have fondue
once Cheewan and Saruj get here?

89
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,440
Who's paying?

90
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,000
It's my treat.

91
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,280
Sure.

92
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,520
He isn't here yet.

93
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,480
No one knows when he's coming.

94
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,240
Let's wait for him then.

95
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,160
Okay.

96
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,480
Cheewan.

97
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,360
Have some chocolate.

98
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,520
It's okay. You have it.

99
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,320
I couldn't get through to Mr. Danai

100
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,880
or anyone else.

101
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,920
Do we have to wait here all day?

102
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,200
I'll wait here.

103
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,960
You should go somewhere with Poom.

104
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,160
We'll buy some food for you then.

105
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,880
Okay, you should go.

106
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,400
I left messages everywhere,

107
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,120
and I told everyone I knew

108
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,280
that you were waiting for Saruj here.

109
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,160
Thank you, Poom.

110
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,120
Saruj will be here soon. Trust me.

111
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,040
Do you want to take a seat?

112
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:26,000
LAST DAY

113
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,560
This is the last day.
You should go and enjoy yourselves.

114
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,200
I'll wait for him here. Just go.

115
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,040
Hello, Mr. Saruj. It's me, Nuch.

116
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,240
Are there any documents from Ms. Chaluay,

117
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,880
Mr. Danai's secretary?

118
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,720
Yes, they just arrived.

119
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,320
I'll deliver them to you.

120
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,040
By the way, are you going
to the meeting at the museum?

121
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,360
What meeting?

122
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,760
I don't know about any meeting.

123
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,880
What? I sent you the invitation last week.

124
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,320
Someone is waiting for you at the museum.

125
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,000
She said she's your sister from Thailand.

126
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,640
Thank you so much.

127
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,600
Cheewan.

128
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,080
BANGKOK

129
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,960
It's okay, Cheewan.

130
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,160
Saruj has always shown me…

131
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,560
that he loves me.

132
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,080
But I

133
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,720
have never told him I love him.

134
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,200
But this time,

135
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,200
I'm not sad or anything.

136
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,560
At least

137
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,800
I fought for my love.

138
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,200
Even though I lost,

139
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,760
at least I got to experience defeat.

140
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,839
It's better than doing nothing.

141
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,480
If I do nothing,

142
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,839
how will I ever know true love, right?

143
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,319
Cheewa.

144
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,640
I miss Saruj.

145
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,160
It's okay, Cheewan.

146
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,400
Hang in there.

147
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,280
Saruj

148
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,080
is now fighting for you.

149
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,760
You'll get to see him one day.

150
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,960
This Thai restaurant serves great food.
You go ahead and order.

151
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,640
I need to use the bathroom.

152
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,680
Okay.

153
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,600
I love you, Saruj.
Please come back to Thailand soon.

154
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,840
Let's go. That table is free.

155
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,440
-Let's go.
-Okay.

156
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,240
My head hurts.

157
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,440
You have a migraine again.
Do you want some medicine?

158
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,440
I already took some.

159
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,640
Could you massage my head and body?

160
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,600
Okay.

161
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,040
We used to be so close.

162
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,920
Did you ever miss my hugs?

163
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,240
Is your head better now?

164
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,400
We once rented a house in Paris
and lived there together for a year.

165
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,640
This feels just like then,
don't you think?

166
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,760
It was the best time for me.

167
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,840
I love you.

168
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,280
You should stop.

169
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,760
Saruj.

170
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,120
I was young back then.

171
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,680
I made a mistake.

172
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,760
But I've changed.

173
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,160
Please give me a chance.

174
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,320
Please get back together with me.

175
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,080
Please stop.

176
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,400
I can't do it.

177
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,720
Saruj. Where are you going?

178
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,160
Saruj.

179
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,760
We got together when we were studying.

180
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,840
We've known each other for ten years.
This isn't just a rebound. I'm sure.

181
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,240
You're my first and only love.

182
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,920
Please think about this.

183
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,000
Our decade-long love and bond

184
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,120
might be what you have been waiting for.

185
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,000
All right, I'll hug you.

186
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,200
I'm glad you're jealous.

187
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,840
You're so worried about me.

188
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,040
I'm so happy.

189
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,160
Mrs. Mus lied to you.

190
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,560
She intentionally ignored your calls.

191
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,520
She wanted your attention.

192
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,320
If you're afraid I'll get back together
with her,

193
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,960
then tell me you love me.

194
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,160
-That's got nothing to do with it.
-It does.

195
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,640
If you say you love me,

196
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,760
I'll keep my heart

197
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,360
for you only.

198
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,160
Say it.

199
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,720
Say that you love me.

200
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,960
Saruj!

201
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,880
Lively and strong.

202
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,920
You're the only one, Cheewan.

203
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,440
No,

204
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,320
you're exaggerating.

205
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,240
There are many more reasons

206
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,280
why my feelings for you
have never changed.

207
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,760
But I love you.

208
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,760
I love you.

209
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,720
And more importantly,

210
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,120
I don't love you like a sister.

211
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,040
2 MONTHS LATER

212
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,720
Cheewan.

213
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,960
Yes?

214
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,680
Have you received a letter from Saruj yet?

215
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,920
He didn't send one,

216
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,120
but he asked someone at the embassy
to relay the message

217
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,920
that he was in Europe
and that I shouldn't worry about him.

218
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,880
You must be feeling relieved, right?

219
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,280
Yes.

220
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,040
I have an idea.

221
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,000
Look.

222
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,200
I'll send this poster to embassies,

223
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,440
Thai communities,

224
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,400
and restaurants.

225
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,040
I'll send them everywhere.

226
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,120
I'll ask them to put this up for me.

227
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,640
HEY, RETURN SARUJ TO ME NOW

228
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,160
Cheewan.

229
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,480
Are you going to post it
with Mrs. Muslin's face on it like this?

230
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,920
I'll censor her face then.

231
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,840
Here you go.

232
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,600
Cheewan.

233
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,200
What?

234
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,640
Can't I do this?

235
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,960
It's such a negative message.
Who would want to help you?

236
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,960
You could get sued
by Mrs. Mus for defamation.

237
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,000
You're humiliating her.

238
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,560
You're right.

239
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,200
I'm so rash and crazy, right?

240
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,280
Yes.

241
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,800
I'll make a new one.

242
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,880
This is better, right?

243
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,760
It's much better.

244
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,760
A positive message

245
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,360
will make people pity you.

246
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,880
When they pity you, they'll want
to spread the news for you.

247
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,920
Yes.

248
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,200
-Awesome.
-Awesome.

249
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,320
I hope I find him.

250
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,720
Yes.

251
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,600
What is it?

252
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,640
It's nothing.

253
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,680
Are you going to continue jogging?

254
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,080
Yes.

255
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,080
I'm done now. I'll go and take a shower.

256
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,200
Okay.

257
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,800
Mrs. Muslin.

258
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,840
Good morning.

259
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,880
Morning.

260
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,080
Where is Mr. Saruj?

261
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,800
He went out for a run.

262
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,480
I see. Can you give him his plane ticket?

263
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,240
His plane ticket?

264
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,080
It's a ticket to Thailand.

265
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,800
He asked me to book it for him. Thank you.

266
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,240
Saruj.

267
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,600
I was young back then.

268
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,160
I made a mistake.

269
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,040
But I've changed.

270
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,520
Please give me a chance.

271
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,640
Please get back together with me.

272
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,200
Please stop.

273
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,520
I can't do it.

274
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,400
What's wrong, Mus?

275
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,760
My only friend…

276
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,960
is about to leave me.

277
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,120
You only booked a ticket for yourself.

278
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,520
Even you are leaving me.

279
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,320
I have to go back to work.

280
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,840
Saruj.

281
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,080
I can't stay by myself.

282
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,679
I really need you right now.

283
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,239
I need you more than anything.

284
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,600
Can we get back together?

285
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,639
Can we?

286
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:40,719
Please, Saruj. Please.

287
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,880
I've moved on.

288
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,239
I'm sorry.

289
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,760
Please pity me.

290
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,080
Please pity me.

291
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,200
It's time for you to be strong.

292
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,480
You must learn to be by yourself.

293
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,920
If you leave,

294
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,920
then there's no point in me living!

295
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,720
I don't see what I have to live for.

296
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,080
What are you doing, Mus?

297
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,840
Put the knife down.

298
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,800
Tell me you won't go back to Thailand.

299
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,440
Please tell me that.

300
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:47,080
1 YEAR LATER

301
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,560
What did your professor say?

302
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,040
How was the exam?

303
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,200
I passed it,

304
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,080
but there are still many more.

305
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,080
I can't fly here to see you often.

306
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:13,440
I think I'll die from missing you.

307
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,200
Enjoy your time with Tualek

308
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,200
and the time will fly by.

309
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,480
Actually, you're much luckier than me.

310
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,560
You get to stay in Thailand
with our child.

311
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,800
I didn't know

312
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,760
that the voice I heard

313
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,640
was actually

314
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,960
the voice of love.

315
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,880
If I had gone after you sooner,

316
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,120
your life

317
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,200
would have been smooth

318
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,960
and not full of obstacles like this.

319
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,320
But I prefer it this way.

320
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Really?

321
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:57,240
If you think about it,
disappointment and pain are beneficial.

322
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,880
Wounds

323
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,040
can make a warrior stronger than others.

324
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,000
My strengths and the lessons I've learned

325
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,880
will make me successful in my family life

326
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,960
and career.

327
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,480
I'll make it happen.

328
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,840
Your eyes…

329
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,000
and the way you carry yourself

330
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,920
are what makes me love you.

331
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,280
You're a strong woman

332
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,480
who grew up in spite of her wounds

333
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,200
and stands strong.

334
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,000
I'm…

335
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,560
so head over heels for you.

336
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,680
You must help me.

337
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,000
Simon.

338
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,960
You two look so lovey-dovey.

339
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,240
But I'm not jealous

340
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,600
because I'm going
to propose to my girlfriend.

341
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,080
Really?

342
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,960
I wondered why you're all dressed up.

343
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,000
Who is she?

344
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,960
Let's go.

345
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,840
Will you marry me?

346
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,160
Yes.

347
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,720
-What's going on?
-Right.

348
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,480
I must be brave
and confident like this, right?

349
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,560
That's right.

350
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,320
He's just practicing.

351
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,680
I helped him come up
with something to say last night.

352
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,040
His girlfriend is on her way.

353
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,840
You can do it.

354
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,320
-Oh my god.
-Go now.

355
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,440
Let's hug.

356
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,480
I'm going to take Poom for a boat ride.

357
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,720
Do you want to come with us?

358
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,880
No.

359
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,000
I'll wait for him here.

360
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,760
Alone?

361
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,840
Yes. He's waited for me for years.

362
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,400
It won't hurt to wait for him.

363
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,760
For you.

364
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,400
Thank you.

365
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,400
Gosh.

366
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,080
Do you two speak in French now?

367
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,000
Yes.

368
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,720
I've been studying it for a while.

369
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,160
Saruj has assumed the position
of First Secretary in France.

370
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,880
He'll have to work here for many years.

371
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,880
-I see.
-I see.

372
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,280
You seem so prepared to become
an ambassador's wife.

373
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,800
Yes.

374
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,800
My exams are over.
I'm going to take German next.

375
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,920
Calm down.

376
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,640
You'll get confused if you study too hard.

377
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,680
Now that you've graduated,

378
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,480
are you going to get married now?

379
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,800
No.

380
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,000
We're going to move in together first.

381
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,960
I'm going to stay over
at his apartment in Paris tonight.

382
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,160
What?

383
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,480
She's joking.

384
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,840
She wouldn't dare.

385
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,160
She's just talking big.

386
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,960
Is it not true?

387
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,320
It's true.

388
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,000
I might do it. Who knows?

389
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,200
Poom.

390
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,920
-Yes?
-Let's get on the boat.

391
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,400
Let's go.

392
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,560
Let's go.

393
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,760
How many days can you take off?

394
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,520
I had so much work.
I almost didn't get it all done.

395
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,480
I almost missed the train from Paris.

396
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,800
I'm going to travel with Poom
for a few days.

397
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,880
Has Mrs. Muslin contacted you at all?

398
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,320
Yes.

399
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,400
You never tell me about her
when I ask you.

400
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,280
She's set up a business in Chiang Mai.

401
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,360
She seemed happy.

402
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,920
Can you tell me what happened back then?

403
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,720
When?

404
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,960
When you ran away with her to England.

405
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,840
Did she really try to make you stay?

406
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,040
Don't act like a diplomat with me.

407
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,480
Just tell me about it.

408
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,280
Fine, I'll tell you.

409
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,760
If you leave,

410
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,280
then there's no point in me living!

411
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,920
If I have to live alone,

412
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,800
I don't see what I have to live for.

413
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,880
What are you doing, Mus?
Put the knife down.

414
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,720
Tell me…

415
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,520
that you won't leave me.

416
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,160
Tell me that
you won't go back to Thailand.

417
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,920
Tell me that
I still mean something to you.

418
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,320
You've always meant a lot to me.

419
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,520
Mr. Nava was charged in another case.

420
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,040
He was convicted this time.

421
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:22,880
He's in jail now.

422
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,840
You!

423
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,120
You lot did this to me!

424
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,280
Just you wait.
Once I get out of jail, I'll wipe out

425
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,800
-your whole family.
-Calm down.

426
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,280
We didn't do anything to you.

427
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,880
You were the one
who was vengeful against us.

428
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,840
Let go!

429
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,840
Just you wait. You'll see what happens
when I get out of jail!

430
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,400
Let go!

431
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,560
Let go!

432
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,040
Hello, Mr. Danai.

433
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,400
Please tell Saruj

434
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,800
that Mr. Nava has been sent to jail.

435
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,960
He's safe now.

436
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,720
Has he really gone to jail?

437
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,800
But I know…

438
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,840
that you don't want
to go back to Thailand yet.

439
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,320
Yes.

440
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,680
I feel ashamed.

441
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,320
I can't face people in Thailand.

442
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,280
Everyone looked down on me

443
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,000
and said I deserved it.

444
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,680
I contacted your mother.

445
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,400
She's getting a visa
so she can come and see you here.

446
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,000
Ma'am, is your visa ready?

447
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,200
Please talk to Mus.

448
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,520
Is that you, Mus? I got my visa.

449
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,320
I'm going to buy a flight ticket

450
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,200
and fly to see you tomorrow.

451
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,640
Listen, they're calling me now.

452
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,320
I'll call you again
once I get the flight number.

453
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,240
You asked her to come here.

454
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,800
Did you plan all this?

455
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,480
She can keep you company.

456
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,200
I have to go back to Thailand to work.

457
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,120
That's not true.

458
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,080
It's because of Cheewan.

459
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,200
Why?

460
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,840
Will you still choose
that kid if I'm dead?

461
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:11,280
Would you let me die in front of you?

462
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,200
Well?

463
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,840
You think I'm the only person
you can depend on.

464
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,360
In fact,

465
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,840
the person you should rely on…

466
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:21,920
is yourself.

467
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,800
You're beautiful

468
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:25,960
and smart.

469
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,080
You can start over.

470
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,600
I can't.

471
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:35,280
I can't. I can't do it without you.

472
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,360
Pull yourself together

473
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,480
and think things through.

474
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,840
It'll take a bit of time
for people to stop gossiping.

475
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,000
While you're here with your mom,

476
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,760
travel and enjoy your life.

477
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:48,000
People will forget about you soon.

478
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,160
This is how the world is.

479
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,440
I can't.

480
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,680
I can't do that.

481
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,280
I can't.

482
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,600
I can't do that.

483
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,400
I love you.

484
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,760
I love you.

485
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,520
I love you.

486
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,160
I love you.

487
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,080
We'll be friends

488
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,960
for our whole lives.

489
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,920
This might be even better
than getting married.

490
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,440
You just feel weak now.

491
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,480
Do you remember what you used to be like?

492
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,480
You were strong

493
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,000
and cheerful.

494
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,080
You were happy back then.

495
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,560
You'll be like that again.

496
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,160
What about the cards and posters I sent?

497
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,880
Did you receive them

498
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,280
or even see any of them?

499
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:23,480
That was so embarrassing.

500
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,440
Why would you be embarrassed?

501
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,840
I chose a good picture of you.

502
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,080
Back then…

503
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,440
What is it?

504
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,480
It's nothing.

505
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,520
Are you going to continue jogging?

506
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,920
Yes.

507
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,440
I saw the posters and postcards.

508
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,320
But what I didn't like at all was…

509
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,080
Our story

510
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,400
was the talk of the town across Europe.

511
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,720
Hey.

512
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,520
-Shall I greet him?
-Do it.

513
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,880
Excuse me.

514
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,720
Are you Mr. Saruj?

515
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,200
It's really him.

516
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,400
You're so romantic.

517
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,960
What do you mean?

518
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,360
I see that poster

519
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,440
all over town.

520
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,280
We were wondering

521
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:26,960
if you were going to return to Cheewan.

522
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,280
Are you planning to go back to her?

523
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:37,080
Please go back soon. Don't make her
wait long. I feel sorry for her.

524
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,160
-Yes.
-She's right.

525
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,400
We helped out
by putting them up all over the place.

526
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,520
By the way,

527
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:52,680
look at this.

528
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,520
Your story was covered in today's issue
of the local newspaper.

529
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:59,840
Look at this.

530
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,200
Is it in a newspaper?

531
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,120
It's the story of a Thai woman
who told her boyfriend that she loves him.

532
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:10,840
We really wanted to meet you in person

533
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,280
so we could help your girlfriend ask you
when you'd be back.

534
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:14,240
Aren't they cute?

535
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,160
-Yes, they are.
-Yes.

536
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,720
Very cute.

537
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:25,480
I only told you I love you…

538
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,560
on a few thousand posters.

539
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:34,000
I'd been waiting
for you to say that for so long.

540
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,520
Even though I've seen it
a few thousand times,

541
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,040
I don't get tired of it.

542
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,920
I'm in front of you now.

543
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,240
Why don't you say it?

544
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,800
If you say you love me,

545
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:59,920
I'll keep my heart

546
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,520
for you only.

547
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,640
I

548
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,800
love

549
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,200
you.

550
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,400
I'll say it every day.

551
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,080
I've graduated.

552
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,760
I've done everything
my parents wanted me to do.

553
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,920
It's the perfect time to be in love.

554
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:34,040
Everything is falling into place.

555
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,760
Waiting for something
makes you appreciate it more,

556
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,440
and it also makes you feel proud.

557
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,200
By the way,

558
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,520
will you study some more,

559
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,600
or shall we get married?

560
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,320
-Well…
-Yes?

561
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,520
Let's do both.

562
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,280
Let's also travel the world.

563
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,120
Let's go to your home to catch fish
and tap trees. Let's do all that.

564
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,040
I'll do it all with you.

565
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,320
Please be by my side.

566
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,840
You'll forget about me when you work.

567
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,560
But that's fine.

568
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,040
I can wait for you.

569
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,040
Let's take our time.

570
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,040
I just need you by my side.

571
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:43,480
You go and take a walk first.

572
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,560
I need to use the restroom for a bit.
I'll catch you up.

573
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,480
Don't take long.

574
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:48,840
Okay.

575
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,320
It's a pity

576
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,520
Saruj had to work, so he couldn't come.

577
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:59,080
Let's go.
I want to play in the snow so badly.

578
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,880
Let's go then.

579
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,160
Let's go.

580
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,200
Hey.

581
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,280
Why is my name here?

582
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:26,520
CHEEWAN

583
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,040
SEE YOU AT SPHINX

584
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,560
"See you at Sphinx."

585
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,760
ICE CAVE

586
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,960
WALK TO THE SNOWMAN

587
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,720
"Walk to the snowman."

588
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,040
Hey, Cheewa.

589
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,640
Cheewan.

590
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,360
Where is Poom?

591
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,280
I don't know. I was just looking for him.

592
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,880
What's that paper, Cheewan?

593
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,920
He says to go to the snowman.

594
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,680
He?

595
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:42,920
Yes.

596
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,240
Let's go.

597
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,400
I wonder what's waiting for us
at the snowman.

598
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:21,760
-Will you marry me?
-Will you marry me?

599
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,240
Saruj, didn't you say you had to work?

600
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,800
Did you lie to us?

601
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,720
Many years ago,

602
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,480
you turned me down.

603
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,480
But this year,

604
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,520
please don't be mean to me.

605
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:00,720
Okay.

606
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:03,960
Saruj.

607
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:06,440
Finally!

608
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,880
Come on, Cheewan.

609
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,400
I can't wait.

610
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:25,840
Just answer me already.

611
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:35,440
Are you saying no?

612
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:36,720
Are you serious?

613
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,120
Poom.

614
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,320
Cheewan.

615
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,600
Cheewan.

616
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:41,680
Cheewan.

617
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:46,160
Cheewan.

618
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,320
Cheewan.

619
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:52,040
What is it this time?

620
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:53,960
Don't you care about my feelings?

621
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:58,560
You see, a question popped up
in my head just now.

622
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,560
What question?

623
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:03,480
I can't wait anymore.

624
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,280
Suppose we got married

625
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:09,240
and I suddenly…

626
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,000
I'm sorry.

627
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,520
Well…

628
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,560
If we fought and got divorced,

629
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,640
what would happen to the Jutathep Palace?

630
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:20,920
I thought you weren't worried
about that now.

631
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:26,920
Outsiders view the Jutathep Palace
as a heaven full of beautiful things.

632
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,040
The men are all the sort of guys
women dream about.

633
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:31,880
But Saruj,

634
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,360
the lives of normal people

635
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,960
are full of conflict, arguments,

636
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:37,240
and divorce.

637
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:40,280
If we ended up that way,

638
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:42,920
what would happen between our families?

639
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,200
Who cares if we break up or divorce?

640
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,760
It wouldn't be the end of the world.

641
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:48,440
Gosh,

642
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,560
you seem so indifferent to this.

643
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,960
The divorce of a Jutathep

644
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:54,440
wouldn't be a small thing.

645
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:59,400
A good person is the person who tries
their best in everything they do.

646
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,480
And if they were to get divorced,

647
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,080
it would mean

648
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:04,600
that person

649
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,880
had done their best for those around them

650
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,840
and for themself.

651
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:11,200
It's the best they could do at that time.

652
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,760
That's because there's no recipe

653
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,200
for how to live your best life.

654
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,240
We just need to do our best

655
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:25,840
and leave everything else
to take care of itself.

656
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,320
Don't stop fighting.

657
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Fight for your family.

658
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:32,880
Fight to maintain your love.

659
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,280
Fight with all your strength,

660
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:35,920
so you won't regret it

661
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,520
or be sad

662
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,360
if you lose.

663
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,240
Okay.

664
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,880
I get it now.

665
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,560
Can you propose to me now?

666
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:27,720
Okay.

667
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,480
Let's get married.

668
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,680
You wouldn't marry me before

669
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:02,480
because you wanted freedom.

670
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:04,360
What about now?

671
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:07,480
It turns out that having a child

672
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:09,040
gave me freedom.

673
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:10,320
What?

674
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,080
It's my heart.

675
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,560
I'm free from other people's eyes.

676
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,800
Before, I wouldn't get married

677
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,840
because I thought I was tainted.

678
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,240
I didn't want others to look down on you

679
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,440
for having a wife like me.

680
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:28,800
But I'm not scared anymore.

681
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:31,520
I don't care

682
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:33,560
how people look at you

683
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,240
or us anymore.

684
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:42,240
You're the perfect woman for me.

685
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,160
You're not tainted at all.

686
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:45,960
Thank you.

687
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,760
Thank you for making my dreams come true.

688
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:19,440
-My gosh.
-My gosh.

689
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:27,200
You two are kissing right in front of us.

690
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,800
Have some consideration.

691
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,360
They've shown off in front of us.

692
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,000
Shall we show off to them too?

693
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,680
That was my very first kiss.

694
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:09,720
Really?

695
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,120
Yes.

696
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:14,080
My first kiss.

697
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:17,720
My first and last love

698
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:22,360
with the man I've known

699
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,480
since I was small.
