1
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,280
Boiled Chinese sausage.

2
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,800
Steamed fish with curry paste.

3
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,560
I'm getting hungry listening to you.

4
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,680
Let's get some rice.

5
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,960
Hey.

6
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,680
This is for Madam Orn only.
There's none for you.

7
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,040
Cheewa.

8
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,120
My gosh.

9
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,960
Enjoy your time together in hell, Dalad.

10
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,280
Dalad!

11
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,320
Please be alive, Dalad.
Please find him as soon as possible.

12
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,240
Mr. Nava is at home.

13
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,760
So why isn't Muslin picking up my calls?

14
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,760
-Hello.
-You dumbass.

15
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,440
I'm so stupid.
I keep calling the wrong number.

16
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,120
How much credit have I wasted now?

17
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,360
Why are you here alone?

18
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,960
Where is Saruj?

19
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,120
He's gone to Chiang Mai.

20
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,240
What? What did you say?

21
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,960
He asked me to tell you
that he was worried about Muslin,

22
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,200
so he flew to Chiang Mai.

23
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,240
He'll stay the night and return tomorrow.

24
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,880
Gosh.

25
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,000
Thank you.

26
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:08,040
CHIANG MAI

27
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,680
Thank you.

28
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,600
Mus.

29
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,920
Muslin.

30
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,959
Mr. Saruj.

31
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,160
-Hello.
-Hello.

32
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,360
Is Mus here? Has something happened?

33
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,840
She's fine. What are you doing here?

34
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,280
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

35
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,400
Well,

36
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,360
I had my phone turned off.

37
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,560
I just wanted some peace and quiet.

38
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,120
You had me worried.

39
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,120
I thought
Mr. Nava had done something to you.

40
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,440
Are you okay?

41
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,240
He still hasn't found you, right?

42
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,560
You came here
because you were worried about me?

43
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,760
That's right.

44
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,000
Mr. Nava is crazy.
He could have done anything.

45
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,440
I'm so happy.

46
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,760
I'm happy
that I still mean something to you.

47
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,160
This seems to be a nice place to live.

48
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,280
Yes.

49
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,360
The house I bought is under construction,
so I'm renting this place for now.

50
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,800
Now that I have a house
where my mom is safe from Nava,

51
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,640
I'm not worried anymore.

52
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,840
Mr. Nava has gone quiet.

53
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,680
He's probably moved on.

54
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,480
I'll only be confident about that
when I see a divorce certificate.

55
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,320
That's true.

56
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,520
How are things between you and Cheewan?
We've never talked about this.

57
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,800
As you know,

58
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,160
I've told my parents about her.

59
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,040
Our families are very close.

60
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,200
Now, I only have to wait three years
for her to graduate.

61
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,880
Three years?

62
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,960
Since you're not getting married soon,

63
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,560
does it mean I still have a chance

64
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,960
in these three years?

65
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,200
Mus.

66
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,760
I'm going to be blunt.

67
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,360
I still hope to get back to the point
we were at many years ago.

68
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,240
I want to marry you.

69
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,120
Well…

70
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,280
If you want me to apologize…

71
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,800
then I'm sorry.

72
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,240
I was wrong for ditching
the thing that was most valuable to me.

73
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,360
Can we start over, Saruj?

74
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,120
Right now, you feel vulnerable,

75
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,320
confused,

76
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,240
and lonely.

77
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,280
It's not a good time
to start a relationship.

78
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,560
We got together when we were studying.

79
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,600
We've known each other for ten years.
This isn't just a rebound. I'm sure.

80
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,840
You're my first and only love.

81
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,120
Please think about this.

82
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,080
Our decade-long love and bond

83
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,600
might be what you have been waiting for.

84
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,640
I booked a hotel near the airport.

85
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,640
I'm taking a flight in the morning

86
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,960
so I can be back in time for work.

87
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,240
Take care of yourself.

88
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,440
Hi there.

89
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,160
Here comes Tualek.

90
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,440
She's here to see her dad and mom.

91
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,240
She's here.

92
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,800
You're smiling so sweetly.

93
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,560
-Tualek, come here.
-Here you go. What?

94
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,320
-I'm leaving for work soon.
-Go to your grandpa.

95
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,080
Let him admire you first, dear.

96
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,840
-I was here first.
-You're so adorable, dear.

97
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,920
Can I use my rights as her dad?

98
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,880
I'm also a dad.

99
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,320
I'm the dad of her mom.

100
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,920
I'm above you.

101
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,560
Cheewa.

102
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,760
Yes?

103
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,720
We have decided

104
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,440
to raise her ourselves.

105
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,520
Mom, please let me raise her.

106
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,200
I'm afraid you'll get tired

107
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,200
and won't have time for yourselves.

108
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,680
That's right.

109
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,160
She has parents,

110
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,400
but you two are taking over our duty.

111
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,880
Cheewa,

112
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,000
why don't you raise her for a few years,
then return to your studies?

113
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,360
And you too, Poom.

114
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,320
You must advance your career.

115
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,080
You're at an important age.

116
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,600
You can't give up on it.

117
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,880
Are you two going to take our child?

118
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,400
-Yes.
-Yes.

119
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,160
Chavit can run things better than me.

120
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,760
He's the new generation.

121
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,240
We're still strong.

122
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,840
Raising a child is tiring.

123
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,120
But it makes us very happy.

124
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,040
Honey,

125
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,040
does this remind you of the past

126
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,160
when we were young
and bringing up children?

127
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,560
Yes.

128
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,600
It was tiring, but we were very happy.

129
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,160
Cheewa.

130
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,600
Thank you

131
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,960
for having Tualek
to keep your dad and me company.

132
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,200
When I was expecting her,
I thought she was an embarrassment,

133
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,200
so I didn't dare consult
you both about it.

134
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,520
I was so stupid back then.

135
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,400
When in distress, people always assume

136
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,640
that there is no solution,

137
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,000
but every problem has a solution.

138
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,880
And neither of us

139
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,360
feels embarrassed
like you thought we would be.

140
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,640
That's right, dear.

141
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,040
Cheewa.

142
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,280
Why don't you look at this
from another perspective?

143
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,440
You see,

144
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,880
a burden can turn into happiness,

145
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,800
so long as you make sure
your mistake makes you stronger.

146
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,280
Return to your studies, all right?

147
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,000
Go back to pursue your dream

148
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,440
and make it happen.

149
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,600
Thank you, Mom,

150
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,320
Dad.

151
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,280
No worries.

152
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,240
Okay.

153
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,760
I won't tease you anymore.

154
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,280
Let's not tease him anymore.

155
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,560
All right, go to your dad.

156
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,000
-Go to your dad.
-Can I hold her?

157
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,440
-Go to your dad.
-Go now.

158
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,360
Tualek.

159
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,680
Come and play with me.

160
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,680
You're crying.

161
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,160
What?

162
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,120
She's asleep.

163
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,560
You won't get to play with her then.

164
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,320
-Honey.
-I'm so sorry, Poom.

165
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,160
Stop teasing him already
and go to work. Go on.

166
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,480
See you later.

167
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,160
We won't get to talk today.

168
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,440
That day you asked me

169
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,720
who the boy in the drawing was,

170
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,760
and I didn't reply to you.

171
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,640
I wasn't ready back then.

172
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,480
But I'm confident now.

173
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,840
Take a look at the name
of the boy in the drawing.

174
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,880
I'LL BE YOUR PRINCE

175
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,960
RONNAPOOM JUTATHEP

176
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,400
Cheewa.

177
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,040
I wrote it back then.

178
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,480
Go to the next page.

179
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,880
RONNAPOOM JUTATHEP

180
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,120
I lied to you

181
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,400
about not having feelings for you.

182
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,400
Have you really
had a crush on me since then?

183
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,360
You didn't

184
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,040
just write my name on it recently,
did you?

185
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,960
You weren't friendly with me,

186
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,480
so I thought you hated me.

187
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,280
Why didn't you tell me

188
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,440
that you had a crush on me?

189
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,800
Well, you were so cool,

190
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,280
so I thought

191
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,080
it was just a teenage crush
on a guy in uniform.

192
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,760
As I grew up, I guess I forgot about you.

193
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,280
But I've never drawn
a picture of another man.

194
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,360
Poncheewa likes me!

195
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,640
Poncheewa loves me.

196
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,640
You love me like a lover,

197
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,880
not like a brother.

198
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,280
Please lower your voice, Poom.

199
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,560
It's embarrassing.

200
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,800
Thank you for loving me.

201
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,760
That's not a brotherly kiss.

202
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,080
Poncheewa loves me!

203
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,400
Poncheewa loves me!

204
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,280
-Poncheewa loves--
-Poom, please lower your voice.

205
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,560
Hey, Cheewan. Are you here to see me?

206
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,240
What is it?

207
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,520
You're not saying anything.

208
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,600
Maybe you're here to see someone else.

209
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,720
But I'm the only one here.

210
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,560
You still won't say it.

211
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,600
I guess there's something wrong
with your mouth.

212
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,520
Let me check.

213
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,400
There's nothing wrong with it.

214
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,080
You still won't say it.

215
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,920
If your mouth doesn't work properly,

216
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,760
I think I'll have to use my mouth
to help you.

217
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,640
Why are you just sitting there?

218
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,320
Aren't you going to stop me?

219
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,760
-Hey, are you crazy?
-Hey.

220
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:07,240
Why don't you go and live in Chiang Mai?

221
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,040
Just buy a house there with her

222
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,480
since you're so worried about her.

223
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,680
Hold on.

224
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,079
I only went there for a day.

225
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,280
I came back as soon as I'd talked to her.

226
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:18,040
Nothing happened between us.

227
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,440
Who asked you that? I don't want to know.

228
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,480
-Gosh, take this.
-Wait.

229
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,560
-Take this.
-Wait.

230
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,680
You're crazy.

231
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,800
I'm all wet now.

232
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,280
It's cold in here.

233
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,560
How can you swim in this weather?

234
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,200
All right, I'll hug you.

235
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,080
-Let go of me.
-Do you feel warm now?

236
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,000
Let go.

237
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,960
Be quiet first.

238
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,200
I'm glad you're jealous.

239
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,840
You're so worried about me.

240
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,720
I'm so happy.

241
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,160
Mrs. Mus lied to you.

242
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,160
She intentionally ignored your calls.

243
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,560
She wanted your attention.

244
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,560
Yes.

245
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,200
Is that all you have to say?

246
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,720
This means you knew about it then.

247
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,280
If you're afraid I'll get back together
with her,

248
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,840
then tell me you love me.

249
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,040
-That's got nothing to do with it.
-It does.

250
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,520
If you say you love me,

251
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,640
I'll keep my heart

252
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,760
for you only.

253
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,040
Let go.

254
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,880
Didn't you say you were cold?

255
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,600
My warm heart

256
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,760
only has a place for you.

257
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,920
Say it.

258
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,080
Say that you love me.

259
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,120
Hey.

260
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,200
-Take this.
-Hey.

261
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,600
Wait, Cheewan. I give up now.

262
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,000
Did you go there just to annoy me?

263
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,800
I'll remember this.

264
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,360
Cheewan, where are you taking my clothes?

265
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,000
Aren't you warm?

266
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,680
Why would you need your clothes then?
Why don't you walk back like that?

267
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,800
Hold on, Cheewan.

268
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,080
It's cold. Bring them back.

269
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,120
Cheewan.

270
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,600
Kwan,

271
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,720
please take care of Chat for me.

272
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,160
Make sure you tame him, dear.

273
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,880
Yes, ma'am.

274
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,800
May your love be long-lasting

275
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,600
and stable.

276
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,960
Don't you dare be a womanizer.

277
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,440
May your love last.

278
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,480
Here.

279
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,680
Forgive each other.

280
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,880
Hold each other's hands.

281
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,200
I'm so happy.

282
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,760
May your love last forever.

283
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,560
Help each other support your love.

284
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,440
Be reasonable, all right?

285
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,800
Don't use your emotions.

286
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,880
I wish you a house full of children.

287
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,640
Forgive each other when necessary.

288
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,600
Okay.

289
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,760
I wish you a lot of happiness.

290
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,960
If my son doesn't behave,

291
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,400
you can deal with him however you want.

292
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,600
You're like my daughter now.

293
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,080
Please take care of Chat for me.

294
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,360
Okay.

295
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,440
Chat.

296
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,240
I wish you a lot of happiness.

297
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,520
Learn to forgive each other
when necessary.

298
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,520
I love you, dear.

299
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,840
Congratulations on a bright start
to your relationship.

300
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,600
I wish you a lot of happiness.

301
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,440
If you have misunderstandings,

302
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,560
I hope you'll remember the days
when you fought together.

303
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,920
I wish you a lot of happiness.

304
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,440
I wish you happiness
and a peaceful marriage.

305
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,720
Thank you.

306
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,080
I wish you a stable and long-lasting love.

307
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,080
Thank you.

308
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,160
Congratulations to you both.

309
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,120
I wish you a lot of happiness.

310
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,600
Chat, take care of her well, okay?

311
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,440
Sure.

312
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,160
Congratulations to you both.

313
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,520
Thank you.

314
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,360
Take care of her well, Chat.

315
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,640
And now it's time for the after-party

316
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,840
to celebrate
Chatklao and Kwanruetai's marriage!

317
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,760
No ceremony, no guests,

318
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,080
no fancy outfits, and most importantly,

319
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,000
no royal titles for these Jutatheps.

320
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,560
It's just us five silly monkeys.

321
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,080
What's this? Hey.

322
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,880
Come on.

323
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,000
Asira.

324
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,680
Hero Phuthaneth!

325
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,640
And I'm Hero Saruj!

326
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,080
I'm Hero Chatklao!

327
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,960
I'm Hero Ronnajak!

328
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,400
Hold on. This is meant to be
the five monkeys. What about you?

329
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,800
Why are you here?

330
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,320
Of course, I'm Hero Ronnapoom.

331
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,680
It's five monkeys plus one.

332
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,880
And why is she here?

333
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,880
Take this.

334
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,080
I'm the most important guest.

335
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,640
Without me,

336
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,800
let alone these five monkeys,

337
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,120
there wouldn't be any baby monkeys.

338
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,840
Congratulations, Saruj.

339
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,520
Chatklao is the one who got married.

340
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,400
Yes, it's me, Chatklao.

341
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,920
Congratulations, Chat.

342
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,120
Thank you.

343
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,760
In that case, let's start the fun.

344
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,800
Sure.

345
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,840
Gosh.

346
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,280
We would all like to congratulate you two,

347
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,920
Chat and Kwan.

348
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,120
Congratulations.

349
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,960
I've waited so long for this.

350
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,080
Gosh.

351
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,280
As the president of the Girl Lover Club,

352
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,640
I'd like to offer my support
to two of our members.

353
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,040
Saruj,

354
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,320
I'm rooting for you.

355
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,440
Thank you.

356
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,440
Poom.

357
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,080
Fight for it.

358
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,560
Thank you, Chat.

359
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,320
An expensive wine

360
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,760
is one that has been aged
and kept for a long time.

361
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,880
But love is better than wine.

362
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,800
The longer we wait, the longer
we get to learn about each other.

363
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,080
It was all worth it.

364
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,320
Thank you, Kwanruetai,
for fighting through this with me.

365
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,360
It was very chaotic
at the wedding this morning,

366
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,160
so we didn't get to tell
a special someone that we love her.

367
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,480
We have a little surprise today.

368
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,160
Let's welcome the Dhevaprom women
who stole the hearts of the Jutatheps.

369
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,880
Everybody says

370
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,760
we're the hearts of the Jutatheps.

371
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,600
And the gentlemen who stand over here

372
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,800
are the hearts of the Dhevaproms.

373
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,320
But for all of us here,

374
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,720
only one person
is the true heart of the Dhevaproms.

375
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,560
It's you.

376
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,240
Thank you so much, dear.

377
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,480
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

378
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,520
The Jutatheps

379
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,560
are bound to the Dhevaproms by a promise,

380
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,400
but only one person stayed true to it

381
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,760
and kept the promise.

382
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,880
That person is you.

383
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,200
Thank you, dear.

384
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,520
Even though many of us Dhevaproms

385
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,360
have hurt you

386
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,160
and the Jutatheps,

387
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:19,040
you forgave us every time.

388
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,280
Thank you, dear.

389
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,440
It was destiny

390
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,840
and a miracle

391
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,400
that all of us married Jutatheps.

392
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,400
You had a hand in making it happen.

393
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,640
Thank you, dear.

394
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,040
Madam Orn.

395
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,920
I have one for you too.

396
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,880
Come here.

397
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,920
Here.

398
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,000
Thank you.

399
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,280
Thank you.

400
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,640
Madam Orn.

401
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,000
On this day that
we further strengthened our family bond,

402
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,600
we'd like to thank you for this.

403
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,240
Thank you, dear.

404
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,080
My pleasure.

405
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,640
This is so touching.

406
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,640
Let me dry my eyes.

407
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,240
Actually, it's not just me.

408
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,960
It's down to all of you

409
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,520
for maintaining your virtuousness,

410
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,920
making you valuable

411
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:36,360
and making men want to hold onto you.

412
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:42,520
Your love has helped us
avoid going astray.

413
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,080
Actually, not everything I did was right.

414
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,680
I made many mistakes.

415
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:55,160
I meddled too much in your business.

416
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,280
I'm sorry, dear.

417
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,640
Even though we might act up sometimes,

418
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,720
we never get mad at you.

419
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,120
We know that

420
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,560
you love us and mean us well.

421
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,880
Love

422
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,360
is what binds families together.

423
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,760
We must learn to forgive each other.

424
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:28,440
No family is perfect.

425
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,960
I hope you will all build strong families

426
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,640
with love

427
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,480
and forgiveness.

428
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,440
All right?

429
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,400
Okay.

430
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,240
I love you, dear.

431
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,320
I love you all.

432
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,080
I'm such a crybaby.

433
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,920
I've spoiled my makeup.

434
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,400
You're still pretty.

435
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,840
Be happy, dear.

436
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,320
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

437
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,600
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

438
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,800
Petch.

439
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,960
I need your advice on something.

440
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,159
What is it?

441
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,040
Mr. Nava won't divorce Mus.

442
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,480
I think I'll have to send the evidence
of the collapsed condo to the police.

443
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,040
Right.

444
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,600
He's dealing
with the warehouse case right now.

445
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,800
If he also has to deal with this,

446
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,040
I'm sure he'll be furious.

447
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,760
Natsarid took the blame

448
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,239
for the warehouse case.

449
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,720
There's no evidence pointing to him.

450
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,960
If Mr. Nava gets away with it,

451
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,560
he'll mess with Muslin again.

452
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,240
I want to corner him

453
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,120
so he'll divorce her.

454
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,280
You can do that.

455
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,200
But we'll have to be prepared,
since we're breaking ties with him.

456
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,120
We've always been in conflict with him
since he's a competitor.

457
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,560
Add this to it

458
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,760
and there'll be no love lost between us.

459
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,240
I just wanted to tell you about it first.

460
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,320
Okay.

461
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,080
We're family,
so I'll do anything to help you.

462
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,920
But why do you want Muslin to divorce now?

463
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,400
Have you asked yourself
how you feel about her?

464
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,360
She asked to get back together
with me the other day.

465
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,640
It must be hard for you

466
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,280
since you two have been together
for so long.

467
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,160
I'd have said yes
if it weren't for Cheewan.

468
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,040
Ever since I was a kid,
if I imagined starting a family,

469
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,280
Mus was the only person
I could imagine having one with.

470
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,720
That's how I felt for over ten years,

471
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,760
so I can't help but be affected.

472
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,080
Then you should be careful
of your feelings and actions.

473
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,480
Love is like water that keeps flowing.

474
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,720
If you make a wrong choice,
you won't be able to go back and fix it.

475
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,320
Especially with a resolute person
like Cheewan.

476
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,200
Please sign the divorce papers.

477
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,680
Mr. Saruj wants them soon.

478
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,360
You have three days.

479
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,360
If you still won't sign them,

480
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,720
the evidence regarding the condo
that collapsed due to your flawed design

481
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,200
will be sent to the police.

482
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,400
Three days?

483
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,720
What right do you have
to give me a deadline?

484
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,360
Read my lips.

485
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,320
I'm not divorcing her.

486
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,200
Okay, sir.

487
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,440
I'm leaving now.

488
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,680
Mus!

489
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,720
Mus!

490
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,440
Mus!

491
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,080
Excuse me.

492
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,480
This family has moved out.

493
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,600
Moved out? Where did Muslin go?

494
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,920
Mr. Nava.

495
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,480
Where did she go?

496
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,440
I don't know.

497
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,640
-I asked where she went.
-I don't know.

498
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,560
I don't know.

499
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,000
Saruj.

500
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,040
Did you help Muslin run away?

501
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,240
Mus.

502
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,320
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

503
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,520
My lawyer said Mr. Nava won't divorce you.

504
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,200
He's acting erratically

505
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,320
and he carries a gun with him.

506
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,880
What should I do?

507
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,320
Are your visas and passport still valid?

508
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,520
I think we should leave the country
as soon as possible.

509
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,680
Please walk slowly.

510
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,320
The weather is nice, isn't it?

511
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,320
Are you tired?
You've walked a long way today.

512
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,120
Just a little.

513
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,960
Please wait here.

514
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,040
I'll get some water
and a cold towel for you.

515
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,240
Saruj!

516
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,280
Saruj!

517
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,440
Saruj!

518
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,720
Where the hell are you?

519
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,640
Come out now.

520
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,640
Saruj!

521
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,960
Where are you?

522
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,240
Come out here now!

523
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,280
Hello, sir.

524
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,840
Where is Saruj?

525
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,560
Well…

526
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,040
He's hiding Muslin here, isn't he?

527
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,640
Mrs. Muslin isn't here.

528
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,840
You're lying.

529
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,400
I don't believe you.

530
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,280
Bring him here.

531
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,840
If I don't see Muslin today, you're dead!

532
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,440
Mr. Saruj is not here. Honestly.

533
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,200
Please spare me. I'm scared.

534
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,320
Saruj!

535
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,880
Come out here now!

536
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,280
What's the racket?

537
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,680
Jaew,

538
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,280
I heard gunshots.

539
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,200
Yes.

540
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,400
Mr. Nava came here

541
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,800
for Mr. Saruj.

542
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,280
Jon is inside.

543
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,560
Calm down. Pull yourself together.

544
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,920
Tell everyone to close their doors

545
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,560
and not to come out until I say so.

546
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,000
-All right?
-Sure.

547
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,960
-Go now.
-Okay.

548
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,480
Please don't do anything to me.
I really don't know anything about this.

549
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,360
I'm scared. I'm begging you.

550
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,440
The Jutathep Palace?

551
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,560
The people in this palace

552
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,880
have been waiting to be my enemies
for a long time.

553
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,120
You competed with me for projects
and took advantage of me in every way.

554
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,080
Not only this, but you insulted me

555
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,480
by snatching my wife!

556
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,560
I'm scared. I'm not involved in this.

557
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:05,120
My son only opened a factory.

558
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,640
What did they do about it?

559
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,360
Instead of saving my face

560
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,880
and telling me about it,

561
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,920
they got my son arrested.

562
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,680
They are the ones

563
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,520
who ruined my life.

564
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,880
I don't know about this.

565
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,320
I'm scared now. Please spare me.
I'm begging you.

566
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,840
Where are you?

567
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,240
Come out here now!

568
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,600
That's Saruj's car.

569
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:46,920
Saruj.

570
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,360
Petch.

571
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,720
Nava.

572
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,760
He's inside your house in a rage.
He's shooting things.

573
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,000
What did you say? Nava?

574
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,440
Yes.

575
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,160
-I'll take care of him.
-You can't.

576
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,360
He's mad right now.
If he sees you two together,

577
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,480
he'll shoot you.

578
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,640
You have to get away.

579
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,160
Tell everyone that a criminal broke in.

580
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,960
Tell them not to come outside.

581
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,600
-Okay.
-Go now.

582
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,280
I've told Mr. Petch's family, Mr. Chat's,

583
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,840
Mr. Jak's, Mr. Phu's.

584
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,320
Who have I not told?

585
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,400
It's…

586
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,000
Madam Orn.

587
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,320
What's all the noise, Jon?

588
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,920
Jon, what's the noise?

589
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,440
Madam Orn.

590
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,240
You never come here.

591
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,960
Why did you come here today?

592
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,320
Madam Orn.

593
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,200
It has been a while.

594
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,080
Are you still alive?

595
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,040
Mr. Chamnan,

596
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,240
when did you get here?

597
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,480
Who's Chamnan?

598
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,760
Who are you here to see then?

599
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,440
This is Chat's house.

600
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,760
Are you here to see him?

601
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,760
Who's Chat?

602
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,160
I came here for Saruj.

603
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,320
I'm here to get him.

604
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,120
You're loved by everyone here.

605
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,880
If I take you down,

606
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,440
then that means I take all of you down.

607
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,800
Am I right?

608
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,760
That's not true.

609
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,960
Mr. Nava.

610
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,880
Please have mercy on her. I'm begging you.

611
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,760
What's this black thing?

612
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,960
Isn't this a gun?

613
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,360
-Oh dear, you're an adult.
-Hey.

614
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,040
Why are you still playing
with this kind of thing?

615
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,920
Let me try it.

616
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,880
My gosh.

617
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,000
This is real.

618
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,160
It's not a toy.

619
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,440
That's right.

620
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,920
You old hag! I'll…

621
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,080
-I haven't hit you yet!
-Ma'am.

622
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,280
Mr. Nava.

623
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,160
Mr. Saruj really isn't here.

624
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,720
Please let us go.

625
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:06,840
No!

626
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:10,080
I'm not leaving until I have Muslin.

627
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,280
What's with the people in this palace?

628
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,400
I'm speaking this loudly,
but not a single one has appeared!

629
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,320
I'm here.

630
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,320
Ma'am.

631
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,640
Ma'am.

632
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,320
Madam Orn.

633
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,000
-Ma'am.
-Great-Grandma.

634
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,760
Great-Grandma.

635
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,240
He didn't hit her, did he?

636
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,520
No, she probably just fainted.

637
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,320
Great-Grandma.

638
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,680
Are you hurt, Jon?

639
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,920
No.

640
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,600
Fortunately, Mr. Saruj isn't here.

641
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,680
If he were,
he'd definitely have been shot.

642
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,840
Saruj has taken Muslin to the airport.
He knows about this already.

643
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:47,840
I see.

644
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,360
Great-Grandma, get up slowly.

645
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,280
Phu, Jon.

646
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,040
What happened to Great-Grandma?

647
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,120
She probably fainted.

648
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,080
Where is Nava? Where did he go?

649
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,440
He was lying right there.

650
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,080
Where did he go?

651
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,440
He's going to the airport to find Saruj.

652
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,560
I got it.

653
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,480
This is your ticket.

654
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,920
How will you stay here if I leave?

655
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Nava is also after you.

656
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,000
I'm going with you.

657
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,520
This is my ticket.

658
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,320
Really?

659
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,360
Are you really coming with me?

660
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:54,760
Yes.

661
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,160
I know how you are.

662
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,600
You won't be able to stay alone
at a time like this.

663
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,160
I'm so happy.

664
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,480
I'd go mad
if I had to go and stay by myself.

665
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,680
The parliament will be dissolved soon.

666
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,960
Mr. Danai won't be a minister anymore.

667
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,360
I called him and requested to take leave.

668
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,440
He remembers you.

669
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,800
I only have you.

670
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,880
You have always been by my side.

671
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,040
You're crying again.

672
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,920
Don't cry.

673
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,000
If I have nothing left,

674
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,840
then you'll have nothing left either.

675
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,600
Muslin!

676
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,440
Nava.

677
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,360
Don't you dare think
of going anywhere together.

678
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,760
If I have to die,

679
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,480
then I'll take you with me.

680
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,600
Saruj.

681
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,440
Let go!

682
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,560
In my capacity as a police officer,

683
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,960
I'm arresting you for possession
of a firearm in a public place,

684
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,000
for trespassing on Jutathep Palace,
and for attempted murder.

685
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,480
These are serious charges.
You won't get away this time.

686
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,840
Let go of me!

687
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,480
We didn't do anything.

688
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,000
You brought this on yourself.

689
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,840
Have a safe trip, Saruj.

690
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,920
Think of this as a vacation.

691
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,360
Don't worry, Mus.

692
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,240
After we've dealt with Nava,

693
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,480
you'll get to come home.

694
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,440
Thank you.

695
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,960
Jutatheps always help each other.

696
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,400
Give us time to take care of this,

697
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,680
so you can come back
and lead your normal lives.

698
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,960
I'm going to kill you all!

699
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,520
Come with us.

700
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,200
Let go! Why are you arresting me?

701
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,480
Let go of me!

702
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:18,840
I said let go!

703
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,400
Let go!

704
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,360
Thank you so much, guys.

705
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,120
You should go.

706
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,320
Good luck, Saruj.

707
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,240
Ma'am.

708
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,160
Ma'am.

709
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,440
-Hey.
-Oh dear.

710
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,280
Ma'am.

711
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,960
Madam Orn.

712
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,840
Madam Orn.

713
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,360
How are you?

714
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,400
Madam Orn.

715
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,040
A gun.

716
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,480
I shot a gun.

717
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:15,040
Yes, but it's okay now.

718
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,640
You're safe now. Mr. Nava has left.

719
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,920
Not Nava.

720
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,320
It was Chamnan.

721
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,600
Which Chamnan?

722
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,240
Yes, ma'am. It was Chamnan.

723
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,320
Madam Orn.

724
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,960
Are you hurt anywhere?

725
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,840
No.

726
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,960
So what happened?

727
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,120
Why can't I remember?

728
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,360
Well, back then,

729
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,120
you were very calm,

730
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,480
but you passed out
after you got surprised,

731
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,560
and you landed on the floor smoothly,

732
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,800
so you didn't get hit.

733
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,000
Who was going to hit me? Chamnan?

734
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:56,920
Nava.

735
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,080
-Nava was also going to hit me?
-Yes, ma'am.

736
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,040
Why is he so evil?

737
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,120
I'll get my grandchildren
to deal with him.

738
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:07,840
-Just you wait.
-Yes.

739
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,120
Ms. Cheewan.

740
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,960
Mr. Saruj has left.

741
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:13,160
What?

742
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,800
He's left?

743
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,200
Where did he go?

744
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,400
Saruj asked me to tell you

745
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,680
that he is going to take care of Muslin,
so don't worry about him.

746
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:29,200
What does he mean by taking care of her?

747
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,920
Is that all he said?

748
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:35,760
Didn't he leave me a letter or anything?

749
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,200
He asked me to pack some stuff
and take it to the airport.

750
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,360
He was flying to Europe with her.

751
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:45,120
He's taken leave

752
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,680
but didn't say for how long.

753
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,280
He didn't say for how long?

754
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,680
Saruj left his job?

755
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,640
For Mrs. Mus?

756
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:57,120
Yes.

757
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,400
Everything was in a rush.

758
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,680
Even though we caught Nava,

759
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,160
the legal process will take a month,

760
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:11,280
and Nava can live his life
like normal in the meantime.

761
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:14,360
He might take revenge on them

762
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:17,920
or might skip bail and go abroad.

763
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:21,840
Is it that bad?

764
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,440
Couldn't he even call me?

765
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,320
Are you okay, Cheewan?

766
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,640
I never told him.

767
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,120
I've been meaning to tell him for days,

768
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,320
but I never said it.

769
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,320
Why?

770
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:52,040
Why didn't I tell him?

771
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,480
What do you want to say?

772
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,240
What if he doesn't come back?

773
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,520
What if he never comes back?

774
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,360
If you're afraid I'll get back together
with her,

775
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,000
then tell me you love me.

776
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,400
That's got nothing to do with it.

777
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,760
If you say you love me,

778
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:16,280
I'll keep my heart

779
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,360
for you only.

780
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,120
How many times?

781
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,360
How many times
have you done this, Cheewan?

782
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,480
Why is it so difficult for you to say it?

783
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,320
Why?

784
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,640
Why didn't you just say it?

785
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,480
It's okay.

786
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:54,000
What if I don't get another chance?

787
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,720
What if he doesn't come back?

788
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,840
What if he never comes back?

789
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,560
Why?

790
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,520
-Why am I so stupid?
-Don't do this.

791
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,880
-Gosh, Cheewan.
-Calm down.

792
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,040
This apartment

793
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:54,200
is usually used by the embassy.

794
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,000
It's safe for us.

795
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,200
Is it okay for you?

796
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:01,880
Yes.

797
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,120
I can stay anywhere if you're with me.

798
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:22,840
You take the big room.
I'll take the small room upstairs.

799
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,840
We were just in Thailand this morning.

800
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,000
I don't know how we ended up here.

801
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:35,520
Everything happened so fast.
I'm still in shock.

802
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,920
I expected this would happen.

803
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,320
We finally got in trouble.

804
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,160
Get some rest.

805
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,840
We'll go out
to get something to eat later.

806
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,840
It's all done.

807
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:22,760
I just got bailed out.

808
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,960
Do you know what the first thing
I'm going to do is?

809
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,640
Take a rest?

810
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,200
Listen to a sermon?

811
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,160
Follow Saruj and Muslin
to the other side of the world.

812
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,120
I still have some connections.

813
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,120
I'll eventually find them.

814
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,360
They'll never get to live in peace.

815
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,520
Is that why Saruj can't come back?

816
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,960
But it has been three weeks now.

817
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:09,560
You see, Mr. Danai, his boss,

818
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,760
asked him
to take care of something abroad.

819
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,920
Meanwhile, he's keeping
Saruj's address a secret.

820
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,720
I don't think he'll contact us.

821
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,560
He'll only contact Mr. Danai.

822
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:22,920
Does this mean
none of you knows Saruj's address?

823
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:26,680
Yes.

824
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,320
What if Mr. Nava finds him?

825
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,520
What if he gets sick or--

826
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,440
Calm down, Cheewan.

827
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,040
I think he'll come back soon.

828
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,000
Nava was acquitted

829
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:42,800
in the collapsed condo case.

830
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,760
But he's facing
other much more serious charges.

831
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,520
We'll do our best

832
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,320
to bring Saruj back to Thailand.

833
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,520
Are you going to work?

834
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,200
Yes.

835
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,560
Are you going to leave me here alone?

836
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,080
There's a Thai temple near here.

837
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:24,800
I'll take you there so you can make
some friends and have something to do.

838
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,440
What if they recognize me?

839
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,320
I don't want to listen to their gossip.

840
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,160
I'd rather not. I don't want to go.

841
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:38,120
I'll stay here and do some housework
and cook while I wait for you.

842
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,480
Okay.

843
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,560
I MISS YOU, SARUJ. CAN YOU REPLY?

844
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:12,160
Answer me.

845
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,160
Gosh.

846
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:29,680
Gosh.

847
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,280
Please slow down. I can't catch them all.

848
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:39,440
Jon, catch them.
The bael fruits are getting bruised.

849
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,200
Jon.

850
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,520
I don't know
where she gets the energy from.

851
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,000
She's so active.

852
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,160
Cheewan.

853
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,720
Why are you picking so much?

854
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:58,360
Madam Orn gave me a recipe.
I want to try it out.

855
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,160
What's wrong with her?

856
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,160
She looks stressed.

857
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:08,160
She has been like this
since Mr. Saruj left a month ago.

858
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,160
-Jon.
-Yes?

859
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,160
Don't mention his name again. Got it?

860
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,560
I don't want to hear his name.

861
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,440
He's so selfish.

862
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,240
He hasn't sent me a single letter.

863
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,760
Is he not going to contact us at all?

864
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,440
There are people after him.

865
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:34,880
He isn't there for a holiday.

866
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,920
It's difficult for him to do anything.

867
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,480
You men are all the same.

868
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:40,880
You all take his side.

869
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,760
He won't come back

870
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:45,000
because he's obsessed with that woman.

871
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,760
He said there was nothing between them,

872
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,960
but they ran away together.

873
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,600
It's not like that. He loves you a lot.

874
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,160
He'll come back soon.

875
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:56,680
He'll forget about his home

876
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:57,800
and everyone here

877
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,360
and won't come back again.

878
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:12,360
Cheewan.

879
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:22,000
Here,

880
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,440
your reward.

881
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:30,440
Muslin always seems to irritate you.

882
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,480
It must be because…

883
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:40,360
JEALOUS

884
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:43,640
Hey! I said I'm not jealous.

885
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:45,160
I'm not. Take it back.

886
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:56,760
Everything…

887
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,640
seems to remind me of him.

888
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,680
When you love someone a lot,

889
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:04,080
you don't use this.

890
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:07,360
But…

891
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,800
When you love someone a lot…

892
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,680
but they don't return your feelings…

893
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:16,920
your heart gets shaken.

894
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,240
You feel anxious…

895
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,040
and restless.

896
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:38,440
It hurts right here.

897
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,640
The more I think of him,

898
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,240
the more it hurts.

899
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:48,120
When I think
that he's in love with someone else…

900
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,440
it hurts even more.

901
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,240
I can't stand being alone

902
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,640
without him by my side.

903
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:03,120
That's why you've been trying
to keep yourself occupied,

904
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,680
so it won't hurt so much, right?

905
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,480
When you love someone a lot

906
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:13,160
but they're not by your side,

907
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:15,080
your heart just feels empty.

908
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,760
When you love someone a lot,

909
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,760
but they don't return your feelings…

910
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,560
in here feels empty.

911
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,280
You feel like giving up on life.

912
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:28,600
I used to think…

913
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:32,120
that being single

914
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:35,200
or traveling the world

915
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:38,760
were my biggest dreams.

916
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:41,840
But then he came into my life.

917
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:46,840
I can't live by myself anymore.

918
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,920
Why is it like this, Cheewa?

919
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,280
Why?

920
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,240
Why, Cheewa?

921
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,640
Excuse me. I have a question.

922
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:33,680
If I want to send a postcard to a member
of staff who is posted overseas,

923
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,520
where should I send it?

924
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:39,680
You can send it to the Thai embassy.
Which country is it? I'll get the address.

925
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,080
I'm sending one to every country.

926
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:45,280
Every country?

927
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,000
Okay.

928
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,440
-Sure.
-Please help me.

929
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:21,000
You must listen to your heart from now on.

930
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,440
If you can't escape it,

931
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,600
and you can't stop loving them,

932
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,080
then just give in to it.

933
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:29,360
I gave in a long time ago.

934
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:32,720
I have no other choice…

935
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,320
but to fight.

936
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:39,280
Fight.

937
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,680
-Hello.
-Hello.

938
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,960
-Please give these documents to Mr. Saruj.
-Okay.

939
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:14,680
There are some letters
and a postcard as well.

940
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:15,880
Thank you.

941
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:39,640
I love you, Saruj.

942
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:41,440
Please come back to Thailand.

943
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:01,240
Mus, did someone from the embassy drop by?

944
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:02,680
Yes.

945
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:31,920
She brought you some documents.

946
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:34,000
Thank you.

947
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:46,720
Thank you.

948
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:07,960
Cheewa!

949
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:09,479
Cheewa!

950
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,920
What is it, Cheewan?

951
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:16,000
I got this address from a member of staff.

952
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:19,120
She said Saruj would be here
for a meeting and for work.

953
01:09:20,439 --> 01:09:23,640
Gosh. Date, time, and meeting venue?

954
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:24,720
Did you get it all?

955
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:25,840
Yes.

956
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:38,720
I want to go there.

957
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:01,400
You don't want me to aim high

958
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,680
because you're afraid I might get hurt.

959
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,520
If I have a chance to find love,

960
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,160
but it means I might get hurt…

961
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,640
I still think it'll be worth it.

962
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,160
If I don't fight for my love

963
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:16,280
or get to confess my love,

964
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:19,120
all I'll feel is pain.

965
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:21,800
This is the last day.
You should go and enjoy yourselves.

966
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,560
Someone is waiting for you at the museum.

967
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,080
She said she's your sister from Thailand.

968
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:31,840
Saruj has always shown me

969
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,040
that he loves me.

970
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:36,600
But I

971
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:40,040
have never told him I love him.

972
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:10,840
