1
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,280
I have a lot of evidence

2
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,040
showing you embezzled money
from construction projects.

3
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,240
-Mr. Nava.
-Well?

4
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,360
If you want to get another charge
for assaulting me,

5
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,520
then go ahead.

6
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,000
Hey.

7
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,400
-You must hug me to congratulate me.
-Nat.

8
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,680
Let go of me.

9
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,560
Do you think everyone will give in to you
just because you're rich?

10
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,680
Just go home, you liar.

11
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,120
This is such a tough battle.
I can't let you wage it alone.

12
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,880
There's a saying that goes,

13
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,000
"Love the person who loves you

14
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,320
more than you love them."

15
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,600
Make a smart choice, Nop.

16
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,960
You're awesome, Venus.

17
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,720
I chose the latest model.

18
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,200
Why a sports car?

19
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,200
Once Cheewa gives birth,
where will you all sit?

20
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,840
Poom was right about Dalad.

21
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,880
He should be saving money for the future.

22
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,840
When we talked,

23
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,520
he told me that he was planning
to invest in condos.

24
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,360
What?

25
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,680
Didn't he just start working with Nat?

26
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,000
He said he has the money he got
for his chocolate recipes.

27
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,200
But it can't be that much.

28
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,120
Yes,

29
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,560
you're right.

30
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,920
I need to go, Cheewan.

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,920
I need to use the toilet.

32
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,360
Hello, Cheewa.

33
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,720
Is that Simon?

34
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,320
I'm happy you remembered my voice.

35
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,800
How are you?

36
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,960
I heard about you and Dalad.

37
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,920
Cheewan told me about it on ICQ.

38
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,040
I'm happy that you're happy.

39
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,880
Thank you, Simon.

40
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,440
Cheewa, are you really okay

41
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,880
about Dalad working with Nat?

42
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,040
Why wouldn't I be okay?

43
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,720
Is anything wrong?

44
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,800
I heard that

45
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,840
the people Nat does business with

46
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,280
are drug dealers.

47
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,560
They opened a shipping company as a front.

48
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,280
I'm sorry for making you bring me
to the restroom so often.

49
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,000
I understand. I'll wait for you here.

50
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,440
Okay.

51
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,720
How is it?

52
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,040
-It's awesome.
-Great.

53
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,520
-See you later.
-See you.

54
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,040
Are you sure, Simon?

55
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,960
I'm not sure.

56
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,160
But I heard people here talking about it.

57
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,640
These gangsters

58
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,120
became millionaires overnight.

59
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,640
So what is it?

60
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,640
Why can't you talk to me inside?

61
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,680
This is the address
of Natsarid's warehouse.

62
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,880
Can you check it out

63
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,120
to make sure nothing fishy is going on?

64
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,840
Has something made you suspicious?

65
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,400
Is that why you want me to have a look?

66
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,480
Hello.

67
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,840
Hello, I'm here to see Dalad.

68
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,760
I don't see Snow Cocoa's name here?

69
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,800
There's no company with that name here.

70
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,400
Cheewa.

71
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,440
What are you doing here?

72
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,680
This way.

73
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,640
So this is your office.

74
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,640
Does this whole area
belong to your company?

75
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,600
Nat told me
to rent this place temporarily.

76
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,440
The main office at the warehouse
isn't finished yet.

77
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,600
I see. The warehouse is somewhere else.

78
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,960
Are you going there today?

79
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,280
I was going to go, but since you're here,

80
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,320
I won't go there now.

81
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,080
Well, I want to see your workplace.

82
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,680
We can drop by that famous noodle shop
on the way back. All right?

83
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,040
I said no.

84
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,080
What's in the warehouse?

85
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,040
Why can't I go there?

86
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,880
Excuse me.

87
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,600
I'm here to pick up my order.

88
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,240
Okay.

89
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,880
It's the address of the warehouse.

90
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,400
INVENTORY REPORT

91
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,440
What are you doing?

92
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,920
I fancy some hot chocolate.

93
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,040
I can make some with this, right?

94
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,920
Don't open it.

95
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,680
What is in here?

96
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,680
You can't open it.

97
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,320
Why? What's in here?

98
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,720
I'm sorry.

99
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,520
I didn't want you to open it because

100
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,560
one of the staff here ordered it.

101
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,200
But it's okay.
I can give them a new packet.

102
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,680
I'll get the vacuum.

103
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,680
No,

104
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,560
I'm sure it's fine.

105
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,120
If you're sure,

106
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,800
why are you asking me to check it out?

107
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,600
Well…

108
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,400
Just tell me,

109
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,440
so I can help you.

110
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,320
Simon heard some news

111
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,400
that Natsarid was in contact
with some criminals in Switzerland.

112
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,840
So you're afraid
something bad will happen to Dalad?

113
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,040
I'll check it out for you

114
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,360
so you can be sure

115
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,720
that Dalad's job is legal.

116
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,720
Thank you for being so understanding.

117
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,120
Poom, you're like
my knight in shining armor.

118
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,720
You always help me.

119
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,240
"Can I be your knight?"

120
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,000
It's a good drawing.

121
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,200
Poom.

122
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,600
Do you have a boyfriend?

123
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,720
Does Vit know about this?

124
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,000
He doesn't know

125
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,360
or you don't have one?

126
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,880
I don't have one.

127
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,040
That means you're in love.

128
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,800
You have a crush on your senior, right?

129
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,080
If he doesn't accept your feelings,
just tell me.

130
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,480
I'll deal with him for you

131
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,480
because I'm your real knight.

132
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,160
Don't worry.

133
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,720
I'll take care of it for you.

134
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,960
Thank you.

135
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,760
Why did Cheewa ask you to spy on it
if she's confident nothing's going on?

136
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,200
Exactly.

137
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,520
Why are you following us?

138
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,240
Well, you two are talking about Poncheewa,
so I want to join you.

139
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,080
I'll go and find out
what's going on there.

140
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,960
If it were just Dalad,
I wouldn't suspect anything.

141
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,240
But Natsarid is involved in this.

142
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,600
It's possible they're involved with drugs.

143
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,800
But Dalad isn't that kind of person.

144
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,040
He was my roommate for almost a year.

145
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,600
He's really a good person.

146
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,920
Give me the warehouse address.

147
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,280
I'll find out for myself

148
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,360
if Natsarid opened a company
as a front just to sell drugs or not.

149
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,160
I can't let you go alone.

150
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,720
I have to come with you.

151
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,880
I'm coming too.

152
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,160
-No.
-No.

153
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,920
-Let me come with you.
-I said no.

154
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,320
I know that,

155
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,680
but I'm going anyway.

156
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,040
Why didn't you say you were going to stop?

157
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,720
If there are drugs at the warehouse,

158
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,560
then it'll be dangerous.

159
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,040
Well then, I must go in case I can help.

160
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,760
You'll help more if you don't go.

161
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,200
If you come,

162
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,920
I'll be too worried about you.

163
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,280
I won't be able to concentrate
if you're there.

164
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,080
This is important for Poncheewa.

165
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,680
I want to help her.

166
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,160
Let me come with you, please.

167
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,040
I'll do anything you want me to do.

168
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,480
Anything?

169
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,720
I'll do anything for Poncheewa.

170
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,000
In that case, tell me

171
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,480
that you love me.

172
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,120
What?

173
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,680
Didn't you say just now

174
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,440
that you would do anything
to go to the warehouse with me?

175
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,520
Tell me that you also love me.

176
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,400
You love me like a woman loves a man.

177
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,840
I'm willing to trade anything

178
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,360
to hear you tell me that you love me.

179
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,640
Okay, fine.

180
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,160
I'm not going anymore.

181
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,400
No, I'm not going anymore.

182
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,760
You told me

183
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,160
that freedom makes life worthwhile.

184
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,280
But for me,

185
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,360
getting to spend it with our loved ones
makes it worthwhile.

186
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,880
My life will be worthless
if I don't get to spend it with them.

187
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,160
Gosh,

188
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,560
you're talking like this again.

189
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,080
You're so stubborn.

190
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,800
Must I die

191
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,360
before I hear you say you love me?

192
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,840
Hey,

193
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,400
why are you talking about death?

194
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,520
Come on.

195
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,080
If I'm not with the person I love,

196
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,560
there's no way I'll die yet.

197
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,600
Go and take a shower.
Then go check out the warehouse.

198
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,200
If they don't let me go to the warehouse…

199
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,520
I must hold Natsarid up
so he won't go to the warehouse.

200
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,600
What?

201
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,040
Hello.

202
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,440
Cheewan?

203
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,480
How did you know I was here?

204
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,720
When we were in Switzerland,
I cleaned your house

205
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,720
and did your papers,

206
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,720
so I'm here to ask

207
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,560
if you need help with anything.

208
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,079
I should be asking you

209
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,880
why you're here

210
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,600
and what you want from me.

211
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,680
Nothing.

212
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,240
You don't need to do anything.

213
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,600
Just stay here

214
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,120
and don't go anywhere.

215
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,160
Just leave the rest to me.

216
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,400
Chocolate boxes.

217
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,400
This is the place.

218
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,200
Let's go.

219
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,520
Were you playing games?

220
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,680
Yes, but I'm bored now.

221
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,520
I was going to go to work.

222
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,840
Work?

223
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,120
Why would you do that?

224
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,320
That's what decent people do.

225
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,440
Wicked people like us don't need to do it.

226
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,160
What?

227
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,560
What game is this?

228
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,400
I've never played it before.

229
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,360
Can you teach me?

230
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,920
Sure.

231
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,600
-Pass me the disc.
-Here you go.

232
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,160
Let me ask you something.

233
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,680
What is it?

234
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,320
Is there a reason you came to see me?

235
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,080
It's nothing. I just came here to see you.

236
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,040
Since you came here alone,

237
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,480
it means I can do anything I want to you.

238
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,600
You won't be mad at me, will you?

239
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,760
I love you.

240
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,640
Hold on.

241
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,800
Well,

242
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,240
I actually need your help with something.

243
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,920
I can help you with anything.

244
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,280
As long as you're happy,

245
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,960
I'm willing to help you with anything.

246
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,160
This is broken.

247
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,240
Hey!

248
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,080
It's broken. Look.

249
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,640
It's not broken.

250
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,680
It's not?

251
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,240
But it was broken when I was at home.

252
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,040
Let me try one more time.

253
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,840
No.

254
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,960
It's not broken.

255
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,360
-Gosh.
-It really is broken.

256
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,480
-Gosh.
-Hey.

257
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,000
Give it to me.

258
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,440
There you go.

259
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,120
That's what you call broken.

260
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,360
Come here.

261
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,760
Where are you going?

262
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,120
-Well?
-I'm going…

263
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,160
I'm going to buy a new one.

264
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,760
You're not going anywhere.

265
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,000
You're staying with me here.

266
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,560
We don't need that damn tool.

267
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,760
I'll give you a shock myself.

268
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,920
Hold on.

269
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,600
I'll cook some food for you.

270
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,480
What do you have in the fridge?

271
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm not hungry.

272
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,840
I'm craving something else right now.

273
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,640
I can't take that positively.

274
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,760
You're pure evil.

275
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,040
Evil but delicious.

276
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,560
That's me.

277
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,400
Do you want to try me?

278
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,040
Don't come near me.

279
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,800
I'm happy

280
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,240
that you thought of me.

281
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,080
Just a second.

282
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,000
What is it, Mod?

283
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,760
Someone broke into the warehouse.

284
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,920
Who?

285
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,080
Let me check it out.

286
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,640
Find them.

287
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,080
Let me.

288
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,080
Saruj.

289
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,520
Saruj?

290
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,760
Cheewan,

291
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,760
did you plan…

292
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,880
Did you dare deceive me?

293
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,640
Mod, catch them.

294
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,960
Don't let them get away.

295
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,200
I'll deal with him.

296
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,360
Natsarid really does sell drugs.

297
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,760
We must report this to the police.

298
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,160
We can't deal with this ourselves.

299
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,400
We've got evidence.

300
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,760
He won't get away with it.

301
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,160
Hey.

302
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,560
Why are you so naughty?

303
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,640
Breaking in here like that,
did you think we'd just let you go?

304
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,640
Get them!

305
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,040
Let's go.

306
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,160
Natsarid.

307
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,080
Good.

308
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,440
Remember my name well,

309
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,680
so you two

310
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:22,440
can come back to take your revenge on me
in your next lives.

311
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,600
My gosh.

312
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,200
What's wrong, dear?

313
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,160
Does it hurt?

314
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,400
It kicked so hard just now.

315
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,360
It hurt my rib.

316
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,400
It must feel cramped in there,

317
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,480
so it needed to stretch.

318
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,440
Poom?

319
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,960
Where are you going?

320
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,960
I need to talk to Vit quickly.

321
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,160
Okay, don't take long.

322
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,160
My grandchild must be starving.

323
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,360
How is it?

324
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,200
Vit.

325
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,480
Do you have Ronnajak's number?

326
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,480
Yes.

327
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,360
Why do you want to call him?

328
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,360
I need him to help Poom.

329
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,960
Just get out.

330
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,480
We're going round in circles.

331
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,960
You don't know where you're going.

332
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,440
I told you the warehouse is around here.

333
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,920
Can't you go around one more time?

334
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,280
I'm running out of gas now.

335
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,560
I also have to take my car to the garage.

336
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,000
Go find it yourself.

337
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,280
Hey, hurry up.

338
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,160
Also, pay me the fare.

339
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,080
Okay.

340
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,560
Here you go.

341
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,960
Will I ever find it?

342
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,000
I could blow your brains out.

343
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,760
Would you like that?

344
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,320
Well?

345
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,320
If you don't want that to happen,

346
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,680
then tell me

347
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,080
how you found out about this.

348
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,880
Who the hell told you about it?

349
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,520
No one told me. I found out myself,

350
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,200
like I found out
you were using drugs in Switzerland.

351
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,760
Someone with good prospects like you

352
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,600
shouldn't destroy them
by trafficking drugs.

353
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,920
You can still turn over a new leaf.

354
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,560
Since you two know about this,

355
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,800
I have no reason to let you live.

356
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,280
How about this?

357
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:10,160
I'll burn you two to ashes.
That'll be satisfying.

358
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,400
Well?

359
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,320
Hey, guys. Tie them up.

360
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,480
-Hey, let go of me.
-Let go.

361
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,400
-I said let go of me.
-Let go of me.

362
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,880
-Let go.
-Why would I do that?

363
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,040
Mod.

364
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,720
Burn this place down.

365
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,800
Hold on.

366
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,880
The product is worth millions.

367
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,760
It's Dalad.

368
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,080
Hello.

369
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,760
Hey, are you on your way with the order?

370
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,680
I came here to get it,

371
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,480
but I found Saruj and Poom here.
They know everything.

372
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,160
What?

373
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,160
The Jutatheps are at the warehouse?

374
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,400
How did they find out?

375
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,160
Stop asking me questions.

376
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,720
Nat and I are dealing with them.
I need to go.

377
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,280
Cheewan knows about this.

378
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,800
That's why she came to my condo
to distract me.

379
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,160
Cheewan also knows about this?

380
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,000
We're screwed.

381
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,160
Even if they're both dead,

382
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,520
we can't guarantee

383
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,560
that other people don't know about this.

384
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,680
We must burn the warehouse down

385
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,160
to destroy the evidence.

386
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,640
Okay.

387
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,960
Hey, you two.

388
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,960
Get some gasoline from behind the factory

389
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,960
and pour it all over this place.

390
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,080
Let's burn those two with the product. Go.

391
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,360
Yes, sir.

392
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,480
Damn it!

393
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,880
Hey, I have some business to take care of.
Are you done?

394
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,120
Yes, sir.

395
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,640
Let's go.

396
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,320
Where is it?

397
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,040
That's Natsarid's car.

398
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,480
Poom, do you have a plan?

399
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,440
Push against the rope to loosen it.

400
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,040
-Hurry up.
-Okay.

401
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,800
Saruj, are you okay?

402
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,080
I'm good.

403
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,480
The Jutatheps already know about this.

404
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,440
They know about this.

405
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,560
What should I do?

406
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,920
Saruj.

407
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,960
Saruj!

408
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,400
Poom!

409
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,040
Saruj!

410
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,640
Saruj!

411
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,040
Saruj!

412
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,240
Poom!

413
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,600
Saruj, can you hear me?

414
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,560
Saruj!

415
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,440
Saruj!

416
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,720
Saruj!

417
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,360
Saruj, don't die.

418
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,360
You told me

419
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,280
that freedom makes life worthwhile.

420
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,760
But for me,

421
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,480
getting to spend it with our loved ones
makes it worthwhile.

422
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,000
My life will be worthless
if I don't get to spend it with them.

423
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,960
You're so stubborn.

424
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,960
Must I die

425
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,480
before I hear you say you love me?

426
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,360
What the hell are you doing?

427
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,240
Have you lost your mind?

428
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,560
Jak.

429
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,600
Saruj…

430
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,280
and Poom are in there.

431
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,480
I know. I'm going in there.

432
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,960
But promise me you will get out.

433
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,760
Wait for me outside, all right?

434
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,720
I came here

435
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,200
because I want to learn about your life.

436
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,600
If you get to live with someone you love,

437
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,720
anywhere is heaven.

438
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,240
I won't love anyone.

439
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,080
You must listen to your heart from now on.

440
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,080
If you can't escape it

441
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,520
and you can't stop loving them,

442
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,360
then just give in to it.

443
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,560
When you love someone a lot,

444
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,400
but they're not by your side,

445
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,360
your heart just feels empty.

446
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,680
If I'm not with the person I love,
there's no way I'll die yet.

447
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,320
We're going to Phuket. Pack your things.

448
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,160
But the baby's nearly due.

449
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,040
I'll drive slowly. You'll be all right.

450
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,000
Dara is sick.

451
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,960
I'm worried about her. I want to see her.

452
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,680
But I'm waiting…

453
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,600
I'm waiting for a call.

454
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,440
Waiting?

455
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,120
Do you mean you're waiting for Poom?

456
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,640
Well?

457
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,160
I'm waiting for Cheewan to call.

458
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,680
This should be enough. Let's go.

459
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,440
Let's go.

460
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,680
Hold on.

461
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,400
Come on.

462
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,640
Can we walk slowly?

463
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,120
Chat insisted you two
get a proper check-up,

464
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,960
even if you say--

465
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,480
-I'm fine.
-I'm fine.

466
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,680
Chat told me

467
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,840
that you two would say this

468
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,040
and you really did.

469
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,200
By the way, Jak,

470
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,080
I got one packet.

471
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,200
There are drugs in here.

472
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,680
You can use it as evidence.

473
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,240
Is Dalad involved in this?

474
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,400
What a shame for Poncheewa.

475
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,680
What were you doing here, Cheewan?

476
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,400
Didn't I tell you not to come?

477
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,320
And why are your eyes swollen?

478
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,320
She was crying.

479
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,200
She wanted to run inside.

480
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,800
That was silly of you.

481
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,120
I…

482
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,520
I…

483
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,800
What is it?

484
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,960
Yes, I know all about it.

485
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,040
That little brat,

486
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,280
always causing me trouble.

487
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,480
Dad, you have to help me.

488
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,840
With what?

489
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,360
I kept some stuff
at your warehouse in Rangsit

490
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,040
and the police raided it.

491
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,880
There was a fire.

492
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,920
What were you keeping in the warehouse?

493
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,960
Chocolate. It's for my business.

494
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,160
There are drugs in the chocolate, right?

495
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,840
I was curious about this,
but I didn't think you'd do it.

496
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,560
But my stuff is good.

497
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,360
If I can sell it before anyone else,
I'll get rich fast.

498
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,480
I might be able to earn more
by doing this than you do.

499
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,800
If you help me, we can get rich together.

500
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,360
You stupid kid.

501
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,200
You put that filthy stuff
in a warehouse registered in my name.

502
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,480
The police will come after me.

503
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,080
Do you want to get me killed?

504
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,320
Sir, that's enough.

505
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,960
It won't help if you beat him to death.

506
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,720
Why don't we help each other think

507
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,080
who we have to pay off to cover this up?

508
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,400
Didn't you say the warehouse was burning?
Everyone will know about it.

509
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,320
What about the condo that collapsed?

510
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,320
You were able to cover that up.

511
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,000
Can't you help me with this?

512
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,400
That was just a building.

513
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,640
This is drugs.
You can get the death penalty!

514
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,520
Who can help you?

515
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,680
Good! If you don't help me,
then we're both screwed.

516
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,440
You're my dad.

517
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,520
You're responsible for my life!

518
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,240
-You brat.
-That's enough, sir.

519
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,360
Let's go.

520
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,960
We're leaving.

521
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,640
You evil child!

522
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,480
You ungrateful son!

523
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,840
You were born to ruin me, weren't you?

524
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,720
Damn it!

525
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,120
Hold on, Nat.

526
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,840
What are we going to do?

527
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,200
I have some cash in the office.

528
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,840
We'll leave the country.

529
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,600
Okay, let's hurry

530
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,360
or the police will get there before us.

531
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,560
Dalad, I thought you were in a hurry.
Why did you bring me here?

532
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,800
Just come.

533
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,320
What's this about?

534
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,840
Dalad, where are you taking me?

535
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,960
Why are you taking so much cash?

536
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:40,640
We found drugs at the warehouse.
There was a confrontation.

537
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,520
Everybody is safe now.
Don't worry about us.

538
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,560
Hey.

539
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,240
You told the Jutatheps
to go to the warehouse.

540
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,480
You took the address from me, didn't you?

541
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,080
Well?

542
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:52,880
Did you know Nat was selling drugs?

543
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,040
Yes. I knew from the start.

544
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,440
Do you think a poor person like me
has a choice?

545
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,120
Damn it!

546
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,800
-Come here.
-Dalad.

547
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,880
-Where are you taking me?
-Come here.

548
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:13,960
Tell me.

549
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,680
Why are we taking this elevator
and not the one to the lobby?

550
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,720
My people and I always take this one.

551
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,800
Let's go.

552
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,760
Hold on, Dalad.

553
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,240
You said you guys always take this lift.

554
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,920
What if Nat is also waiting for this lift?

555
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,280
What if he's taking it too?

556
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,840
Nat, hold on.

557
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,600
Why are we taking this one,
not the one in the lobby?

558
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:24,400
Fewer people use this one.
It's more convenient.

559
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,680
Okay.

560
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,520
Is this your floor?

561
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,840
Dalad.

562
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,000
Hey, Dalad knows the code.

563
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,440
He betrayed us.

564
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,600
Damn it!

565
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,800
He stole my money. I'm going to kill him.

566
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,200
This is Poncheewa's pager.

567
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,000
They must have just left.
Let's go after them.

568
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,600
Damn you.

569
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,440
Dalad.

570
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,480
Dalad.

571
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,160
Hold on, Dalad.

572
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,160
Where are you taking me?
Is Dara really sick?

573
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,920
Dara is in Bangkok,
but she has a house in Phuket.

574
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,280
I have the key.

575
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,200
We'll go there and think about what to do.

576
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,320
But I'm not involved in this.

577
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,400
Just leave me here.

578
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,320
I can't leave you here.

579
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,280
I'm doing all this for you and our child.

580
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,280
It'll be just the three of us from now on.

581
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,640
We'll start a new life together.

582
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,240
Dalad, let go.

583
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,720
Get in.

584
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,320
Dalad!

585
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,360
-Dalad!
-Damn it!

586
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:42,360
Damn it, Nat, I told you not to trust him.

587
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:45,200
He took all our money. What do we do now?

588
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,520
Where the hell can he go?

589
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,080
Phuket.

590
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,280
Phuket.

591
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,840
His sister lives in Phuket.

592
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,200
He must be going to Phuket.

593
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,360
There aren't many routes to Phuket.

594
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,520
I think we can still catch him. Let's go.

595
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,200
Hello, Pae.

596
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:16,080
Remember Dalad's plate number.
It's SorWor 2288.

597
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,840
Send this to all our men.

598
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,560
He's heading south.

599
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,760
Focus on the main roads first.

600
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,200
He has a pregnant woman with him.

601
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,440
If you can catch him,

602
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,600
I'll give you 100,000 baht.

603
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,160
Get him for me.

604
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:43,960
What do you mean?

605
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,320
Cheewa didn't come home last night?

606
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,360
Yes, the kids said

607
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:51,200
Dalad came to pick her up
yesterday evening.

608
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,360
I see.

609
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,640
Dad, Mom.

610
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,240
Come and look at this.

611
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,360
What is it?

612
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,080
Breaking news.

613
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,400
Yesterday evening, an investigation unit

614
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,840
discovered a gang of drug smugglers

615
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,920
who were using a chocolate trading company
as a front.

616
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,440
Isn't that Dalad's company?

617
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,600
-I remember it.
-What?

618
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:25,840
No wonder

619
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,600
he gets so rich

620
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,120
while the economy is plummeting.

621
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,040
Honey,

622
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:37,280
maybe Dalad is running away
and he's taken Cheewa with him.

623
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,560
What? Is he running away?

624
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,360
Hold on.

625
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,760
Poncheewa.

626
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,040
I'm going to faint.

627
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,560
-Honey.
-Mom.

628
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,960
They found chocolate packages

629
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,360
with small packets of cocaine
hidden inside.

630
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:56,720
We have a problem.

631
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,160
Dalad kidnapped Poncheewa yesterday.

632
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:02,520
What? Poncheewa is about to give birth.

633
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,880
He's so thoughtless.
Why doesn't he escape alone?

634
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:10,120
I think it's time for the Jutatheps
to come together to protect a Dhevaprom.

635
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:15,440
Yes.

636
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,520
Please tell your subordinates

637
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,760
to check the border checkpoints for me.

638
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:21,440
Sure.

639
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,160
And these…

640
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:24,840
are photos of them.

641
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,280
I'll take care of this for you.
Don't worry.

642
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,200
Thank you.

643
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,440
Please check for two people
matching this description.

644
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,160
They are a pregnant woman

645
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,240
and a man around 25 years of age.

646
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,400
Sure.

647
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:46,720
Can you find them with this photo?

648
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,760
I'll try.

649
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,080
Great.

650
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,760
Order our men at every checkpoint

651
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,360
on the roads heading south

652
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,320
to stop a red sports car

653
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,520
with the plate number SorWor 2288.

654
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,000
-Roger that.
-Roger that.

655
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,040
SORWOR 2288.

656
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,480
What are you doing?

657
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,040
This is for the food.

658
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,400
And this is for you.

659
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,360
Keep your mouth shut.

660
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,800
Pretend you didn't see this.

661
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,320
-Okay.
-Got it?

662
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,120
The food is here.

663
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,240
Are you just going to lock yourself
in the bathroom?

664
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,280
Won't you listen to what I have to say?

665
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,160
Dara.

666
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,840
Dara, come out here now.

667
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,720
Dara.

668
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,240
I know you're in there.

669
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,280
Dara.

670
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,120
-Cheewan.
-Cheewan.

671
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,320
What are you doing?

672
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,160
She won't come out,
so I have to break in and talk to her.

673
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,000
You can't do that. It's illegal.

674
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,760
I don't care.

675
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,320
Dara,

676
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,560
come out here and talk to me.

677
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,600
Fine, I'll come out.

678
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:37,200
But before you say anything,

679
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,240
I'm telling you
I didn't know anything about this.

680
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:43,120
Your brother is part
of a big drug smuggling gang.

681
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,600
Are you trying to tell me
you don't know anything about it?

682
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:46,640
I don't.

683
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,480
What do you want me to do?

684
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,720
I wasn't involved with him running away

685
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,720
or what he has been doing.

686
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,240
But Dalad is your brother.

687
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,240
If he saw me as his sister,

688
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,960
he'd have listened to me.

689
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,760
He'd have stayed away from that rich girl

690
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,680
and he wouldn't be in this mess.

691
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:07,200
Are you saying Dalad is selling drugs
because of Cheewa?

692
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,240
Well, it's true.

693
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,040
She's just a spoiled rich girl

694
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,320
who jumped into bed with a guy

695
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,200
and got herself pregnant.

696
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,800
Why does he have
to be responsible for her?

697
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,040
-That's too much.
-Enough!

698
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:21,240
-Cheewan.
-Cheewan, stop.

699
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,400
That's enough. We should go.

700
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,080
But Saruj.

701
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:27,040
We have wasted enough time.

702
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:30,120
Cheewa and Dalad aren't here.

703
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,040
Yes, Saruj is right. Let's go.

704
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,520
Every minute is valuable.

705
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,360
Cheewa could go into labor at any time.

706
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,800
Let's go.

707
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:42,800
Let's go.

708
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,640
What's more,

709
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:00,520
the warehouse where the drugs were stored

710
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,320
is owned by Mr. Nava Wongpanich,

711
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,600
a well-known former government minister.

712
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,040
My goodness.

713
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,920
Isn't that Mr. Nava?

714
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:12,040
Maybe it's his son.

715
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,720
They're both as bad as each other.

716
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,320
It's a good thing I decided to leave him.

717
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,240
Otherwise, who knows
what my life might have been like?

718
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,040
I don't know how your life is now,

719
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:33,760
but I'm sure that

720
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,080
it's way better than before thanks to me.

721
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:38,560
Nava.

722
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:50,720
Are you drunk?

723
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,280
Let's take a look
at Mr. Nava's background.

724
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:55,960
In the past,

725
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:59,960
every woman in this country
had their eyes on the millionaire,

726
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:02,200
as he was handsome, rich, and powerful.

727
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,920
He was a political party leader.

728
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,440
He has served as a minister and had

729
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:09,800
the potential to become the prime minister
after the next election.

730
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,240
It hurts, doesn't it?

731
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,200
When I was prosperous,

732
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:19,520
people flocked around me.

733
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:23,120
But now that I'm screwed,
I don't see a single one of them.

734
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,000
Not even my wife.

735
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:29,760
I wouldn't want a divorce
if you hadn't hurt me--

736
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,160
Are you going to divorce me?

737
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:32,280
Mr. Nava!

738
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,600
You married me for my money.

739
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,400
You're no different from everyone else.

740
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,160
My gosh, Mr. Nava!

741
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,640
Mr. Nava.

742
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,920
Please calm down and talk about this.

743
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:51,960
Mr. Nava.

744
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,280
Mr. Nava.

745
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,080
Please calm down.

746
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,240
Think carefully about what you're doing.

747
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,560
Did you think I'd just let you divorce me?

748
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,000
Well?

749
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:11,600
Mr. Nava.

750
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,120
I'm begging you.

751
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:17,000
Please spare us.

752
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,800
Please.

753
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,480
Nava.

754
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,560
Why don't we take this opportunity
to clear the air?

755
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:35,960
Mus, what are you trying to do?

756
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:59,000
There are only Japanese restaurants
around here.

757
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,680
I hope you don't mind
having some sashimi with your drink.

758
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:06,520
Mom.

759
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,560
Please go and buy some.

760
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,440
Mus.

761
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,760
I'm not going anywhere.

762
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,560
It's good we get to talk.

763
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:21,600
Jak, how are things there?

764
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:24,360
Poom, come to my office now.

765
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,960
We have a lead.

766
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,240
Okay.

767
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,240
Jak wants us to go to his office now.

768
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,440
Let's go.

769
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:39,280
Mr. Saruj.

770
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,280
-Ma'am.
-Please help Mus.

771
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,600
Mr. Nava came to our house.

772
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:47,040
Who was that?

773
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:06,840
What is it?

774
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,800
I was thinking of the day we first met.

775
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:13,960
You spilled some wine on me.

776
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:17,960
I was wearing a white shirt like this.

777
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:22,480
I remember that.

778
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,440
It was a really expensive designer shirt.

779
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:27,880
That night, I was terrified

780
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:29,320
that you'd get mad.

781
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,080
You kept apologizing.

782
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,320
You wanted to remove my shirt right there.

783
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,960
You never wanted to marry anyone…

784
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,080
but you married me.

785
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:51,920
I've always told you

786
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:54,720
that no one else is like you.

787
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,120
I really do love you.

788
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,280
But it's not enough.

789
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,800
Nothing is ever enough

790
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:11,840
for women like you.

791
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,760
Meanwhile, you're crazy for power.

792
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:16,680
-You never cared about my feelings--
-You were unfaithful.

793
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:19,080
You had an affair. You cheated on me.

794
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:20,480
I've never had an affair.

795
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,200
Not even once.

796
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,120
Nava.

797
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:28,720
Believe me.

798
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,120
This has nothing to do with Saruj.

799
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,200
I already called the police,

800
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,960
but they're not here yet.

801
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,200
I'll go in myself.

802
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,200
Hold on.

803
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,960
You can't go inside.

804
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:54,440
Mr. Nava still thinks
you're having an affair with Mrs. Muslin.

805
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,560
If you go inside now,

806
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,480
you might not come out alive.

807
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,400
This is the food you bought, right?

808
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,120
Yes.

809
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,480
I'll go in.

810
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:09,000
You stay here.

811
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,640
Don't go in.

812
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,760
Wait here. Don't go in.

813
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,240
Wait, Cheewan.

814
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,080
Cheewan.

815
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,320
Can we try again?

816
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,400
I love you so much.

817
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:32,480
I have no one left now.

818
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:34,320
I only have you.

819
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:47,840
I'm sorry, but I can't get back
together with you.

820
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:50,600
Please let me go.

821
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:25,680
Well then, there aren't many more ways

822
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,360
that we can be together.

823
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:44,160
Here it is.

824
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,760
Your food is here.

825
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:49,920
Gosh, the restaurant took so long
to make this.

826
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,240
You must be starving, Mr. Nava.

827
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,240
Here you go.

828
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:56,320
Hey.

829
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,920
Aren't you from the Jutathep Palace?
What are you doing here?

830
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:03,040
I came to buy shallots.

831
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:05,920
The market here sells good shallots.

832
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,120
I wanted to have
more spicy canned fish salad

833
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,160
so I dropped by to buy more.

834
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,080
Let me clean up the broken glass
for you first

835
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:17,080
or it will cut you.

836
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:19,000
Don't stand up just yet

837
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:21,720
or you could get hurt.

838
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:24,560
Where is the broom?

839
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:30,120
I'll get it for you.

840
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:35,080
Mr. Nava.

841
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:37,640
This Japanese food is really good.

842
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,800
I queued up for so long.

843
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:42,160
Let me clean up the broken glass,

844
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,040
so you can have your food.

845
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:47,160
Oh dear, I should have brought it with me.

846
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:48,440
How could I forget it?

847
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:49,800
-Why am I so forgetful--
-Shut up!

848
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,880
You talk too much!
You're getting on my nerves!

849
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,200
Hey.

850
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:54,920
Please don't do it, Nava.

851
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,240
Don't go in there.

852
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,680
Take it easy.

853
01:08:28,359 --> 01:08:29,840
If you wanted to help me and the baby,

854
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:32,399
you wouldn't have gotten involved
with Natsarid in the first place.

855
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:33,359
Cheewa.

856
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:37,880
My gosh!

857
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:41,680
Can you carry on?

858
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:44,760
I'm thinking of buying
a new house for my mom.

859
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,920
Which one do you think I should buy?

860
01:08:47,479 --> 01:08:49,160
Boiled Chinese sausage.

861
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:51,680
Steamed fish with curry paste.

862
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,520
I'm getting hungry listening to you.

863
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,560
Let's get some rice.

864
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,279
-Hey.
-This is for Madam Orn only.

865
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:00,560
There's none for you.

866
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:01,760
Mr. Nava is at home.

867
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,279
Why isn't Muslin picking up then?

868
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:07,000
You dumbass. I'm so stupid.
I keep calling the wrong number.

869
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,680
How much credit have I wasted now?

870
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:39,920
