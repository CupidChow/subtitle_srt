1
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,960
Why can't we be like brother and sister?

2
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,840
Mr. Saruj.

3
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,920
You're the woman
who is making me, M.L. Saruj Jutathep,

4
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,120
who has always been superior,
feel so inferior.

5
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,080
I'm inferior to a kid
who hasn't graduated.

6
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,680
Inferior to everyone.

7
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,160
You work hard for our country

8
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,880
like what the Jutatheps do.

9
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,760
You're flattering me now.

10
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,400
Don't think that way again.

11
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,280
You're not inferior to anyone.

12
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,160
Mr. Saruj.

13
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,200
Mrs. Kratin sent me to ask
if you're free this evening.

14
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,280
She's planning to throw a small party.

15
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,640
A party?

16
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,040
- It's burning.
- This one.

17
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,960
Here are more fish balls.

18
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,520
- Thank you.
- Meatballs.

19
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,040
It's a little hot.

20
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,680
- Please eat up.
- Over here.

21
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,200
Mr. Saruj is here.

22
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,960
Mr. Saruj.

23
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,560
We'd like to apologize to you.

24
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,920
We haven't been able to sleep.

25
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,080
He's right.

26
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,720
We'd like to apologize to you
about that day.

27
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,000
- I feel so bad.
- Yes.

28
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,280
I'll let you off this time,

29
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,960
but if you do it again, you're out.

30
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,680
- Come.
- Cheers.

31
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,360
This one is good.

32
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,280
Here you go.

33
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,080
Besides thanking Mr. Saruj,

34
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,240
I also have
an important announcement to make.

35
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,560
It's a great and delightful thing.

36
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,360
Right, Pana?

37
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,200
Yes.

38
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,880
Believe me when I tell you,

39
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,080
I was thrilled when Pana told me about it.

40
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,880
But for this kind of thing,

41
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,320
the woman's side shouldn't announce it.

42
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,880
I'll let you announce it then, Pana.

43
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,800
Please, Pana.

44
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,520
- Sir, wake up.
- What?

45
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,760
- Come on.
- Get up.

46
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,040
Most importantly, I came here today…

47
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,480
No, let me do it properly.

48
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,280
I came here today
to ask for Cheewan's hand

49
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,760
for my son, Nop.

50
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,440
So they can be married in the future.

51
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,240
Nop, what's this about?

52
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,360
I don't know.

53
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm the one who arranged this.

54
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,640
Didn't you tell Cheewan

55
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,880
in Khao Yai that you love her?

56
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,400
Since things have come this far,

57
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,440
why don't you two just get engaged?

58
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,600
Hold on.

59
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,840
Get engaged? Who's in love with whom?

60
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,000
Nop and…

61
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,240
me?

62
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,320
Well, back then…

63
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,120
I put a ring in the bun,

64
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,560
but I didn't…

65
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,640
Well…

66
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,240
Hey, what are you waiting for?

67
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,160
I love you.

68
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,960
- That's it!
- There you go!

69
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,560
So I told my dad about it.

70
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,360
- That's right.
- Yes.

71
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,280
I'm very happy about this, Cheewan,

72
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,800
because Klaow and I have been best friends
since we were small.

73
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,720
And now,

74
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,040
you'll be my daughter-in-law.

75
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,760
No one is more suitable than you.

76
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,440
Hold on, but…

77
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,800
Why did no one ask me about this?
I'm still in college.

78
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,280
Right.

79
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,200
She's still young
and I still have one more year to go.

80
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,440
Listen. Kids your age in the countryside

81
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,800
already have a few children.

82
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,960
Also, we have a respectable person,

83
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,440
Mr. Saruj of the Jutathep Palace,

84
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,800
as a witness. Right, guys?

85
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,160
- Yes!
- Yes!

86
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,600
Nop, they're handing you
an opportunity on a silver platter.

87
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,280
Don't turn it down. Just take it.

88
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,600
- Yes.
- Take it.

89
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,640
Nop, just put your class ring

90
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,000
on her right now.

91
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,680
- Yes.
- Take it off.

92
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,760
- That's it.
- Take it off.

93
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,200
Put the ring on her.

94
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,560
But that ring is just a hors d'oeuvre.

95
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,080
When we go home,

96
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,720
I'll give you a shrimp pond
as an engagement gift.

97
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,360
My gosh.

98
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,720
I think it's too much.

99
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,960
Not at all. This is just
an engagement gift.

100
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,040
Once they get married,

101
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,440
I'll give you 40 acres
of rubber plantation.

102
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,760
I may look like this…

103
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,320
Mr. Saruj, I may look like this,

104
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,520
just like a piece of coal,

105
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,480
but I'm actually a piece of gold.

106
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,560
It's true. Mr. Pana owns a lot of land.

107
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,280
You'll have a comfortable life, Cheewan.

108
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,440
Go for it.

109
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,520
- Put it on her!
- Put it on her!

110
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,360
- Put it on her!
- Put it on her!

111
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,240
Hold on.

112
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,960
I plan to continue my studies,

113
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,240
travel the world,

114
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,720
and do many other things.

115
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,480
That's right, Cheewan.
Women want to live their own lives.

116
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,360
Fall in love? Get married? Have babies?

117
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,400
Don't get married, Cheewan.

118
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,799
It's just an engagement.

119
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,400
You don't have to get married now.

120
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,919
- Right, Pana?
- Yes.

121
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,559
- Yes, you just get engaged first.
- That's right.

122
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,000
- Make it official.
- Yes.

123
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,880
Otherwise, you'll have guys all over you
like a swarm of ants.

124
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,320
You should get engaged first.
Now, put the ring on her.

125
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,720
- Hey, guys. Take a picture
- Yes?

126
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,000
and make a fabric poster

127
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,240
with the word "engaged"
to post in front of the house tomorrow.

128
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,960
And you two can get married
after Nop has graduated.

129
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,760
- I agree.
- Hold on.

130
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,840
He can't get his ring off.

131
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,480
Take it off.

132
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,560
- Take it off.
- Help me, Jon.

133
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,640
- Sure, I'll help you.
- Take it off.

134
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,480
I'll help you take it off,
but I don't know about the engagement.

135
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,560
Sure.

136
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,680
Dad.

137
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,600
- It's very tight.
- Actually,

138
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,520
the ring is probably too big for her.

139
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,240
Nop, stop right there.

140
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,760
If you carry on with this,

141
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,120
I'll smack you round the head.
Do you want that?

142
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,560
No, I don't, Cheewan.

143
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,120
Gosh.

144
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,000
What?

145
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,680
- It's rolling away.
- Where did it go?

146
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,920
- Where did it go?
- Where's my ring?

147
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,440
What?

148
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,000
So are you going
to get engaged to her, Nop?

149
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,920
If you don't,

150
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,400
I'll cut you out of my will.

151
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,160
Do it now.

152
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,320
Yes, I'm getting engaged to her.

153
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,760
Let me look for the ring first.

154
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,600
Help him look for it. It went that way.

155
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,360
Don't look for it, Nop.

156
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,600
- Nop.
- Over there.

157
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,480
Whose feet are these? They're so wrinkly.

158
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,440
Why don't you look up?

159
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,400
They're my feet.

160
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,480
Do you have a problem with them?

161
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,960
I'm sorry, Madam.

162
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,800
I'm sorry.

163
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,080
Hey, Nop. Where's the ring?

164
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,560
- Look for it.
- Right. I'm sorry, Madam.

165
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,160
- Look for it.
- Nop, don't look for it.

166
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,120
Don't look for it.

167
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,120
I won't.

168
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,960
Nop, I'm your dad.

169
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,720
- Okay, I'll look for it. Excuse me.
- Yes.

170
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,040
- See where it is.
- It's over there.

171
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,080
- Is it there?
- Found it.

172
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,000
That's great.

173
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,480
They're finally getting engaged.

174
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,080
They're getting tied.

175
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,280
This boy is naive, silly,

176
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,160
stupid, but rich.

177
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,520
He's also obedient and handsome.

178
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,880
Cheewan.

179
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,760
Trust me.

180
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,800
This kind of man makes the best husband.

181
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,600
- Madam Orn.
- That's the truth.

182
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,520
No, Madam Orn.

183
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,040
I'm not getting married.

184
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,720
You've always listened to Madam Orn
in the past.

185
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,240
You should listen to her
as she's more experienced than you.

186
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,560
Hey, I could hear you from my house.

187
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,400
I heard everything.

188
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,360
And you're also rather silly.

189
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,680
Thank you.

190
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,240
I don't think you'll live that long.

191
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,480
Thank you.

192
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,600
Are you cursing me or complimenting me?

193
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:49,120
- What do you mean?
- You'll make a nice in-law.

194
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,200
- That's right, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

195
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,640
Cheewan.

196
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,960
You'll have such a happy future.

197
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,440
Even though this isn't
an engagement ceremony,

198
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,520
the two elders here,

199
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,880
Madam Orn and Mr. Saruj,

200
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,440
have acknowledged this and agreed
to let you two be together.

201
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,640
Gosh, this is going too far.

202
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,000
Go and pay respect to Madam Orn now.

203
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,040
Nop, pay respect to her.

204
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,880
Sit down, Cheewan.

205
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,760
Pay respect to me. That's it.

206
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,800
Here is my blessing for you.

207
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,880
Listen, I hope you graduate soon

208
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,600
and your love blooms,

209
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,480
so you two can be husband and wife.

210
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,520
All right, now pay respect to Mr. Saruj.

211
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,200
Mr. Saruj, please give them your blessing.

212
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,200
Go ahead, dear.

213
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,000
I wish you every success in your studies.

214
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,280
Please also bless their relationship.

215
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,720
That's right.

216
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,800
I wish you happiness.

217
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,400
Why do you sound so weak?

218
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,800
Come here, Poncheewa.

219
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,880
You're like Cheewan's older sister.
Can you give her a blessing?

220
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,160
I wish you

221
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,360
a serious, strong, and enduring love.

222
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,320
We came to this point
because you're a good person, Nop.

223
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,840
Maintain your goodness

224
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,400
and finish your studies soon,

225
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,480
so you two can start your married life,

226
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,840
and I'll be free of worries.

227
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,320
Nop.

228
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,440
Congratulations, Nop. Study hard.

229
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,040
The ring is big.
I don't think it'll fit her.

230
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,280
Gosh, why are you so worried
about it being too big?

231
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,680
How about you attach it
to something bigger?

232
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,720
What is it?

233
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,320
- Here it is.
- Gosh.

234
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,280
- Damn.
- My goodness.

235
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,600
Here you go.

236
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,920
Your hands are shaking.

237
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,080
Don't shake.

238
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,680
My gosh.

239
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,120
I'm so pleased.

240
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,200
I'm very happy.

241
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,680
It'd be great
if it were a little bigger than this.

242
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,720
Nice.

243
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,400
I have many.

244
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,160
- That's it.
- Very nice.

245
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,960
Congratulations, dear.

246
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,520
- This one.
- Hey, smile.

247
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,640
This ring…

248
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,040
represents my feelings for you.

249
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,280
They're so sweet.

250
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,960
I feel like swooning.

251
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,720
- I'm all teary now.
- You're pleased.

252
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,440
Mom, what's wrong with you today?

253
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,920
Why did you do that?

254
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,360
I love you

255
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,240
and I'm worried about Mr. Saruj.

256
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,320
I care about everyone.

257
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,640
I don't think of Nop that way.

258
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,280
Marriage isn't the only thing in life.

259
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,960
You're acting like Lady Veena.

260
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,440
You can't decide who I marry.

261
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,720
I won't marry him.

262
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,520
Don't take the necklace off, Cheewan.

263
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,720
Mom.

264
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,640
Pana adores that necklace.

265
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,360
It's the first gold necklace he bought
with money he earned.

266
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,680
By giving you that necklace,

267
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,960
he's saying he loves you like a daughter.

268
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,560
Don't offend him, Cheewan.

269
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,200
I beg you.

270
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,000
I'll talk to him myself.

271
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,800
What about Nop?

272
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,599
Nop will graduate in a year.

273
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,200
Can't you stay and give him moral support?

274
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,600
So when he graduates,

275
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,800
I can break up with him
and give this necklace back to him, right?

276
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,640
Yes,

277
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,520
if you don't love him.

278
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,800
I won't love him. I can't even imagine it.

279
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,120
Just a year, all right, Mom?

280
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,920
Just a year.

281
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,760
Thank you, Mr. Saruj, for not standing
in the way of Nop and Cheewan.

282
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,920
It's okay.

283
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,120
Cheewan respects you very much.

284
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,720
She listens to those
she loves and respects.

285
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,200
If you had objected,

286
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,280
Cheewan would have been shaken
and confused.

287
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,840
She's a smart girl.
I don't think she would.

288
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,800
I was once betrothed to M.R. Pavornruj.

289
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,560
If he hadn't met Princess Rasa

290
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,240
and had married me instead,

291
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,040
it would have been hell for me

292
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,440
because I would have married
above my station.

293
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,640
Right.

294
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,440
My parents were made for each other.

295
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,080
You're just like your dad.

296
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,840
It might not be now,

297
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,200
but you'll surely meet someone
suitable for you.

298
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,480
This is what I believe.

299
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,280
That's why I had to get
between you and Cheewan.

300
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,640
Mrs. Kratin.

301
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,080
Marriage is about suitability,

302
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,880
not emotions.

303
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,280
This is what I believe.

304
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,880
I see.

305
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,760
If you don't like what I'm doing,

306
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,120
please just trust me.

307
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,720
This is how I show my love to you.

308
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,400
If you and Cheewan get together

309
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,360
and break up later,

310
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,640
both our families will get hurt
because of it.

311
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,440
I can't let it happen.

312
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,120
I understand.

313
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,440
Cheewan.

314
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,960
Nop.

315
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,400
What was that all about last night?

316
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,720
Cheewan, I really do want to marry you.

317
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,720
You know I've never felt that way.

318
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,920
I only think of you as my brother.

319
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,600
I want to be your lover
and someone important to you.

320
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,440
Please give me a chance.

321
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,000
- I don't want--
- Listen to me first.

322
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,400
If your heart is not taken,

323
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,320
please give me a chance

324
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,120
to prove…

325
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,400
that I really love you.

326
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,280
Please open your heart for me.

327
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,760
What are you doing?

328
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,520
What are you doing to Cheewan?

329
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,080
I'm just holding her hand.

330
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,760
You two are still in college.

331
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,760
You won't get married soon.

332
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,400
You have almost a year to go.

333
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,480
Hey, Cheewa.

334
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,040
Calm down.

335
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,960
Get this straight.

336
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,080
If you really love her,
you can wait for her.

337
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,200
That's called true love.

338
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,320
I don't want anything from her yet.

339
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,040
I'm too scared to do anything now.

340
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,880
You must not give in
to him easily, Cheewan.

341
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,080
Hey, look at this.

342
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,080
- Take this.
- Gosh.

343
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,000
Why did you hit my head?

344
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,560
See? Lovers don't treat
each other like this, do they?

345
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,600
This is how we really are.

346
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,600
Don't worry, Cheewa.

347
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,320
He always gives in to me.

348
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,360
If he takes advantage of me,

349
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,760
I'll definitely kick him.

350
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,160
No one can bully me.

351
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,200
Come here. Give me a hug.

352
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,000
I've never seen you play
a musical instrument.

353
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,560
What are you thinking?

354
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,440
I can't stop my feelings

355
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,680
For you…

356
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,000
How can I stop my feelings

357
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,360
For you?

358
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,880
I might have to stop breathing

359
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,520
Stop my breath

360
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,520
Before I can stop loving you

361
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,840
That's a sad song.

362
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,760
Is anything wrong?

363
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,440
It's just the mood of the song.

364
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,040
The look in your eyes
and the way you're behaving

365
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,400
are just like the other day
when we had a fight.

366
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,680
You're the woman
who is making me, M.L. Saruj Jutathep,

367
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,080
who has always been superior,
feel so inferior.

368
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,560
I'm inferior to a kid
who hasn't graduated.

369
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,240
Inferior to everyone.

370
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,280
I'm sleepy.

371
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,760
I'm going to bed.

372
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,320
Hold on.

373
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,480
You have your love song.

374
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,480
Do you want to listen
to my kind of love song?

375
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,880
Are you going to sing a song?

376
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,120
What song?

377
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,640
It's pretty deep, like yours.

378
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:27,720
There's an insect on the rabbit's nose

379
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,800
There's an insect on the rabbit's nose

380
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,160
So it chases the insect away

381
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,400
So it chases the insect away

382
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,560
The insect flies away…

383
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:46,520
There's an insect on the rabbit's nose

384
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,120
I'll let you fly away,

385
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,440
as all I want is for you to be happy.

386
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,040
That would be enough to make me happy.

387
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,760
Today is your birthday,

388
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,160
so I asked someone to pick you up.

389
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,120
We're throwing a party
for you this evening.

390
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,800
Vit and Ploy will join us in the evening.

391
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,800
But I'm not staying over tonight.

392
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,760
Once we've finished dinner,

393
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,720
I'll go back to Madam Orn's house.

394
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,320
I'm going to study with Cheewan.

395
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,440
Okay.

396
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,520
Happy birthday, dear.

397
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,400
Thank you, Mom.

398
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,000
All my pants are getting tight.

399
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,680
I'll have to get some bigger ones.

400
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,520
Cheewan, pass me the bag
that's in the top drawer.

401
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,520
Sure.

402
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,960
Thank you.

403
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,360
The photo of us Thai students
on our first day in Switzerland.

404
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,160
I miss those days.

405
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,320
Who is likely to be the child's dad?

406
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,840
Well…

407
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,720
I'll cross Dalad off.

408
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,800
They rarely talked to each other.

409
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,280
Simon.

410
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,640
Cheewa said it's not him.

411
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,360
Well…

412
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,040
It must be Nat.

413
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,960
Cheewa, has Nat contacted you at all?

414
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,520
He paged me a few times.

415
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,200
Nat was after you
since the very beginning.

416
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,440
How's your relationship with him now?

417
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:54,080
Gosh, why is she so tight-lipped?

418
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,800
I'm so clueless.

419
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,040
I don't know if Nat is the baby's dad.

420
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,080
Hello.

421
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,520
Nat? It's me, Cheewan.

422
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,960
Cheewan?

423
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,320
Is Poncheewa there?

424
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,000
Yes.

425
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,400
Do you want to visit her?

426
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,560
Yes, right.

427
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,160
I know you won't let me see her

428
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,800
if I go there.

429
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,720
I'll let you see her this time,

430
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,280
but you have to come
to her parents' house.

431
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,800
Today is her birthday.

432
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,840
Do you dare come see her?

433
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,440
Well…

434
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,680
She's at her parents' house?

435
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,840
Why?

436
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,720
Are you unsure?

437
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,880
You did something bad, didn't you?

438
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,040
No.

439
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,440
I'll go.

440
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,080
See you soon.

441
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,880
What?

442
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,800
He's actually coming.

443
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,920
These are for you.

444
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,280
Happy birthday.

445
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,160
If they have that kind of relationship,
it'll definitely show.

446
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,800
Poncheewa must be angry at Nat.

447
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,320
Slap him.

448
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,400
How did you know?

449
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,440
Cheewan told me.

450
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,960
Cheewan?

451
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,240
Yes.

452
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,400
Thank you.

453
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,840
What?

454
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,800
Isn't she mad at him?

455
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,120
Not even a little?

456
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,920
You look very pretty today.

457
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,400
You're so pretty that I'm speechless.

458
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,600
So have you eaten?

459
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,160
Not yet.

460
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,480
Do you want to stay for dinner with us?

461
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,200
Sure.

462
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,880
Let's go.

463
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,680
What?

464
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,440
She invited him to stay for dinner?

465
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,240
How is it going, Nat?

466
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,760
Is your dad doing well?

467
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,840
Yes, sir. He's doing well.

468
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,120
Cheewa.

469
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,239
Is Nat the child's dad?

470
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,920
I'm so happy

471
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,520
that all of you are here
to have dinner with Cheewa tonight.

472
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,880
It's fun.

473
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,520
The food is great.

474
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,360
Eat up.

475
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,440
Thank you.

476
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,320
By the way, I just built an extra room
at my house.

477
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,600
If you think this house is too far
from your campus,

478
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,360
you can stay at my house.

479
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,679
That's right.

480
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,960
Don't bother Madam Orn for too long.

481
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,760
You can come stay with us.

482
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,280
Poncheewa wants to stay and help me out.

483
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,720
We don't just stay there and do nothing.

484
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,640
We help each other take care of Madam Orn,

485
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,320
including preparing her food and medicine,

486
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,560
because Jaew is getting old.

487
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,440
I'll be right back.

488
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,200
Whatever you do,

489
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,560
you have to move out
by the end of the month.

490
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,360
You don't have to stay over tonight,

491
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,600
but I insist

492
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,080
you must come home
at the end of this month.

493
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,960
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

494
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,400
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

495
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:55,720
- Happy birthday, happy birthday
- Happy birthday, happy birthday

496
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:03,200
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

497
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,400
Make a wish, dear.

498
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,160
Thank you, everyone.

499
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,280
Happy birthday.

500
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,920
I wish you a lot of happiness, dear.

501
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,280
Thank you, Mom.

502
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,640
If you love Poncheewa

503
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,600
and care for her, why did you do
such a thoughtless thing?

504
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,960
What?

505
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,240
If you're a man, you'd be brave enough
to admit what you have done.

506
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,640
What are you saying?

507
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,520
I know what happened to Poncheewa now.

508
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,280
You forced yourself on her, didn't you?

509
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,760
Me?

510
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,120
When did I do that?

511
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,240
You can still fix your mistake.

512
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,960
I'll help you.

513
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,360
Tell me what happened.

514
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,520
Tell me.

515
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,680
What do you want me to tell you?

516
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,760
What's going on between you and Poncheewa?

517
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,040
What do you mean?

518
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,920
It's as you see.

519
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,240
Poncheewa is so unyielding.

520
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,960
I'm getting bored of her now.

521
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,320
But since you came back to Thailand,

522
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,320
you have become prettier.

523
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,040
Maybe…

524
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,800
Should I go after you instead?

525
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,760
Don't try to be funny.

526
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,360
Tell me.

527
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,560
Something happened in Switzerland,

528
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,720
between you and Poncheewa, didn't it?

529
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,640
Nothing happened.

530
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,000
What's wrong with you today?

531
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,640
You're talking nonsense.

532
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,680
Nat didn't seem to be lying.

533
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,600
Could it be that Cheewa lied?

534
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,880
The child's dad might be Simon.

535
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,120
Simon.

536
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,040
Hey, Simon.

537
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,960
How are you? I miss you.

538
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,400
Do you want to visit Thailand?

539
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,480
I'll look after you.

540
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,120
Mr. Saruj is staying at a hotel
close to his ministry.

541
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,880
He didn't say when he'll return home.

542
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,440
Is he busy?

543
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,320
Why is a minister's secretary so busy?

544
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,880
Venus.

545
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,040
By the way, Jon,

546
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,000
it has been many weeks now.

547
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,280
Why has Mr. Saruj been away for so long?

548
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,560
Do you know which hotel he's at?

549
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,880
I don't, ma'am.

550
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,120
You're so useless.

551
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,240
- I'll find out.
- Okay.

552
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,600
Ms. Cheewan, what did you cook today?

553
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,200
It's for you.

554
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,120
Thank you so much.

555
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,600
Is that all the food you have?

556
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,120
You can have this.

557
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,800
Gosh, you're so kind.

558
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,400
Isn't that royal cuisine?

559
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,760
- We'll enjoy it. Thank you, miss.
- No worries.

560
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,800
We've got something nice to eat now.

561
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,200
- Open it.
- Okay.

562
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,520
Thank you. Do you want to join us?

563
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,440
But it's a little dirty here.
Just a second.

564
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,600
It's fine. I can sit.

565
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,880
I'm already satisfied
with you handsome and masculine men here

566
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,600
for me to look at.

567
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,640
- Give her a spoon.
- Hey, Cheewan.

568
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,720
Sit here. Join us for the meal.

569
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,720
- Here is your plate.
- Goodness.

570
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,280
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

571
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,760
- It looks so good.
- It looks yummy.

572
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,960
- Let's get some rice.
- Have some fish.

573
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,120
Venus!

574
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,680
What are you doing there?

575
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,880
I'm eating, Mom.

576
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,600
Gosh, why do you insist
on mixing with such vulgar people?

577
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,400
Come here. Get up now.

578
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,240
Listen, I know which hotel
Mr. Saruj is at now.

579
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,760
Do I have to go there?

580
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,680
They're hosting a dinner party
for ambassadors.

581
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,520
Let's go home so you can get dressed up.

582
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,200
But it's boring, Mom.

583
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,480
But they have caviar, your favorite.
Aren't you interested?

584
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,680
- Caviar? My gosh.
- Yes.

585
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,640
Cheewan, have you ever had caviar?
Do you want to come with me?

586
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,920
- Sure.
- Do you want to come with us, Nop?

587
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,520
Listen, you need to wear formal attire.

588
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,880
Do you think they have any?

589
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,080
You can borrow one of mine.
I have so many.

590
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,520
You're going there to get a man.

591
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,520
Why are you inviting her along?

592
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,440
What if she looks prettier than you?

593
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,680
There are only old people
at those parties.

594
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,400
I'll do whatever you tell me to do,

595
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,760
so can't you let me bring
a few friends with me?

596
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,400
Okay, fine.

597
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,360
Tell Cheewan to get ready.

598
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,200
You don't need to lend her a dress,
I'll prepare something for her.

599
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,240
Yes.

600
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,120
Cheewan, my mom will find
something for you to wear.

601
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,760
- Thank you.
- You too, Nop.

602
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,000
You'll get to eat caviar. It's so good.

603
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:34,080
Gosh, you look so handsome.
Did my mom get that suit for you?

604
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,080
Yes. Listen, Venus,

605
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,080
I didn't know your mom hated me so much.

606
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,000
By the way, Venus.

607
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,880
Is this event organized
by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs?

608
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:56,920
Yes.

609
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,680
That's my mom, my dad, Mr. Saruj,

610
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,280
and Minister Danai.

611
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,560
He's always handsome.

612
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,160
I miss him so much.

613
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,320
Is Nop not coming?

614
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,840
He's caught up with work
but should be here soon.

615
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,920
I see. Okay.

616
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,240
Well then, let's have some caviar.

617
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,360
There it is.

618
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,840
Gosh, so these are the fish eggs
that cost over 10,000 per kg?

619
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,760
This is how you eat it.

620
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,320
Put a bit of this on.

621
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,160
You eat a little at a time.

622
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,640
I see. You eat it like
a good person with manners.

623
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,040
But I'm not.
I'm an evil person with no manners.

624
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,200
Venus.

625
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,760
Hey, Venus.

626
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,560
Let's go and sit over there.

627
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,440
Just leave it there.
Let's get some spoons.

628
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,680
Let's go.

629
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,240
It's good.

630
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,600
Hey, Venus. You sit here.

631
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,920
I'll go get some water for you.

632
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,520
Okay.

633
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,920
This is your job.

634
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,360
Ms. Venus will go upstairs

635
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,040
and will stay there
with Mr. Saruj for a while.

636
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,760
Your job is to take photos
of Venus and Mr. Saruj.

637
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:11,240
Get shots of them close together.

638
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,320
Make some copies of them for me

639
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,160
and send one to Madam Orn
at Jutathep Palace.

640
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,960
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

641
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,040
Good.

642
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,640
I'll get going.

643
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,640
This is obviously blackmail.

644
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,080
Venus, what does your mom
want you to do today?

645
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,880
Well, she said Mr. Saruj has a room here,

646
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,360
so she asked me to pretend to be drunk

647
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,520
and get Mr. Saruj to take me to his room.

648
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,680
That's all she told me.

649
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:56,720
Don't get your hopes up.
So long as I'm here, that will never work.

650
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,720
Where is Mr. Saruj?

651
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,600
Come with me.
I have something for you to do.

652
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,400
- Ya, I brought someone to help you out.
- Yes?

653
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,160
- Look at how well-dressed she is.
- Good.

654
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,720
Please help me. You only have

655
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,200
to give souvenirs to the guests.

656
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:46,880
- Right.
- All right.

657
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,680
Now, sit down.

658
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,440
Enjoy your work.

659
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:05,520
You can execute our plan now.

660
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,120
Okay.

661
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,360
- I'm not drunk.
- Hold on.

662
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,800
Come back here.

663
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,080
Act like a drunk heroine,

664
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,880
not a drunk villain.

665
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,960
I see. A heroine.

666
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,240
Okay.

667
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:30,800
Gosh, my head hurts.

668
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,720
Saruj.

669
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,080
Are you okay, Venus?

670
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,600
I'm drunk.
I think I drank a little too much.

671
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:08,560
Let me take you
to Mr. Narong and Mrs. Veena.

672
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,440
Where did they go?

673
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,360
You have a room here, right?

674
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,800
Can I go upstairs and take a rest?

675
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,720
Gosh.

676
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,760
What's wrong?

677
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,200
My stomach hurts.

678
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,880
Your stomach hurts?

679
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,040
I thought you had a headache?

680
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:47,680
Although I'm stupid, I can differentiate
between my head and my stomach.

681
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,600
I don't think I can make it to your room.

682
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,400
Let me go to the restroom here.

683
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,800
Hold on.

684
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,400
This is the keycard to my room.
You can go on up.

685
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,480
Okay, I'll see you later.

686
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,400
Mr. Saruj.

687
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,320
Mr. Saruj.

688
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,880
Cheewan, what are you doing here?

689
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,480
Well,

690
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,320
I came with Venus.

691
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,880
Mr. Saruj,

692
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,960
Lady Veena is planning to blackmail you.

693
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,480
Fake drunk, right?

694
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,360
I'm being careful.

695
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,880
Actually, I'm done with work.

696
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,200
I want to go to my room,

697
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,160
but I think that

698
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,200
I should leave Venus there on her own.

699
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,920
I see.

700
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,520
You're so smart.

701
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,440
So have you been busy recently?

702
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,920
Why are you staying at a hotel?

703
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,080
Venus, where is Cheewan?

704
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,040
She…

705
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:49,920
What's wrong?

706
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,880
- I have an upset stomach.
- I see.

707
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,360
Are you okay?

708
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,320
It's the caviar.

709
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,160
- My gosh, I can't hold it.
- You go ahead.

710
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,240
- It's coming. Excuse me.
- Okay.

711
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,840
Watch your step.

712
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,000
No, it wasn't me.

713
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:18,640
You must have so much work
that you have to stay at this hotel.

714
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,320
Is there anything I can do to help you?

715
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,000
I don't have that much work.

716
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,120
I'm staying here because…

717
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,560
And how have you been?

718
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,000
Has Mrs. Kratin gone home?

719
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,960
Yes.

720
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,560
My dad called and told her to return.

721
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,120
She must be very happy.

722
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,000
Nop is a good person.

723
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,560
He's also smart.

724
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,960
He's still young, but he's already
helping his dad with their company.

725
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,160
Yes.

726
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,120
He's really smart.

727
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,120
So what's your plan for your married life?

728
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,520
- I'm going to run away.
- What?

729
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
My gosh.

730
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,920
What's wrong, Cheewan?

731
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,280
My stomach hurts.

732
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,080
I feel like

733
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,040
throwing up.

734
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,880
What did you eat?

735
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,880
I ate the caviar
that cost over 10,000 per kg.

736
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:28,360
How about you get some rest in my room?

737
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:32,040
Isn't Venus in your room?

738
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:35,880
I don't think people will say anything
if there are three of us there.

739
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,000
Let's go.

740
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:40,760
Come on.

741
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:42,440
Let me help you.

742
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,040
Are you okay?

743
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,280
- Okay. Sure.
- Please excuse me for a second.

744
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:08,600
They have both disappeared.

745
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,840
Both Mr. Saruj and my dear Venus.

746
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,800
Can you make it?

747
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,560
Yes.

748
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,160
We're almost there. Hang in there.

749
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,040
I'm okay.

750
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,760
What?

751
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,440
Where is Venus?

752
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:00,880
Here.

753
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,240
Sit here first.

754
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,760
I can't hold it anymore.

755
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,760
The smell is so strong.

756
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,840
I can't take this.
Let's go to the second floor.

757
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,800
Gosh.

758
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:49,960
Venus.

759
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,320
Venus.

760
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,000
Venus.

761
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,400
Venus.

762
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,760
Gosh.

763
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,440
Venus.

764
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,760
I thought there was a shooting here.

765
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,000
It's…

766
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,480
It's not just a shooting.

767
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,360
It's war.

768
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,160
I'm dying.

769
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,040
I'm about to die in this war.

770
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,280
I feel bad.

771
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,840
It came out on both ends.

772
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,360
It stinks.

773
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,000
Please don't go inside yet.

774
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,880
I'm afraid you'll suffocate.

775
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,720
Here. Have some water.

776
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,760
Mr. Saruj.

777
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,520
I stink. I should go outside.

778
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,200
Let me wipe your face for you.

779
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,560
It's okay. I can do it myself.

780
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,320
- Just put it down.
- Let me do it.

781
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,440
This is bad. There's someone over there.

782
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,440
What's with you?

783
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,440
Don't turn that way.

784
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,040
The person over there

785
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,880
might be a photographer.

786
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,560
She has a camera.

787
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,520
Over there.

788
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,560
You're right.

789
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:20,920
Cover your face.

790
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,200
Cover it
and let's walk back inside slowly.

791
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,160
I'm good.

792
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,600
Gosh.

793
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,760
Your foot is so big.

794
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,800
You stepped on my foot.

795
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,520
I'm sorry.

796
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:54,920
Blood.

797
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:00,800
My teeth.

798
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,880
I'm sorry.

799
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,760
I just threw up too.

800
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:11,240
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

801
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:13,720
Please don't be mad at me.

802
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,120
You're smiling.

803
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,000
Why are you smiling?

804
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:25,080
Isn't it smelly?

805
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,640
I think my guts are rotten.

806
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:31,840
They're churning.

807
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,880
- I'll go home now.
- Hold on.

808
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,000
Are you okay now?

809
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,200
What if you can't hold it
on your way back?

810
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,400
Well, I'll just find a place
to puke and poop on the way.

811
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:50,920
There's someone there.

812
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,040
Could it be the photographer?

813
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:56,040
- Is it the photographer?
- Hold on.

814
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:58,400
What if you open the door
and she sees you?

815
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,440
Just stay here. Don't go anywhere.

816
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:02,920
Take a rest first.

817
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,400
Sure.

818
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,000
I feel dizzy right now.

819
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,680
Come here.

820
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:19,840
Lie down over here
so you'll feel more comfortable.

821
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:22,960
It's okay.

822
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:27,240
You must be tired from work.
You should get some rest.

823
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:30,800
I'm small. I can take the sofa.

824
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:13,640
Nop, you're still here.

825
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,320
Yes.

826
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,280
I was worried about you.
I couldn't hear you from outside.

827
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:21,080
I was afraid you'd pass out
and nobody would know.

828
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:25,080
But I could hear you from here
when you pushed,

829
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,600
so I knew you were fine.

830
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:32,360
You're not just handsome,

831
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:34,840
but you also have a good heart.

832
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:41,360
I think you should go see a doctor.

833
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,080
It must be food poisoning.

834
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:48,160
My parents and Mr. Saruj.

835
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,760
I haven't done the task
my mom assigned me.

836
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:57,040
I think you should call her
after you get to the hospital.

837
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,000
- Let's go.
- Okay.

838
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,360
- Let's go.
- Fine.

839
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:05,880
This way.

840
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,560
You're at the hospital because you got
food poisoning from eating caviar?

841
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:13,880
Yes, my stomach hurts a lot.

842
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,440
I felt dizzy too.

843
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:18,480
I don't have any energy.

844
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,240
Didn't you go see Mr. Saruj?

845
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:24,360
So the thousands of baht I spent
on a photographer was for nothing then.

846
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,720
I was throwing up

847
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,280
and pooping for an hour.

848
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:31,640
I couldn't go see anyone.

849
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:34,280
I'm dying, Mom.

850
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:36,720
Gosh, you stupid child.

851
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:40,400
You can't even do such an easy job.

852
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,560
I can't believe you're my child.

853
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,640
You stupid child.

854
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,920
My mom gave me an earful.

855
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:04,560
She didn't even ask me how I was.

856
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I didn't mean it.

857
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,120
I think they're right.

858
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,800
I'm stupid.

859
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:17,480
I'm stupid.

860
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:20,240
I'm stupid

861
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:23,240
just like people say.

862
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,840
Right, Nop?

863
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,600
No.

864
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:36,840
She's probably just angry.

865
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,280
She'll be fine soon.

866
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,440
All right?

867
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,920
It's okay.

868
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,440
Stop crying.

869
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:05,200
It's okay.

870
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:01,560
What time is it?

871
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:03,480
So…

872
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,400
didn't Venus come here?

873
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,520
It's okay.

874
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:21,320
I'll just move to another room
or a different hotel tomorrow.

875
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,280
I wonder

876
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:27,280
if Nop is here as well.

877
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,840
How about we text him
and tell him to come here?

878
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:36,200
That way, he can pick me up
and it won't look bad.

879
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:39,440
I can't remember Nop's number.

880
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,000
Can you?

881
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,040
I can't remember it either.

882
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:47,240
But if you drop me at home,

883
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:49,920
someone might be waiting there
to take pictures.

884
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,200
Then stay here.

885
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:55,880
Let's think about it in the morning.

886
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,600
Sure.

887
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,440
Cheewan.

888
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:07,360
Has Mrs. Kratin ever talked to you
about my dad?

889
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,440
Yes.

890
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:14,000
She said

891
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:17,080
Princess Rasa was suited
to being the wife of an ambassador.

892
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:20,360
But she wasn't suitable at all.

893
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:23,080
She didn't like to stay in the palace

894
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:25,560
and didn't want
to be part of the Jutathep family.

895
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:29,160
What about you?

896
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:30,600
Me?

897
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:32,960
What about me?

898
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,680
If you were in your mom's position,

899
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,280
what would you do?

900
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:53,360
I would

901
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,240
do what my mom did.

902
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:01,240
My English is terrible.

903
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:02,840
I'd have to live abroad.

904
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:04,800
I'd have to attend social events.

905
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:09,640
I wouldn't know which spoon
to use at the dinner table.

906
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:12,720
I'd also have to represent the country.

907
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,359
How could I do that with my manners?

908
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:23,600
M.R. Pavornruj and my mom
are too different.

909
01:09:35,319 --> 01:09:37,720
Please help me.

910
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:40,319
Poncheewa ran away to Pattaya with Simon.

911
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:41,880
Simon, flip it now.

912
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,040
Simon.

913
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:47,120
Don't say that we kissed.

914
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,880
Our mouths just bumped into each other.

915
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,319
I've never kissed anyone.

916
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:54,080
I can tell who it is at a glance.

917
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:55,360
This is a hotel.

918
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,480
You might be forced into marriage.

919
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:58,840
I don't want that.

920
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:01,040
I won't get married no matter what.

921
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,000
I won't get married to anyone.

922
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:05,920
I don't want to be responsible
for the royal duties.

923
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,040
Can't you do it for me

924
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,120
and for us?

925
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:45,960
