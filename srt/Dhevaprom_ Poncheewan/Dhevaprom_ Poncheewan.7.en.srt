1
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,880
There's an insect on the rabbit's nose

2
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,320
So it chases the insect away

3
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,400
The insect then flies away…

4
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,880
Tell me what happened in Switzerland

5
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,320
between you and Poncheewa?

6
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,640
You can execute our plan now.

7
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,680
Okay.

8
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,240
Your job is to take photos
of Ms. Venus and Mr. Saruj.

9
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,880
This is bad. There's someone over there.

10
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,720
If you were in your mom's position,
what would you do?

11
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,880
M.R. Pavornruj and my mom
are too different.

12
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,760
Cheewa, are you going out somewhere?

13
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,000
Yes. I'm going to a pharmacy.

14
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,960
Are you going to buy medicine
for morning sickness?

15
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,880
Yes.

16
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,240
I'll come with you.

17
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,600
Cheewan.

18
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,600
There's a crispy pancake shop over there.

19
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,160
I want some. Can you buy some for me?

20
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,920
Sure, I'll see you in a bit.

21
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,600
- Okay.
- By the way, Cheewa,

22
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,279
don't forget to ask the pharmacist

23
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,839
whether they also have
supplements for pregnant women.

24
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,920
Make sure you get both.

25
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,240
- I will.
- Okay. See you.

26
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,200
Please pull over up ahead.

27
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,040
In front of the door.

28
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,680
Thank you.

29
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,200
Where have you two been?

30
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,760
Cheewa!

31
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,920
Just now…

32
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,200
Are you all right, Poom?

33
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,960
I'm feeling dizzy.

34
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,840
Mr. Poom!

35
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,080
Are you okay?

36
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,040
Everything suddenly went dark.

37
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,520
How are you feeling now?

38
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,760
I'm okay now.

39
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,560
I think it's gone now.

40
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,240
How are you feeling now?

41
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,280
I don't feel dizzy or nauseous.

42
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,280
I'm all good.

43
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,000
Have you been sleeping enough?

44
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,360
Have you fainted before?

45
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,440
I've been sleeping normally
and I've never fainted.

46
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,760
I just had a checkup
and I'm as healthy as usual.

47
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,000
But…

48
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,240
when I touched Poncheewa just now…

49
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,560
That's strange.

50
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,640
You should observe yourself for a while.

51
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,760
I'm sorry.

52
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,040
Please excuse me.

53
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,360
Cheewan, let's go.

54
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,120
Excuse me.

55
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,200
When it comes to fainting,

56
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,080
this herbal drink is the best for you.

57
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,480
Here you go.

58
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,240
Thai herbs are good.

59
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,520
Just drink it.

60
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,440
Help me, Poom. Please help me.

61
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,800
It's come back.

62
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,080
Are you feeling dizzy again?

63
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,440
No, it's not that.

64
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,720
It's a voice in my head.

65
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,000
Why don't you lie down?

66
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,360
Please lie down.

67
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,840
No, it wasn't like before.

68
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,560
Don't worry. I'm fine.

69
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,960
What?

70
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,280
Poncheewa.

71
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,800
Poncheewa.

72
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,760
Poncheewa, are you in there?

73
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,240
I'm coming in.

74
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,240
I'm in the bathroom.

75
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,840
Are you okay?

76
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,320
Yes. Just a second.

77
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,760
- Yes?
- Are you okay?

78
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,720
I heard your voice in my head again.

79
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,720
Again?

80
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,680
I'm all right. I'm totally fine.

81
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,800
If you're fine, then I'm relieved.

82
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,520
And are you still feeling dizzy?

83
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,160
Not anymore.

84
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,120
But I think…

85
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,680
that I might have to see a psychiatrist.

86
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,320
What should I do?

87
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,040
What are you doing?

88
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,560
Hey, Saruj.

89
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,760
Our wedding is in three months,

90
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,320
so we're making a guest list.

91
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,120
You seem stressed, Kwan.

92
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,400
Aren't you happy about being a bride?

93
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,200
I'm worried about one thing.

94
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,440
It's moving in with him.

95
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,920
Chat.

96
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,160
Can you stop laughing at my girlfriend?

97
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,000
This is what it's like
to have a young girlfriend.

98
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,960
Don't you also like someone younger?

99
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,440
Do you have a girlfriend?

100
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,560
I wanted to talk to you about that.

101
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,680
If a woman is still young,

102
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,400
and she values her freedom so much

103
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,240
that she doesn't want a boyfriend,

104
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,480
do I have a hope with her?

105
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,200
Of course.

106
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,800
I was also like this before.

107
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,880
But Chat was very kind.

108
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,560
He told me

109
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,960
that if I wanted to study
or do something else,

110
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,760
I was free to do so.

111
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,720
As long as you understand each other,

112
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,640
things will work out between you two.

113
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,520
I love you, Chat.

114
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,320
Isn't my girlfriend cute?

115
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,280
But what if her mom doesn't like me?

116
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,000
This was also
a big problem for you, right?

117
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,240
Yes.

118
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,920
Some people break up
to save the woman trouble.

119
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,120
But I didn't.

120
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,080
Saruj,

121
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,960
if you're not willing to fight
and persevere for your love,

122
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,720
what's the point?

123
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,760
Is it really true love?

124
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,360
Am I right?

125
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,680
So what made you fight

126
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,640
and persevere like you did?

127
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,760
When I was seriously injured

128
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,760
and came close to death
during the operation,

129
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,000
I heard Tai say that she loved me.

130
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,640
I told myself

131
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,360
that I had to survive,

132
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,960
so I could be with Tai.

133
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,120
Just thinking how great it'd be

134
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,400
to spend our lives together…

135
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,480
gave me the strength to fight on.

136
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,840
Your effort won my heart.

137
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,800
He also won my mom's heart.

138
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:59,720
It might take time, but love needs time.

139
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,200
You must fight for it.

140
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,720
Okay, I'll fight.

141
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,440
I'll give it another go.

142
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,320
Cheewa!

143
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,440
Cheewa!

144
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,600
Cheewa, are you okay?

145
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,400
Will your baby be okay?

146
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,360
I don't know.

147
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,880
You have to see a doctor.

148
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,160
No.

149
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,960
Let's wait and see how I feel.

150
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,120
Let's go before anyone notices.

151
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,720
I'll go with you. Let's hurry.

152
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,120
Let's go, Cheewa.

153
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,920
Come on. Let's go.

154
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,800
EMERGENCY

155
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,280
I'll do an ultrasound to check your baby.

156
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,400
How does it look?
Is the baby still alive, doctor?

157
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,520
This is the baby.

158
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,680
This is its heart.

159
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,440
I'll let you listen to it.

160
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,760
What's that sound?

161
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,520
It's the beating of the child's heart.

162
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,560
My goodness.
Are there two hearts in there?

163
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,520
That means the baby is fine, right?

164
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,440
The heartbeat is strong.

165
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
The baby is strong,

166
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,960
but from now on,

167
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,480
you must take good care of yourself

168
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,960
because the risk of miscarriage is high

169
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,400
in the first 12 weeks.

170
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,360
I'll prescribe you some supplements.

171
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,560
Let's go.

172
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,480
I think you can see more clearly
in this one.

173
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,520
The man is definitely Mr. Saruj.

174
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,400
But I'm not sure
if the other person is a man or a woman.

175
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,440
Their face isn't clear.

176
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,640
It's a man.

177
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,440
But the hairstyle…

178
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,520
But men these days have hair like that.

179
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,080
Let me see another one.

180
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,760
Madam Orn. I guess I'm too late.

181
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,840
- Hello.
- Hello, Prapaiporn.

182
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,280
I'm Lady Veena.

183
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,160
That's right.

184
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,440
What brings you here?

185
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,280
Well, I meant to send those photos
to my friend,

186
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,600
but I put the wrong address
on the envelope.

187
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,480
So it was you.
To whom did you want to send them?

188
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,480
These are photos of Saruj.

189
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,280
It's not Mr. Saruj.

190
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,560
Well, can I have them back?

191
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,680
- Madam Orn, think of this--
- No.

192
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,680
- Please forget about it.
- It's Saruj.

193
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,360
To whom did you want
to send these photos? To reporters?

194
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,040
No, that's not it.

195
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,440
You've got it all wrong.

196
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,480
I just…

197
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,920
Yes.

198
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,200
They are photos of me.

199
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,880
Lady Veena hired a photographer
to photograph me.

200
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,800
You're dead.

201
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,880
It's game over for you.

202
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,920
Serves you right.

203
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,440
Well,

204
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,240
I just killed a mosquito.

205
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,160
I see.

206
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,640
Hold on.

207
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,760
Why did you have someone
take photos of Mr. Saruj?

208
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,760
Well…

209
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,040
I thought he'd meet with Venus.

210
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,600
Well, Venus and Mr. Saruj

211
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,120
are very close.

212
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,440
I'm not close to her.

213
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,320
And the person in the photos isn't Venus.

214
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,560
Are you saying you're close
with the man in the photos?

215
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,800
But you kissed him in the photos.

216
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,360
It was an accident.

217
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,560
He was a waiter who helped me
carry stuff and he fell over.

218
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,400
He helped you carry your stuff.

219
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,720
Did you have to hug him?

220
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,320
He wasn't feeling well,
so I wanted to give him some medicine.

221
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,080
So nothing was going on.

222
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,920
Hold on.

223
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,840
Don't tell me the reason
you don't have a girlfriend

224
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,040
is because you like…

225
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,920
That's not it.

226
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,800
I like women.

227
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,400
And more importantly,

228
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,080
I don't like Venus.

229
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,200
Please don't try to do this anymore,
Lady Veena.

230
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,960
Mr. Saruj.

231
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,560
Venus should have her own life.

232
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,720
Please don't let her waste time on me.

233
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,880
Yes, I totally agree with you.

234
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,840
It seems to me

235
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:25,560
you hired someone
to take photos of Saruj to entrap him.

236
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,720
I think you have gone too far.

237
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,720
You're getting it wrong, Madam Orn.

238
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,560
Listen, kids these days aren't like us.

239
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,640
You can't match them up

240
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,560
and force them to get together.

241
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,640
A good adult doesn't do that.

242
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,960
You think they're suitable

243
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,280
because of their family status,
so you try to match them up

244
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,920
and force things on them.

245
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,200
An adult who does this

246
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,320
won't be respected by others.

247
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,760
- Yes, ma'am.
- What is it? Why do you keep shaking me?

248
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,240
What? What did I do?

249
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,360
What?

250
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,560
Have I ever done that? I've never done it.

251
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,200
You have.

252
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,760
Gosh,

253
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,640
you haven't just done it,

254
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,960
but you have been doing it
your whole life.

255
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,400
"How to use the present continuous tense."

256
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,040
The subject plus

257
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,080
is, am, are,

258
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,920
plus the verb with -ing

259
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,240
is used to talk about an event…"

260
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,920
Come to my house this evening.

261
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,480
I'll help you study for the English exam.

262
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,360
You have an exam soon, don't you?

263
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,920
Aren't you staying at the hotel anymore?

264
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,040
I have moved back home.

265
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,120
You should drink plain milk

266
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,080
so you won't get cavities.

267
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,280
The best way to learn English

268
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,800
is to make it fun,

269
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,920
like with songs

270
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,800
or movies.

271
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,640
Do you want me to watch them?

272
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,760
Yes.

273
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,520
Jot down words or sentences
in your notebook.

274
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,800
Thirty sentences, at least.

275
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,600
- What?
- Listen.

276
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,000
Don't forget to show them to me.

277
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,640
Sure.

278
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,720
How will you thank me
if you pass the exam?

279
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,800
Anything. Just tell me what you want
or where you want to go,

280
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,120
what you want to buy,

281
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,440
what you want to eat.

282
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,320
Or if you want to buy
a games console for me,

283
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,960
- I will--
- Hey.

284
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,720
You have to give something to me.

285
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,880
In that case,

286
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,680
what do you want?

287
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,000
Well…

288
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,280
Can you drop the Mr.?

289
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,240
You're serious about this, aren't you?

290
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,720
If you're so formal with me,

291
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,120
then it'll be difficult
if I want to be something else.

292
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,680
Something else?

293
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,480
What do you mean?

294
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,960
Let me see.

295
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,040
Don't you know what this means?

296
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,000
It means

297
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,640
kissing her cheek.

298
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,720
I see.

299
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,840
Thank you.

300
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,200
I couldn't find it.

301
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,880
Kiss her cheek.

302
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,680
Actually, we didn't only kiss.

303
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,800
Don't say that we kissed.

304
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,160
Our mouths just bumped into each other.

305
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,120
It's not kissing.

306
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,840
How could you say that?

307
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,600
I've never kissed anyone.

308
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,280
Never.

309
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,040
It wasn't just that time.

310
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,960
You also kissed my cheek once.

311
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,520
It was an accident.

312
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,920
Stop making out there was more to it.

313
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,160
- Wait.
- Stop it now.

314
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,600
Take this.

315
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,560
Is it such a big deal?

316
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,360
Of course. What's wrong with you today?

317
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,800
You're talking nonsense.

318
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,120
Why are you being like this
all of a sudden?

319
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,800
Fine, you never kissed me on the mouth

320
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,240
or the cheek.

321
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,600
But I kissed your cheek once.

322
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,800
No, you didn't. When did you do that?

323
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,640
Hey.

324
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,160
What are you doing?

325
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,760
Why are you playing with fire?

326
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,160
I'm not. Jaew is going to grill some fish

327
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,640
for your family,

328
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,320
so I volunteered
to light the fire for her.

329
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,240
Why didn't you turn on the fan?

330
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,960
Look at you getting all teary.

331
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,440
Come here.

332
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,360
I don't know where the fan is,

333
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,400
but I'm fine. It's okay.

334
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,040
I'm just building a fire.

335
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,760
It's nothing.

336
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,560
You're so adorable.

337
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:45,640
Aren't I smelly? I'm all sweaty.

338
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,560
You smell nice with the coal.

339
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,120
It's lit. I'll go and tell Jaew.

340
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,560
Right. I forgot.

341
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,360
Hello, I'm Cheewan, Kratin's daughter.

342
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,480
I'll be here for the school holidays.

343
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,840
Goodbye.

344
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,760
What?

345
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,840
Wasn't that Mr. Jak?

346
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,760
You mistook me for Jak?

347
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,080
You've hurt my feelings.

348
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,120
Don't you remember me at all?

349
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,200
Am I really that forgettable?

350
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,560
Well, Mr. Jak liked to tease little kids.

351
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,360
That's right.

352
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,840
It was you, Mr. Saruj.

353
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,800
No, you kissed my cheek.

354
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,480
I can't stay here anymore.

355
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,440
Hey.

356
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,120
What are you doing here?

357
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,920
And when did you arrive in Bangkok?

358
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,920
I just arrived.

359
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,760
I have some business at the bank.

360
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,360
I'll go back in a few days.

361
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,360
Hello.

362
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,760
Are you two alone?

363
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,440
What are you doing?

364
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,440
It's late.

365
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,480
You're here to see me, aren't you?

366
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,120
What is it?

367
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,880
A mom always recognizes her child.

368
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,960
I can tell who it is at a glance.

369
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:41,160
This is a hotel. Why did you do that?

370
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,560
I can explain.

371
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,200
Lady Veena wanted to blackmail him,

372
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,920
so I was helping him.

373
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,920
I know about that.

374
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
But if you're going to help him,
you shouldn't be reckless like this.

375
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,120
There are many ways to help him

376
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,280
without spending the night with him.

377
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,840
Please don't scold Cheewan.

378
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,600
It was my fault.

379
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,240
I can't do that.

380
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,000
You're a senior, so I can't scold you.

381
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,880
More importantly,

382
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,840
you're a Jutathep.

383
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,600
If a woman is linked to you,
she is considered lucky.

384
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,360
What do you think, Cheewan?

385
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,760
Do you want to be lucky

386
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,160
and become a Jutathep?

387
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,880
No.

388
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,840
I don't want to be one.

389
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,400
I don't want to be a Jutathep one bit.

390
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,320
But spending the night together,

391
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,240
for whatever reason, is dangerous.

392
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,200
You're lucky Madam Orn doesn't know
it's you in the photo.

393
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,880
If she finds out,

394
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,520
you might be forced into marriage.

395
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,880
I don't want that.

396
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,000
I won't get married.

397
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,040
I won't get married no matter what.

398
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,040
I want to be free,
not tied down to anyone.

399
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,960
I don't want to be responsible
for the royal duties.

400
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:05,000
Please don't tell Madam Orn.
It's better she doesn't know.

401
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,320
You're grown-up now,

402
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,320
so be more careful when you're with…

403
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,920
Even if you two are close.

404
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,120
Sure.

405
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,720
Okay.

406
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,800
Now that we have talked it out,

407
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,640
I feel better.

408
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,120
We've reached an understanding

409
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,840
and you should know
what Cheewan really wants now, right?

410
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,520
Hello, Cheewan.

411
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,040
I've arrived in Thailand.

412
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,360
Simon, do you know the way to my house?

413
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,400
Sure, I'll wait for you.

414
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,760
Simon is on his way.

415
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,760
If he's the child's dad,

416
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,920
I wonder what will happen when they meet.

417
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,840
Hey.

418
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,600
Simon.

419
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,360
What are you doing here?

420
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,719
I've missed you so much.

421
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,280
Hey, what are you doing?
Get away from her.

422
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,320
I said get away from her.

423
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,679
I'm sorry.

424
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,120
I can't do this in Thailand.

425
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:46,239
Cheewan invited me here.

426
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,639
Poom, this is Simon,

427
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,440
a friend of Cheewan's and mine.

428
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,760
His dad is the caretaker of the apartment

429
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,640
I rented in Switzerland.

430
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,600
That was just a Swiss-style greeting.

431
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,320
But you're in Thailand.

432
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,880
You can't do that here.

433
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,640
You'll give her a bad name.
Do you understand?

434
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,440
I won't do it again.

435
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,680
Cheewa.

436
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,560
- Yes?
- Did you get my postcards?

437
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,440
Yes.

438
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,520
I sent you one almost every week.

439
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,760
Why did you never reply?

440
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,360
Hey, Simon!

441
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,560
- Hi, Cheewan.
- How have you been?

442
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:32,920
Cannot.

443
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,480
Well done making it all the way here.

444
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,000
Of course.

445
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,200
Come here. I've missed you so much.

446
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,400
- I also miss you.
- Tell me how you got here.

447
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,760
My gosh.

448
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,320
What postcards was he talking about?

449
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,000
Hey, Simon.

450
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,760
I don't know what Cheewa will say
about you coming here.

451
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,880
I didn't tell her about it.

452
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,760
I don't know what Cheewa will say,

453
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,600
but I'm very happy

454
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,880
to see you and Cheewa again.

455
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,040
If a good person like Simon

456
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,880
is the child's dad,

457
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,640
he'll definitely
take responsibility for it.

458
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,560
Maybe Cheewa didn't tell him
she's pregnant.

459
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,960
Why wouldn't she tell him?

460
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,400
He likes you, doesn't he?

461
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,040
Yes.

462
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,480
Are there many men after you?

463
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,080
Yes.

464
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,920
That man.

465
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,000
His name is Poom.
He's like our big brother.

466
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,120
Your big brother?

467
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,360
Poom.

468
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,560
What are you doing?

469
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,800
I'm teasing him.

470
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,280
Look at his face.

471
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,960
He's sulking now.

472
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,760
If he comes after a woman
in the Jutathep palace,

473
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,680
this is what he gets.

474
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,520
I told you many people are after me.

475
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,640
How will you protect me from all of them?

476
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,240
Who else is after you?

477
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,360
If you want me to tell you,
you must give something in exchange.

478
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,080
What about you?

479
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,720
How many women are you seeing now?

480
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,840
Who are they?

481
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,880
Why do you think I'm such a playboy?

482
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,520
Jak, you, and Vit

483
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,280
go out every night.

484
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,640
You don't go out for rice soup, do you?

485
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,360
Actually, I've seen it with my own eyes.

486
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,160
That's nonsense, Cheewa.

487
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,360
When did you see it?

488
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,960
Shall I read your fortune?

489
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,920
What's your name?

490
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,680
I'm Kaew.

491
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,400
Kaew.

492
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,400
Who is my soulmate?

493
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,560
It's probably a man in uniform.

494
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,240
Kaew.

495
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:30,920
Come here.

496
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,280
I'll be right back.

497
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,160
Hold on.

498
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,200
This is my number.

499
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,600
RONNAPOOM JUTATHEP

500
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,000
Thank you.

501
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,440
No worries.

502
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,800
Poom.

503
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,240
Can you read my palm, please?

504
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,840
Sure.

505
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,320
I want to know about my soulmate.

506
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,880
Well…

507
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,320
It's probably a man in uniform.

508
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,960
In that case, can I have your number

509
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,800
so you can recommend someone?

510
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,840
Sure.

511
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,200
Here you go.

512
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,640
Both of them are Lisa's friends.

513
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,240
You're Poncheewa, right?

514
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,840
Yes, I'm Lisa's sister.

515
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,400
I want to know

516
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,640
if you would
court them both simultaneously

517
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,760
if they call you at the same time.

518
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,920
I'm not going to court them.
We're just friends.

519
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,520
What if they get into a misunderstanding?

520
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,040
You'll give Lisa trouble.

521
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,560
I see.

522
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,480
I remember now.

523
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,360
Are you two really friends?

524
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,840
I mean, you and Cheewa.

525
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,920
Are you two really just friends?

526
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,080
Why are you asking me this way?

527
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,160
Because I want to know.

528
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,600
We're friends.

529
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,040
Cheewa just wants to be friends with me.

530
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,120
But I'm not okay with that.

531
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,440
I love Thailand so much.

532
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,120
Venus said she'd find me a job.

533
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,720
Find you a job?

534
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,160
Has she found you one?

535
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,280
Yes.

536
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,800
I will teach English in another province.

537
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,120
I have accommodation already.

538
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,160
I have to report there tomorrow

539
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,800
to start my job.

540
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,160
Congratulations, Simon.

541
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,680
Thank you, Cheewan.

542
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,040
I got the result of my English exam.

543
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,240
How is it?

544
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,360
Did you fail?

545
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,600
I passed!

546
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,280
Come on.

547
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,160
Were you trying to trick me?

548
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,440
You're so naughty.

549
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,400
Thank you so much for helping me.

550
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,520
You can't just thank me.

551
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,400
You must also give me my reward.

552
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,560
Okay.

553
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,440
Saruj.

554
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,920
What did you say? I didn't hear it.

555
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,640
Can you say it again?

556
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,320
Saruj.

557
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,320
I like it so much.
I'm so happy to hear it.

558
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,440
Now that your English is better,

559
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,080
I'll teach you about different cultures,

560
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,480
so you won't be afraid
when you attend social events.

561
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,080
Do I need to learn about culture too?

562
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:25,680
I think it'll make both of us exhausted.

563
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,040
Let's not go that far.

564
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,240
Why?

565
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,840
I don't hate English anymore.

566
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,920
I should be able to study it myself.

567
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,560
Actually, I just want to pass my exams
and get my diploma.

568
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,600
Are you afraid of hard work?

569
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,040
Learning stuff that
is out of your wheelhouse

570
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,840
is always going to be tough.

571
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,600
It'd be tough for you too.

572
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,160
Can't you do it for me

573
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,280
and for us?

574
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,160
Madam Orn wants me
to stay with her tonight.

575
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,240
Jaew has gone home for a while.

576
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,160
I'll go to bed now.

577
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,760
Good night.

578
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Your dad and I will pick you up
this Saturday.

579
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,920
Get your things ready.

580
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,320
Simon.

581
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,600
Tomorrow is your first day of work, right?

582
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,440
Hi, Cheewa.

583
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,560
Yes, it's my first day.

584
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,920
Well then, can I come with you?

585
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,200
Would it be all right
if I stayed with you for a while?

586
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,680
Stay with me in Pattaya?

587
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:49,960
Yes.

588
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,120
I'm dealing with some problems right now.

589
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,440
I want to be somewhere quiet
to think things over.

590
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,400
Sure.

591
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,160
I have rented a car.

592
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:03,480
Do you want me to pick you up
tomorrow morning?

593
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,000
Yes.

594
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,200
But…

595
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,840
don't pick me up at home.
I'll go meet you myself.

596
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,360
Okay.

597
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,520
She's coming to Pattaya with me.

598
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,320
Cheewa.

599
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,600
Cheewa.

600
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:04,560
I'm going upcountry
to stay with a friend for a while.

601
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,040
Don't worry about me.

602
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,720
Please tell my parents I'm sorry.

603
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,920
What?

604
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,640
Cheewa dared run away?

605
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,160
My gosh.

606
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,320
What do I do?

607
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:54,240
There are two bedrooms in this house,
so don't worry.

608
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,040
You can stay here.

609
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,880
I'll take care of you.

610
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,720
Thank you.

611
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,960
Is this Venus's house?

612
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,360
It's nice.

613
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:16,080
Are you sure it's okay for me to stay?

614
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,200
I'm not bothering you, am I?

615
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,960
I'm actually glad you're here.

616
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,000
You're probably aware

617
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:28,040
that I came here because of you.

618
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,560
I have a job

619
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,800
teaching at an international school
near the village.

620
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,880
You're a very nice guy.

621
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,560
I really appreciate your help.

622
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,520
But you don't want me to contact Cheewan.

623
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,960
You have a problem, right?

624
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,360
I just want

625
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,280
to be alone for a while.

626
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,760
The sea is very nice.

627
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,840
Hello, Kae.

628
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,160
Is Poncheewa with you in Chiang Mai?

629
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,600
I see.

630
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:37,800
It's nothing.

631
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:42,080
I just remembered that Poncheewa loves
your house in Chiang Mai.

632
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:47,040
It's nothing, really.

633
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:50,280
I need to go.

634
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,080
She's not with Kae.

635
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:01,840
Gosh, who is she with?

636
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,840
I can't tell anyone about this.

637
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,680
I made you breakfast.

638
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,320
Bread?

639
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,680
I don't want to eat Western food anymore.

640
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,600
I'm in Thailand.

641
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,960
Is this blueberry jam?

642
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:41,960
Simon.

643
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,480
It's bad. It's rotten.

644
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,480
- Simon.
- It's inedible.

645
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,440
- No! Simon.
- It's rotten.

646
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:58,760
Simon.

647
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,720
That's shrimp paste dipping sauce.

648
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,760
I was going to have it
with vegetables and rice.

649
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,040
What am I going to eat now?

650
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,040
Is it edible?

651
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,200
Yes.

652
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,280
Do you eat that stuff?

653
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,400
Yes.

654
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,280
At home, most people your age

655
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,440
move out to live by themselves.

656
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:28,360
But why do they call this
running away from home in Thailand?

657
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,400
Yes. It's considered very bad behavior

658
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,720
to live with a man.

659
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,920
Therefore, please don't tell our friends

660
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,520
or your colleagues
that I'm staying with you.

661
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,520
We love each other.

662
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:48,040
But I love you.

663
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:51,200
I want to start a life together with you.

664
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,120
A life together?

665
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,480
You and me?

666
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,520
Yes.

667
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,320
Do you want to give it a try?

668
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,480
Look around you.

669
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,720
This kind of life is very good.

670
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,040
I go to work

671
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,040
while you stay at home,

672
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,240
take care of our house,

673
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,040
and cook.

674
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,040
And…

675
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,600
we can have a child together.

676
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,160
Have a child?

677
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,240
With you as my child's dad?

678
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,520
Do you want me to tell everyone that?

679
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,840
It's okay.

680
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,720
Take your time to think about it.

681
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:41,440
But I have to go to work first.

682
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,000
Bye.

683
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,280
Hello.

684
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,480
Hello. Is that Cheewan?

685
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,760
What are you doing?

686
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,600
I'm stressing out.

687
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,600
I'm fine. What is it?

688
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:58,160
Don't tell my mom
that I found a job for Simon.

689
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,200
- Why?
- Well, I said he could stay

690
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,760
in my mom's house that she rents out.

691
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,680
It's not occupied right now,
so I let him stay there.

692
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,120
But I didn't tell my mom about it.

693
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,120
Simon has already paid the rent,

694
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,240
but I'm keeping it.

695
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,400
I'm planning to buy a new game console.

696
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,840
Hey, that's stealing from your mom.

697
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,280
Come on, it's okay.

698
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,080
What?

699
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:24,560
I was afraid you'd let it slip to my mom
if she goes to Jutathep Palace.

700
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,000
And tell Cheewa

701
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:28,280
not to tell anyone. It's a secret.

702
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,520
Poncheewa.

703
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,840
Simon! Yes.

704
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,720
That's right. Gosh, why am I so stupid?

705
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,080
Why did I only just think of it?

706
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,560
What is it?

707
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:41,840
It's in Pattaya, right?

708
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:46,520
Venus, can I have the address?
Give me all the details.

709
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,680
Okay, jot this down.

710
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,720
Where are you going, Cheewan?

711
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,640
Do you need a lift?

712
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,040
Yes.

713
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,840
What's wrong, Cheewan?

714
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,320
I can't tell anyone about it.

715
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,960
Cheewa will be mad at me.

716
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:35,360
What happened? Just tell me.

717
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,800
I've been stressed every day

718
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,200
for the past couple of months.

719
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,280
I'm especially stressed today.

720
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:49,440
Saruj, please help me.

721
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,640
Please help me.

722
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,000
Poncheewa ran away to Pattaya with Simon.

723
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:58,000
Why? Are they together?

724
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,640
I'm not sure.

725
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,920
Is there something else

726
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,880
that you haven't told me?

727
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,560
Thank you so much for telling me.

728
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,960
I need to go.

729
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,520
There you are. Come here.

730
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,440
- Let me pinch you.
- Gosh.

731
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,920
What is this, Mom?

732
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,400
Why didn't you say someone is staying
at the house in Pattaya?

733
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:38,280
How did you find out?

734
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,680
Well, Taew, who lives next door,
called and asked me.

735
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:44,000
Well, Simon got a job as a teacher
at a school nearby,

736
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,000
so I let him stay there.

737
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:47,720
For free?

738
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,120
No. He paid the rent,

739
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:53,600
but I've already spent it.

740
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,880
What? You stole my money?

741
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,800
- Why are you like this?
- Gosh, Mom.

742
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,840
Dad does it, so I thought I'd do it too.

743
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,640
What? Your dad is embezzling me?

744
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:07,600
- How could you let him do that?
- Mom!

745
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,600
- Mom, it hurts!
- Tell me now

746
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,280
what your dad stole from me.

747
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,320
- Tell me now.
- Mom.

748
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,160
Come back here.
Tell me how much he has taken.

749
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,960
Hello.

750
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,040
What a tiring day.

751
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,360
I talked so much that my throat was raw.

752
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,760
Do you want some water?

753
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,040
Sure.

754
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,600
Here you go.

755
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,280
Give me a second.

756
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,880
I just have to fry this fish
and stir-fry some vegetables.

757
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,200
The oil is splashing everywhere.

758
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,280
- What do I do?
- Cheewa.

759
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:00,720
Did you forget to dry the fish?

760
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,480
Dry the fish?

761
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,680
I need to flip the fish before it burns.

762
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:09,080
How do I flip it? It's going to burn.

763
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,840
Cheewa, stand back. Let me do it.

764
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:12,840
Okay.

765
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,120
Simon, flip it now.

766
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:24,960
Now!

767
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,120
Simon.

768
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,840
There's a lot of smoke. It's burning.

769
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,560
What do we do, Cheewa?

770
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,080
Turn off the gas first.

771
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,400
- Turn off the gas.
- It's down there.

772
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,840
How do I turn it off?

773
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,680
- Turn it.
- Turn it? I've never done it before.

774
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,760
Gosh, Simon. Move. Let me do it.

775
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,520
Cheewa!

776
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:08,720
Cheewa!

777
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,280
What happened?

778
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,480
It's down here.

779
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,560
Cheewa.

780
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,280
Are you okay?

781
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:22,880
Cheewan.

782
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,720
I fell down again.

783
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,600
- Fell down?
- My baby.

784
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:28,640
Will my baby be okay?

785
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:30,800
- Baby?
- Baby?

786
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,720
Cheewa, what baby?

787
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,800
Did you run away from home

788
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,800
because you're pregnant?

789
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:45,960
What?

790
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,800
Are you not the dad?

791
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:54,360
I thought you were,
since she eloped with you.

792
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:01,680
Are you all right?

793
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,680
Slowly, Cheewa.

794
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,480
How are you, Cheewa?

795
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,240
I'm all good.

796
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,240
I'm not bruised or hurt.

797
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,080
It's still there.

798
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,720
I don't think I need to go
to the hospital.

799
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:13,720
Do you two have anything to tell me?

800
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:21,680
How did it happen?

801
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,080
Who is the child's dad?

802
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,560
Come here first.

803
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,360
Whose is it?

804
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:31,640
I already broke up with him.

805
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,120
Do your parents know about this?

806
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,200
No one knows about it.

807
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:45,440
We can't let them know this, Saruj.

808
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,280
What can we do, Cheewa?

809
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:50,120
This problem is too big for you
to deal with yourself.

810
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:57,920
I can't bear to see my parents' faces
when they find out.

811
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:01,480
Please don't tell them.

812
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:09,240
There's Simon.
There are so many of them here.

813
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,240
This is big.

814
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:15,480
We didn't waste our time coming here.
Let's listen to them first.

815
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,360
Okay, I'll listen.

816
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,600
If you say I'm the child's dad,

817
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:23,120
why can't I really be their dad?

818
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,120
My gosh.

819
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,480
- This is…
- Cheewa.

820
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:29,680
- See?
- I want to start a family with you.

821
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,240
That's enough, Simon.

822
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,600
Please accept the truth.

823
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:41,160
Have I not been good enough to you?

824
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:45,640
I want to spend my life with you.

825
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:51,640
I'm begging you.

826
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,920
Please let me be with you.

827
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:01,360
You have been good to me, Simon.
You really have.

828
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,480
But you don't belong here.

829
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:14,320
Why?

830
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,080
Cheewa, I love you.

831
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,600
Thank you so much.

832
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,920
You're the best friend I have.

833
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,040
That's all you are to me though.

834
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,240
Our love

835
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,920
must be meaningless

836
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,600
since I'm the only one
willing to fight for it, right?

837
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,320
Please quit your job,

838
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,840
go traveling, and have some fun,

839
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,600
and then go home, Simon.

840
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:50,160
You'll find love one day

841
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:54,280
that won't tire you out or hurt you.

842
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,160
This is a photo.

843
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:47,840
Before this,

844
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:50,840
all I had to think about was

845
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:52,840
eating,

846
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,120
playing,

847
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,120
and studying.

848
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:58,960
That's all I thought about.

849
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:03,920
But now,

850
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,880
I have to be a mom.

851
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,720
I can't imagine

852
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,880
how I'm going to manage this.

853
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:19,880
Being a mom is such a big burden.

854
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,960
You're not alone.

855
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,840
Why are you running away from everyone?

856
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,360
You still have your dad

857
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:33,560
and mom.

858
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,360
I can also help you raise this child.

859
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:42,480
My parents are my whole life.

860
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,080
All my memories

861
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:47,920
are of them being very proud of me.

862
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:50,800
Dad.

863
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,920
This award for outstanding manners,

864
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,520
you've been awarded it
every year for six years.

865
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:01,160
She's also been the top student
for six consecutive years.

866
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:04,880
So the awards in the cabinet

867
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,840
are all yours, right?

868
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:11,280
I also have one.

869
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:12,440
Here it is.

870
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:17,920
I only have one.

871
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,960
And it's for soccer.

872
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,280
I also have one.

873
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:25,600
Only one, just like him.

874
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:31,640
Vit, it's a shame we're her siblings.

875
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:33,320
We can't compete with her.

876
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,720
Right?

877
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:37,360
Don't be silly, Lisa.

878
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:42,840
Thank you, dear.

879
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:46,520
Now your mom can boast about you
to the neighbors again this year.

880
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,520
Hold on.

881
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,880
It's not just me
who boasts to the neighbors.

882
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,360
You're my witnesses.

883
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:56,560
Your dad has gathered
all your awards in the cabinet.

884
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:59,440
Who is the one getting excited and feeling

885
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,480
very proud of you? Is it just me?

886
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,920
Honey, come on.

887
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,040
She's good at her studies and outstanding
in activities, so I have to boast.

888
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:13,760
I don't have to worry about you.

889
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:16,560
You'll definitely be successful in life.

890
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:20,440
Always be a good girl, all right?

891
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:23,040
Yes, Dad.

892
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,880
I love you, Dad.

893
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,680
You're the best.

894
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:33,840
Thank you.

895
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:41,200
I can't stay at home

896
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:45,480
because of that cabinet.

897
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,040
I want to destroy it every day

898
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:56,320
because I destroyed my parents' hopes

899
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:01,400
and brought shame on them.

900
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,080
Don't let one mistake define
your whole life.

901
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:16,240
We've all made mistakes.

902
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:18,920
You must forgive yourself.

903
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,319
It's okay.

904
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:30,600
I'm here for you.

905
01:08:31,479 --> 01:08:32,640
It's okay.

906
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:49,840
What brings you all the way here?

907
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,640
Are you really the child's dad?

908
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:54,840
Is Saruj the child's dad?

909
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:56,040
Yes.

910
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:57,520
Then you must get married.

911
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,520
But they must talk about this
as soon as possible.

912
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:02,520
You want me to be the intermediary
between Mr. Saruj and Poncheewa?

913
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,000
Do you really want me to marry Poncheewa?

914
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:07,280
Yes.

915
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:10,560
Do you think it's right
to let two people get married

916
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,520
out of responsibility

917
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,280
when they don't love each other?

918
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:15,840
