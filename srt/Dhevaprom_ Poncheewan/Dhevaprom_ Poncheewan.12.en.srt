1
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,480
What makes a good ambassador's wife?

2
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,720
She must speak many languages, right?

3
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,920
Does she have to be prim and elegant?

4
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,360
She must know her manners

5
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,080
and be considerate of others.

6
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,520
And we think that…

7
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,760
You have all those qualities, Cheewan.

8
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,720
Love.

9
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,040
Gosh, you're giving me goosebumps.

10
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,920
You make no sense.
I'm tired of talking to you now.

11
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,600
Fine, I'll be like a brother for you.

12
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,840
Can I hug you like a brother then?

13
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,320
Saruj.

14
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,840
-Where are you going?
-Saruj.

15
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,880
Stay here, you naughty girl.

16
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,360
Don't you run away from me.

17
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,960
Poom,

18
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,920
you stand here.

19
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,200
Poncheewa,

20
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,920
you stand here.

21
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,160
Cheewan,

22
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,640
come here.

23
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,240
What is this about?

24
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,840
Just do as I say, and you'll know.

25
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,360
The way to find out if the feelings
you have for another person

26
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,080
are like those of siblings

27
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,280
or lovers

28
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,520
is very simple.

29
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,640
You use your heart.

30
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,399
Close your eyes.

31
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,600
Think about

32
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,120
what you like about them.

33
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,720
If you just think of them like a sibling,

34
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,440
your heart will only feel warm.

35
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,120
But if you think of them like a lover,

36
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,080
your heart will race.

37
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,600
Your face will flush.

38
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,280
The warmth will turn into heat

39
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,880
that burns your heart.

40
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,920
Next,

41
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,760
think about them being with another person

42
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,560
or losing them to someone else.

43
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,360
If you only think of them like a sibling,

44
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,960
you'll only feel a little empty,

45
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,680
like someone is sharing their love.

46
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,160
You'll just worry about their well-being.

47
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,120
But if you really love them,

48
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,120
your heart will feel something else.

49
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,280
Next,

50
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,840
you have to hug them.

51
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,040
The hug of a sibling

52
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,680
energizes you.

53
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,920
But the hug of a lover

54
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,360
is never enough.

55
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,960
You want to hug them

56
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,680
more and more.

57
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,840
I'm sorry. I…

58
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,960
Cheewa.

59
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,760
Cheewa.

60
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,840
She's also blushing.

61
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,760
This is a great way to test it,
isn't it, Poom?

62
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,720
That's nonsense.

63
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,400
It doesn't work at all.

64
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,080
You messed up, Poom.

65
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,480
Yes,

66
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,880
you definitely did.

67
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,040
-Why are you angry at Poom?
-What?

68
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,280
He can't help his feelings.

69
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,640
You always take your cousin's side.

70
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,240
You're also biased,

71
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,160
taking your cousin's side.

72
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,480
Well…

73
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,560
I'm going to bed now, Mali.

74
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,960
Mr. Poom is such a womanizer.

75
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,640
He said he likes Poncheewa.

76
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,040
I don't believe him.

77
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,280
You're dead, Poom.

78
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,880
There are so many cars parked outside.

79
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,600
Is there a party?

80
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,960
There you are.

81
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,560
Come on, let's head inside.

82
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,800
Jak is also here.

83
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,840
Vit called us three tigers to gather.

84
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,480
And a cute cat.

85
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,400
And a cute cat.

86
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,800
Are you teasing me?

87
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,400
Let's go,

88
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,680
Mr. Cat.

89
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,760
Hello, everyone.

90
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,440
Today, some old friends of mine,

91
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,240
whom Cheewan asked me to invite,

92
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,560
are here.

93
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,360
Who are your old friends?

94
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,120
Here they are.

95
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,360
They're all here.

96
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,400
Cheewan.

97
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,800
Did you invite them here?
Why did you do that?

98
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,720
What's going on?

99
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,400
It's nothing.

100
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,520
We're Poom's ex-girlfriends.

101
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,520
He dated me for a month.

102
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,320
He dated me for six months.

103
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,960
He dated me for three months.

104
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,640
Back then, my friends and I

105
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,640
liked to throw parties here

106
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,800
and we saw you three often.

107
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,280
But Poom

108
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,120
was the most charming.

109
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,280
Yes.

110
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,120
You're handsome and cool.

111
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,560
You were a lot of fun.

112
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,440
But it wasn't long before
you got bored with us,

113
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,960
and you broke up with us with the phrase,

114
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,280
-"Let's just be friends."
-"Let's just be friends."

115
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,360
He also pulled a surprise when we dated.

116
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,360
He hid a cute ring in a dessert.

117
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,000
Cheewan, why are you doing this?

118
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,960
I just wanted to remind you
that you like pretty girls.

119
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,760
Girls shouldn't take you seriously

120
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,440
when you tell them you like them,

121
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,040
because they'll get hurt

122
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,560
when you get bored of them.

123
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,040
What about you, Vit?

124
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,400
What were you like?

125
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,520
What does this have to do with me?

126
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,880
Chavit?

127
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,880
He was very generous.

128
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,200
On Valentine's Day,

129
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,440
he bought a big bouquet
of roses for his girl.

130
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,440
He brought it to Satriwitthaya School,
where I studied.

131
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,480
It was for a senior named…

132
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,400
Noon.

133
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,120
And it was Bow the year after that.
She got some chocolate.

134
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,440
That's right.

135
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,760
Back then,

136
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,760
I was quite popular.

137
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,600
Back then.

138
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,200
Jak.

139
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,280
Fai asked me to send you her regards.

140
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,720
Fai?

141
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,400
She was in the year below me.

142
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,160
I used to know her.

143
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,840
It's nothing.

144
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,240
That's right.

145
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,280
Back then, you picked Fai up
at the campus in your car.

146
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,320
You often took her to Canton Suki in Siam.

147
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,760
This is clearly a party
to expose the three players.

148
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,600
That's enough. Stop this.

149
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,920
Lisa.

150
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,320
This isn't a party for your old friends.

151
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,400
Take them upstairs now.

152
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,600
Let's go our separate ways.

153
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,240
Cheewan, you're a rascal.

154
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,880
And you too, Poom. What have you done?

155
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,880
Are you after her friend?

156
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,040
Cheewan.

157
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,480
-Let's take a walk outside.
-Okay.

158
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,960
Let's go.

159
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,440
Hold on, Cheewa. I'm coming with you.

160
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,600
Vit, take this.

161
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,320
-Ploy, please take this.
-Yes?

162
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,080
Fai?

163
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,960
Hold on, Cheewan.

164
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,960
That was too much.

165
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,600
You can't judge me
for what I did in the past.

166
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,040
Saruj, look at her.

167
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,560
Is this how you see me too, Cheewa?

168
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,640
Yes, I always have.

169
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,800
What?

170
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,040
Don't forget

171
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,920
that I've seen you flirt with women
since I was small.

172
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,400
But my feelings are different.

173
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,160
I just did it for fun back then.

174
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,600
I just wanted to try things out.

175
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,000
But it's different with you.

176
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,960
You two have known each other for so long.

177
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,840
Why are you only falling for her now?

178
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,240
Cheewan.

179
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,320
Let them talk it out first.

180
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,440
No, Saruj. This is an important question.

181
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,200
I want to hear Poom's answer.

182
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,080
I didn't realize my feelings back then

183
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,920
because Cheewa was still young.

184
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,240
I could suppress my feelings

185
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,120
because I knew

186
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,200
that it wasn't time for it.

187
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,240
Cheewan, come here.

188
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,480
Saruj, we're not going anywhere.

189
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,040
And you must talk Poom out of this.

190
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,240
You're going too far.

191
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,240
Once a player, always a player.

192
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,280
Cheewan.

193
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,360
You always take Poom's side.

194
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,960
Don't you care about Poncheewa?

195
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,000
Cheewan.

196
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,440
You're being too harsh on me.

197
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,280
Poom, don't raise your voice at her.

198
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,600
Cheewa, listen to me.

199
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,320
I was just wild back then.

200
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,760
But you're taking Dalad's side, Cheewan.

201
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,200
He isn't that good.

202
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,320
Don't insult him.

203
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,880
That's right,
and don't scold Cheewan, Poom.

204
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,720
Don't insult Saruj then.

205
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,200
Don't insult Poom.

206
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,320
Stop it.

207
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,480
Gosh, this is giving me a headache.

208
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,160
What were we talking about?

209
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,200
-About you being a womanizer.
-About you being a womanizer.

210
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,280
Right.

211
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,600
How long will Poom be mad at me?

212
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,360
I'm actually scared thinking about it.

213
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,120
He'll calm down soon.

214
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,640
This is how he is.

215
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,680
This is why my mom doesn't want me
to get together with Saruj.

216
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,120
If you and Poom were together and fought,

217
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,960
our families wouldn't be able
to look each other in the eye.

218
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,240
Players are scary.

219
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,920
Come to think of it…

220
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,960
Poom isn't a player.

221
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,040
He was probably just wild
because of his age.

222
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,520
What?

223
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,320
What is this?

224
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,560
Are you taking his side now?

225
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,359
Why?

226
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,400
Vit, go to the left. Shoot.

227
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,319
Gosh.

228
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,960
We're so awesome.

229
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,520
By the way, Poom,

230
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,320
are you free on Valentine's Day?

231
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,200
I'm not.

232
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,040
I have many girls to see
on Valentine's Day.

233
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,960
Gosh,

234
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,640
but you must help me this time.

235
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,960
I promised my mom
I'd pick Cheewa up from school.

236
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,240
Poom,

237
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,680
you're my last resort.

238
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,200
Go and pick Cheewa up for me.

239
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,120
Fine, I'll pick her up for you.

240
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,240
Why are you picking me up?
What about your girlfriend?

241
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,360
I told her I had to pick up my sister.

242
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,280
Actually, you didn't have
to come. I feel bad.

243
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,240
For me,

244
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,280
no woman is more important than you.

245
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,680
Thank you.

246
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,560
What are you thinking about?

247
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,160
Why are you blushing?

248
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,960
It's nothing.

249
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,360
Actually,

250
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,080
Vit and Jak had more girlfriends

251
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,040
than Poom back then.

252
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,920
And look at them now.

253
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,200
They're married

254
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,760
and they stay at home.

255
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,120
They're so tame now.

256
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,120
Maybe we're being too harsh on Poom.

257
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,920
Really?

258
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,760
Chaiya, please prepare
a marketing plan for me.

259
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,760
The economy is slow, so help find a way

260
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,520
to boost sales.

261
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,520
Don't you want to start
your own business in the future?

262
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,520
Dalad.

263
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,800
Dalad, are you listening to me?

264
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,280
Yes, I am.

265
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,880
All right, let's go with that.

266
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,720
You prepare some promotions

267
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,520
and you come up
with new chocolate products.

268
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,120
You want a new product.

269
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,800
What about my fee for the previous one?

270
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,000
I'll pay you at the end of this month
as we agreed.

271
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,840
If you pay me at the end of the month,
but want me to come up with a new one now,

272
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,360
then please pay me for both products

273
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,800
at the end of this month.

274
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,640
Hey, hold on.

275
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,320
And when are you going
to make me a partner?

276
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,240
Your products and the partnership
are separate.

277
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,880
I told you we had to follow the process,
didn't I?

278
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,080
So your promise is a lie?

279
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,560
I'm not lying.

280
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,600
What is this? You're going overboard.

281
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,720
I've made a few chocolate products,
but you haven't paid me at all.

282
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,920
As for the partnership,

283
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,880
you told me you'd introduce me
to a partner,

284
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,680
but I haven't met anyone.

285
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,240
You're selling dreams and using me,
aren't you?

286
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,880
Can you be reasonable?

287
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,800
There are processes for everything.

288
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,520
You can't be so headstrong and impatient.

289
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
You can't do that.

290
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,000
So how long do I have to wait?

291
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,040
You're rich. You own a business.

292
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,440
How the hell would you understand
a poor person like me?

293
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,440
Hey, how dare you?

294
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,560
Dalad, stop it!

295
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,480
Do you want to fight me?
Get out. You're fired.

296
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,840
I don't want your chocolate anymore.

297
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,240
-Get out!
-You're a crook.

298
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,320
-You used me.
-Go.

299
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,960
-Take him now out.
-No.

300
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,160
Let go of me.

301
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,640
Dalad might have some urgent business.

302
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,400
But he should at least call
and tell you about it.

303
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,360
But this is weird.

304
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,000
He's never missed a single appointment.

305
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,920
Let's go home.

306
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,760
152, hello.

307
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,800
372882.

308
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,040
"372882."

309
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,480
Where are you? Call me back urgently.

310
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,680
"Where are you? Call me back urgently."

311
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,240
From Poncheewa.

312
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,360
"From Poncheewa."

313
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,440
Thank you.

314
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,200
Thank you.

315
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,880
Hey,

316
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,880
give me another beer.

317
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,600
152, hello.

318
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,720
372882.

319
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,200
"372882."

320
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,240
Why did you disappear again?

321
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,720
"Why did you disappear again?"

322
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,680
I'm sorry, operator.

323
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,800
It's okay. Please calm down.

324
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,640
Do you know

325
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,880
this is like torture for me?

326
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,840
"Do you know

327
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,040
this is like torture for me?"

328
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,960
Every time you don't respond to me,

329
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,960
I feel worthless.

330
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,560
"Every time you don't respond to me,

331
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,480
I feel worthless."

332
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,640
Why do I have to go through this
over and over again?

333
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,160
"Why do I have to go through this

334
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,520
over and over again?"

335
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,560
Why?

336
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,040
Hey.

337
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,040
Isn't that Dalad?

338
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,920
You're right.

339
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,200
Tong told me the other day

340
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,080
that he fought
with his boss and got fired.

341
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,680
Hey.

342
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,280
You just got fired.

343
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,640
Can you afford to come
to an expensive bar like this?

344
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,680
Yes.

345
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,320
I can afford to come
to the same bar as you.

346
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,560
Do you have a problem?

347
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,800
The person who has a problem is you.

348
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,480
You just got fired.

349
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,240
How are you going to provide
for your wife and baby?

350
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,440
Well?

351
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,240
I get it.

352
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,760
Are you going to leech off her?

353
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,240
You're so lucky.

354
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,360
You got fired,
but you still have a safety net.

355
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,520
-You!
-Hey.

356
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,560
Do you think you're tough? Take this.

357
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,160
Even though I'm poor,

358
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,840
I'd never do that.

359
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,000
I see.

360
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,440
I'm glad you wouldn't

361
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,360
because I have a job for you.

362
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,040
But you

363
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,840
have to work for me.

364
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,480
What the hell are you talking about?

365
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,800
You want me to work for you?

366
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,640
I can take care of it alone.

367
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,480
Mod.

368
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,240
If you want to do something big,

369
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,240
you must be generous.

370
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,200
For my import business,

371
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,320
I'm looking for people
who have no choice in life

372
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,960
but are brave

373
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,120
and you fit the bill perfectly.

374
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,320
Mrs. Muslin, please sign here.

375
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,360
Mr. Saruj, please sign as a witness.

376
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,640
Mus.

377
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,720
Do you really want to divorce Mr. Nava?

378
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,680
Mom, we have talked about this
so many times already.

379
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,560
It's all done.

380
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,680
Okay, thank you so much.

381
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,080
Everything will be okay.

382
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,760
If you have any problems, I'll help you.

383
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,800
Thank you.

384
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,160
APPLICATION FOR REGISTRATION
OF DIVORCE

385
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,960
That bastard Saruj.

386
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,040
Go and tell Muslin
that I'm not divorcing her.

387
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,720
The court is allowing you
to settle this between you.

388
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,640
Do you want to go to court
and risk ruining your reputation?

389
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,400
I'd rather ruin my reputation

390
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,440
than let Muslin get back together
with Saruj.

391
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,120
Go and tell Muslin

392
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,280
that she can wait all she wants.
I'm not divorcing her.

393
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,640
I knew Mr. Nava
wouldn't let you go easily.

394
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,040
He called to threaten me
before I left home.

395
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,600
He said he'd drag me home if he found me

396
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,200
and lock me up forever.

397
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,560
I think

398
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,680
you should report this to the police,

399
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,840
so they can protect you

400
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,800
in case Mr. Nava really does what he says.

401
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,520
I'm scared, Saruj.

402
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,840
I want this to end already.

403
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,520
I don't want to live my life
in fear like this anymore.

404
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,800
I think I have a way to persuade him
to agree to a divorce.

405
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,280
I'll call Petch.

406
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,160
Focus on this first
because it's important.

407
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,520
Settle it so there won't be
a problem later.

408
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,520
I'll leave it to you.

409
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,760
Let's move to the next item.

410
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,080
We still have to discuss the plot of land
where we intend to build a condominium.

411
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,440
Okay, tell me.

412
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,840
Saruj.

413
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,720
I won't take up much of your time.

414
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,080
I need to talk to Mr. Nava for a bit.

415
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,320
APPLICATION FOR REGISTRATION
OF DIVORCE

416
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,120
APPLICATION FOR REGISTRATION
OF DIVORCE

417
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,520
Would you sign Muslin's document

418
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,480
that you threw away yesterday?

419
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,360
I'll leave as soon as you do so,

420
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,160
so you can continue this meeting.

421
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,160
Do you think I won't talk about this
in front of them?

422
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,440
Go back and tell Muslin

423
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,960
that I'm not divorcing her.

424
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,320
And tell her not to send her boyfriend
to talk to me.

425
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,320
Well then, I'll send the photos
of what you did to Muslin

426
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,440
to all media outlets.

427
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,560
Muslin said she's cornered.

428
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,080
She's not ashamed.

429
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,560
If you still won't divorce her,

430
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,640
I'll expose you
for the condo that collapsed

431
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,040
because it was your design.

432
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,760
What are you talking about?

433
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,560
Even though you spent
a lot of money covering it up,

434
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,800
you must have forgotten

435
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,280
that JT Property took over the project.

436
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,720
I have a lot of evidence

437
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,000
showing you embezzled money
from construction projects.

438
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,320
-What do you want?
-Mr. Nava.

439
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,400
Well?

440
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,120
If you want to get another charge
for assaulting me,

441
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,440
then go ahead.

442
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,520
What exactly do you want from me?

443
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,520
Divorce Muslin,

444
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,320
so it's over.

445
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,240
Leave her alone.

446
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,200
Or else, it's your life

447
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,600
that will be over.

448
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,160
If you wreck my life, I'll kill you.

449
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,440
Is this a product launch party?

450
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,720
Yes.

451
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,040
Natsarid invited us here
to celebrate with him.

452
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,560
He opened a company
importing chocolate powder.

453
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,760
Is it this brand?

454
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,280
Yes, that's right.

455
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,320
But it doesn't look like a product launch.

456
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,880
It looks more like a party.

457
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,080
A party?

458
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,960
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

459
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,480
I'm sorry for disappearing.

460
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,239
Gosh, you look so handsome.

461
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,719
That's a designer suit.

462
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,440
It costs tens of thousands.

463
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,040
The company provided it.

464
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,960
I'm working with Nat now.

465
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,239
You

466
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,440
and Natsarid?

467
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,000
Yes.

468
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,840
He wanted to sell chocolate powder,

469
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,920
so he had to seek my help.

470
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,840
He appointed me as managing director.

471
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,600
Gosh.

472
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,560
That's awesome, Dalad.

473
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,320
-Let's go.
-Okay.

474
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,440
Nop, wait up.

475
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,080
Aren't you going to dance, Cheewan?

476
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,480
You go ahead, Venus.
Don't forget your baby.

477
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,680
Thank you for coming.

478
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,840
-Make yourselves at home.
-Enjoy.

479
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,720
Hey, Cheewan.

480
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,240
Thank you all for coming.

481
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,360
Drink as much as you like tonight.

482
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,400
Congratulations.

483
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,720
I wish you success in your business.

484
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,080
Thank you for inviting us to join the fun.

485
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,200
You look pretty today.

486
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,760
Since you came back to Thailand,

487
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,600
you've become much prettier.

488
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,520
I look the same.

489
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,240
What drugs are you on?

490
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,840
Don't be shy.

491
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,080
Gosh.

492
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,600
Gosh.

493
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,400
Are you better now?

494
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,400
I'm sorry for missing the appointment.

495
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,080
I already told you

496
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,760
that I'm not mad at you
for missing the appointment.

497
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:56,120
You're sad
because I suddenly disappeared, right?

498
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,560
Dalad.

499
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,680
Can you tell me

500
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,800
how many more times
you're going to ditch me like this?

501
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,840
So I can prepare myself.

502
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,440
I promise I won't do this again.

503
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,560
From now on,

504
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,560
I won't make you sad again.

505
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,360
I just started my new job,

506
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,360
so I'm very busy.

507
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,040
Nat's business is doing really well.

508
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,760
Our lives will get better very soon.

509
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,000
I'm not that loser anymore.

510
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,440
Is his business doing that well?

511
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,400
Well, Nat has a connection in Switzerland.

512
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,160
This is the new Dalad.

513
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,320
I won't feel ashamed
when I'm with your family

514
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,560
and others anymore.

515
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,040
Thank you for understanding me.

516
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,200
They've made up.

517
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,760
We need to celebrate.

518
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,120
Venus, take it easy.

519
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,680
Why, Nop? It's so much fun.

520
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,480
Venus, it's not good for your baby
if you jump this like.

521
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,040
What baby?

522
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,440
My baby.

523
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,400
I'm having a baby, but I can still dance.

524
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,320
-I can still dance.
-I see.

525
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,600
Okay.

526
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,840
One, two, three, four.

527
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,360
Go.

528
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,480
Cheewan.

529
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,360
Here you are.

530
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,000
Listen.

531
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,640
Let me tell you something.

532
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,480
Dalad only got back together with Cheewa

533
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,520
because I gave him a job

534
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,560
and a future.

535
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,040
Thank you for giving him an opportunity.

536
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,360
Is that all you have to say?

537
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,720
I started this company myself.

538
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,640
I didn't ask my dad for any help.

539
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,840
If my gratitude isn't enough,
then here is my blessing.

540
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,600
May you live long.

541
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,080
Hey.

542
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,920
Your blessing isn't enough.

543
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,680
-You must hug me to congratulate me.
-Nat.

544
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,320
Hey, Nat. Let go of me.

545
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,200
-What are you doing?
-I'm not letting you go.

546
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,240
-Let go.
-I should have gone for you.

547
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,080
I shouldn't have wasted my time
on Poncheewa.

548
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,320
But it's okay. We can start over.

549
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,960
-Hey.
-What are you talking about?

550
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,000
I'm not interested in you.

551
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,640
Don't play so hard to get. Come here.

552
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,600
Hey!

553
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,840
Serves you right.

554
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,680
Cheewan, what happened?

555
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,880
Cheewan.

556
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,840
You should consider yourself lucky

557
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,960
that someone like me goes after
a lame woman like you.

558
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,560
Do you think everyone will give in to you
just because you're rich?

559
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,000
They won't.

560
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,200
To me, you're just a piece of trash.

561
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,720
Let's go home, Cheewa.

562
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,800
Damn it!

563
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,880
Mod!

564
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,880
Nat!

565
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,000
Help me get out. Come here.

566
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,240
Damn.

567
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,960
Hey!

568
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,400
Gosh.

569
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,840
Damn it!

570
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,040
I'm all wet now!

571
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,920
Cheewa. Cheewan.

572
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,840
Are you leaving already?

573
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,720
Nat is very drunk.
Please don't mind him, Cheewan.

574
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,440
Dalad, get a car and take us home.

575
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,240
I can't leave yet,
but I'll ask someone to call you a taxi.

576
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,440
Cheewan.

577
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,400
Cheewan, don't go yet.
Please stay with me.

578
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:01,800
Venus, if she stays,
we'll definitely have a problem with Nat.

579
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,520
Nat is drunk.

580
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,840
Don't mind him. He's our friend.

581
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,760
I won't be friends with a pervert
who takes advantage of women like him.

582
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,760
We'll go our separate ways.

583
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,480
He's not my friend anymore.

584
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,080
Come on. It won't be fun if you leave.

585
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,520
Please stay for a little longer.

586
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,720
-Please.
-No, I'm going home.

587
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,320
-Please.
-No, Venus.

588
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,880
-Please.
-No, I'm going home now.

589
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,360
-Gosh!
-Venus!

590
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,240
-Gosh!
-Venus!

591
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,760
-Venus!
-Venus!

592
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,480
-Venus.
-Venus, I'm sorry.

593
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,760
Venus.

594
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,320
-Are you hurt?
-Are you okay?

595
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,600
-I'm okay.
-Are you sure?

596
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,160
I'm good.

597
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,960
-Venus. There's blood.
-What?

598
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,240
Nop!

599
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,240
Venus!

600
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,200
Let's take her to a hospital.

601
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,640
-Let's go.
-Come on!

602
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,800
-I'll get a car.
-Hang in there, Venus.

603
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,760
Don't worry, Nop.

604
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,440
I believe Venus and your baby
will be fine.

605
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,840
But she was bleeding.

606
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,520
She wasn't being careful at the party.

607
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,800
She wouldn't listen to me.

608
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,600
It's okay. She's with a doctor.

609
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,640
How is my girlfriend?

610
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,840
She's fine.

611
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,520
She wasn't injured by the fall.

612
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,720
But about the baby…

613
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,520
What's wrong with my baby? What happened?

614
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,720
Well…

615
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,040
your girlfriend

616
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,760
isn't pregnant.

617
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,280
She's not pregnant?

618
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,560
But she was bleeding.

619
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,520
The red stain isn't blood.

620
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,720
It's wine.

621
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,480
The doctor said you're not pregnant.

622
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,800
What does this mean?

623
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,120
I'm sorry.

624
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,920
I lied to you.

625
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,240
Why?

626
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,680
My mom wanted me to go
and study in Australia,

627
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,600
but I didn't want to go,

628
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,280
so I…

629
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,920
just told her that.

630
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,440
I love you, Nop.

631
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,520
I didn't want to leave you.

632
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,200
Do you expect me to marry
someone who lies to me like this?

633
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,560
I'm sorry.

634
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,640
I didn't mean to.

635
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,880
I meant to tell you this before,

636
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,000
but I haven't had a chance to.

637
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,960
If you think loving someone
involves lying to them,

638
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,440
then our ideas of love are different.

639
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,680
Nop, please don't go.

640
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,160
Nop, I'm sorry.

641
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,960
I really didn't mean it, Nop.

642
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,560
Nop.

643
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,480
I didn't mean it.
I didn't mean for it to turn out this way.

644
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,520
I didn't mean for it to turn out this way.

645
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,040
I understand.

646
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,240
I didn't mean for it to turn out this way.

647
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:00,000
I'm scared Nop will hate me.

648
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,560
He won't. I'll talk to him for you.

649
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,600
I'll talk to him for you.

650
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,360
-Don't cry.
-Help me.

651
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,960
It's okay.

652
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,920
Nop.

653
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,360
Venus.

654
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,440
It's okay.

655
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,840
Don't cry.

656
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,200
I already called Lady Veena.

657
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,920
I told her
you're staying here with Cheewan.

658
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,680
Thank you.

659
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,840
If I went home
and Mom found out about this,

660
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,560
she'd definitely scold me.

661
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,680
Venus,

662
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,040
your mom will find out one day.

663
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,960
I'll deal with that later.
I want to make up with Nop first.

664
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,240
Sure. I'll help you.

665
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,720
Mr. Saruj,

666
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,200
do you have any idea how she can do that?

667
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,560
I don't know.

668
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:09,160
If I were him, I'd also be mad.

669
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,680
Mr. Saruj.

670
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,640
You're not helping me at all.

671
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,560
It's okay, Venus.

672
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:20,280
Nop.

673
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:27,680
Cheewan, you must help me.
I really love Nop.

674
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,120
I can't live without him.

675
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,920
But he said he was going home.

676
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,040
He doesn't want to see anyone.

677
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,520
Nop.

678
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,760
Just go home, you liar.

679
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,840
You're not welcome here anymore. Go.

680
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,280
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

681
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,240
Please forgive me.

682
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:04,560
Please let me see Nop.

683
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,040
No way.

684
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:10,680
I won't let you hurt my son again.

685
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,840
So

686
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,400
just go home, you rich girl
whose feet never touch the ground.

687
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,920
They do touch the ground.

688
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,200
You're right. There's some dirt on it.

689
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,880
Hey, girl.

690
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,600
Do you think this is all a joke?

691
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,120
I see. Is this why

692
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,680
you disrespected Nop's love and trust?

693
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:39,200
That's not true. I didn't
disrespect his love and sincerity.

694
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,720
Please forgive me, sir.

695
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,120
Read my lips.

696
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,600
No.

697
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,800
Well then, I'll just stand here.

698
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,400
I won't go anywhere

699
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,200
until you and Nop forgive me.

700
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,480
Do whatever you please.

701
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,000
You're so stubborn.

702
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:28,400
Can't you chase her off?
I don't want to see her.

703
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:34,400
She won't be able to endure
the heat for long.

704
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,240
She'll probably leave soon.

705
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,280
But it's such a pity.

706
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,280
I wanted a grandchild.

707
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,280
Nop.

708
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,080
-Venus.
-Hurry.

709
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,960
-Venus.
-Nop.

710
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,160
-Venus.
-What happened, dear?

711
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,560
It's nothing.

712
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,200
My friend is here to support me.

713
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,560
What on earth is this?

714
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:08,240
I'm so happy you followed me here.

715
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:11,680
This is such a tough battle.
I can't let you wage it alone.

716
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,280
Thank you so much.

717
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,200
By the way, why is he here with you?

718
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,960
I'm here to support you,
as you're fighting for your love like me.

719
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:29,000
Thank you for not having a go at me.

720
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,000
Please don't hold a grudge.

721
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:37,120
Today is a holy day,
so I came to invite you to a temple.

722
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,760
We'll have a good road now.

723
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,960
There won't be dust
when we use it anymore.

724
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,640
What are they doing?

725
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:57,160
Hey, Klaow and Kratin are here.

726
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,280
Right.

727
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,520
Kratin.

728
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,600
Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.

729
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,640
What are you thanking me for, Chief?

730
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:10,360
Well, you're building a road
to our temple.

731
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,560
Thank you for sharing your merit with us.

732
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:16,200
That guy made a donation.

733
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,280
Who is it?

734
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,480
-Mr. Saruj, hello.
-Hello.

735
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,160
Gosh.

736
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:39,080
The last time I was here, I came
to make merit and saw the temple's plea,

737
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,400
so I…

738
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,280
So you thought you'd use money

739
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:45,880
to win the hearts
of Kratin and others, right?

740
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,560
Let me tell you something.

741
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:53,200
The name Jutathep

742
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,040
is unknown here.

743
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:57,960
Gosh.

744
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,360
-The name of the road is Wongnakorn.
-Right.

745
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Wongnakorn? Isn't that Cheewan's surname?

746
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,840
-Right?
-Yes.

747
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,640
Mr. Klaow, Mrs. Kratin, are you happy
to have a road named after you?

748
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:12,960
Honey.

749
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,720
Is this road going to be named after us?

750
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,640
It's also our surname.

751
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,160
Mr. Saruj.

752
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,600
Why don't you use your surname

753
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,800
instead of ours?

754
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,480
You might not see me
as part of your family,

755
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,160
but I…

756
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,400
I want to be part of your family.

757
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,720
Both of you.

758
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,200
You're trying to buy us off, aren't you?

759
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,680
Let me tell you something.

760
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,320
It doesn't work with us.

761
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,320
-It does.
-It does.

762
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:55,720
It doesn't.

763
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:56,760
-It does.
-It does.

764
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,720
Sure, why not?

765
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,400
Let's be family.

766
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,320
And you're so handsome,
rich, sporty, and dependable.

767
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,320
We accept you.

768
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,320
We do.

769
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,160
Pana,

770
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,080
I also want to thank you

771
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,560
for your contribution to the temple.

772
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,640
Hold on, Chief. Why are you thanking me?

773
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,400
I didn't contribute anything.

774
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,080
-What?
-Did you build something?

775
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,440
Build what?

776
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:39,760
"Mr. Pana Srisangsuk and his family
built this for the temple in 1998."

777
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:40,880
Here it is.

778
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,640
Why is it written here?

779
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,040
-That's your name.
-Right.

780
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,080
You love Cheewan so much

781
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,200
that you wanted her
as your daughter-in-law,

782
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:53,800
but I cut in front of you and asked
for her hand, so I feel very bad.

783
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,080
Hold on. Asking for my hand?

784
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,960
When did you do that?
Who gave you my hand?

785
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:05,160
I didn't know how to make up for it,
so I thought that…

786
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,320
we should make merit together.

787
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,440
After this, whenever people use
the restroom here,

788
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,800
they'll always think of you.

789
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,480
They go inside and push one out.

790
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:19,840
Once it drops down,

791
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,400
-they look at it.
-Mr. Pana.

792
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,840
They go inside and push one out.

793
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,480
Once it drops down, they look at it.

794
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,400
Mr. Pana.

795
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,880
They push one out.

796
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,240
-It drops down.
-Mr. Pana.

797
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,720
Hey.

798
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,560
Hold on.

799
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:43,720
I don't think it's a good idea

800
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,800
for people to think of me
when they poop and piss.

801
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,120
-It is.
-It is.

802
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,640
They get a lot of relief,
so you'll get a lot of merit.

803
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,280
That's right.

804
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,040
You're so smart, Saruj.

805
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,880
You can win the hearts
of the whole village like this.

806
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,000
I want to do this too.

807
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:01,840
But what should I donate?

808
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,600
You lied before

809
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,840
and now you want to pay us off.

810
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,440
Do you know how to be sincere?

811
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:10,680
-What?
-Hey.

812
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,680
Nop.

813
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,680
-Wait up, Nop.
-Sir, how are you pushing it?

814
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:16,840
Like this.

815
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,720
-It comes out as Mr. Pana.
-This is funny.

816
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,000
Yes.

817
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,560
Wash it off too.

818
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:24,360
The whole family comes here.

819
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:31,200
My mom wanted me
to go and study diplomacy,

820
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,560
but I didn't want to.

821
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,520
If I hadn't said I was pregnant,

822
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,760
I'd have flown to Australia already.

823
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,760
I wouldn't be sitting here.

824
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,200
But you could have told me the truth.

825
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:51,560
If I told you, my mom would think
you were conspiring with me.

826
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,920
She would insult you.

827
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,240
Will lying to her

828
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:58,280
give her a better impression of me? No.

829
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:00,240
You're just buying time.

830
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,600
More importantly,

831
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,560
you made me feel like a fool.

832
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,960
When you thought I was pregnant,

833
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,520
you really pampered me.

834
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,520
I was very happy,

835
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,080
so I wanted things to stay that way.

836
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:20,240
That's why
I couldn't bring myself to tell you.

837
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,600
That's it.

838
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:25,040
You only thought of yourself.
You never thought about me.

839
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,120
You can't say you love me.

840
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,280
You just wanted to beat your mom.

841
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,680
Maybe you were just using me.

842
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,320
That's not true. I really love you.

843
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,800
When I imagine my life,

844
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,720
you're there every step of the way.

845
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,160
From when you graduate
and I help you with work,

846
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,520
to coming here and living like a local.

847
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:47,760
-Hey, Venus. That dish is…
-Hey.

848
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,680
It's okay. I can eat this.

849
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:54,040
I'll try to adjust myself to Nop
like Saruj did.

850
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,080
What is that dish?

851
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,600
It looks weird.

852
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,320
It's a stir-fry with three stinky items.

853
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,880
Stink beans,

854
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,800
cha-om, and pickled garlic.

855
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:15,640
One more mouthful.

856
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,760
Hey, stop it, Venus.

857
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:21,600
It's okay. I'll prove to everyone

858
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,280
how hard I'm trying

859
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,200
to be a good wife for Nop.

860
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,240
I can see it now.

861
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:40,760
And it's really stinky.

862
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,360
I'm getting the smell.

863
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:51,320
Yes, and the smell is really strong.

864
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:55,600
There's a way for you to prove
your sincerity that doesn't stink.

865
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:00,240
Tell us what you like about Nop.

866
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:05,960
When Nop drinks a soft drink,

867
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,920
he can't control himself

868
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:08,880
and he burps…

869
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,080
at least three times.

870
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,000
Venus.

871
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,400
Is that his good point?

872
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,560
Well, I smile every time

873
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,800
he does that,

874
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,080
so it's considered a good point.
Am I right?

875
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:30,680
Stop it. Just eat your food.

876
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,680
-Look at you.
-Okay.

877
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,920
That's what I was talking about.

878
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,680
You're awesome, Venus.

879
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,680
There's a saying that goes,

880
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:53,560
"Love the person who loves you

881
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,760
more than you love them."

882
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,160
Make a smart choice, Nop.

883
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:15,320
So what exactly happened that night?

884
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,360
Venus.

885
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,800
Nop.

886
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,360
Hey.

887
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,120
Nop, what's wrong?

888
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,280
Nop, did you faint or are you sleeping?

889
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,240
Nop.

890
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:46,160
You just fell asleep.

891
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,520
And I fell asleep after you.

892
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:51,360
That's it. Nothing else happened.

893
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,320
What are you going to tell your mom?

894
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,400
I'll probably tell her the truth.

895
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,760
The university term has already started.

896
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:03,320
I wouldn't be able to catch up
with my studies if I went there.

897
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,480
But I'll have to accept punishment

898
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:08,960
from my parents.

899
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,040
By the way,

900
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,080
can you

901
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,880
forgive me?

902
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,920
Yes.

903
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:22,600
But if you lie to me again,
I'll break up with you.

904
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:27,000
Sure. I promise I won't lie to you again.

905
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,840
By the way,

906
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,920
you said you'd break up with me.

907
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,520
Does that mean

908
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:39,200
we are officially together?

909
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,120
You have a good heart.

910
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:51,960
You don't look down on others.

911
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,760
You don't get jealous.

912
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,120
You don't even get mad at anyone.

913
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,040
I feel comfortable around you.

914
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,160
If you want to spend your life with me…

915
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:07,880
I think

916
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:11,640
that I can do it.

917
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:26,280
In time, we can prove to them

918
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,240
that we love each other

919
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,880
and that we can be trusted.

920
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,880
Sure. I promise.

921
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:10,760
Cheewa,

922
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:12,800
you should put the nappy basket

923
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,160
in front of the bathroom.

924
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:15,200
It's more convenient.

925
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,360
After you're done bathing the little one,

926
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,640
you can get them dressed right away.

927
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,000
By the way, Cheewa,

928
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:25,720
did you keep the bills

929
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,680
for the clothes and blankets?

930
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,080
I'm thinking of changing them
for pink ones.

931
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:36,120
Didn't you tell me to buy blue

932
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,880
or neutral colors
so that they're suitable for both genders?

933
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,200
I heard that

934
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:44,880
if it's a girl,

935
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,600
the mom will look pretty

936
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:48,440
and have glowing skin.

937
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,960
She won't look shabby

938
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,520
even with severe morning sickness.

939
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,640
So I'm confident

940
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,960
that you're having a girl

941
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,240
because…

942
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,760
you're getting prettier every day.

943
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:23,600
Little one,

944
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,920
I'm sure you'll be pretty like your mom.

945
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:02,920
Whose car is that?

946
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:13,720
Dalad.

947
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,160
-Dalad.
-Yes?

948
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:31,680
Is that really your car?

949
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,160
Not really. It's a company car.

950
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,280
Did Nat buy it for you?

951
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:44,160
It comes with the job,
but I chose the latest model.

952
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,800
It was imported.

953
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:51,720
You had an opportunity to buy a car.
Why a sports car?

954
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,160
Once Cheewa gives birth,
where will you all sit?

955
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:04,040
Do you like the bag I bought for you?

956
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,280
Why did you buy it? It's a waste of money.

957
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,040
Now I have enough money

958
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:15,040
to buy many things for you.

959
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,360
This perfume

960
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,000
isn't available in Thailand yet.

961
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:29,800
I asked someone from France
to buy it for me.

962
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:31,720
Why don't you smell it?

963
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:36,200
What are you doing?

964
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:37,480
I should be asking you that.

965
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:40,160
Don't you know that
Cheewa is allergic to perfume?

966
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:48,680
You have a job and a salary now,

967
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:50,600
but you're buying useless stuff like this.

968
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:52,960
Hey, it's my money.

969
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:54,560
I can buy anything I want.

970
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,440
I don't want to meddle in this,

971
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:57,880
but I can't help it.

972
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,680
If you're going to boast that you're rich,

973
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,560
then please buy something
that's beneficial for Cheewa and her baby.

974
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,840
I can buy what I want for them.

975
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,320
It's none of your business,
so stay out of it.

976
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,400
If you

977
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:12,680
were taking care of her properly,

978
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,360
I wouldn't be getting involved.

979
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:17,040
I may not have been able
to take care of them before,

980
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:18,560
but I have the means now.

981
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:20,080
I can take care of them myself.

982
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,680
You ditched her before.

983
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,600
How do I know

984
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:26,400
-you won't ditch her again?
-Hey!

985
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,960
This is your last warning.

986
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:31,200
Leave my lover and baby alone already.

987
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,080
Dalad.

988
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:35,080
Let go of him.

989
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,360
He's my relative.

990
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:24,120
Let me come with you.

991
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,120
If there are drugs at the warehouse,

992
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:29,680
then it'll be dangerous.

993
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:33,000
I'll do anything for Poncheewa.

994
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:34,960
Tell me

995
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,240
that you also love me.

996
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,640
Catch them.

997
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:42,000
