1
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,160
I brought the owner
of a major construction company here.

2
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,560
Isn't that the woman in the photos?

3
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,520
Saruj's ex-girlfriend.

4
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,400
I'll give you 500.

5
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,440
What's the job?

6
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,040
Don't let that flame get reignited.

7
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,000
Is it appropriate for a married woman

8
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,000
to hold hands
with her ex-boyfriend in a private place?

9
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,440
Who are you?

10
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,440
I'm Cheewan, Madam Orn's servant.

11
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,800
Please let me renovate your house.

12
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,560
"For Cheewan."

13
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,520
For me?

14
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,160
Hey, Tamagotchi.

15
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,120
Thank you.

16
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,560
Tamagotchi.

17
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,560
As for the window frames,

18
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,400
try to match the original color.

19
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,200
- Sure.
- Also,

20
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,040
as for the cracked cornices,

21
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,720
- make sure to patch them up.
- Sure.

22
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,920
What are you doing here?

23
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,920
Come on,

24
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,920
why do you sound so angry, Stepmom?

25
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,280
My dad established this company,

26
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,680
so I came here to supervise my workers.

27
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,320
I can do that, can't I?

28
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,520
Damn, that's harsh.

29
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,880
I'm trying to build the company's profile.
Don't create trouble here.

30
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,160
Calm down.

31
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,520
I'm here to see Poncheewa and Cheewan.

32
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,000
We've been friends
since we were in Switzerland.

33
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,040
I came here to visit my friends.

34
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,600
Ms. Poncheewa and Ms. Cheewan

35
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,760
are at Madam Orn's house over there.
They won't come here today.

36
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,960
Well then, work hard.

37
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,000
And take good care of my company,

38
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,720
Stepmom.

39
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,520
- Hey.
- Yes, sir?

40
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,720
Lead the way.

41
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,880
- Yes.
- Don't just stand there.

42
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,240
Come on, it's hot out here.

43
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,560
Would you like some water first?

44
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,960
Put it down and lead the way.

45
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,960
Okay.

46
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,240
This way, please.

47
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,200
Let's go, Mod.

48
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,160
It's almost midday.
Why are you still in bed?

49
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,400
I have a headache. I feel a little dizzy.

50
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,040
I might sleep a little longer.

51
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,400
It's calling me again.

52
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,800
Where did you get the Tamagotchi from?

53
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,320
Mr. Saruj bought it for me.

54
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,400
I couldn't afford one.

55
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,560
Having this is like having a baby.

56
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,440
I have to give it water and food.

57
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,760
I also have to play with it.

58
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,040
It's like a baby?

59
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,560
It dies if I don't take care of it.

60
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,640
But it's getting fun now.

61
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,760
It's cute.

62
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,000
Look.

63
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,080
It's just a stupid toy.

64
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,520
What's fun about it?

65
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,880
Having a baby?

66
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:16,320
Cheewa, come to Siam tomorrow.
I've invited Mr. Saruj to come with us.

67
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,240
What are you going to do?

68
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,720
Well, we'll go there

69
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,080
to buy snacks, hair clips,
and some nice jeans.

70
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,760
Don't you like those things?

71
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,560
No, I'll pass. I want to stay at home.

72
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,320
You can't.
I already arranged it with Mr. Saruj.

73
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,640
You must come. Please come with me.

74
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,680
Cheewa.

75
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,920
Cheewan.

76
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,720
There's more to life
than going out to have fun.

77
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,560
Stop being childish and stop trying
to make me do this and that?

78
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,040
Are you scolding me?

79
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,320
Yes. You've been doing this
since we were in Switzerland.

80
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,800
Why is it always about Saruj?

81
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,960
If you like him,

82
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,560
then go to Siam with him.
Don't invite me along.

83
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,440
I want to stay here
and get some peace and quiet.

84
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,240
Don't say that I like him.

85
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,120
I don't like him.

86
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,120
So why do I have to come
with you two then?

87
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,720
It's good Poncheewa has moved here.

88
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,800
They'll get to talk to each other

89
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,320
and will fall in love one day.

90
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,200
And you,

91
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,600
don't give up just yet.

92
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,040
Well…

93
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,400
Ms. Poncheewa.

94
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,520
Mr. Natsarid is here to see you.

95
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,960
Nat?

96
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,680
Yes, he said he already paged you.

97
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,560
So it was he who paged me,

98
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,880
not…

99
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,200
Hey, Cheewa!

100
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,240
- What's wrong?
- Get her on the bed.

101
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,400
Jon.

102
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,280
Venus is into royal Thai cuisine
right now.

103
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,840
She has learned fruit carving.

104
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,760
I remembered that

105
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,760
Jutathep Palace is well-known for this.

106
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,720
Here you go.

107
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,600
When my daughter gets into something,

108
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,440
she really works hard at it.

109
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:49,080
Last week, she only learned
how to carve a leaf.

110
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,280
That was all she could do
because you have to make it very detailed

111
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,280
to make it neat and exquisite
like they do in the palace.

112
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,080
That's why she could only finish
a small leaf.

113
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,040
What?

114
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,800
That's not just a leaf.

115
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,960
It's a whole garden.

116
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,280
That's right.

117
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,160
Hey.

118
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,560
Where did you get this from?

119
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,440
I paid someone to make it.
That's what money is for, isn't it?

120
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,840
Gosh, I just told him
that you carved it yourself.

121
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,680
Okay, sure.

122
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,440
Mr. Saruj, I carved this myself.

123
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,400
I see.

124
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,480
How much did you spend on this?

125
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,160
Only 10,000 baht.

126
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,200
- 10,000 baht?
- Only 10,000 baht.

127
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,400
Gosh, I feel light-headed.

128
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,520
No, it's okay.

129
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,680
I'll ask your dad to sell it
to someone at the ministry.

130
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,880
I'll be happy if I get 5,000 baht.

131
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,880
Wit.

132
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,920
- Yes, ma'am.
- You must be very careful

133
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,720
when you take it back.

134
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,320
Don't bump into anything.

135
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,040
You must be careful. Do you understand?

136
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,520
Repeat after me. 5,000.

137
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,080
- 5,000.
- 5,000.

138
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,960
Where is everyone?

139
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,120
What kind of palace is this?

140
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,600
Why aren't there any servants around

141
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,480
to escort me?

142
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,760
There you are.

143
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,400
I told you to get Poncheewa.

144
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,080
Where is she?

145
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,240
Well…

146
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,240
She's sick.

147
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,600
Why are you making such a fuss?

148
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,440
Stay out of this.

149
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,560
You keep coming between me and Cheewa.

150
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,240
She's not dating Mr. Saruj.

151
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,640
Yes, you lied through your teeth.

152
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,720
I had to run around trying to confirm it.

153
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,040
You filthy liar.

154
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,800
Poncheewa is sick.

155
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,640
I want to see her.

156
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,280
You can't do this. Cheewa is really sick.

157
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,520
She needs to rest.

158
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,760
- Move.
- Cheewan.

159
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,880
Wit.

160
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,560
Are you hurt?

161
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,600
No.

162
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,280
Put it over there. Hurry up.

163
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,280
You can't push women around like that.

164
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,440
Hey,

165
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,920
Nat treats men and women equally.

166
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,080
He doesn't care about that.

167
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,560
Do you want to try him?

168
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,720
Get your hands off him now.

169
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,160
Poncheewa and I are friends.

170
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm visiting my friend,

171
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,040
unlike you and Muslin.

172
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,320
What about me and Muslin?

173
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,080
Your ex-girlfriend

174
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,960
is renovating your house.

175
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,080
Do you think I don't know

176
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,840
what you two are up to?

177
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,680
You're having an affair
behind my dad's back.

178
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,280
I have no respect for you.

179
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,400
Nat, stop making wild accusations.

180
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,760
Stop right there.

181
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,040
I can confirm that.

182
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,520
I invited Mrs. Muslin here
to work on the house.

183
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,880
There's nothing going on between them.

184
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,480
Well, I guess it's time to talk
about something important.

185
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,280
Something important? What is it, Mom?

186
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,920
Please don't worry about Mr. Saruj,

187
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,480
because the person he's dating is…

188
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,360
Venus.

189
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,640
It's Venus.

190
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,560
- I don't believe you.
- I don't believe you.

191
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,920
What?

192
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,440
Do none of you believe me?

193
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,960
Please don't worry.

194
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,400
I won't report this to my dad yet.

195
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,360
Get together if you like.

196
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,200
Actually, it would be good.

197
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,400
It means he'll hurry up and divorce you.

198
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,280
Then I'll get my full share of the money.

199
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,120
We won't have you leeching off us anymore.

200
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,440
Nat.

201
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,160
I'm married to your dad,
so show me some respect.

202
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,520
Respect?

203
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,400
My dad is with so many women.

204
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,440
Do I have to show respect
to every woman in the country?

205
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,280
You're a leech.

206
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,280
You live off others.

207
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,840
You're so shameless.

208
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,120
Gosh!

209
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,800
Mr. Saruj!

210
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,920
- Move it away.
- You punched him?

211
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,720
Goodness!

212
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,640
My gosh!

213
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,200
Dear me, there goes my 5,000 baht.

214
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,760
I'll deduct 10,000 baht

215
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,480
from your salary!

216
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,440
Leave him to me.

217
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,280
Nat, stop it. This is the Jutathep Palace.

218
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,040
Your dad may act like he's above everyone,
but you can't do that here.

219
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,560
If you don't stop,
your dad won't be able to help you.

220
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,800
Just leave.

221
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,520
I'll let you off today.

222
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,680
You can't stop me
from seeing Poncheewa though.

223
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,920
Mod.

224
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,880
Let's go.

225
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,200
I'm sorry for causing a scandal.

226
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,000
I won't come back here again.

227
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,760
As for the renovation,

228
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,960
I don't think I can do it anymore.

229
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,120
I understand.

230
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,320
Nava is running in the election.

231
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,640
People think I'm lucky

232
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,000
as I'll get to be the first lady.

233
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,600
But what you saw today

234
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,400
is the reality.

235
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,720
How was Natsarid raised?

236
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,280
He's so obnoxious. I don't get it.

237
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,920
He's an only child.

238
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,440
His dad spoils him.

239
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,800
He's looked down on me
since the day we met.

240
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,200
His dad cheats on me,

241
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,880
while he looks down on me.

242
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,200
This is it,

243
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,600
the marriage I've had to put up with.

244
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,760
It's so embarrassing.

245
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,560
People envy me.

246
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,080
But I feel so empty inside.

247
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,200
Neither of them treats me like a human.

248
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,120
They never have.

249
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,240
They're hugging.

250
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,000
Gosh.

251
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,000
I told you there'd be trouble one day.

252
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,920
Instead of being careful, they're hugging.

253
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,960
I know she's upset,
but she's someone else's wife.

254
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,080
I don't like this at all.

255
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,720
Hey.

256
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,840
Did Jon say that?

257
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,080
Did he punch him?

258
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,320
He fell on the carved fruit.

259
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,800
And Saruj started it?

260
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,880
Whoever Saruj punched
must have done something really bad.

261
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,760
It's Mr. Nava's son. I heard he's a thug.

262
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,680
But Saruj is a professional diplomat.
He's the most level-headed among us.

263
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,480
But if he went that far,

264
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,320
he must have lost it completely.

265
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,080
It must be over a woman

266
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,280
and Muslin is the only woman
he's ever loved.

267
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,080
You haven't turned the television on.

268
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,720
Well, we didn't try to turn it on.

269
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,600
It's broken. I'm fixing it now.

270
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,720
The results
of Great-Grandma Orn's blood test…

271
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,280
I've gone through them.

272
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,720
That's an electricity bill.

273
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,320
Oh, that's mine.

274
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,960
I wanted to talk about it,

275
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,560
not Great-Grandma Orn's blood test. Right?

276
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,720
That's right.

277
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,200
Well, we're talking about many things.

278
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,680
Great-Grandma Orn's blood test,

279
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,200
utility bills, water bills…

280
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,160
That's right. So what does it say?

281
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,320
I can't do this anymore. I want to know.

282
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,840
Tell us about it, Saruj.

283
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,400
Tell us about it, Saruj.

284
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,160
What happened? Tell us.

285
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,200
Yes.

286
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,840
I really lost it.

287
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,920
Natsarid is Mr. Nava's son.

288
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,600
Mr. Nava is our business partner

289
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,600
and he's a political ally of Mr. Danai,
my boss.

290
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,680
Jon told us that
he was completely out of order.

291
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,160
How are kids raised these days?

292
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,080
He used force with a woman.
That's unacceptable.

293
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,400
I understand why you got into a fight
with a brat like him,

294
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,360
but getting involved
with someone else's wife,

295
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,280
that's not right, Saruj.

296
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,880
I know that.

297
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,880
You're not over Muslin, are you?

298
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,880
What do you say?

299
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,480
I really hate your poker face.

300
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,400
I can't read what you're thinking
even though we grew up together.

301
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,080
Come on.

302
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,520
I know what I'm doing.

303
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,800
Let's just say
you don't need to worry about me.

304
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,400
I'll keep my cool.

305
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,320
Okay?

306
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,880
So are we going to Siam today?

307
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,640
Poncheewa is sick. We can't go anymore.

308
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,320
How about next Saturday?

309
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,280
Okay.

310
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,720
How is your Tamagotchi?

311
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,520
I want to see what it looks like.

312
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,400
I let it die. It's annoying.

313
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,200
I don't have anything to eat.

314
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,800
Are you cooking for Great-Grandma?

315
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,680
Yes.

316
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,040
Is there lon puu kem?

317
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,720
You cook it so well.

318
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,240
Don't be so greedy.

319
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,400
You shameless cockroach.

320
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,760
You really love talking to cockroaches.

321
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,480
By the way,

322
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,840
there are many documents I can't find
at my house.

323
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,000
Seeing as you arranged them,

324
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,120
can you help me go through them?

325
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,120
You're troublesome.

326
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,080
Why are you so troublesome?

327
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,280
Why are you messing around here?

328
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,160
This is not your place.

329
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,080
Go away!

330
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,800
Are you mad at me?

331
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,800
Why don't we just talk it out?

332
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,000
Jaew, Madam Orn's soup is done.

333
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,800
Let go of me.

334
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,560
It's hot.

335
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,240
Cheewan.

336
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,760
Cheewan.

337
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,440
Cheewan.

338
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,880
I told you Muslin and I are just friends.

339
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,480
Why don't you believe me?

340
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,200
You punched Nat in front of everyone
to stick up for Mrs. Muslin.

341
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,600
Her husband must have heard
about it by now.

342
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,880
I don't think I punched Nat
because of Muslin.

343
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,680
How can that be?
I saw it with my own eyes.

344
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,360
Whatever.

345
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,200
Why do you still deny it?
You were hugging her so tightly.

346
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,440
You're usually so level-headed.

347
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,160
What has got into you recently?

348
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,360
Let me be honest.

349
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,560
Poncheewa is much cuter than Mrs. Muslin.

350
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,360
Hold on.

351
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,360
What do you mean I was hugging her?

352
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,400
Were you spying on us again?

353
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,960
What did I tell you?

354
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,760
It's rude.

355
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,280
If you're innocent,
there's nothing to worry about?

356
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,720
So is it the hug
that you have a problem with?

357
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,200
No.

358
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,320
I've never had a problem with you.

359
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,920
But you're going to have
a problem with Nat

360
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,080
and his nasty dad, Mr. Nava.

361
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,680
If you're saying I can't hug someone else,

362
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,720
then…

363
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,880
What are you doing?

364
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,280
I gave you a hug.

365
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,520
That's right. Why did you hug me?

366
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,160
You can't do that.

367
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,680
I wanted to show you

368
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,520
how friends and family hug each other.

369
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,960
That's how I hugged Muslin.

370
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,920
Do you get it now?

371
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,520
Like family?

372
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,640
Like friends?

373
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,560
That's right.

374
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,120
If you still don't understand,

375
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,600
we can do it again.

376
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,120
No, please stop.

377
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,640
Please stop right there.

378
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,440
I understand now. I understand very well.

379
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,760
Don't do that to me again

380
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,960
or I'll kill you. My gosh.

381
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,840
- Hey, naughty boy.
- You bad boy.

382
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,080
I'm going to tell Mrs. Kratin about this.

383
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,400
About what?

384
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,600
About you and Cheewan.

385
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,280
Tell us everything.

386
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,880
What's wrong with you lot?

387
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,800
Should I put a fence around my house

388
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,240
so you can't stick your noses in?

389
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,320
Jon said, it's because
you care so much about Muslin

390
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,960
that you lost it.

391
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,480
Jon and the others are worried
that you still have feelings for Muslin.

392
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,200
Yes, but there's no way

393
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,680
you would just hug someone
who wasn't your girlfriend like that,

394
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,400
even if that person was Cheewan.

395
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,720
So is it Muslin or Cheewan?

396
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,560
Right,

397
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,760
Muslin or Cheewan?

398
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,440
Or both?

399
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,720
Muslin and Cheewan.

400
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,480
Answer us now.

401
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,080
Come on, stop smiling.

402
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,240
Spill the beans. Tell us.

403
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,200
Yesterday, Nat pushed Cheewan over.

404
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,960
I almost lost it then,

405
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,160
but I completely lost it
when he insulted Muslin.

406
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,840
I've been wondering all day

407
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,240
whether it was because of Muslin

408
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,160
or Cheewan.

409
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,000
And is it Muslin or Cheewan?

410
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,640
Listen. I'll make it simple for you.

411
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,880
You have hugged both of them, right?

412
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,120
When you hug the one you love,

413
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,880
warmth radiates from them.

414
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,280
It's not like when you hug someone else.

415
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,920
What's more,

416
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,880
no one else feels like that.

417
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,760
Whose hug is warmer,

418
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,240
Muslin's or Cheewan's?

419
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,280
Do you have your answer now?

420
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,520
Yes.

421
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,360
- Yes, what?
- Right.

422
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,440
Well, yes.

423
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,720
Gosh, just say it.

424
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,640
Aren't you going to tell us?

425
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,920
Are you going to say it?

426
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,080
- Tell us. Do it.
- Hey, it's me, Saruj.

427
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,520
- Tell us.
- Calm down, Chatklao.

428
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,120
You're not going to say it?
Why are you being so tight-lipped?

429
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,040
- Hey, hold on.
- You're not going to say it?

430
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,280
- Get him.
- Calm down.

431
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,520
Come here.

432
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,200
- Calm down.
- You won't tell us?

433
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,080
Where are you going?

434
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,960
Come here.

435
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,240
Saruj, we know

436
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,640
how lonely you are.

437
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,440
We worry about you.

438
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,200
That kind of warm light,

439
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,520
that kind of special hug,

440
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,000
we have gotten to know them already.

441
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,680
No matter how many women we hug,

442
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,240
it's just different
to hugging that special woman.

443
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,520
We have found that woman.

444
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,000
We're really worried about you.

445
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,680
We want you to get that kind of hug too.

446
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,200
The woman who makes you feel
a warm light around you.

447
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,800
You feel its warmth, right?

448
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,240
No matter who that woman is,

449
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,080
the four of us will stand by you.

450
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,200
We'll be rooting for you.

451
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,040
Cheewa.

452
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,400
- Yes?
- Can I hug you?

453
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,840
Hugging a friend

454
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,840
and family…

455
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,320
So why

456
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,400
is it different?

457
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,960
You're saying it's different.

458
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,160
Who did you hug?

459
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,920
Sometimes, a hug

460
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,400
can be confusing.

461
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,280
Muslin recalled her workers,

462
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,320
so the renovation is unfinished.

463
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,320
Yes, and the materials she bought
are still there.

464
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,280
Exactly.

465
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,600
Well…

466
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,720
I know a good contractor.

467
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,320
Let me contact my mom.

468
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,040
Okay, good.

469
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,280
Hey.

470
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,200
- Why did you cut in front of me?
- Are you okay?

471
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,720
- I'm fine.
- Ma'am, I'm here to fix up a house.

472
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,080
We have to unload all our stuff here,

473
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,520
so I have to park my car here.
Please understand us.

474
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,720
No. I have stuff too.

475
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,320
Whose house are you fixing up?

476
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,400
The house of a Mom.

477
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,840
This is a palace.
There are so many Moms here.

478
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,920
What is their name?

479
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,320
What is it again?

480
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,680
Who on earth hired someone like this?

481
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,360
What was that? "Someone like this"?

482
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,120
What do you mean by that?

483
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,440
I don't get it. Can you explain it?

484
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,360
My gosh, you're filthy.

485
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,320
- O siao, we o siao, see o siao
- O siao, we o siao, see o siao

486
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,400
- We sa-ai, we sa-o
- We sa-ai, we sa-o

487
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,880
- O…
- Gosh.

488
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,400
- O siao, we o siao, see o siao
- O siao, we o siao, see o siao

489
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,240
We sa-ai, we sa-o

490
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,720
We're going out today, right?

491
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,960
Poncheewa has a headache.
We can't go anymore.

492
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,520
We can go by ourselves.

493
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,080
We can buy toys,

494
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:17,560
hair clips, and clothes.

495
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,719
I'm busy.

496
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,280
Are you still mad at me?

497
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,880
Who is mad at you? I'm not.

498
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,960
If it's about Muslin, there's really
nothing going on between us.

499
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:39,920
I don't believe you.

500
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,880
She won't come here anymore.

501
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,639
She will.

502
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,520
If you're worried about me,

503
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,760
there's no need to be.

504
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,440
Who is worried about you?

505
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,560
If you're not worried,

506
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,760
you must be jealous.

507
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,080
Are you surprised

508
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,480
that I know what you're up to?

509
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,280
Over there. Look at them. Do you see them?

510
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,520
Deal with them.

511
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,920
You said you're here to build a house.

512
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,880
Whose house are you building?

513
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,320
Do you have a contract?

514
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,240
I don't need it.

515
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,760
I can remember it.

516
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,360
This is the correct address.

517
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,880
You can't trust them.

518
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,360
Get rid of them quick.
They'll steal stuff.

519
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,480
- Yes, ma'am.
- Come on,

520
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,120
please don't look down on us like this.

521
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,560
We look dirty like this

522
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,320
because we were working.

523
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,200
Yes, do you expect us to wear suits?

524
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,080
Why do you have to accuse us
of being thieves?

525
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,120
- You hurt me.
- Right.

526
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,040
With that mouth of yours,
should I just punch you?

527
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,040
- Hey.
- See that?

528
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,680
They're criminals. Be careful, dear.

529
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,440
- Jon, chase them out.
- Yes, ma'am?

530
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,560
Chase them out now. Do you hear me?

531
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,360
Yes, they're so scary.

532
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,840
- They look like a bunch of hoodlums.
- Yes.

533
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,640
Cheewan!

534
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,480
Cheewan, do you know them?

535
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,760
Yes.

536
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,480
I want to dance too.

537
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,800
- Come on.
- Come.

538
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,400
Excuse me.

539
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,520
I'm the person who accepted the work
for my dad.

540
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,440
I have proof.

541
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,040
It's on my pager.

542
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,520
This is who made the order.

543
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,640
Nop!

544
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:24,120
I've missed you so much.

545
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,600
Do they know each other?

546
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,600
How have you been?

547
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,840
Cheewan.

548
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,160
Mom, he's so hot.

549
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,520
Are they here to fix Mr. Saruj's house?

550
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,880
That's right.

551
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,280
This is Mr. Pana, my mom's friend.

552
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,720
This is Nop, Mr. Pana's son.

553
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,760
And that is his team,

554
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,760
Chid, Chom, and Chob.

555
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,000
Actually, my mom should be here too.

556
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,880
But…

557
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,000
I don't know where she is.

558
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,120
Who on earth did he hire?

559
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,120
Mr. Saruj is just in time. Mr. Saruj.

560
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,680
Hello, ma'am.

561
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,400
Hello.

562
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,880
Mr. Saruj, this isn't just any old house.

563
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,440
This is part of the Jutathep Palace.

564
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,600
You can't let a bunch of losers like that

565
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,680
near your house.

566
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,640
Hey.

567
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,320
Isn't that your wine, Mr. Saruj?

568
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,680
My gosh, you're already stealing things.

569
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,920
What do you mean?

570
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,280
You're right. I recognize it.

571
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,720
Why didn't you tell me
Mrs. Muslin had backed out?

572
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,400
I can recommend another contractor.

573
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,880
I think you should get rid of them first.

574
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,880
Send them away now.
To be honest, I don't trust them.

575
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,240
Please send them away.

576
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,960
Mom, try this.

577
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,680
No, you got it wrong.

578
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,800
It's not wine.

579
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,560
It is. I remember the bottle.
Give it to me.

580
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,280
She drank it.

581
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,440
She drank it all.

582
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,960
This isn't wine.

583
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,560
Who said it's wine?

584
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,840
It's called budu.

585
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,920
Is it sweet and fragrant?

586
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,280
Gosh, this is so satisfying.
You deserved that for accusing us.

587
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,960
I bet you're enjoying it.

588
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,600
You bastards.
Why did you put it in a wine bottle?

589
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,680
Gosh, it has a truckload of salt.

590
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,320
She's enjoying it.

591
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,920
She seems to like it.

592
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,040
- Gosh.
- She likes it.

593
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,360
Venus.

594
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,240
Why did you give it to me?

595
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,720
Is it not wine?

596
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,720
I thought it was, so I gave you some.

597
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,520
Don't worry about it, ma'am.

598
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,160
Petch referred them to me.

599
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,000
They've worked with JT Property before.

600
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,360
You can trust them.

601
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,360
- That's wine. A salty wine.
- Wine.

602
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,800
- Hey.
- Be careful.

603
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,280
That should be enough.

604
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,880
Mix it together.

605
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,680
This budu was made by those three.

606
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,960
Everyone in the province says
it's the best budu.

607
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,480
I told them to start selling it,

608
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,880
but what did you say again?

609
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,160
- Men must do manly work.
- Men must do manly work.

610
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,000
So now, no one gets to have it.

611
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,840
All right, pass it over.

612
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,120
Mr. Saruj, are you fine
with southern-style spicy rice salad?

613
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,520
- Yes.
- Yes.

614
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,840
- Give it a taste.
- Here you go, Venus.

615
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,000
Here you go.

616
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,840
Thank you.

617
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,080
Thank you.

618
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,880
Squeeze some lime on it before you eat.

619
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,280
Thank you.

620
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,200
Thank you.

621
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,160
Gosh, it's so good.

622
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,800
Hey, Cheewan.

623
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,720
Are you and Nop close?

624
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,360
Yes.

625
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,840
He's studying engineering
at Chulalongkorn University.

626
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,480
He's graduating next year.

627
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,800
My gosh, an engineering student
at Chulalongkorn University?

628
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,840
- That's cool.
- Very.

629
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:47,480
Cheewan and Nop have been close
since they were small.

630
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,680
Cheewan has three brothers,

631
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,680
but they didn't take her with them
to play football.

632
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,240
They left her at home.

633
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,440
Nop was just next door,

634
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,560
so he took pity on her

635
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,400
and came to hang out with her.

636
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,360
I promised Cheewan
that I'd be her big brother.

637
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,200
That's right.

638
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,880
So many brothers.

639
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,440
So they have been close since then.

640
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,480
Cheewan loves playing boys' games.

641
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,960
Shoot it.

642
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,200
- Gosh.
- Awesome.

643
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,080
My gosh!

644
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,760
Nop, you brat!

645
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,600
Why are you so naughty?

646
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,400
You broke my window. Do you see that?

647
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,680
Wait right there. I'm going to hit you!

648
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,480
- Let's run.
- Let's run.

649
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,000
Gosh, you brat.

650
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,440
Thank you.

651
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,520
By the way, Cheewan,

652
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,720
did you get my letters?

653
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,320
Yes.

654
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,120
I also got them in Switzerland,
but they took three weeks to arrive.

655
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,040
Gosh,

656
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,320
you two send letters to each other.

657
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,280
He sends one to me every month.
My parents also do.

658
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,240
But not my brothers,

659
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,760
Kid, Kong, Komson. They never sent me one.

660
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:45,280
And do you reply to Nop's letters?

661
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,160
Yes, whenever he sends me one.

662
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,080
I was too lazy to write a long letter,

663
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,280
so I only sent him postcards.

664
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,320
That's nice.

665
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,080
So what did you write on the postcards?

666
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,440
"I love and miss you."

667
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,640
- My gosh.
- Damn.

668
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,320
- Gosh.
- That's touching.

669
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,040
That's touching.

670
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,880
Why are you cheering?

671
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,480
I was too lazy to write a long letter.
I didn't know what to write.

672
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,200
I'm sorry, Nop,
for writing the same thing.

673
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:15,720
It's enough that you didn't forget me.

674
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,680
- Gosh.
- Damn.

675
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,760
Who did he learn this from?

676
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,040
He's so sweet.

677
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,560
He's like you.

678
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,560
That's smooth.

679
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,040
Well, Nop is like my brother,

680
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,400
unlike those three.

681
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:35,880
Hey, Nop. What's wrong with you today?
Your face has been flushed all day.

682
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,840
Are you flushed? Are you sick?

683
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,720
No.

684
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,960
His ears are also red.

685
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,920
That's true.

686
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,720
He doesn't blush like this
around other women.

687
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,000
- Really?
- It's only with Cheewan.

688
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,520
- Gosh.
- His hands are giving out.

689
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,960
Look at him.

690
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,680
But I thought you two
were more like brother and sister.

691
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,840
But she grew up to be a beauty
with boobs and a butt.

692
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,680
Chom, be more respectful
when you're talking about a woman.

693
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,200
But she doesn't want to be his sister.
She wants to be his wife.

694
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,880
They played outside back then,
but now they'll do it in bed.

695
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,440
That's what you call

696
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,360
a real heart-to-heart.

697
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,560
They'll bare more
than just their souls to each other.

698
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,080
Look at this, Mom. It's growing.

699
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,160
- Let me see.
- Do you see it?

700
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:40,520
- Look at this.
- You're right.

701
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,960
It's grown big.

702
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:47,200
But it's such an expensive toy.

703
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,960
Why did Mr. Saruj buy it for you?

704
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,680
I did some work for him

705
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,040
and you told them not to give me a salary

706
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:00,640
because I'm living here for free,

707
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,640
so he probably just wanted to repay me.

708
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:07,720
But I think you two must be close.

709
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,880
Who do you mean?

710
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,080
Me and Mr. Saruj?

711
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:17,560
Mr. Saruj is handsome.
Women fall head over heels for him.

712
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:21,640
You're also a woman.
How can you control your feelings?

713
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,800
Mom, I don't have feelings for him.

714
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,720
Your grandpa was a Mom Rajawongse,

715
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,160
but he gave up his title

716
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,440
and his old life in Bangkok

717
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,880
as he just wanted
to run a rubber plantation.

718
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,440
That's also how I grew up.

719
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,440
I understand.

720
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:54,040
Nobility like the Jutatheps

721
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,800
are held to a higher standard than others.

722
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,120
It sounds exhausting.

723
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:04,240
You just reminded me
of when I first came to the palace.

724
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,240
I was your age back then.

725
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,440
Greetings, dear.

726
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,960
This is Madam Orn,

727
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,200
the grandmother of the Jutatheps.

728
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,480
And these are M.R. Rachanon

729
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:32,920
and M.R. Ronnaphee.
You can regard them as your brothers.

730
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,800
- Kratin.
- My gosh.

731
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,120
That story never grows old.

732
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,160
You'd never been to the palace.

733
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,160
You'd never been to Bangkok,
come to think of it.

734
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,800
You must have been homesick.

735
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,360
That's right, and when the elders said

736
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,880
I had to marry M.R. Pavornruj,

737
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,080
I didn't even know what marriage was.

738
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:04,320
I wondered if he would be mean to me
like Maratee and Rumpa.

739
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,840
I didn't know any of that.

740
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,400
Do you believe it?
When I thought about it,

741
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,040
I considered jumping
out of a tree to kill myself.

742
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,160
But I was afraid of getting hurt.

743
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,280
Mom.

744
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:23,240
And when I met M.R. Pavornruj,

745
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,240
he was very handsome.

746
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:26,920
Kratin.

747
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,240
Just be yourself.

748
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,680
Don't change yourself for anyone,

749
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,200
including me.

750
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,480
They showed me how to carry out
household chores for you

751
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,880
as I'll be your wife…

752
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,960
I mean, I'll be

753
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:49,920
the wife of an ambassador in the future.

754
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,560
That's not necessary.

755
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,800
Let's just be friends for now.

756
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,080
Do you mean it?

757
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,440
Yes.

758
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,240
What was even more beautiful
than his appearance

759
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:05,800
was his kind and gentle heart.

760
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,720
But in the end, you insisted
on marrying Dad,

761
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:15,280
even though he was much poorer.

762
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,880
Money can buy happiness,

763
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,920
but not the happiness I wanted.

764
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,400
Your happiness is being
on the rubber plantation

765
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:29,240
in the South, surrounded by your family.

766
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,120
Don't get carried away
by the beautiful things and places

767
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,120
and forget to consider
whether you belong in that place or not.

768
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,680
We all have our own place.

769
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,600
Don't compare yourself to others.

770
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,560
You should be well aware of

771
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,560
where you belong.

772
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,560
That's true, Mom.
They have to attend social events,

773
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,040
speak English,

774
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:55,840
and live abroad like Princess Rasa.

775
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:57,720
I couldn't do that.

776
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,520
Right?

777
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:03,320
You wouldn't want to be
an ambassador's wife, would you?

778
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,800
Listen, dear.

779
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,640
Love means being free and being yourself.

780
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:15,440
Love shouldn't require so much effort.

781
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:22,840
Love shouldn't require so much effort?

782
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,520
Choose your lover carefully, dear.

783
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,840
Being with someone
of a higher status than yours is tiring

784
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,640
and in the end, it won't work out.

785
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,640
I care about you, Cheewan.

786
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,600
I couldn't bear to see you get hurt.

787
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:45,080
What status are you talking about?
There's no such thing.

788
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,440
Gosh.

789
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:09,640
Your kaeng tai pla haeng is the best.

790
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,160
Thank you, Madam Orn.

791
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,000
How long are you going to stay?

792
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,840
I'll be here for a while.

793
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,840
My sons have all graduated now

794
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,560
so they are helping out a lot.

795
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,560
Great. Bring Kavee along next time.

796
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,280
Mom.

797
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,960
Madam Orn.

798
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,640
My husband's name is Klaow

799
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,600
and I only have one husband.

800
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,760
Goodness.

801
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,480
Madam Orn.

802
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:44,160
You're right. Kavee was the name
of the hero in last night's drama.

803
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,080
He's so handsome.

804
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,040
- He's handsome.
- I'm really sorry.

805
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:53,840
My husband Klaow isn't fond of Bangkok.

806
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,480
He says it's cramped

807
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,440
and the air is polluted.

808
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:01,600
It's best to let him watch
over the rubber plantation. Right, dear?

809
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,760
- Yes.
- All right.

810
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,200
Send him my regards.

811
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,000
Sure.

812
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,960
Madam Orn.

813
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:17,160
How is it going matching up
Mr. Saruj and Poncheewa?

814
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,960
I'm worried he'll get back together
with his ex-girlfriend.

815
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:27,640
I couldn't bear to see a Jutathep man
involved with a married woman.

816
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,960
And how is Poncheewa?

817
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,160
I haven't seen her lately.

818
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,640
She just stays in her room.
She doesn't go anywhere.

819
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,080
I don't know what to do.

820
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:47,000
I have a plan to get them together.

821
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,400
Really? What's the plan?

822
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,880
But I need your help too, Madam Orn.

823
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,040
Really?

824
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,560
I have to oversee the renovation
of the house in Khao Yai?

825
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:09,760
Yes, take Mr. Pana to renovate that house.

826
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,160
Do I have to go there myself?

827
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,280
What?

828
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:15,280
I don't know what needs fixing.

829
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:18,520
I think we could send Mr. Pana's team

830
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,640
or a team from JT Property.

831
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,760
They should be able to help us with it.

832
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,560
Let's do this.

833
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,000
Think of it as taking me on a trip.

834
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,640
It has been so long
since I last went there.

835
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,600
I'll take Poncheewa

836
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,800
and Cheewan along.

837
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,160
Listen, let's go and breathe the sea air,

838
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,520
so we'll be happy.

839
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,920
- Madam Orn.
- Yes?

840
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,520
We're going to visit the house
in Khao Yai, not Hua Hin.

841
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:58,120
What? It's in Khao Yai, not Hua Hin?

842
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:01,560
It's the house in Khao Yai.

843
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:05,920
It's in the mountains, not by the beach.

844
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,360
All right.

845
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,960
Fine.

846
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,280
How about this Saturday?

847
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,840
Please take me.

848
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,760
Let's go to the beach in Khao Yai.

849
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,920
Shall we?

850
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,840
- Yes.
- Sure.

851
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,120
I'd rather stay home.

852
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,760
I want to do some music practice.

853
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,680
You should go.

854
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,800
No.

855
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,480
Look, Madam Orn has been asking after you,

856
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:49,240
saying she's not seen you
even though you stay in the same house.

857
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:52,960
Really?

858
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,120
Yes.

859
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,280
Let's go. It'll be fun.

860
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:00,680
If there's one, there must be two
Two plus two is four

861
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:04,080
If there's a glass, there must be a bowl
If there's a girl, there must be a boy

862
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,040
If it's new, it'll get old
If it's alcohol, it'll get you drunk

863
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,960
I always miss good stuff
I always get some bad stuff

864
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:20,520
- Here they come.
- They're here.

865
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,280
They're here.

866
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:26,680
Great-Grandma said
we would travel together. Is it this bus?

867
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,480
I think so.

868
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,920
Gosh, when I drive for you,

869
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,080
I normally get to listen to piano music
that is pleasant to my ears.

870
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,640
I'm not sure if my ears can take this.

871
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:39,960
You can't take it?

872
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,960
I don't think so.

873
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,160
Then don't come.

874
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,000
Madam Orn wants you to stay here anyway.

875
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,240
I don't have to go?

876
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,480
Well, you said it's too much for you.

877
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,920
I shouldn't have said that.

878
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:55,960
Yes, ma'am.

879
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,960
I don't think

880
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,680
Great-Grandma can take this bus.
It's not suitable for an elderly lady.

881
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,800
I'll drive her there.

882
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:12,800
But she asked you to wait on the bus.

883
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,080
She really likes this kind of atmosphere.

884
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:20,080
Let's get on the bus and go and get her.

885
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,960
Come on.
Things are getting fun on the bus.

886
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,680
Let's go, Mr. Saruj.

887
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:27,560
He's here, guys. Things are getting fun.

888
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,880
You can sit here, Mr. Saruj.

889
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,480
Hello, Saruj.

890
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,200
- Hello.
- Sure.

891
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,960
Press this, Nop.

892
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,280
No, press it like this.

893
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,160
I have changed my mind.

894
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:48,840
I'll drive there.

895
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,560
Mr. Saruj.

896
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,160
Hello.

897
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,680
Why don't you sit down?

898
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,240
Why do I have to do what you say?

899
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,200
It's Madam Orn's order.

900
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,440
Let's do this.

901
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,280
You sit with me

902
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,480
or I'm not going.

903
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:14,240
I'll sit with Poncheewa.

904
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,560
All right.

905
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,960
Chauffeur, let's hit the road.

906
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,000
Hold on!

907
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,320
What about Great-Grandma Orn?

908
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,280
Madam Orn?

909
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,320
Well…

910
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,840
Mr. Saruj.

911
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:34,240
Madam Orn just called me.

912
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:38,360
She said she has a bad headache,
so she's not coming with us anymore.

913
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:42,920
Does she have a headache?

914
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Yes.

915
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,560
Chauffeur, let's go now.

916
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,040
Gosh.

917
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,720
Madam Orn really does have a stomachache.

918
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,040
What?

919
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,720
But Mr. Pana told me she had a headache.

920
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,280
The headache is gone now

921
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:07,000
and now she has a stomachache.

922
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:10,560
Gosh, my stomach hurts so much.

923
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,280
Gosh.

924
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,360
Is she all right?

925
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:16,280
Did you tell Chat about this?

926
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,760
Well, she'll be fine, Mr. Saruj.

927
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:21,600
Please don't worry about her.
Please focus on your trip.

928
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,720
Goodness.

929
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,160
How will she be fine, Jaew?

930
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,520
She's crying so loudly.

931
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:27,840
Gosh, it hurts.

932
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,120
See?

933
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,440
She isn't crying anymore.
Please don't worry about her.

934
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:38,880
Hold on, Jaew.

935
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,240
Jaew.

936
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,000
Here's the plan.

937
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:53,080
You let Mr. Saruj supervise
the renovation of a house upcountry.

938
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,680
It can be anywhere,
but he has to go with Poncheewa.

939
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:56,920
I see.

940
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,440
But Mr. Saruj is very busy

941
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,560
and he'll never go alone with her.

942
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,760
Well, we'll all go.

943
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:10,440
After that, we'll pretend
something has happened

944
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,240
and leave them alone,

945
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:15,880
so Mr. Saruj will have a chance

946
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,440
to get close to Poncheewa.

947
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,720
How does this sound?

948
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:22,760
Very good.

949
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,840
You're awesome, Mom.

950
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,600
Why don't you dance with me?

951
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,160
Do you know the cha-cha-cha?

952
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,120
Will they make all this noise
all the way there?

953
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,200
Can't they tone it down?

954
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,760
Come on, they don't need to.

955
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:52,160
It's fun like this.

956
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,360
You only listen to soft piano music.

957
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,640
You must be bored.
Try something different.

958
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,360
Try this.

959
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,080
Hey, Cheewan.

960
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:06,400
It's your favorite snack.

961
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,760
Hey.

962
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,440
Boo.

963
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:15,880
Are you ready?

964
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:17,920
One, two, three.

965
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,040
One, two, three.

966
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:23,400
Here you go.

967
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,360
Poncheewa is very happy
to be going on a trip with you.

968
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,120
What did you say?

969
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,840
I said

970
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:40,080
Poncheewa is very happy
to be going on a trip with you.

971
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,360
What did you say?

972
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,800
Cheewa is very happy…

973
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,600
My gosh.

974
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,800
Did you kiss my cheek?

975
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:24,480
Can you drive better?

976
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:28,080
And you're being very noisy at the back.
I can't hear myself think.

977
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,640
- What did you say?
- You want it louder?

978
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,120
Let's go.

979
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,320
Are you having fun?

980
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,120
I'm not bored anymore.

981
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,080
I'm kind of enjoying myself.

982
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:30,920
All right, we're here.

983
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,480
- Let's get off.
- Let's go.

984
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,320
Cheewa.

985
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:38,160
- Let's get off.
- Do the cha-cha-cha as you get off.

986
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:39,960
We're here.

987
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,040
My gosh.

988
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:45,360
How are you, dear?

989
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,040
My gosh.

990
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:53,360
Gosh.

991
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,840
Isn't it beautiful?

992
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:58,720
This is perfect. It's so isolated.

993
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:01,000
You're screwed if you don't have
a car around here.

994
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,840
It's so beautiful.

995
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:08,600
Madam Orn had someone
to prepare food for us.

996
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,520
Why don't we get inside and eat?

997
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:11,840
Come on.

998
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,680
Great-Grandma isn't here with us,

999
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,640
so how will we know what needs fixing?

1000
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,760
There's no phone signal here either.

1001
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:20,920
Right.

1002
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:26,520
Please don't worry.
She's given me a list of what to do.

1003
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,200
It's the foyer,

1004
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:31,320
the windows, and the roof.

1005
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,600
- How about we look at the exterior?
- Sure.

1006
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,840
- Let's go.
- Sure.

1007
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,560
Let's go.

1008
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:51,000
Let's take a look inside, Cheewa.

1009
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:53,240
- Let's go.
- Go.

1010
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:56,720
It's so pleasant and cool.

1011
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:58,960
Listen.

1012
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:02,000
Follow the plan
and don't make any mistakes.

1013
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:03,320
- Sure.
- Sure.

1014
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:08,320
Madam Orn hasn't been here for years.

1015
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,560
Why does she suddenly want
to get it fixed up?

1016
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,520
I don't know.

1017
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:18,760
Cheewa, there's enough food in the fridge
to last until tomorrow.

1018
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:21,840
Aren't we leaving this evening?

1019
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,760
Yes, you're right.

1020
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:27,960
By the way, if you have nothing to do,

1021
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,160
there's a vineyard
where you can collect some grapes.

1022
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:33,200
It should be fun to take a walk
and collect them.

1023
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:36,680
Do you want to do that? Let's go.

1024
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:39,560
No, not right now.

1025
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:41,040
I'm just telling you, just in case.

1026
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:45,280
Also, the stars
are very beautiful at night.

1027
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:50,080
If you have to spend a night here,
you can enjoy them on the balcony.

1028
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:53,920
So long as you're here, I don't mind.

1029
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:56,840
But can I take a rest now?

1030
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:00,320
I feel a bit carsick.

1031
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,080
Sure. Why don't you

1032
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:05,120
go and lie down in that room?

1033
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,200
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1034
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:16,920
Take a rest.
I'll get drinks for the others.

1035
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:19,040
Okay.

1036
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:06,720
It's all done.

1037
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:17,280
According to the plans,

1038
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:20,520
this area is the foyer, Mr. Saruj.

1039
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:24,000
Madam Orn asked me to check for dampness.

1040
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,280
I think it must be caused by
a problem with

1041
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:29,560
either the windows
on the second floor or the roof.

1042
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,480
It must be because of the humidity.

1043
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:36,680
There might be termites.

1044
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:40,880
Okay.

1045
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:43,680
What? Is it okay for the house
to have termites?

1046
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,240
It should be fine. If we find termites,

1047
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:49,880
we'll have to strip away the ceilings

1048
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:52,480
to see how much damage they've done.

1049
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:10,840
Madam Orn informed me
about the dampness and some leaks.

1050
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,600
Based on the plan,

1051
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:15,520
it must be here.

1052
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,960
According to the plan, it's right here.

1053
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:22,560
Here.

1054
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,960
There are no pipes there.

1055
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:32,840
Why would water be leaking from here?

1056
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:34,960
I think there's only one way
we can check it.

1057
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:40,040
We have to open the ceiling
and see where it's coming from.

1058
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:41,000
Okay.

1059
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:43,200
I'll go get the guys
and bring some equipment

1060
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,880
so we can open the ceiling
and see where it's coming from.

1061
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:47,360
Thank you.

1062
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,520
Is it okay? Are things okay over there?

1063
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,760
Okay? Let's go.

1064
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:11,760
Guys, I'm bringing drinks for you.

1065
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:14,160
My gosh, help me!

1066
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,439
- I tripped! I hurt my leg!
- Goodness.

1067
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,640
I tripped! My leg hurts so much!

1068
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,080
Gosh, it hurts.

1069
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:22,319
Mrs. Kratin tripped.
She has a wound on her head.

1070
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:24,120
My gosh. She's also bleeding!

1071
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,000
I think she's losing her memory!

1072
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:29,399
I think I need to see a doctor.
I can't take this anymore.

1073
01:08:29,479 --> 01:08:31,439
This really hurts. Help.

1074
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:39,000
- Help! She's bleeding.
- It hurts so much.

1075
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:41,720
- She's running out of blood.
- Come here.

1076
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,080
It's all set.

1077
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:46,560
Are you okay?

1078
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:51,399
- Hey, Mom. I'll be right back.
- Great job, son.

1079
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,840
What are we waiting for? Get on the bus.

1080
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:57,359
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1081
01:08:57,439 --> 01:08:59,040
- She's bleeding!
- Help!

1082
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,520
- Help!
- Let's go to the hospital!

1083
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:10,479
Mr. Saruj.

1084
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:13,359
My mom tripped and injured her leg.

1085
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:16,479
We'll take her to the hospital.

1086
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:17,920
Hold on.

1087
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,240
Let me come with you.

1088
01:09:19,319 --> 01:09:20,760
There's no need.

1089
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:22,479
You wait here.

1090
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,560
Please take care of Poncheewa.

1091
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:27,600
Wait here with her. We'll be right back.

1092
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:31,760
Poncheewa is also in the house?

1093
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,520
- My gosh.
- Cheewa.

1094
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:58,800
How is Poncheewa?

1095
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,320
Can you run now?

1096
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:01,560
Is your leg better?

1097
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:02,880
My leg?

1098
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:05,800
Why can't we be like brother and sister?

1099
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:07,160
Mr. Saruj.

1100
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:11,280
You're the woman
who is making me, M.L. Saruj Jutathep,

1101
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:13,480
who has always been superior,
feel so inferior.

1102
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,440
I'm inferior to a kid
who hasn't graduated.

1103
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,040
Inferior to everyone.

1104
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,680
Please don't think that way again.

1105
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:21,640
You're not inferior to anyone.

1106
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:24,840
You work hard for our country,

1107
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:29,040
like what the Jutatheps do.

1108
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,040
You're flattering me now.

1109
01:10:56,280 --> 01:11:01,280
