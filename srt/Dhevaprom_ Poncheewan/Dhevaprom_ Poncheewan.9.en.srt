1
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,960
What brings you all the way here?

2
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,760
Are you really the baby's dad?

3
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,960
Is Saruj the child's dad?

4
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,160
Yes.

5
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,640
Then you must get married.

6
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,640
We must talk about this
as soon as possible.

7
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,640
You want me to be the intermediary
between Mr. Saruj and Poncheewa?

8
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,120
Do you really want me to marry Poncheewa?

9
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,400
Yes.

10
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,680
Do you think it's right
for two people to get married

11
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,640
out of responsibility

12
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,400
when they don't love each other?

13
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,960
Cheewan doesn't love me either.

14
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,920
-This hurts.
-There, there.

15
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,520
-It's okay.
-It's okay, Petch.

16
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,360
Why don't you ask your wives for love?

17
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,840
Why are you asking me for it?

18
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,640
Well…

19
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,360
Mr. Saruj.

20
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,680
Aren't you going to see Madam Orn?

21
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,600
She must be waiting for you.

22
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,200
Mr. Saruj.

23
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,520
Mr. Saruj.

24
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,960
You can't put off your wedding.

25
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,680
Mr. Saruj.

26
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,640
Mrs. Muslin called.
She said it was urgent.

27
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,280
She was crying.

28
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,440
What is it, Mus?

29
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,360
I'll be right there.

30
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,360
Mr. Nava did this.

31
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,279
Did he really do this to you?

32
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,120
What happened?

33
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,720
Nava.

34
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,160
How could you do this to me?

35
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,880
How could you?

36
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,560
Where are you going, you bitch?

37
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,440
-Where are you going?
-I said stop!

38
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,640
Where do you think you're going?
Do you think you can steal my husband?

39
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,160
Stop it.

40
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,920
-You shameless bitch!
-Stop.

41
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,160
-You shameless bitch!
-Stop it!

42
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,200
-Let go of me!
-Wait. Stop.

43
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,800
-I said stop.
-Stop. You're the one who should stop.

44
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,240
This is my house.

45
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,200
How could you bring her here?

46
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,640
-How could you do this to me, you bastard?
-Hey.

47
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,240
-Hey.
-You can't stop.

48
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,640
Stop making such a scene.

49
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,040
I married you and gave you everything.

50
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,480
What else do you want?

51
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,520
My mom doesn't care what I do.
Who are you to stop me?

52
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,120
What are you saying, you bastard?

53
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,400
How could you say that?

54
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,680
Stop it! It hurts!

55
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,560
Do you want to die?

56
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,440
This is attempted murder, Mus.

57
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,240
You must report him.

58
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,200
I already have.

59
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,560
I'm going to file for divorce
using all the evidence I have.

60
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,640
I won't let him hurt me like this anymore.

61
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,800
I have no one left.

62
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,640
No one.

63
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,800
You still have me.

64
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,880
No matter what,

65
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,880
I won't let anything happen to you.

66
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,400
Thank you.

67
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,320
It's fine now.

68
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,880
Muslin.

69
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,520
Nava.

70
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,520
You had a lawyer file for divorce
so you can be with your lover?

71
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,480
Watch your mouth.

72
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,400
I can sue you for defamation.

73
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,040
I'm going to sue you too.

74
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,160
Why are you hugging my wife like that?

75
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,120
-Well?
-She's just a small woman.

76
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,240
How could you do it to her?

77
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,000
Don't do it.

78
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,240
This is a hospital.

79
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,760
-Cheewan.
-Mrs. Mus, call a nurse.

80
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,640
-Cheewan.
-Pull yourself together.

81
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,640
You won't gain anything
by fighting with him.

82
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,160
They haven't divorced.

83
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,480
Come here.

84
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,600
I'll wait outside.

85
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,600
Mus, call me if you need anything.

86
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,880
-Come here.
-Why did you stop me?

87
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,640
This will already be a big story.

88
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,080
Mr. Nava will be in trouble.

89
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,600
Don't get into a fight with him now.

90
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,880
Also, we're in the hospital.

91
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,640
He won't do anything to Mrs. Mus.

92
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,560
And she's reported him to the police.

93
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,480
-Nurse.
-Yes?

94
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,400
Please stay with the patient.

95
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,080
The man in the room
is her husband who harmed her.

96
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,200
Sure, please don't worry.

97
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
How dare you?

98
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,160
-May I help you?
-Why did you hug him?

99
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,760
Mus is definitely serious this time.
She has evidence now.

100
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,400
She can definitely divorce him.
She just needs to wait.

101
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,080
Yes, Mrs. Mus will be single soon.

102
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,280
You can be with her
as you wish after that.

103
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,600
Calm down.

104
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,720
Calm down.

105
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,480
I can't take this anymore.

106
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,640
-Take this!
-Gosh, Cheewan.

107
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,800
Why did you do that? Gosh.

108
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,720
Hold on, Cheewan. Wait up.

109
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,559
Cheewan.

110
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,039
Cheewan.

111
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,840
You're so cruel, I could kill you.

112
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,280
Why are you so mad? What's wrong?

113
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,760
I should be asking you that.

114
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,280
Why are you so irresponsible
all of a sudden?

115
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,080
Poncheewa is your girlfriend

116
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,800
and she's having your baby.

117
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,200
You don't even care about her
as much as you care about Mrs. Mus.

118
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,040
You're right.

119
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,680
I totally forgot about that.

120
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,080
What's wrong with you?

121
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,840
How could you forget your baby?

122
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,400
You're just

123
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,960
good for nothing.

124
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,200
You're so mad.

125
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,520
Yes, I'm mad for Poncheewa's sake.

126
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,560
Mrs. Mus is getting divorced.
You must be dreaming of the future.

127
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,120
You're finally getting
your first and only love.

128
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,320
Is this for Poncheewa's sake?

129
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
Yes.

130
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,560
You're so thoughtless.

131
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,440
Another woman is having your baby.

132
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,960
You should care about her
even if you don't love her,

133
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,280
instead of doing this.

134
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,760
I'm so angry I'm burning.

135
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,640
SARUJ

136
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,120
Yes?

137
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,040
Is Poncheewa with you?

138
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,160
She's having cake with me.

139
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,800
Sure.

140
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,000
It's Saruj.

141
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,960
Poncheewa.

142
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,400
I'm with Muslin at the moment.

143
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,720
She's not feeling well,
so I'm looking after her.

144
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,600
Are you okay with this?

145
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,440
Yes, I'm okay.

146
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,360
What's wrong with Mrs. Mus?

147
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,280
She had a fight with Mr. Nava.

148
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,560
They're getting a divorce.

149
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,440
Gosh, this is serious.

150
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,400
I feel so sorry for her.

151
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,160
Please send her my regards.

152
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,280
Cheewan.

153
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,320
Poom bought me some cakes.
They're so good.

154
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,960
He also bought some for Saruj.
Don't forget to have them.

155
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,400
Hold on, Cheewa.

156
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,080
See?

157
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,560
She's not mad at me.

158
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,720
She's never cared about me.

159
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,840
You're the only one who ever has.

160
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,920
Everybody says you're not a womanizer,

161
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,360
but I think you're the worst.

162
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,120
You pretend to be softy with women
and they end up getting the wrong idea.

163
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,800
You say you think of them like a sister,

164
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,880
get close to them, and treat them nicely.

165
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,560
That's how you tricked Poncheewa.

166
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,360
Did she tell you that?

167
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,960
She didn't have to tell me.

168
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,600
You treat everyone this way, including--

169
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,400
Including who?

170
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,840
And what kind of treatment
do you consider gentle?

171
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,400
Like that?

172
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,920
Can you stop doing this to me?

173
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,360
I'll never give in to you
and end up getting ditched like Poncheewa.

174
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,520
I'm glad you know I'm coming on to you.

175
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,880
You're not pretending
you don't know anymore.

176
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,560
Denying me

177
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,120
and your own feelings…

178
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,680
Hey.

179
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,360
So you now know that we're in love.

180
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,360
Coming on to me?

181
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,600
In love?

182
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,480
Don't say that to me or I'll kill you--

183
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,760
Hold on.

184
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,120
Come here.

185
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,120
Where are you taking me now?

186
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,400
Just come with me.

187
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,600
I have no idea
what you were talking about.

188
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,920
-Come on.
-Let go of me.

189
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
-Let go of me.
-Come here.

190
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,960
M.R. Ruj.

191
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,800
Mrs. Rasa.

192
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,120
Come.

193
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,200
Hello, Dad. Hello, Mom.

194
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,280
I miss you so much.

195
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,800
We haven't seen you for months.

196
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,320
Come and sit down.

197
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,920
Okay.

198
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,400
Hello.

199
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,520
Hello. Why don't you sit on the chair?

200
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,640
I'm fine on the floor.

201
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,680
Just sit on the chair.

202
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,320
Yes, ma'am.

203
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,600
Cheewan.

204
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,880
Saruj talks about you a lot.

205
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,240
Thank you for helping me
take care of the house and Saruj.

206
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,960
Sure.

207
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,360
I thought you'd have gone to bed.

208
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,120
You've just got back. Aren't you tired?

209
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,520
I'm forcing myself

210
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,920
to reset my body clock,
but I'll go to bed soon.

211
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,640
Listen.

212
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,600
What exactly happened
between you and Poncheewa?

213
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,720
Don't tell me

214
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,880
that you're her child's dad.

215
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,200
I've heard so many different things,
I don't know what to think.

216
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,480
I'm not the biological dad.

217
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,360
What?

218
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,640
You're not the dad?

219
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,400
Then why did you say you were?

220
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,640
Right.

221
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,480
At the time, Lady Veena

222
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,440
seemed as if she was going
to bad-mouth Poncheewa to others.

223
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,680
I was mad, so I said that.

224
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,720
I wanted to stop her.

225
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,240
But will your lie stop the gossip?

226
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,240
I think it'll make things
more complicated.

227
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,240
Right.

228
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,560
I've already made the mistake.

229
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,200
So, what did Poncheewa say?

230
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,160
She doesn't want me to do this.

231
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,880
She's very strong.

232
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,960
It's fine.

233
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,200
Let's go one step at a time.

234
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,720
How are Kedsara and Chinnakorn?

235
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,480
They must be very stressed.

236
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,920
Yes.

237
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,480
We should find time to visit them.

238
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,320
Okay.

239
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,360
And how far through
your degree are you, Cheewan?

240
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,760
Cheewan.

241
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,160
Yes?

242
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,200
What did you ask me?

243
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,240
I asked how far along you are
with your studies.

244
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,160
I've enrolled at Ramkhamhaeng University,

245
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,200
in the Faculty of Humanities.

246
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,080
Don't do this.

247
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,520
You're such a liar.
You intentionally lied to me.

248
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,480
Was it fun to fool me like that?

249
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,040
Do you know how confused I've been
the last few days?

250
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,560
And you've been behaving
all weird with me.

251
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,560
You're driving me crazy. Do you know that?

252
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,160
Why are you smiling?

253
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,760
You drove me crazy before

254
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,320
and now I'm driving you crazy.

255
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,600
I can't help but feel satisfied.

256
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,080
Take this. What do you mean by satisfied?

257
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,680
People go crazy because they're in love.

258
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,600
I drive you crazy,
so it means you love me.

259
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,880
I'm so happy.

260
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,480
No, I don't love you.

261
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,200
I don't love you.

262
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,520
That's your problem,

263
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,440
but I love you.

264
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,440
I love you.

265
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,400
More importantly,

266
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,800
I don't love you like a sister.

267
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,960
Let go of me. I can't love you.

268
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,920
I can't love you.

269
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,240
Cheewa.

270
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,240
Cheewa, it's me, Cheewan.
Can you open the door?

271
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,960
What are you doing here?

272
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,440
What's wrong?

273
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,880
What happened?

274
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,960
-Cheewa, how could you do that to me?
-What?

275
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,560
How could you go behind my back like that?

276
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,240
Well, Saruj isn't just anyone.

277
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,760
He's your boyfriend.

278
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,320
Why did you say that? Don't say that.

279
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,960
-I'm going to pinch you hard.
-Okay.

280
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,840
Fine, I won't say it.

281
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,800
How do I know if it's love?

282
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,280
I've been thinking about this
for over a month already.

283
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,880
How do I know

284
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,960
if I just admire him…

285
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,080
if I'm getting carried away…

286
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,680
or if I love him

287
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,040
like a sister loves her brother.

288
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,720
Love isn't logical.

289
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,480
It happens without you realizing it.

290
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,720
More importantly,

291
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,320
it's hard to control.

292
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,760
Gosh.

293
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,280
It gives me a headache.

294
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,400
It's just a headache now,

295
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,400
but when you get to the painful stage,

296
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,840
it'll hurt a lot.

297
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,480
Are you still hurting?

298
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,000
Yes.

299
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,480
Sometimes, I'll just be walking around

300
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,360
and I'll suddenly feel…

301
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,680
a pain.

302
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,480
I suddenly feel hurt.

303
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,360
I can't do this.

304
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,040
Love is too scary for me.

305
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,760
I really can't do this.

306
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,480
Hold on. Where are you going?

307
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,360
I'm going to a province
not far from Bangkok.

308
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,640
Who are you going to meet?
Why can't you tell me?

309
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,360
I'm following your advice.

310
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,200
You were right.

311
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,280
My baby's dad should know what happened.

312
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,560
I get it now.

313
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,040
Get in the car. I'll take you.

314
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,720
Let's go.

315
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,880
Let's go.

316
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,440
Did you arrange to meet him?

317
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,520
Where is he?

318
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,560
I didn't make any arrangements.

319
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,640
What?

320
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,760
Are you going to spy on him?

321
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,760
So, where is the dad?

322
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,080
I don't see him.

323
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,680
He's probably not here today.

324
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,080
What do you mean?

325
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,760
I heard that he came back
from Switzerland a while ago,

326
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,920
but we haven't been in contact at all.

327
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,960
Last week, a friend told me
that he works here.

328
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,400
They're so cute.

329
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,440
Did you make them yourself?

330
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,440
It's good.

331
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,560
You were the inspiration

332
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,240
for this chocolate recipe.

333
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,840
Excuse me.

334
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,200
Hello.

335
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,080
These chocolates…

336
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,280
This is our new recipe.

337
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,560
We just launched it two weeks ago.

338
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,840
Is the chef here?

339
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,320
Can I see him?

340
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,240
He's just a temporary employee.

341
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,560
He's off work right now.

342
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,760
Why don't you leave him
a message or your number?

343
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,760
He was one of the Thai students there.

344
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,320
We weren't close at first.

345
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,000
But one day,

346
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,520
something happened.

347
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,360
Let go of me.

348
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,360
No one can hear you.

349
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,120
Come here, Cheewa.

350
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,600
Leave us alone.

351
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,200
Dalad.

352
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,840
Thank you so much for saving me.

353
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,440
My life would be over
if it weren't for you.

354
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,680
I got suspicious when I saw Nat's car.

355
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,840
Did you know Nat was going to do that?

356
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,080
I knew he would do something like that.

357
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,640
You're naive, so you're careless.

358
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,600
You always study alone on campus

359
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,360
until late at night.

360
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,160
How did you know I was studying?

361
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,440
Well, I was following you.

362
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,960
Following me?

363
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,600
Yes.

364
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,760
Well…

365
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,040
I sleep in the cafe.

366
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,680
I didn't know what to do

367
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,920
when it was closed,
so I secretly followed you.

368
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,800
It's the only happiness in my life.

369
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,520
What?

370
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,560
Well…

371
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,800
I like you.

372
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,520
We became close after that.

373
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,480
I could never tell how he would be.

374
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,960
Sometimes, he was quiet.

375
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,760
Sometimes, he was romantic.

376
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,600
But he was very good to me.

377
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,280
After he got off work,

378
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,720
he'd walk me back to my apartment.

379
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,000
My lonely life,

380
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,360
where all l I did was study,

381
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,440
became brighter because of him.

382
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,720
We only dated for a month.

383
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,960
Then he suddenly disappeared.

384
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,640
You didn't fight or fall out?

385
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,880
Not at all.

386
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,000
I looked for him everywhere.

387
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,400
I called him,

388
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,200
but he wouldn't answer my calls.

389
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,400
I sent him emails and letters.

390
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,960
DALAD, WHERE ARE YOU?

391
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,240
I left a message at his house,

392
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,920
but he didn't reply.

393
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,080
He must have had a reason for doing that.

394
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,360
He didn't.

395
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,000
He just disappeared.

396
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,840
Maybe he got bored of me

397
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,840
or just didn't love me anymore.

398
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,440
Just as I was getting over him,

399
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,880
I found out that I was pregnant.

400
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,600
You came back to Thailand

401
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,600
and didn't contact him,
so he might not know about this.

402
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,840
Why would I tell him?

403
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,120
Disappearing like that

404
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,400
clearly indicates
that he wanted to break up with me.

405
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,000
All of this

406
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,600
is my fault.

407
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,760
I was too easy.

408
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,400
I only knew him for a few months.

409
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,000
I shouldn't have given in to him.

410
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,120
People may think I'm perfect,

411
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,880
but I'm just a boring woman.

412
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,280
Crying over a guy who doesn't value you

413
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,680
is a waste of your tears.

414
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,600
I'll give him a month.

415
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,080
If he doesn't contact me,

416
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,000
then it's over between us.

417
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,240
I'll move on for good.

418
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,360
Here you go.

419
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:12,120
I could never cook enough golek chicken
when you were kids.

420
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,080
You all loved it
and you had such big appetites.

421
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,400
Dig in.

422
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,840
What a feast.

423
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,000
Can we eat now?

424
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,520
Of course, go ahead.

425
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,760
Can I take some home too?

426
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,040
I have a son now. I think he'll like it.

427
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,720
I've prepared some for you.

428
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,080
-You should eat.
-Thank you.

429
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,320
Here is the sticky rice.
Have you all got some?

430
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,200
By the way, I called you here today

431
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,840
because I wanted to talk to you
about Mr. Saruj and Poncheewa.

432
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,280
Madam Orn wants them to get married
as soon as possible,

433
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,880
-but--
-Do you know, Jiem, my housemaid?

434
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,040
Jiem. Is she the large lady?

435
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,440
Well, yesterday, she had a big fight
with her daughter-in-law.

436
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,960
-What?
-She doesn't like her.

437
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,440
She can't accept her,

438
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,400
so she got in between her son
and the daughter-in-law.

439
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,960
Her daughter-in-law then fought back.

440
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,080
They insulted and pointed fingers
at each other.

441
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,440
"Stay out of it! Leave us alone."

442
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,120
That's what
her daughter-in-law said to her.

443
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,240
"You'll go to hell

444
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,360
for obstructing somebody else's love."

445
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,440
That's what I heard.

446
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,040
"You evil bitch."

447
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,280
"It's none of your business."

448
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,920
Don't eat my food then, you bastards!

449
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,840
I'm sorry. I got carried away.

450
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,760
Why don't you continue eating?

451
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,080
Enjoy it.

452
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:44,080
Weren't we talking
about Saruj and Poncheewa?

453
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,080
I don't think they want to get married.

454
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,760
I think we should stay out of it.

455
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,520
Saruj loves someone else.

456
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,400
Do you want to know who that person is?

457
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,440
I think I know who it is.

458
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,640
You can stop people
from doing a lot of things,

459
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,200
but you can't stop them
from falling in love.

460
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,320
Why can't I stop them,

461
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,520
if it's for the best?

462
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,640
Why would you support this
when they're so different?

463
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,200
They're people, not objects.

464
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,440
They can adapt.

465
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,720
This is what we call

466
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,520
the power of love.

467
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,440
But won't it be
painful and tiring for them?

468
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,480
Isn't making a living also tiring?

469
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,480
Yes.

470
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,640
Everything in this world has a cost.

471
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,600
You must try hard and persevere.

472
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,880
You fight to get what you want.

473
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,600
That's what makes it valuable.

474
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,440
But why would you bother
if there are so many other choices?

475
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,480
But they must choose for themselves,

476
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,880
not their parents.

477
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,480
Parents tend to make choices
based on their own thoughts,

478
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,280
beliefs, and past,

479
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,120
which are different from their children's.

480
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,800
Hey, Petch. Let's eat.

481
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,880
-Okay.
-It's good.

482
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,239
-Eat.
-Gosh.

483
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,679
-Gosh.
-Here.

484
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,800
-Sure, take it.
-This is the biggest one.

485
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,320
That one.

486
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,840
-Two pieces? Thanks a lot.
-Take two pieces.

487
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,159
Do you want some cucumber?

488
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,360
Did you leave any for me?

489
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,480
You can have this.

490
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,360
Poom.

491
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,480
What brings you here?

492
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,040
I came to see you.

493
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,520
Are you going out?

494
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,320
Yes.

495
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,840
Did the dad contact you?

496
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,800
Yes.

497
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,600
Get in my car.

498
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,720
It's okay.
I asked someone to call me a taxi.

499
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,960
Really? In that case, I'll come with you.

500
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,440
Poom, I want to go alone.

501
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,000
Is that what you want?

502
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,480
But I think…

503
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,760
Poom.

504
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,040
This is between me and him.

505
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,840
Please do this for me.

506
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,080
I want to handle this by myself.

507
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,160
Okay.

508
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,360
The taxi is here.

509
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,760
I'll get going.

510
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,160
Even though you said that,

511
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,440
I can't help

512
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,600
but worry about you.

513
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,480
I'm so happy to see you.

514
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,360
Didn't Cheewan come with you?

515
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,720
So how have you been?

516
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,120
Not bad.

517
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,200
What about the others?

518
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,320
They're fine. Cheewan enrolled
at Ramkhamhaeng University.

519
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,760
We came back to Thailand
a few months after you.

520
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,840
Our mom called us back because there was
a problem with our family's land.

521
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,040
And how have you been?

522
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,560
We're as poor as always.

523
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,760
We had to work to get by in Switzerland

524
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,560
and now we're doing the exact same thing.

525
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,960
We have debt.

526
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,920
Our mom took a loan out on our land.

527
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,520
We have to pay interest every day

528
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,360
and work just to make ends meet.

529
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,200
We don't know what the future holds.

530
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,080
I see.

531
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:41,480
Is that why you stopped contacting me?

532
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,920
What would you like to drink?

533
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,440
This one.

534
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,200
Sure.

535
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,880
If we didn't have
to buy ingredients for chocolate,

536
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,760
we wouldn't come to Bangkok.

537
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,760
So,

538
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,520
you didn't intend to come and see me.

539
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,160
You only had some business here,
so you dropped by to see me.

540
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,600
You seem strange today.

541
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,400
You seem moody.

542
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,120
You left a message for me to contact you,

543
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,880
so I did.

544
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,880
I'm so grateful for that.

545
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,920
Thank you so much for getting in touch.

546
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,440
Hold on.

547
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,760
What's up with you two?

548
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,680
Poncheewa?

549
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,640
Dalad?

550
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,280
Would you like to try our green tea cake?

551
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,440
Sure.

552
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,040
I wanted to see you

553
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,040
because I wanted to know
why you suddenly disappeared.

554
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,160
But let's forget it.

555
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,120
I know now

556
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,400
what I have to do with my life

557
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,800
and my baby.

558
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,160
-Baby?
-Baby?

559
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,400
What's this about?

560
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,920
What is she talking about?

561
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,840
Is it your baby?

562
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,800
This isn't true, is it?

563
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,960
Are you pregnant?

564
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,640
Hold on.

565
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,640
Are you sure

566
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,280
that it's my brother's baby?

567
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,840
So?

568
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,160
Tell your sister.

569
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,720
But

570
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,040
we were only together for a month.

571
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,640
Dalad, what have you done?

572
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,640
Can you give us some feedback on the cake?

573
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,120
It's a little rank.

574
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,320
Yes.

575
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,280
In that month,

576
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,040
I felt the happiest

577
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,760
and the saddest I've ever felt in my life.

578
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,120
But please don't worry.

579
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,440
I'm not here to ask you for anything.

580
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,600
I just wanted to clear things up,

581
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,280
so that everything is out in the open.

582
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,080
That's all.

583
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,000
What the hell have you done?

584
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,320
Cheewa.

585
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,000
Poom.

586
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,000
Well…

587
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,680
I didn't mean to follow you,

588
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,960
but I--

589
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,240
Poom.

590
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,000
It's okay.

591
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,480
I don't get it.

592
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,120
I think you know
what you have to do, right?

593
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,760
Yes, we'll do our best.

594
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,600
Please don't worry.

595
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,800
Very well. I'm counting on you.

596
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,320
-No worries.
-Sure.

597
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,840
Mr. Saruj called me here.

598
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,520
Am I in the right place?

599
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,800
Yes, you are.

600
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,800
He asked me to invite you here.

601
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,320
Just you.

602
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,600
This will make it five.

603
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,120
Five?

604
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,480
Five what?

605
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,600
Come here.

606
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,960
Come and take a seat.

607
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,160
Sit here.

608
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,000
-Hey.
-Why are you sitting like that?

609
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,200
-Well…
-Sit on the sofa.

610
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,040
All of you here

611
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,000
are Dhevaproms,

612
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,200
the hearts of the Jutatheps.

613
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:08,160
I feel like I'm sitting
amidst the five Dhevaprom angels.

614
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,840
Please don't compare me to them.

615
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,240
I don't deserve it.

616
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:18,320
Where are you going?
Come and sit here. Trust me.

617
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,120
Hey, Cheewan.

618
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:30,680
There's an important party
at the Jutathep Palace next Saturday

619
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:34,240
and the Jutatheps' in-laws will host it.

620
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:40,320
Do you want me to take care
of the food and beverages?

621
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,080
In that case, I don't need to be here.

622
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,960
I'll prepare some refreshments.

623
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,320
It's okay.

624
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,280
Someone has already taken care of it.

625
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,560
Just sit down.

626
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,360
Okay.

627
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,720
M.R. Pavornruj and I are hosting a party
for European ambassadors

628
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,080
to fundraise for our foundation

629
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,720
to build emergency housing
for needy children.

630
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,440
I'll take care of the ambassadors
who speak French.

631
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,360
I'll take care of the ambassadors
who speak English.

632
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,960
I'll coordinate with the foundation

633
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,560
to build emergency housing
in all provinces.

634
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,920
This is our goal.

635
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,560
We can do it.

636
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,800
I'll coordinate

637
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,920
with shops to display royal art.

638
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,400
There will be food, refreshments,
and souvenirs.

639
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:39,160
Now we just need someone to organize
the venue and the staff.

640
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,800
Can you help us with that, Cheewan?

641
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,440
Do you want me to do it alone?

642
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,640
I don't think I can do it.

643
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,920
Wouldn't it be better to ask my mom, Jaew,

644
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,520
or someone older to take care of it?

645
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,080
I'll help you, so don't worry.

646
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,600
In that case, please take the lead
and I will assist you.

647
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,960
I'll just be like Jon.

648
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,360
Saruj asked me

649
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,880
to show you how to oversee this job.

650
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,240
He also ordered us

651
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:23,160
to show you how to be an in-law.

652
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,240
No,

653
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,360
she meant we'll show you
how to organize an event.

654
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,080
Saruj did that to me.

655
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,240
Why doesn't he just kill me?

656
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,080
-Cheewan.
-Come on.

657
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,360
What's with him?

658
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,520
-Cheewan, don't do that.
-No, Cheewan.

659
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,720
Don't sulk, Cheewan.

660
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,760
Smile.

661
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,160
Why are you smiling like that?

662
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,400
Yes?

663
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,880
Why aren't you coming in?

664
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,560
You normally come right in, don't you?

665
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,400
About the party,

666
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,480
I'll just do whatever I can.

667
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,000
Once Mr. Danai's term ends,

668
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,160
I'll resume my position as an ambassador.

669
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,680
The guests who are coming

670
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,360
are important for my career.

671
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,720
Well, I said I'll do whatever I can.

672
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,000
Didn't you hear me?

673
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:05,280
I've already got you an outfit.

674
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,080
I picked it myself.

675
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,920
I've never done this for a woman before.

676
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,320
I bet you'll look beautiful.

677
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,960
I'm going to wear a maid's
or a waitress's uniform.

678
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,000
I'll wear what I want. I'll wear a sarong.

679
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,320
Don't put me in with the Jutatheps' wives.

680
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,720
I'm not the same.

681
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,720
I want to show you the dress.

682
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,040
You'll look great.

683
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:30,040
Gosh, you're not listening to me at all.

684
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,080
I'm going to Phuket this weekend.

685
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,440
Why don't you all come with me?

686
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,160
Actually, I've already arranged
accommodation for you.

687
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,920
The only thing I haven't done
is book the flight.

688
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,440
Let me book it
and get the tickets sent to you.

689
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:57,960
-Okay.
-Thank you, Mom.

690
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:05,160
But there's a reception for ambassadors
at the Jutathep Palace this Saturday.

691
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,880
Didn't Mrs. Rasa invite us all?

692
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,680
Let's go to Phuket. It'll be more fun.

693
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,760
Right?

694
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:19,960
-Yes.
-Yes.

695
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,480
You don't want me to show my belly
at the reception, do you?

696
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,080
In society,

697
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,080
there are both good

698
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,360
and bad people.

699
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:46,640
Sometimes, it's better to stay
out of the way with your loved ones.

700
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:56,520
If you like, I'll book the tickets.

701
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:02,040
But you don't have to pay for them.

702
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,600
You're a rich man.

703
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,880
You can't be stingy, Mr. Chinnakorn.

704
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,880
Of course, Mr. Chavit.

705
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,400
I'll take it out of your salary.

706
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,480
-Do you want that?
-Ploy.

707
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,600
-Help me.
-All right?

708
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,120
I don't know about this.

709
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,280
I'll leave it to you then, Ploy.

710
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,720
Thank you so much.

711
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,920
No worries.

712
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,040
It should be fun.
I haven't been to Phuket for so long.

713
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,360
How long do we have to hide from society?

714
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,840
We're hiding from both
society and reality.

715
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,920
Why do we have to act like we're ashamed?

716
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,560
How is it, Cheewan?

717
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,080
Gosh.

718
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,520
You look so pretty.

719
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,960
You look really pretty.

720
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,160
Really?

721
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,640
It's uncomfortable.

722
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,200
I can't really move easily.

723
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,160
But I think it really suits you.

724
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,560
It's like it was made for you.

725
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,320
You're exaggerating.

726
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,200
Gosh, you're so pretty.

727
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,720
I don't like it. I'm going to get changed.

728
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,200
Hey.

729
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,440
This is how you should dress

730
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,360
for the task I want you to do.

731
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,160
Come on.

732
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:42,760
It's itchy and suffocating.

733
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,680
It's awkward.

734
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,200
Please do her hair and makeup, Venus.

735
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,560
Make her pretty.

736
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,320
You can trust me.

737
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,960
Come here.

738
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,080
Gosh, you're so pretty.

739
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:02,160
But you'll be prettier
once I've done your makeup and hair.

740
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,600
I'll make you a princess.

741
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,240
Can I not do this?

742
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,720
No, you must.

743
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,560
Turn around. Oh my, you're so pretty.

744
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,040
Venus, I'm getting dizzy.

745
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,120
-I'm sorry.
-Are you teasing me?

746
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,960
No, take a look at yourself.

747
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,320
You're so pretty. Can you smile?

748
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,480
This is your job.

749
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,240
The French ambassador
is bringing his daughter along.

750
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,480
Gina has a pet.

751
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:31,400
She adores it
and takes it with her everywhere.

752
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,520
I need your help to take care of Gina.

753
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,880
Is it a dog or a cat?

754
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,800
I bet it's really cute.

755
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,040
Here is it.

756
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,680
My goodness.

757
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:42,920
What is that?

758
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,200
It's an iguana.

759
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,920
I see.

760
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:46,960
It's rather scary.

761
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,600
It's very scary.

762
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:55,920
I'm going to put some coconut milk
into the holes one by one.

763
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:02,440
A little on each one. Can you reach it?

764
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,320
Well done.

765
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,680
-You're so good.
-It'll be yummy.

766
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,440
Now, you put the lid on and wait.

767
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,320
While we wait,

768
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,960
do you want to make some baskets with me?

769
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,320
-Sure.
-Here you go.

770
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,360
Here. This is an example.

771
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,920
How's everything?

772
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:25,920
It's all good.

773
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,480
-All good?
-Yes.

774
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:29,640
Tell me if you need anything.

775
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,360
-Sure, Ms. Kwan.
-Okay.

776
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,400
-Look at her, Jaew.
-Yes?

777
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,640
Kwan is still young,
but she organized this event very well.

778
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,360
Yes.

779
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,200
And Mrs. Laorchan

780
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,560
is so pretty and elegant.

781
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,240
That's Noopook.

782
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,640
She seems very adept.

783
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,120
You're right.

784
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,200
Gosh.

785
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,640
Fah is coordinating with so many people.

786
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:14,560
I can't be compared to them.

787
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,920
You're also good.

788
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,600
I'm good at making this.

789
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,840
You're good with everything.

790
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,080
Here they come.

791
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,160
Everyone is looking at us.

792
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,040
They're acting like we're celebrities.

793
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,760
Smile, dear. Be confident.

794
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,280
Okay.

795
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:02,760
Hello, Mr. Chinnakorn and Mrs. Kedsara.

796
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,880
-Hello.
-Hello.

797
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,040
My gosh, Poncheewa.

798
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,440
You're wearing a maternity dress today.

799
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,360
It's very pretty.

800
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,440
Thank you.

801
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:17,280
What about the child's dad?
Is it Mr. Saruj?

802
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:21,680
Mom.

803
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,560
Don't let her get to you, Poncheewa.

804
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,760
Don't give in to her.

805
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:28,880
No, he's not.

806
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,520
Then who is it?

807
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,520
Mom.

808
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:33,640
What?

809
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:37,480
I've decided to raise the baby alone.

810
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:38,480
That's it.

811
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:39,960
Isn't she great?

812
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,280
Yes.

813
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:46,480
That means you can't continue
your studies then.

814
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:50,280
Mrs. Veena, once this child is born,

815
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:53,040
my husband and I will take care of them.

816
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,240
We're very lucky

817
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:58,160
to get a grandchild
while we're still young.

818
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:02,280
I'm telling you, I can't wait.

819
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,760
My business is doing well,

820
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:09,720
so I'm getting bored with life.

821
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:13,680
We've been wanting small children
running around our house.

822
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,720
I'm counting the days
until my grandchild is born.

823
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:21,640
And Cheewa has a plan
to continue her studies.

824
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,280
What are you going to study again?

825
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,080
Music, just like before.

826
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:29,320
I have a dream
of opening my own music school.

827
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,400
It has been my dream since I was young.

828
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,320
We'll help her

829
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,880
with the business and make sure
there are branches nationwide.

830
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,720
And I'm very confident that this child

831
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:45,280
will motivate and encourage their mom

832
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:49,080
and make her strong, Mrs. Veena.

833
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,800
Please don't forget to bring your kids

834
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,760
to study at her music school.

835
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:57,920
You're all invited.

836
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,280
Hi, Madam.

837
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,160
-Please excuse me.
-Okay.

838
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,640
-Bonjour.
-See you later, Cheewa.

839
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,960
Please excuse me. Goodbye.

840
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,560
We'll let you know
when the school is open.

841
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:12,160
What's wrong?

842
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,440
It's gone.

843
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:22,800
Jaew.

844
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:27,800
She's crying.

845
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:01,080
It's over there.

846
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,960
Don't worry. I'll take care of this.

847
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,880
Let's take a look.

848
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:33,800
Cheewan,

849
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,160
stop right there!

850
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,680
Cheewan!

851
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:37,680
Cheewan.

852
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,360
-My gosh.
-Goodness.

853
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,120
Where did she go?

854
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,920
-Hey.
-Oh my.

855
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,800
-Hey, Cheewan.
-Cheewan.

856
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,200
-Cheewan.
-My gosh.

857
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,720
-Stop right there, Cheewan.
-Cheewan.

858
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:00,920
Stop it, Cheewan!

859
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
-Cheewan.
-Be careful, Cheewan.

860
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:03,920
Cheewan!

861
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:07,680
Cheewan.

862
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,240
Hey.

863
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,320
Cheewan.

864
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,120
Cheewan, stop.

865
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,080
Cheewan, stop.

866
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:29,240
I got you.

867
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:37,320
My gosh.

868
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:39,160
-Cheewan!
-My goodness!

869
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,560
Cheewan.

870
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,360
-Cheewan, my dear.
-Cheewan.

871
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,400
-Cheewan.
-Cheewan.

872
00:59:58,880 --> 00:59:59,920
Cheewan.

873
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,480
Serves you right.

874
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:09,480
That's exactly what you deserve.

875
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,480
Cheewan.

876
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:17,880
Excuse me.

877
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,760
Saruj and everyone
is very worried about you,

878
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,920
so they asked me to check on you.

879
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,240
I see.

880
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:43,640
Come here. Let me help you.
Let me apply this for you.

881
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,640
Gosh,

882
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,320
you have so many wounds.

883
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:56,960
Does it hurt?

884
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,120
No.

885
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:05,280
As for the bruises,

886
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,400
Chatklao told me to put ice on them.

887
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:09,240
Wait a second.

888
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:21,200
This is nothing.

889
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,160
They'll be gone in a few days.

890
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,640
I had more when I was small.

891
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,120
Lady Veena.

892
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:39,840
Why don't you look at yourself
in the mirror?

893
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:44,320
How are you suitable
to be an ambassador's wife?

894
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:48,320
You can't compare to Princess Rasa.

895
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,560
If Mr. Saruj marries you,

896
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:55,680
you'd give Mr. Saruj and all the Jutatheps

897
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,080
a bad name.

898
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,000
All because of you.

899
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:54,720
-Where is she?
-There she is.

900
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:57,080
-Dad! Mom!
-Cheewan.

901
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,640
I miss you.

902
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:02,440
-I miss you so much.
-How was the trip? Are you tired?

903
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:03,680
Not at all.

904
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:06,280
-Come here.
-Dad.

905
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,680
-My daughter.
-Look at you two.

906
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:11,120
-My pretty girl.
-You're too much.

907
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,720
Listen. Kid, Kong, and Komson

908
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,960
are waiting for you at home.
They said they've really missed you.

909
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,560
What's wrong?

910
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:27,920
Nothing is wrong.

911
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,960
I'm going home tonight.

912
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:38,360
I'm attending the merit-making ceremony
for my ancestors.

913
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,280
I'll stay there for a month.

914
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:44,280
A month?

915
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,440
Okay.

916
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:50,840
It's up to you.

917
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,160
This is home.

918
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,600
This is where I belong.

919
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,840
This is my life.

920
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,120
Let's go home.

921
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,120
Your brothers have been waiting for you.

922
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:11,960
-Are you hungry?
-Yes.

923
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,720
-What's there for me to eat?
-Nothing.

924
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:16,360
-Really?
-I didn't buy anything for you.

925
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:19,240
-Why not? I don't come home often.
-I don't care about you.

926
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:21,320
I want to have rice noodles.

927
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,360
Hey, Kong.

928
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:28,120
-What is it?
-Where do you think Cheewan is?

929
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,880
She'll probably be here soon.

930
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,120
-Go on. Go inside.
-They're here.

931
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,280
Hey, let's greet her. She's here.

932
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:37,040
Why are you so clingy?

933
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,360
Kid.

934
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,440
-Hold on.
-I miss you.

935
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:44,280
What about me?

936
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:46,640
Don't be sad, Kong.

937
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:49,240
-Komson.
-I was waiting for you.

938
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:51,160
Gosh. Take it easy.

939
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,280
I miss all of you so much.

940
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,360
You're so pretty.

941
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,720
-Right?
-Of course.

942
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:03,720
Let's go.

943
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:07,520
Let's have some rice noodles,
visit a market, and go into the forest.

944
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,760
I want to do everything
we did when we were small.

945
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:12,320
Calm down.

946
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,080
Aren't you going to be here for a while?

947
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,120
There's plenty of time.

948
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:19,280
What happened?
You only came home a few months ago.

949
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,240
I felt uncomfortable there.

950
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,160
People in Bangkok
make me feel uncomfortable.

951
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,880
All right.
Rice noodles from your favorite shop.

952
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,360
Your mom bought some for you.

953
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:35,720
Mom.

954
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:39,600
-You're the best.
-Of course.

955
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:40,760
That's right.

956
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:44,080
We bought you
all your favorite childhood snacks.

957
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,400
Over there. Check it out.

958
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,280
-Check it out. There's a lot.
-Go on.

959
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:51,840
-It looks yummy.
-My gosh.

960
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:55,840
Do you like it?

961
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,240
Yes. It all looks amazing.

962
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,840
Gosh, Mom.

963
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:04,640
-I can't breathe now.
-Easy.

964
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:07,520
-You know exactly what I like.
-Of course.

965
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,920
There's no place like home.

966
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:21,480
Where are your wives?

967
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,920
They took some guy
to the rubber plantation.

968
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,560
They're crazy about him.
He's not even handsome.

969
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:30,200
He's skinny and weak.

970
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,640
I can't stand these guys from Bangkok.

971
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,160
Bangkok?

972
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,640
What? Do we have a visitor?

973
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:38,040
Well?

974
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,520
Do you like Southern food?

975
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,640
-Do you want to try some?
-I do.

976
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:52,040
-Really?
-And do you like Southern women

977
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:54,080
with sharp eyes and dark skin?

978
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,880
Do you want to try living here
for a few months?

979
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:02,040
Look at them being all flirty.

980
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:04,920
Look. Pla!

981
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,200
Don't be so slutty. Come here.

982
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:12,400
-Come here.
-This woman. Why are you so flirty?

983
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:14,280
I said come here.

984
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:19,160
Hello.

985
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:21,000
Hello.

986
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,640
Why didn't you tell us you were coming?

987
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,560
Is this M.R. Pavornruj's son?

988
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,320
You've grown up.

989
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,360
Yes.

990
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,640
I was happy for less than an hour

991
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,920
and now I feel suffocated again.

992
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
-Hey!
-Hey! Cheewan.

993
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,400
What's wrong?

994
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:44,160
I'm suffocating.

995
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,720
I flew here.

996
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,280
The flight was this morning.

997
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:49,440
Hey, you flirty bitch.

998
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,160
-Come here.
-Let's go home.

999
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:53,080
-Come here. Let's go home.
-Come home with me.

1000
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,960
-You're getting it.
-You're so inconsiderate.

1001
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:57,480
-Come here.
-Why did you go with him?

1002
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:59,120
-Go.
-Come here.

1003
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,800
No, you can't.

1004
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:26,399
Don't tell me he's courting Cheewan.

1005
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:27,640
I won't let him.

1006
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:30,600
I got it. Look.

1007
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:32,560
Nop.

1008
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:33,840
There's a fish there, Cheewan.

1009
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:35,359
You stupid fish.

1010
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:36,920
What?

1011
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:40,680
-Cheewan is engaged to Nop.
-Yes.

1012
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:43,399
Cheewan must be my daughter-in-law.

1013
01:08:43,479 --> 01:08:44,479
You thick-skinned lord.

1014
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:45,640
You old geezer.

1015
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:49,160
When she smiles or laughs,

1016
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:52,880
my boring life just lights up.

1017
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,720
You're the only one, Cheewan.

1018
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:56,720
No,

1019
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:59,680
you're exaggerating.

1020
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:01,120
She's my in-law.

1021
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,439
I can't let this happen.

1022
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,240
I only have one way left,

1023
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,120
which is to fight.

1024
01:09:32,359 --> 01:09:37,359
