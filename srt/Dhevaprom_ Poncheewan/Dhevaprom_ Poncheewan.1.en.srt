00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,520
BANGKOK

00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,240
SWITZERLAND

00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,120
1997

4
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,560
Love is the best thing in life.

5
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,920
You're the only single one now.

6
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,680
It's time to get a girlfriend.

7
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,120
Hey.

8
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,600
I think I saw someone following us.

9
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,160
I can't see them now.

10
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,800
Let's go.

11
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,880
Let's go.

12
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,960
- Hey, Cheewa. Look at the flowers.
- Yes.

13
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,680
- My gosh, they're beautiful.
- Yes.

14
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,760
The colors are so pretty.

15
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,720
- There should be more up ahead.
- Yes.

16
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,800
What is it, Cheewan?

17
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,680
It's nothing. Let's go.

18
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,400
Oh my gosh!

19
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,920
- Cheewa. Let's take some photos.
- Yes.

20
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,240
One, two, three.

21
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,040
Two, three.

22
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Stand here.

23
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,680
One, two.

24
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,680
- The hill was so steep.
- Right. I'm so sore.

25
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
Dara.

26
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,320
Dalad.

27
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,040
You've arrived.

28
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Yes, I hopped on the train
right after work.

29
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,240
I couldn't wait.

30
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,960
I worked hard to save up for this trip.

31
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,040
Cheewan, have something to eat.

32
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,960
Okay.

33
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,200
Do you want a sandwich?

34
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,240
How do you like it?

35
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,320
It's okay. Cheewan will prepare it for me.

36
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,280
Excuse me.

37
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,400
She has her own personal maid.

38
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,440
She doesn't need us.

39
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,440
Ms. Poncheewa is the daughter
of a gold shop owner.

40
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,800
She won't talk
to poor Thai students like us.

41
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,640
Hey, it's not like that.

42
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,320
She's just picky about food

43
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,200
and she isn't good at socializing.

44
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,720
Don't think too much.
You'll get to know her soon.

45
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,280
You're not like her, are you?

46
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,520
I'm just a poor, silly girl.

47
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,040
With my plain looks, I'm no match for her.

48
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,960
Who is it?

49
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,440
There's no one there.

50
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,000
I wonder who it was.

51
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,080
Why are they being so sneaky?

52
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,640
There's a story about this hotel.

53
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,280
A country girl

54
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,200
was sent to marry a rich man
who owned this hotel.

55
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,440
Are there such stories as this
in Europe too?

56
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,240
But then the rich man fell in love
with a high-class woman

57
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,640
and didn't marry the country girl.

58
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,320
The country girl was outraged

59
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,720
to be shunned by him.

60
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,760
She had an elder brother,

61
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,600
but he had passed away.

62
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,600
- What?
- What?

63
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
She believed her brother's spirit

64
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,080
protected her,

65
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,400
so she performed a voodoo ceremony

66
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,840
to summon his spirit.

67
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,000
So Westerners also do black magic.

68
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,640
- Was she able to summon him?
- Yes.

69
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,600
The brother then haunted
the rich man and his wife

70
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,600
until they could no longer handle it
and they died.

71
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,480
They say

72
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,360
the spirit is still

73
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,920
in the basement of this hotel!

74
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,560
Then one fine day,

75
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,960
someone saw the shadow of a man

76
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,600
and heard someone clearing his throat.

77
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,760
Stop it, Dalad.

78
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,840
What? It wasn't me.

79
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,880
What? Who was it then?

80
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,480
I don't know.

81
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,520
Hey, Venus, did you book us
into a haunted hotel?

82
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,920
- It's a ghost!
- My gosh, a ghost!

83
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,480
Cheewan!

84
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,160
Where are you? I can't see you.

85
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,560
Cheewan!

86
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,640
Cheewan!

87
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,240
It's a ghost!

88
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,960
- It's a ghost!
- A ghost?

89
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,240
- Enough!
- Enough!

90
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,880
Come on, I'm scared of ghosts.

91
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,040
Hold on, Mod.

92
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,960
What?

93
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,440
Why are you here?

94
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,320
Nat.

95
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,720
Let go of me.

96
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,720
Why are you so pretty?

97
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,000
Let go of me.

98
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,760
So it wasn't a ghost sneaking around,

99
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,080
it was you.

100
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,680
I just got here.

101
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,560
I came because I miss you so badly.

102
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,600
Let go of me, Nat.

103
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,520
Let go. Help!

104
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,480
Help!

105
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,520
- Get your hands off her!
- Gosh!

106
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,560
Dalad, how dare you punch me?

107
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,080
There are so many ways to woo a woman.

108
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,680
This isn't one of them.

109
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,800
Before you lecture me,

110
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,840
can you afford to pay your tuition fees?

111
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,040
You loser.

112
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,200
Hey.

113
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,280
Why are you talking to him like that?

114
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,920
Hey.

115
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,880
Hey.

116
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,440
I'll pay both of your tuition fees,

117
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,560
but you must bow down to me first.

118
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,080
Bow down to you?

119
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,040
- Hey.
- Dalad.

120
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,320
Nat.

121
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,440
Haven't you been paying Cheewan
to clean your house?

122
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,840
That's right.

123
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,040
She didn't have money to pay for her flat,

124
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,440
so she asked me to hire her. Right?

125
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,360
Yes, sir.

126
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,200
Cheewan has been to your place so often

127
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,280
that she has discovered
many secrets about you.

128
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,240
I wonder what those secrets are.

129
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,560
Those secrets?

130
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,840
One day, I was vacuuming the floor

131
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,800
and someone suddenly screamed
because he was scared of a creature.

132
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,240
What happened again?

133
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,440
Cheewan!

134
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,400
Gosh, I'm dying to say it.

135
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,000
Hey, do you want me to tell them
what you're scared of?

136
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,760
Stop right there.

137
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,360
Hold on.
Is there something Nat is scared of?

138
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,800
I've known him for ages
and I don't even know that.

139
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,520
What are you scared of?

140
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,760
Mod, do you want to get it?

141
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,760
I'm sorry.

142
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,560
If you don't want her to expose you,

143
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,000
then leave

144
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,360
and stop messing with me.

145
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,560
Okay?

146
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,840
Fine, I'll leave,

147
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,840
but I need to pay for my room first.

148
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,160
We still have time, Poncheewa.

149
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,120
Mod, let's go.

150
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,280
- Okay, but I still don't know what it is.
- Stop it.

151
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,280
Okay.

152
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,560
Are you staying here?

153
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,600
Who invited you?

154
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,880
Gosh, the power is finally back.

155
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,440
Let's go.

156
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,280
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

157
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,880
Let's go, Cheewa.

158
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,960
Okay.

159
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,880
By the way, what is he scared of?

160
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,840
Thank you for helping me.

161
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,800
Sure.

162
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,080
Nat is from a rich family.

163
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,640
If you had punched him,

164
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,960
life would be difficult for you here.

165
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,120
So? Are you saying I was thoughtless?

166
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,840
People like him
don't show their fear, ma'am.

167
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,640
I'm warning you.
There's no need to be sarcastic.

168
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,320
Anyway, thank you.

169
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,600
- Eleven.
- Eleven.

170
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,840
Hey, you're so fast.

171
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,760
All right.

172
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,920
- One, two, three, four,
- One, two, three, four,

173
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,520
- five, six, seven, eight,
- five, six, seven, eight,

174
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,200
- nine, ten, eleven.
- nine, ten, eleven.

175
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,880
- Are you buying it?
- One hundred.

176
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,880
My gosh.

177
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,320
Hold on.

178
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,040
Did any of you hear that?

179
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,360
I did.

180
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,640
Loud and clear.

181
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,360
Cheewa.

182
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,280
Do you want to join us?

183
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,120
No. I'm going to read a book.

184
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,040
That's what smart people do.

185
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,280
Hey, we're also smart.
We're doing some calculations here.

186
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,600
Let's continue.

187
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,280
- Shall we continue?
- Okay.

188
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,080
Hey.

189
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,480
Where is my purse?

190
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,160
Is your purse missing?

191
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,720
- Yes.
- Is it in the bag?

192
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,440
No, it's not here.

193
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,160
No.

194
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,120
Let me see.

195
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,680
There's nothing here.

196
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,800
It's not the ghost's doing.

197
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,520
Venus, come here.

198
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,040
On the count of three,

199
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,000
you open the door.

200
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,160
- Me?
- Yes.

201
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,240
Come on, open the door
on the count of three.

202
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,160
Okay.

203
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,200
One, two, three.

204
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,720
What is this?

205
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,960
- Let go of me.
- No.

206
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,000
It's me.

207
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,440
I'm your cousin.

208
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,960
Don't pretend to be the ghost's cousin.

209
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,280
You fooled us, you thief.

210
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,200
Give my friend's purse back.

211
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,000
- What purse?
- Where is it?

212
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,240
- Give it back.
- What are you doing?

213
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,200
What is this?

214
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,000
A flashlight.

215
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,640
Tell me it's a flashlight.

216
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,320
- My gosh.
- My gosh.

217
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,200
It must be a big one
because it's very dark here.

218
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,680
Go away, you brat.

219
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,640
Hey, I found my purse.

220
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,360
I found it.

221
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,200
It was under the table.

222
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,720
What?

223
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,120
What? But the thief…

224
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,040
Where did he go?

225
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,080
That was fast.

226
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,240
Who was he?

227
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,440
He was Thai.

228
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,440
So was that a person

229
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,160
or a ghost?

230
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,240
There's a letter for you from Thailand.

231
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,960
Thai people have very nice handwriting.

232
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,040
Thank you.

233
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,520
My dear Cheewan,

234
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,520
Saruj has assumed his duty

235
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,240
as the first secretary in that country.

236
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,400
He must have arrived by now.

237
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,560
Is Mr. Saruj working here?

238
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,520
All of his cousins have married.

239
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,200
I can't help but worry about him.

240
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,880
Having considered it, I think Poncheewa,

241
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,520
Kedsara's daughter,
is the most suitable for him.

242
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:14,079
Kedsara is like family to us Jutatheps.

243
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,599
If we can make a bond with her,

244
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,560
she'll really become our family.

245
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,359
If you love and respect me,

246
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,920
I hope you will do exactly as I say.

247
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,880
First.

248
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,160
Do everything you can

249
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,360
to make sure
Saruj falls in love with Poncheewa.

250
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,480
Second, don't tell anyone about this.

251
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,560
Make Mr. Saruj fall in love with Cheewa?

252
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,560
Mr. Saruj.

253
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,440
Poncheewa.

254
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,960
That would be a good match.

255
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,080
Now, I have something fun to do.

256
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,760
Leave this to me, Madam Orn.

257
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,840
Hey,

258
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,920
come here.

259
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,560
Here.

260
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,880
Daeng said they must be important Thai
customers as the embassy staff are coming.

261
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,640
They've booked out the whole restaurant

262
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,400
and they will pay you double.

263
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,680
- To do a traditional dance?
- Yes.

264
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,840
What kind of Thai dance?

265
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,360
Daeng said you could do what you like.

266
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,960
It's a birthday party.

267
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,240
Fine, I'll do it.

268
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,600
What about a costume?

269
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,000
It's being delivered.

270
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,280
- Let's go.
- Okay.

271
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,520
- Hey, let's make a toast to Nat.
- Come on.

272
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,320
Feel free to order more.

273
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,040
- Hey, you're here.
- Hey, Nat.

274
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,160
Nat.

275
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,200
Didn't anyone tell you
the whole restaurant is booked?

276
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,320
Someone is throwing a birthday party.

277
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,480
I'm that someone.

278
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,880
Today is my birthday.

279
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,480
Are you the one hiring me to dance?

280
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,680
That's right.

281
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,760
I want you to wish me a happy birthday,

282
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,400
so I'll feel like I'm in heaven with you.

283
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,440
It'll be tough today.

284
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,560
Let's get changed.

285
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,040
Guys, someone else is joining us today.

286
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,880
Please give a round of applause

287
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,040
to the new first secretary
of the Royal Thai Embassy,

288
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,160
M.L. Saruj Jutathep.

289
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,120
Clap your hands.

290
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,160
Hey.

291
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,040
You said he was handsome,

292
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,880
but you didn't say he was this handsome.

293
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,400
That's…

294
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,560
It's me.

295
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,720
Don't pretend to be the ghost's cousin.

296
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,640
Give my friend's purse back.

297
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,760
A flashlight.

298
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,360
Who invited him?

299
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,200
It's my duty, Mr. Natsarid.

300
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,840
I have a duty to take care
of Thai students here.

301
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,240
This is Venus, my daughter.

302
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,720
Hello.

303
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,840
I know who you are.

304
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,120
Dara.

305
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,280
Dalad.

306
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,440
Poncheewa.

307
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,520
Where's the other one?

308
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,000
Cheewan.

309
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,600
Do you remember Aunt Kratin's daughter?

310
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,520
Hello.

311
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,560
So how do you know us?

312
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,120
- The ghost!
- The ghost!

313
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,800
Did you follow us
to the mountain the other day?

314
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,200
That's the best way

315
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,920
to find out what you're up to.

316
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,600
So I can report
to your parents how you are.

317
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,480
You're still mad at me, aren't you?

318
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,360
I'm sorry
for kicking you and touching your…

319
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,840
I see. You don't want to talk about it.

320
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,760
Okay, I won't mention it.

321
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,800
I'm scared of you now.

322
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,400
Mr. Saruj,

323
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,080
Venus is taking a language course here.

324
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,640
She wants to study international relations
and be an ambassador.

325
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,840
No,

326
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,160
I just want to be somebody's wife.

327
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,280
She's a very good student.

328
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,000
You came here on a scholarship,
didn't you?

329
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,280
It's my grandpa's scholarship.

330
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,800
I mean my family's foundation.

331
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,200
I didn't have to compete for it.

332
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,200
Tomorrow is a holiday.

333
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,520
I'll pick you up
and show you around the city.

334
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:15,360
Do everything you can
to make Saruj fall in love with Poncheewa.

335
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,480
Mr. Saruj,

336
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:24,120
the most incredible show
you've ever seen is coming up.

337
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,920
Make sure you watch it.

338
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,000
She's so pretty.

339
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,320
No one can take their eyes off her.

340
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,400
Cheewa.

341
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,840
Cheewa.

342
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,600
Come and sit on my lap.
I'll give you a tip.

343
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,520
- Come on.
- Come here.

344
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,400
Don't be shy.

345
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,720
Do you see this?

346
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,680
I have all this for you.

347
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,560
I'll give you double,

348
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,560
but you must lay your head on my chest.

349
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,960
- Come here.
- Come on.

350
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,480
Come down here.

351
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,480
- Come and get your tip.
- Come on.

352
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,800
Come on. Here's my chest.

353
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,200
Thank you so much, Mr. Nat.

354
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,200
Let me give it to Cheewa.

355
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,280
Hey.

356
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,560
- Cheewa.
- Hey.

357
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,840
All right, let's move on to the next show.

358
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,000
Happy birthday, Mr. Nat.

359
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,520
Mr. Mod, will you join me onstage?

360
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,240
Yes, come up here.

361
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,720
- Come on.
- Go.

362
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,200
- Help me wish Mr. Nat a happy birthday.
- I can do it for you.

363
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,360
Please give
a round of applause for Mr. Mod.

364
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,240
This is your…

365
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,200
Head.

366
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,960
- Yes, and this?
- Shoulder.

367
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,240
- Yes.
- Butt.

368
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,760
Let's go again slowly.

369
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,280
Head, shoulder,

370
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,880
- butt.
- It's simple, right?

371
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,360
It's not too hard.

372
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,280
Well then, let's try it.

373
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,760
Head, shoulder, butt.

374
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,440
Head, shoulder, butt.

375
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,440
Head, shoulder, butt.

376
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,960
- Head, shoulder, head--
- There you go.

377
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,800
I've seen something like this before.

378
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,680
It's called slapstick. I love it.

379
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,200
I see.

380
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,800
- My goodness.
- Okay.

381
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,440
Touching a man's butt?

382
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,280
That's the end of the show.

383
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,560
Thank you.

384
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,400
What about me?

385
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,320
Thank you so much, Mr. Mod.
You can go now.

386
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,480
Gosh, I didn't get to touch her butt.

387
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,960
Please bring the birthday cake.

388
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,560
Happy birthday!

389
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,240
There we go.

390
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,640
You're taking Mr. Saruj out,

391
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,120
so don't say silly things
and scare him off, all right?

392
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,280
- Okay.
- Mr. Saruj.

393
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,240
Take him out for a meal
and listen to some music

394
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,080
somewhere romantic.

395
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,240
Don't take him anywhere weird
or he'll be shocked.

396
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,440
Yes, Mom.

397
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,160
I'm sorry.

398
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,160
It's fine.

399
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,680
You smell so good.

400
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,560
Next time, take him skiing at Jungfrau.

401
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,880
Are you avoiding them?

402
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,280
Come this way.

403
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,480
Follow me.

404
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,160
Is there an exit here?

405
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,080
Of course.

406
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,400
There.

407
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,760
A doghole.

408
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,800
Come on, Mr. Saruj.

409
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,560
Gosh.

410
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,640
I totally forgot

411
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,400
that you're a prince,

412
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,240
not a dog.

413
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,720
So who is the dog here?

414
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,280
It's me, of course.

415
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,480
Not even a little.

416
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,040
No sign of a smile at all.

417
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,920
Why did you come to see me?

418
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,160
I wanted to take you out.

419
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,840
If you're not mad at me anymore,
please come with me.

420
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,720
Take me out?

421
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,080
You just got here. We will…

422
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,640
I mean, Cheewa and I will show you around.

423
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,840
Let's go. Come on.

424
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,000
- Cheewa!
- My gosh!

425
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,160
Cheewan.

426
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,800
You scared the hell out of me.

427
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,240
Cheewan,

428
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,520
what have you been doing?

429
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,000
Look.

430
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,640
It's nothing. Let's go.

431
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,280
Saruj, hello.

432
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,240
Hello.

433
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,120
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

434
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,920
Mr. Saruj, let's go.

435
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,320
Let's go.

436
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,080
Mr. Saruj,

437
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,800
I want to look in this shop.

438
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,440
This shop called…

439
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,120
Ki…

440
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,920
Kirchhofer.

441
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,960
Yes, that's it. Let's go.

442
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,960
Let's go.

443
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,280
Thank you.

444
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,400
Come on.

445
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,400
I'll take a look
at the keychains over there.

446
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,800
I'll come with you.

447
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,680
No, you stay here.

448
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,720
Mr. Saruj, please take care of Poncheewa.

449
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,040
Sure.

450
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,600
Why aren't they talking?

451
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,280
Cheewa.

452
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,360
Yes?

453
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,400
Ask him about Switzerland.

454
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,520
Why don't you ask him yourself?

455
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,840
You ask him. Do it.

456
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,480
You studied in England before,

457
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,480
so you must have come here, right?

458
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,280
Yes.

459
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,760
Don't you have anything else to say?

460
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,720
This country is where my parents met
and fell in love.

461
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,600
Gosh.

462
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,000
Please tell us about it.

463
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,400
You must have heard about it.

464
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,040
It's a well-known Jutathep story.

465
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,120
Princess Wanrasa disguised herself
as a commoner

466
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,880
and fell in love with M.R. Pavornruj
during her visit.

467
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,760
Yes.

468
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,640
Is that it?

469
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,360
Aren't you going to ask him anything else?

470
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,840
Madam Orn,

471
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,240
they're like two peas in a pod.

472
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,440
Can two shy people get together?

473
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,640
I'm not sure about this at all.

474
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,840
I've never had a husband.

475
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,560
Oh dear.

476
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,640
- Cheewa.
- Yes?

477
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,160
Give this to Mr. Saruj.

478
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,400
Here you go, Saruj.

479
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,160
Thank you.

480
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,120
Have some coffee.

481
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,520
This is yours.

482
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,120
Thank you.

483
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,120
It looks great.

484
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,280
It's a chili paste
and dried shredded pork sandwich.

485
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,680
You prefer pork to fish, right?

486
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,000
How do you know that?

487
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,960
I was observing you
while I was serving the food.

488
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,440
I told Cheewa about it today,

489
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,520
so she made the sandwich for you.

490
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,200
What?

491
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,280
She made the sandwich.

492
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,320
I only made the coffee.

493
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,440
Hey.

494
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,000
You should marry a Thai woman

495
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,120
so she can cook Thai food for you.

496
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,600
You wouldn't like a foreigner.

497
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,000
You're not dating a foreigner, are you?

498
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,920
No.

499
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,960
That means you prefer Thai women, right?

500
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,400
Well…

501
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,000
See? He said yes!

502
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,720
- I didn't answer.
- He didn't answer.

503
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,440
My gosh.

504
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,360
You said it at the same time.

505
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,880
That's cute.

506
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:51,760
I heard that when this happens,
you should put your thumbs together…

507
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,320
and make a wish.

508
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,960
Your wishes will come true.

509
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,360
Where did you hear that?
I've never heard of it.

510
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,400
I came up with it just now.

511
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,880
What?

512
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,800
Can't I do that?

513
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,280
Do you want some coffee?

514
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,440
Yes.

515
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,560
That's it!

516
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,280
What are you doing?

517
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,040
What? What do you mean?

518
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:57,080
I asked what you were doing.

519
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,720
Cleaning my teeth.

520
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,840
Do high-class guys like you ever do this?

521
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,400
Like this.

522
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,640
My gosh.

523
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,760
Since you came here to study

524
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,720
and came to stay here with Cheewan,

525
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,680
I've been growing red roses.

526
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,200
I mean, do Thai people

527
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,880
know the meaning of a red rose?

528
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,920
Yes.

529
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,320
This is for you.

530
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,440
It's so pretty. Thank you so much.

531
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,720
Be careful, Simon.

532
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,960
Be careful.

533
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,400
Excuse me.

534
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,560
Cheewa.

535
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,080
Here is the rent.

536
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,520
I'm sorry for paying you late.

537
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,200
It's all right.

538
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,200
My gosh.

539
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,040
You gave her a rose.

540
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,960
Where's mine?

541
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,520
I only grew one,

542
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,480
so there's only one rose.

543
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,960
I see.

544
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,840
By the way, have you heard the news?

545
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,240
The new first secretary asked me
to book some accommodation for him.

546
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,640
He's going to take
the Thai students to Jungfraujoch.

547
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:40,080
Gosh, Saruj will take us on a trip.

548
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,880
- My gosh.
- That's awesome.

549
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,320
CHEEWAN

550
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,680
It's so pretty.

551
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,480
Hey, Cheewa.

552
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,840
- Are you okay?
- I'm good. I just tripped on something.

553
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,760
That's Mr. Saruj.

554
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,760
This is Poncheewa.

555
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,600
It's looking great.

556
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,760
What are you doing?

557
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,320
Well, it's nothing.

558
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,200
But…

559
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,640
they're cute, aren't they?

560
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:35,160
Poncheewa is a good girl
and a good student.

561
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:39,200
She's very prim and elegant.

562
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,480
If you'd consider her

563
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,920
to be your partner,

564
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,800
then I'd be very happy.

565
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,800
Although many Jutatheps

566
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:53,640
have married Dhevaproms,

567
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,600
I'd still like you

568
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,400
to marry Kedsara's daughter,

569
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:03,400
who is our beloved one.

570
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,240
I miss and love you.

571
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,080
Great-Grandma Orn.

572
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,240
Let's dance, Cheewa.

573
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,960
Do you have any information about tattoos?

574
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,680
Gang tattoos, that sort of thing.

575
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,640
Okay.

576
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:15,800
What are you doing?

577
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,640
What the hell are you doing? That hurts.

578
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,040
What's going on, Mr. Saruj?

579
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,720
He was putting drugs in the drink.

580
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,160
Has anyone drunk it?

581
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,880
Do you mean the punch?

582
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,360
All of us drank it.

583
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,360
Only the girls had it.
I was drinking beer.

584
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,920
What the hell are you talking about?

585
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,320
What drugs?

586
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
This is caramel sugar that I made.

587
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,160
Those foreigners are drug dealers.

588
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,560
I saw you got it from them.

589
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,640
You don't have any evidence,

590
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,760
but you're already accusing me.

591
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,400
I don't want anything from you,

592
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,360
but let me throw a punch at you.

593
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,240
- Hey!
- My gosh!

594
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,280
If I take you for a urine test,

595
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,560
do you think you'd pass it?

596
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:30,080
I'll let it go this time.

597
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,120
Make sure you leave me alone from now on.

598
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,200
Did you drink a lot?

599
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:48,000
No, I shared it with Simon and Dalad.

600
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,320
I had three glasses

601
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,000
because it was so good.

602
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,040
How are you feeling now?

603
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,600
I'm fine.

604
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,280
He was targeting Poncheewa.

605
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,120
But don't worry.

606
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,000
I won't sleep tonight.

607
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,040
You two take the bed.

608
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,600
Tell me right away

609
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,040
if you don't feel well.

610
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,760
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

611
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:11,720
It's fine.

612
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:13,960
You should go to bed.

613
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,600
By the way, Cheewan, Nat…

614
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,520
Are you already asleep?

615
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,080
That was quick.

616
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,920
You can't sleep?

617
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,360
No.

618
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,360
What are you reading?

619
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:23,360
Just sit down.

620
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,600
Are you feeling dizzy?

621
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,960
Tell me how you feel.

622
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,400
It's nothing. I'm fine.

623
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,400
I just tripped over the rug. I'm clumsy.

624
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,520
Are you sure you're okay?

625
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,560
Yes.

626
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,400
I've read that book.

627
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,800
Oh, right.

628
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,240
I forgot you're a bookworm.

629
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,520
There are many exciting parts.

630
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,160
The war got me thinking

631
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,240
that people's misguided beliefs
can cause the most pain and suffering.

632
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:09,280
You think deeply for someone so young.

633
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,520
Which part do you like?

634
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,120
I like the whole book.

635
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:22,640
When I was 13 like Anne Frank,
all I did was play with Lego.

636
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,680
Have you ever visited her house?

637
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:31,640
Yes.

638
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,080
- I really want to go there.
- Really?

639
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,040
- Yes.
- Sure.

640
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,920
I'll take you when I have the chance.

641
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,560
- Promise?
- Promise.

642
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,400
You're so kind to me.

643
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,640
Oh my gosh.

644
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:52,040
Madam Orn, they finally found
something in common.

645
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,080
There is hope for them.

646
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,000
Oh my, they'll make such a good couple.

647
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:02,960
I really hope Mr. Saruj will get
together with Poncheewa.

648
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:13,240
I have an announcement to make.

649
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:16,360
Cheewa got herself a boyfriend.

650
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,400
- Cheewan, I don't--
- Hey.

651
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,160
The guy is a distant relative.

652
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,880
He came to work here

653
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,320
in order to find his love.

654
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,560
And that man is

655
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:35,640
Mr. Saruj!

656
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,240
I won't lose to you.

657
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,800
Cheewan, wait up.

658
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:27,320
Why did you say that?
Saruj and I aren't together.

659
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,040
You should have asked me
before you said that.

660
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:37,600
I did think of asking you for advice.

661
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,840
Asking for advice means
you must ask me first,

662
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,720
but you're telling me this afterward.
It's called informing.

663
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,960
Poncheewa is a woman.
This might damage her reputation.

664
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,640
Natsarid seemed serious about Cheewa.

665
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,160
He's such a thug.

666
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:54,720
But he was stunned
when I said you were after Cheewa.

667
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,400
Did you do it to protect Poncheewa?

668
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,480
Yes.

669
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,040
I was killing two birds with one stone.

670
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,440
What stone?

671
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,640
What birds?

672
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,280
Listen, please don't take it seriously.

673
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:14,400
You're both single, aren't you?

674
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,840
Then this won't be a problem.

675
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,040
Just tell everyone this for now

676
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,960
and keep it a secret between us.

677
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,960
You could try dating if you like.

678
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:31,960
What?

679
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,120
- Hold on.
- Hey.

680
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,280
You don't have to date.

681
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,320
Let's just wait

682
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,400
until Nat stops pursuing Cheewa

683
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,160
and sets his sights on someone else.

684
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,560
After that, we can tell everyone
that you two have broken up.

685
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,240
Are you fine with this?

686
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:29,680
Dalad.

687
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,880
What are you doing here?

688
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,600
This is the university cafe.

689
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:35,480
I got a part-time job here.

690
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,600
I couldn't afford to study
at a university like this.

691
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,400
That's great. I can talk to you.

692
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:44,320
I'm the only Thai student here.

693
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,560
I'm a waiter.

694
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,600
I can't just sit and chat with a customer.

695
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,200
What can I get for you?

696
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,800
Hi, Dalad.

697
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,480
How is your first day at work?

698
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,960
It's okay.

699
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,800
- Cheewan, do you work here too?
- Yes?

700
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,320
They only wanted a guy,

701
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,160
so Dara and I have to stay
at the Thai restaurant.

702
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:06,760
I see.

703
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,640
How is it? Are you tired?

704
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:09,800
Just a bit.

705
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,720
Work hard.

706
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,160
Is Mr. Saruj here yet?

707
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,080
I got so many visitors today.

708
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,320
I'm usually alone here.

709
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,520
How could you be lonely?
You have a boyfriend, don't you?

710
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,600
Hey, are you really dating him?

711
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,280
I came here to find out about this.

712
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,920
Here he is. Poncheewa's boyfriend is here.

713
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:01,760
Come here.

714
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,840
Mr. Saruj.

715
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,840
Are you really dating Poncheewa?

716
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,000
Poncheewa.

717
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,000
I brought you some flowers.

718
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,480
Take them.

719
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:22,200
Gosh, the flowers are so pretty.

720
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,000
Why don't you take them?

721
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,840
You're asking for trouble.

722
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,840
You reported it to my dad

723
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:40,360
and he gave me an earful.

724
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,080
I called your dad and told him that

725
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:47,280
two of your friends were arrested
for drug possession.

726
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,160
Bob.

727
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,200
Did Bob get busted?

728
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,920
Is he the guy who visited us at Jungfrau?

729
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,560
All of Bob's friends have been arrested.

730
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,040
As for you two,

731
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:05,360
the police are keeping an eye on you.

732
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,240
If you start a fight,
they'll be all over you.

733
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,840
I suggest you two leave.

734
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,560
Let's go.

735
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:19,880
I'm not going. I want some coffee.

736
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:23,560
I just came here to see Poncheewa.
I'm not doing anything wrong.

737
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:34,680
Gosh, Nat hangs out with drug dealers.

738
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,680
Do you think he also takes drugs?

739
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,000
Of course he does.

740
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:03,960
Hey.

741
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:08,840
How dare you reject me
in front of other people like that?

742
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,040
Why are you still here?

743
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,400
I want to know what's so great
about that asshole Saruj?

744
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,440
Let me tell you something.

745
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:21,120
The Jutathep era is over.

746
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:25,720
Now, it's time for my dad
and our family to step up.

747
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:30,040
Don't you know that outsiders
aren't allowed in here? Get out.

748
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,200
You got together with him,
you can break up with him too.

749
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,480
I'll make sure you lose interest in Saruj.

750
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:45,400
Can we talk later?

751
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:47,000
Stop playing so hard to get.

752
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,400
Do you see that?

753
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,360
It's my new car.

754
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,600
Come for a ride with me.

755
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:53,960
No.

756
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:56,720
No!

757
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,920
No! Let go of me.

758
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:03,960
No one can hear you.

759
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:04,880
Cheewa.

760
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,440
Come here, Cheewa. Leave us alone.

761
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:24,080
Stop right now.

762
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,160
Move!

763
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:29,600
Do you think you're tough?

764
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:34,200
- Stop it, Nat!
- Move!

765
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,640
Dalad.

766
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,840
You're tough, aren't you?

767
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,440
You're tough, aren't you?

768
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,520
Do you want to help her?

769
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,240
Cheewa.

770
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:08,880
Cheewan,

771
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,760
why didn't you tell me you were coming?

772
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,760
I haven't seen you for a week. I miss you.

773
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,240
Wait a second.

774
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:19,680
Just wait outside.

775
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,400
Why?

776
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,040
Why can't I come in?

777
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:25,720
Is there someone in there?

778
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:29,280
No, I'm alone.

779
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,680
I thought you said
your roommate had gone home?

780
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:36,280
You must have a guest.

781
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,320
I knew it.

782
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,160
There are two glasses.

783
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:42,960
Well?

784
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:46,000
It's not that. It's just that I'm naked.

785
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,600
Come on, Cheewa.

786
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:52,000
We've seen each other naked
since we were kids. Don't be shy.

787
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:53,760
Let me come in. It's cold out here.

788
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:54,680
Cheewan.

789
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,760
Wait outside for a second.

790
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:59,160
Give me a second
and we can go and get some hot cocoa.

791
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:02,080
- Just a second.
- But it's cold…

792
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,280
Hello.

793
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,200
You two can get on the cruise first.

794
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,360
I'll wait over there.

795
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:45,880
Just go.

796
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:49,800
You're so cute when you smile and laugh.

797
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:50,960
Do you mean it?

798
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,400
Yes.

799
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:58,400
What's going on?

800
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,960
- Venus is doing an internship here.
- With me?

801
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:04,120
Please make way for a human removal unit.

802
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:07,240
Mr. Saruj, there is
a big problem in Thailand.

803
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,200
The Thai baht will depreciate.

804
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,080
This is the biggest economic crisis
of the country.

805
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:15,280
Madam Orn can't sponsor me any longer.

806
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,280
I think I'll have to return to Thailand.

807
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:19,600
We'll have half of the world
separating us now.

808
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,880
I don't know
when I'll get to see you again.

809
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:53,560
