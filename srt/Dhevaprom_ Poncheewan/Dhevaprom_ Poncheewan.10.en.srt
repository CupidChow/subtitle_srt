1
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,200
You had a lawyer file for divorce
so you can be with your lover?

2
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,160
Watch your mouth.

3
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,800
I'm going to sue you too.

4
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,480
Mrs. Mus will be single soon.

5
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,600
You can be with her
as you wish after that.

6
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,960
I can't take this anymore.

7
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,720
-Take this!
-Gosh, Cheewan.

8
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,080
Is this for Poncheewa's sake?

9
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,440
I'm so angry I'm burning.

10
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,160
No, I don't love you.

11
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,640
I don't love you.

12
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,360
That's your problem,

13
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,680
but I love you.

14
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,920
Saruj did that to me.

15
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,360
Why doesn't he just kill me?

16
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,640
What's with him?

17
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,560
I was happy for less than an hour

18
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,280
and now I feel suffocated again.

19
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,360
-Hey!
-Hey! Cheewan.

20
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,360
The minister has to get an appendectomy.

21
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,640
He has to take leave,

22
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,720
so I took this opportunity
to take a break.

23
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,840
Why didn't you go to Phuket,
Chiang Mai, or Samui?

24
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,600
I wanted to come here.

25
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,200
Why did you suddenly come here?
Is something wrong?

26
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,360
Well…

27
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,680
Not really. I just…

28
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,920
Hey, I'm here.

29
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,520
I'm ready to hang out with you.

30
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,720
Mr. Saruj.

31
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,840
What brings you here?

32
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,360
Are you two going out?

33
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,760
Let me come with you.

34
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,640
They're going to catch some fish.

35
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,840
Why don't you come with me
for a ride around the city?

36
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,640
It'll be much more fun with me. All right?

37
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,960
I don't mind going fishing with them.

38
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,079
I want to go.

39
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,400
No way.

40
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,080
What?

41
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,760
That is full of starch and oil.

42
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,320
As your baby grows,

43
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,920
your womb cramps your intestines,

44
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,520
making it harder to digest food.

45
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,280
And you'll get flatulence
if you eat spicy food.

46
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,800
You might get acid reflux.

47
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,080
Now that you've said all that,

48
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,880
I won't eat it.

49
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,160
What am I going to have for lunch then?

50
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,840
I came here this morning

51
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,240
and cooked some food for you.

52
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,480
It was my first time cooking.

53
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,800
Actually, I don't want you to eat it.

54
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,920
So why did you give it to me?

55
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,480
Let's go out to eat.

56
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,800
You're pregnant,

57
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,680
so your hormones are changing
and you might get hot flushes.

58
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,920
That's why I brought you here,

59
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,240
so you can enjoy nature and the nice view.

60
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,960
It's just your sort of place.

61
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,080
It's very beautiful.

62
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,160
What would you like?

63
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,160
Stir-fried chicken with ginger, please.

64
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,280
Please use chicken breast.

65
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,840
It is high in protein and low in fat.

66
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,960
Stir-fried broccoli
and shrimp in oyster sauce.

67
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,440
The little one is growing
and your belly is getting bigger.

68
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,960
You might get constipation and flatulence.

69
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,080
You must eat vegetables.

70
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,280
We'll have stir-fried vegetables.
Make sure the vegetables are well cooked.

71
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,680
-Sure.
-Can I also have spicy mackerel dip.

72
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,160
Please grill the mackerel.

73
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,800
And some white rice, please.

74
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,200
Make that brown rice.

75
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,160
To prevent beriberi disease.

76
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,560
I didn't realize

77
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,840
you knew so much about nutrition.

78
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,040
I've read books about nutrition
and child development.

79
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,040
You can rest assured when you're with me.

80
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,720
I wanted to see you

81
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,840
because I wanted to know
why did you suddenly disappear.

82
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,200
I know now

83
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,560
what I have to do with my life

84
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,080
and my baby.

85
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,720
Are you pregnant?

86
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,040
Come here.

87
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,160
What is it, Mint?

88
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,920
Mr. Man, the owner, wants to see you.

89
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,280
STAFF ONLY

90
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,440
Thanks.

91
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,480
No worries.

92
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,480
Here is your bonus for the chocolate.

93
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,440
Our customers love it.

94
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,480
It sells out every day.

95
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,600
You're very talented, Dalad.

96
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,159
Thank you.

97
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,560
I still have a few other recipes.

98
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,480
If you're interested,

99
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,400
I'll make them and you can taste them.

100
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,640
If they sell as well as this,

101
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,480
I won't just promote you,

102
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,360
I'll also give you a share of the profits.

103
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,680
Does that mean I've been promoted
to a permanent position now?

104
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,760
Yes.

105
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,200
Thank you so much, Mr. Man.
I really appreciate it.

106
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,000
Don't forget to get a health check-up
and sign a contract with us tomorrow.

107
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,960
Sure.

108
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,480
We grew up differently.

109
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,800
I was always filthy when I was young

110
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,800
because I walked in the mud like this.

111
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,320
That's why I did what I did
the other day without thinking

112
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,480
and humiliated you.

113
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,520
You didn't humiliate me.

114
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,080
The ambassadors didn't say anything.

115
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,800
You're overthinking it.

116
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,800
I love my life here so much.

117
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,640
No matter where I live,

118
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,120
I'll come back and stay here when I'm old.

119
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,280
I get it now.

120
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,240
I came here

121
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,680
because I want to learn about your life.

122
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,960
Let's do it.

123
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,120
Hey,

124
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,560
please don't.

125
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,040
You go that way,

126
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,440
I'll go this way. We can't fail.

127
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,800
But Mr. Saruj…

128
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,440
Hey, isn't Mr. Saruj
engaged to Ms. Poncheewa?

129
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,800
Yes.

130
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,600
They already called it off.

131
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,520
He's not her boyfriend or her baby's dad.

132
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,240
He did it to protect her reputation.

133
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,440
What's with him coming here alone

134
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,360
and following Cheewan around like this?

135
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,520
Don't tell me he's courting Cheewan.

136
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,000
I think he is.

137
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,200
He knows that Cheewan is your fiancée.

138
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,000
-Yes.
-Yes. That's true.

139
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,840
-If I were you, I wouldn't let him.
-Yes.

140
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,160
I won't let him.

141
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,880
-Who cares if he's a Jutathep?
-Right.

142
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,120
I'm not scared of him.

143
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,040
-That's it.
-Go now.

144
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,080
-Go on.
-Go for it. Do it now.

145
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,800
-Go for it, my friend.
-Go.

146
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,200
-My gosh.
-What?

147
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,320
Why did he jump in there?

148
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,640
Cheewan must be mine.

149
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,840
She's mine.

150
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,320
Hey, Nop. Calm down.

151
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,920
I'm good.

152
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,080
-Walk slowly.
-Gosh.

153
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,880
Hey.

154
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,240
Cheewan, I got one.

155
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,760
-Look, Cheewan. Just a second.
-Where?

156
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,040
I got it. Look.

157
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,000
Nop.

158
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,840
-Oh man.
-He gives Southerners a bad name.

159
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,680
Wait a second.

160
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,960
Cheewan.

161
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,640
I got one.

162
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,360
-What? Really?
-Yes.

163
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,520
Let me see.

164
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,600
Be careful of its spines.

165
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,000
Here. Put it here.

166
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,960
Cheewan, I got one too.

167
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,480
Nop.

168
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,000
Gosh, you're so good, Mr. Saruj.

169
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,800
We have one now.

170
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,800
How about you catch another one?
Give it a go.

171
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,960
Look, he's so handsome.

172
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,320
The clay doesn't even mask his good looks.

173
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,400
True.

174
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,720
Watch out for the spines.

175
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,320
Let's have a competition.

176
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,280
-Sure.
-Whoever gets the most wins.

177
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,520
Come on.

178
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,680
Hey, I got it.

179
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,480
Let me see.

180
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,680
It's mud.

181
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,440
Gosh, it's so good.

182
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,640
It's so good.

183
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,080
Eat up.

184
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,640
Sure.

185
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,120
Thank you, Nop. Hey, Mr. Saruj,

186
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,800
that's spicy stir-fried eel.

187
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,640
I want to get used to the spiciness.

188
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,760
But it's…

189
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,880
Look, you must take a spoonful.

190
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,120
You won't taste it if you eat that little.

191
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,760
Do you want some water?

192
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,960
Is it spicy?

193
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,200
No.

194
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,560
You should have the fish.

195
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,880
It's less spicy.

196
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,440
Why don't you eat boiled vegetables?

197
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,160
You're taking too little.

198
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,240
Take a spoonful.

199
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,960
Nop.

200
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,240
It's so good.

201
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,720
It's good, isn't it?

202
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,560
My mom is the best cook.

203
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,040
-Drink plenty of water.
-Okay.

204
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,920
Let's go home.

205
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,560
Do we have everything?

206
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,600
I told you not to touch this cooler.

207
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,080
One of the bottles is missing.
Who took it?

208
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,560
It wasn't me.

209
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,200
Not me.

210
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,720
Maybe it was Nop or Mr. Saruj?

211
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,240
My dear rice paddy.

212
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:21,480
You're so pretty.

213
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,560
-Nop!
-Nop!

214
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,080
What?

215
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,240
Where did you get your water?
From the small or big cooler?

216
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,440
I don't remember.

217
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,520
-Oh dear.
-We're screwed.

218
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,760
What's wrong?

219
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,560
Maybe it's at the bottom.

220
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,280
I feel weird.

221
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,320
Did it fall down here?

222
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,520
Gosh.

223
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,520
Why is the floor tilting?

224
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,720
Hey, Cheewan.

225
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,640
A fish. Come and have a look, Cheewan.

226
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,680
Hey, are you looking at me?

227
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,160
You stupid fish.

228
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,040
You're lucky I'm done catching fish,

229
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,280
or else, I'd eat you.

230
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:18,319
Cheewan, come and look at the fish.

231
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,000
There's a fish there, Cheewan.

232
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,040
Didn't we already catch it?

233
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,079
You stupid fish.

234
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,960
-Hey.
-Why are you looking at me?

235
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,480
Are you looking at me?

236
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,960
-Hey.
-Mr. Saruj.

237
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,400
-Are you challenging me? Fine.
-Hold on.

238
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,560
Mr. Saruj.

239
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,960
-What did you drink?
-Cheewan, let's catch some fish.

240
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,080
Let's catch some fish.

241
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,200
What?

242
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,000
What's in that bottle?

243
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,280
-It's his. Ask him.
-Ask him.

244
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,080
-Ask him.
-What is it?

245
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,800
-Hey!
-Hey!

246
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,040
-Mr. Saruj!
-Mr. Saruj!

247
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,720
-Hey! Gosh.
-Open the door. Take him home.

248
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,160
-Hurry up.
-Damn.

249
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,080
-Wait. I need to catch some fish.
-Get in the car.

250
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,480
Go do that at home.

251
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,760
-I'm sorry.
-Hey, start the engine.

252
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,600
Just a second.

253
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,200
-Nop, let's go.
-Let's catch some fish.

254
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,520
Wait up.

255
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,400
-Get in the car.
-Come on.

256
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,640
Let's catch fish, Cheewan.

257
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,320
-Go now.
-Go.

258
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,640
Hold on. What about Nop?

259
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,880
-Hey, Nop.
-Wait up.

260
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,000
-Gosh.
-Come on.

261
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,560
Okay, let's go.

262
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,120
Go on. Go.

263
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,280
Mr. Saruj admitted to me
that he likes Cheewan.

264
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,520
How could he do that?

265
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,640
-Cheewan is engaged to Nop.
-Yes.

266
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,880
I didn't think much of it

267
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,320
because our daughter doesn't seem
willing to accept their advances.

268
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,640
Not from Mr. Saruj or Nop.

269
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,360
She doesn't want a husband,
so I didn't worry about it.

270
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,920
That means that lord came here

271
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,720
to keep other men away from her.

272
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,840
I won't let him do this, Klaow.

273
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,240
Let me tell you something.

274
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,560
No matter what happens,

275
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,240
our children must tie the knot.

276
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,680
Cheewan must be my daughter-in-law.

277
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,240
-Yes.
-Honey.

278
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,760
I don't want that lord as my in-law.

279
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,840
I've known Nop since he was small.

280
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,440
-I'd prefer it if he married Cheewan.
-Yes.

281
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,160
So what do we do next?

282
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,640
I don't know.

283
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,520
Let's do this, Klaow.

284
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,280
Leave this to me.

285
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,200
Nobles get embarrassed easily.

286
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,360
I'll just insult him.

287
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,920
I'll insult him and chase him away.

288
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,360
I'm sure he'll leave.

289
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,520
Leave this to me.

290
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,000
They're here, honey.

291
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,200
-Let's go.
-Come on.

292
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,640
-Go now.
-Go.

293
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,320
-Pull over.
-Come on.

294
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,920
Gosh.

295
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,120
Come here.

296
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,520
-Hey!
-Hey!

297
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,480
-Let's go.
-Where am I?

298
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,120
Come this way.

299
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,680
Hold on. Where are you going?

300
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,400
You coming here is like an insult to me.

301
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,520
You're well aware
Cheewan is engaged to my son,

302
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,840
but you still followed her here.

303
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,880
What you're doing is wrong.

304
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,800
Dad, don't say anything.

305
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,960
Nop, you be quiet.

306
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,160
I need to teach him a lesson.

307
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,960
You thick-skinned lord.

308
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,360
Who?

309
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,120
Who are you talking to, you old geezer?

310
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,080
-Hey!
-Hey!

311
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,560
Mr. Saruj, what happened to you?

312
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,760
Please don't say anything yet.
Please leave him alone.

313
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,880
-He's high.
-High?

314
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,960
High on what?

315
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,320
-Kratom juice.
-What?

316
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,800
He's high on kratom juice.

317
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,840
My goodness.

318
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,480
He's never had it before.

319
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,400
-Will he be okay?
-Right.

320
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,200
I think we should take him to a doctor.

321
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,000
No need, Kratin. He's not going anywhere.

322
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,440
He insulted me just now.
Let me insult him first.

323
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,560
You're one evil aristocrat.

324
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,080
What did he say again?

325
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,440
He insulted you in English.

326
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,400
Damn you, you insulted me in English?

327
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,280
You stupid bastard.

328
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,920
Gaozeng!

329
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,040
-My gosh.
-What did he say?

330
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,520
It means son of a bitch in Chinese.
He speaks many languages.

331
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,280
Gosh, you're bold, aren't you?

332
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,880
You insulted me in foreign languages.

333
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,720
I can't take this anymore.

334
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,440
-No.
-Come on.

335
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,440
-Cool it.
-Hold on.

336
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,760
I can also insult you in Thai.

337
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,320
-What?
-You dirty bastard!

338
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,080
Gosh, that's enough, my lord.

339
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,720
You can't insult me
and belittle me like this.

340
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,680
You know full well
that my son and Cheewan are together.

341
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,600
Why did you follow her here?

342
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,960
Go back to where you came from. Go.

343
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,080
I'm not going.

344
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,080
I also like Cheewan.

345
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,080
No.

346
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,240
I love Cheewan.

347
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,000
You two listen to me.

348
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,920
I'm going to make her my wife.

349
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,880
Mr. Saruj.

350
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,920
-Mr. Saruj.
-Why did you say that?

351
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,320
Are you really a gentleman?

352
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,720
Cheewan is a woman.

353
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,040
She has the right to choose,

354
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,720
so don't force her.

355
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,200
Right, my dear.

356
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,640
-You love me, right?
-Hey.

357
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,440
-Hey.
-My gosh.

358
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,080
My sweetheart.

359
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,800
-That's enough. You're high.
-Right.

360
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,960
-My gosh, Cheewan!
-Stop!

361
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,560
My gosh.

362
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,800
You'll kill him, Cheewan.

363
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,640
I can't bear seeing him like this.

364
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,040
He's ruining his family's reputation.

365
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,840
You three, please take him upstairs.

366
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,280
-Go that way.
-Go on.

367
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,360
-Go carefully.
-Be careful.

368
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,320
-Go on.
-Move.

369
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,440
-Watch your step.
-Oh my.

370
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,600
What's going on, honey?

371
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,960
Gosh, he's something.

372
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,960
I thought a few insults would stop him.

373
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,080
Instead, he insulted me back.

374
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,400
I'm totally defeated.

375
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,960
Right.

376
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,800
Hey, why did you take
that kind of drink with you?

377
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,720
I have no idea when he drank it.

378
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,800
-Pana.
-Yes?

379
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,920
I think you should buy
some lottery tickets.

380
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,880
Why now?

381
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,160
Well, you got insulted
by a polite person like Mr. Saruj,

382
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,640
so you're quite lucky.

383
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,880
Gosh, Kratin, stop making fun of me.

384
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,920
Well, it's true.

385
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,920
I have a headache.

386
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,600
Hey, hold on.

387
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,760
I'll chip in some money.

388
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,480
-We're on the same team.
-Yes.

389
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,240
It's cold.

390
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,360
It's so cold.

391
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,800
It's so cold.

392
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,120
It's cold.

393
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,520
It's cold.

394
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,640
Just hang in there.

395
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,520
You'll be fine tomorrow.

396
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,680
Have some water.

397
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,200
Now I feel warmer.

398
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,200
Unrequited love

399
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,680
feels cold like this.

400
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,360
What are you talking about?

401
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,120
If you're not in love…

402
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,680
but you're surrounded by people,

403
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,520
you can enjoy yourself.

404
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,960
But if your love is unrequited,

405
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,120
your heart longs for just one person

406
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,520
even if you're surrounded
by everyone in the world.

407
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,880
You don't care about others.

408
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,720
You don't want them.

409
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,760
This is what I mean by being cold.

410
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,200
You're talking
about Mrs. Muslin, aren't you?

411
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,280
No.

412
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,880
I miss the girl in Switzerland.

413
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,960
When she smiles or laughs,

414
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,080
my boring life just lights up.

415
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,200
She cared about the people around her.

416
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,720
She took care of them tirelessly.

417
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,960
Even though she had her own problems,

418
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,440
she never made a fuss.

419
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,040
She was lively and strong.

420
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,400
You're the only one, Cheewan.

421
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,280
No,

422
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,280
you're exaggerating.

423
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,200
There are many more reasons

424
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,280
why my feelings for you
have never changed.

425
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,640
Please understand me.

426
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,600
Don't make me feel colder than this.

427
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,440
What are you doing here?

428
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,560
Does Cheewan have to dote on him
like that?

429
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,480
Mr. Saruj is very good to her.

430
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,080
He helped her pass her exam.

431
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,960
Can't Nop compete with him?

432
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,840
That's a pity.

433
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,040
Nop is like our son.

434
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,440
I'm also worried about this.

435
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,120
What?

436
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,720
Why are you two still up?

437
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,120
How is Mr. Saruj?

438
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,440
Does he need to see a doctor?

439
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,880
I don't think so. He's just high.

440
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,240
He's asleep now.

441
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,080
I'll let him sleep in my room tonight.

442
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,000
I'll sleep in Kid's room.

443
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,040
I'm going to bed now.

444
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,160
I told you

445
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,640
that I could come here by myself.

446
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,560
Well, I want to know about the little one.

447
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,680
It's much more fun
with many people around, right?

448
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,040
My gosh.

449
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,240
What's wrong, Cheewa?

450
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,160
I think…

451
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,480
it's kicking.

452
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,840
I have never felt it this strongly.

453
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,680
My gosh.

454
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,280
It's kicking again.

455
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,880
Do you want to feel it?

456
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,880
Sure.

457
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,200
Here.

458
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,320
That's awesome.

459
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,760
Hello, little one.

460
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,240
What are you doing?

461
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,840
I think we should go now
before you miss your appointment.

462
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,120
Okay.

463
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,080
Let's go.

464
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,760
OBSTETRICS - GYNECOLOGY

465
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,080
Here is your medical certificate.

466
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,840
You can submit it to your employer.

467
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,800
-Okay, thank you.
-No worries.

468
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,680
OBSTETRICS - GYNECOLOGY

469
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,960
Do you want to go inside?

470
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,920
Who are you?

471
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,200
I'm Ronnapoom, Poncheewa's relative.

472
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,360
I see.

473
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,120
Cheewa would be pleased

474
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,520
if she thought you still care
about her and the baby.

475
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,960
Just let him go.

476
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,120
I don't want anything from him anyway.

477
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,840
I don't expect anything from him anymore.

478
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,200
If you want to cry,

479
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,440
just do it.

480
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,400
Do you feel better now?

481
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,160
Poom.

482
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,760
Didn't you go to the restroom just now?

483
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,360
Did you wash your hands
before touching my head?

484
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,680
I'm sorry for offending you.

485
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,760
I can't remember anything.

486
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,320
I'm really sorry, Mr. Pana.

487
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:17,880
And do you still have a headache
and aching limbs?

488
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,800
Yes, but not much.

489
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,240
Cheewan already gave me a herbal drink.

490
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,440
You said you love Cheewan.

491
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,480
Did you say it because you were high?

492
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,120
I really do love her.

493
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,160
Actually, I don't want to say
anything much.

494
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,360
She's still young.

495
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,880
I want her to take her time
to think it over. It's better this way.

496
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,920
I'm never getting married.

497
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,040
No matter who it is.

498
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,800
I'm going to travel the world
after I graduate.

499
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,600
What?

500
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,720
Yes.

501
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,200
My head hurts.

502
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,400
I brought you some bedding
so you can sleep tonight.

503
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,600
Please get up. Let me arrange it for you.

504
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,160
If you give yours to me,

505
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,800
what will you sleep on?

506
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,520
I can sleep without them.

507
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,840
It's weird, isn't it?

508
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,200
Different people

509
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,680
can feel differently about the same thing.

510
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,040
Take this blanket for example.

511
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,120
Some people can sleep on it comfortably.

512
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,320
But others can't.

513
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,120
Are you saying

514
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,040
I can't live a life like yours?

515
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,440
I admit…

516
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,840
that this place isn't that comfortable.

517
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,520
But…

518
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,520
To put it simply,

519
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,200
it's better to live
wherever you are happy.

520
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,400
If you get to live with someone you love,

521
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,040
anywhere is heaven.

522
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,600
I'm going to throw up.

523
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,240
Hold on.

524
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,080
You know what?

525
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,880
A person is scared to be in a relationship

526
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,280
because they haven't found someone
who they love deeply.

527
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,120
I've found someone.

528
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,760
It's me.

529
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,720
I love myself so much that
I don't want to share myself with anyone.

530
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,720
When you love someone a lot,

531
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,280
you don't use this.

532
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,840
But…

533
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,440
When you love someone a lot,

534
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,080
but they don't return your feelings,

535
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,800
your heart gets shaken.

536
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,480
You feel anxious

537
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,120
and restless.

538
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,160
When you love someone a lot,

539
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,680
but they're not by your side,

540
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,080
your heart just feels empty.

541
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,960
When you love someone a lot

542
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,120
but they don't return your feelings,

543
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,960
it feels empty here.

544
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,160
You feel like giving up on life.

545
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,960
That's why I don't want to love anyone.

546
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,080
When this feeling builds up,

547
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,960
I only have one way left,
which is to fight.

548
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,640
Fight for love,

549
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,200
because you won't lose anything by trying.

550
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,400
No.

551
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,920
I won't love anyone.

552
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,800
That's what your head tells you.

553
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,920
You must listen to your heart from now on.

554
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,680
If you can't escape it

555
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,160
and you can't stop loving them,

556
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,480
then just give in to it.

557
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,520
I gave in a long time ago.

558
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,600
I have no other choice,

559
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,120
but to fight.

560
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,680
Good night.

561
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,520
Good night.

562
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,440
It's late. Why are you still up?

563
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,760
Hey, why are you crying?

564
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,280
I…

565
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,200
I can't sleep, Dad.

566
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,000
Is it a problem of the heart?

567
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:54,040
My little girl is big now.

568
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,080
Why are you crying?

569
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,120
Can you tell me?

570
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,000
Mr. Saruj…

571
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,560
shouldn't love someone like me.

572
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,120
You feel uncomfortable, right?

573
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,200
He came all the way here

574
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,760
as if he wanted to pressure you,
don't you think?

575
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,960
Yes, Dad.

576
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,800
I feel a lot of pressure.

577
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,240
You know, don't you,

578
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:35,680
that if I married a Jutathep,
people would expect so much of me?

579
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,320
A little mistake

580
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,360
and they'd say I'm not suitable for him.

581
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,520
They'd ask, as the wife of a Jutathep,

582
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,160
why I was so thoughtless.

583
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,360
They'd say I don't carry myself well.

584
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,120
That's right.

585
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,880
Do you understand now

586
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:03,200
why your mom and I want you to marry Nop?

587
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:09,920
But I really don't have feelings for Nop.

588
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,360
But that might change in the future.

589
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:21,520
By the way, if you don't love Mr. Saruj

590
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,880
or have feelings for him,

591
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,960
a straightforward person like you

592
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,240
can just tell him that you don't like him.

593
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,560
Why are you crying?

594
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,880
Well…

595
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,760
I feel sorry for him.

596
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,320
But I also feel sorry for myself.

597
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,880
You're such a crybaby.

598
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,320
My little girl.

599
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,160
Come here.

600
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,760
Cry with me.

601
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,240
My dear.

602
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,560
It's difficult being an adult, isn't it?

603
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,160
Take your time to think things over

604
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,320
and see what happens.

605
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,760
You're grown-up now.

606
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,720
All I can think of is vengeance.

607
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,320
You bastard.

608
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,200
You insulted me
and snatched my daughter-in-law from me.

609
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,960
I can't let this happen.

610
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,720
I'll deal with you once and for all.

611
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,160
Honey.

612
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,600
-Hey!
-Hey!

613
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,640
-Come on.
-What are you doing?

614
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,120
Be quiet.

615
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,560
It's the wrong side.

616
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,800
-Turn it around.
-Turn it around. No.

617
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,000
Right here.

618
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,960
-Let's go.
-Let go of me.

619
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,120
-Come on.
-Let go.

620
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,360
Let go! Cheewan!

621
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,440
-Come on.
-Help! Cheewan!

622
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,200
-Cheewan, help me!
-Gosh.

623
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,320
-Go.
-Cheewan!

624
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,640
-Cheewan! Help!
-Be quiet.

625
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,000
-Help! Cheewan!
-Be quiet.

626
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,280
Cheewan!

627
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,840
-Help me, Cheewan!
-Be quiet.

628
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,920
Come with us.

629
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,560
What are you doing?

630
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,120
Do you want to marry their daughter?

631
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,040
If you want to,

632
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,160
you must be able to tap rubber trees.

633
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:10,840
Nop.

634
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,440
-Show him.
-Sure.

635
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,720
Mr. Saruj, watch this.

636
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,920
This is how you prove
if you're a real man.

637
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,200
In three hours from now,

638
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,280
you must have tapped all the trees.

639
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,160
If not,

640
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,200
just leave this place.

641
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:49,720
Let's go, guys.

642
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,160
Three hours.

643
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,880
Make sure you do all of them, Mr. Saruj.

644
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,280
Mom, how could you make him
tap the rubber trees?

645
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,200
What if something happens to him?
What will you tell Madam Orn?

646
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,000
What could happen?
He's just here to tap rubber trees.

647
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,560
He'll be fine.

648
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,560
Mr. Saruj.

649
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,960
-Honey.
-Honey.

650
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,320
Let's check it out.

651
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,120
Mr. Saruj.

652
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,480
What's wrong?

653
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,280
Did you cut yourself?

654
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,200
Gosh.

655
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,120
Come here.

656
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:12,920
I'm fine.

657
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,080
I'm just frustrated
that I can't tap the trees.

658
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,840
Not only can you not do it,

659
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,760
but you've also damaged so many trees.

660
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,200
I'm not sure
if they'll still be tappable next year.

661
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,640
How many are damaged?

662
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,600
You have caused
a lot of damage, Mr. Saruj.

663
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,040
You're good for nothing. Look at Nop.

664
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,000
He's a real Southerner.

665
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,920
He is dependable
and can take care of women.

666
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,680
Just go home if you can't do this.

667
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:43,040
Kratin told me you're a skillful
and capable person,

668
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,360
but you can't even tap a tree.

669
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,960
Honestly, I couldn't accept you
as my son-in-law.

670
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:50,000
Just go back to your palace.

671
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,880
Mr. Saruj.

672
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,360
Are you okay?

673
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,200
Hold on.

674
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,280
You're obviously screwing with him.

675
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:11,000
Who gave him this old knife?

676
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:14,480
How is he supposed to tap the trees
if the knife is so blunt?

677
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,560
Who was it?

678
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:18,600
Who?

679
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,200
Right, who?

680
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,120
-I have no idea.
-Who did it?

681
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,040
I don't know.

682
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:26,440
Well, I asked Chid to get him a knife.
Right, Chid?

683
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,520
Right, Chom?

684
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,240
It wasn't, Chid. Right, Chom?

685
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:31,960
Right, Chob?

686
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,320
It's not Chid or Chom. Right, Chob?

687
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,560
It wasn't Chid, Chom, or Chob.

688
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,480
Right…

689
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,320
Hey.

690
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,680
You're dazzling me.

691
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,400
You're supposed to back me up.

692
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,600
Let's just say you can't tap trees,

693
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,440
so please return to your palace.

694
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,560
-Right.
-Chid.

695
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,960
Get the car and drop him off in town.

696
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,000
Where there's a will, there's a way.

697
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,640
-Which way?
-That way.

698
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,000
No.

699
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,560
Cheewan.

700
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,520
I'm begging you.

701
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,080
Show me how to do it.
I really want to be able to do it.

702
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,760
Hold the knife with two hands.

703
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,040
Hold the handle with your dominant hand

704
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,200
and use the other hand to guide it.

705
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,880
Now, score the bark of the tree.

706
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,880
Cut it little by little.

707
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,560
Like this.

708
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,960
Slowly. Score it little by little.

709
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,000
Like this?

710
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,400
That's right.

711
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,600
Hey.

712
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,680
-Hey.
-Slowly.

713
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:30,400
Look at them, Klaow. Look.

714
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,640
We're trying to make him
go back to his palace,

715
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,360
but now they're holding hands.

716
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,560
Slowly. Look.

717
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,080
They're even closer now.

718
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,520
What do we do, Klaow?

719
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:51,000
Now, you stick a spout into the tree.

720
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,560
-This one?
-Yes, bang it in.

721
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,160
-Bang it in?
-Yes.

722
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,440
Hey, the latex is flowing out.

723
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,080
Yes. Well done.

724
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,320
I don't know why you're so happy.
You've only tapped one tree.

725
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,960
You still have 100 waiting for you.

726
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,440
Make sure you do them all.

727
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:23,440
If not, you should return to your palace.

728
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,240
If you can't escape it

729
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,720
and you can't stop loving them,

730
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,960
then just give in to it.

731
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,160
I gave in a long time ago.

732
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,080
I have no other choice…

733
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:20,920
but to fight.

734
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,640
Saruj.

735
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,800
The more you do this,

736
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,080
the worse I feel.

737
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:13,080
I want to apologize to you
about the last time

738
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,160
for not saying anything to defend you.

739
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,480
I wasn't trying to deny responsibility.

740
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,920
I had a very difficult time
when I returned to Thailand.

741
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,520
Creditors were coming
to collect from me every day,

742
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,880
so I had to find a new job
and place to live.

743
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:31,360
When I found out you were pregnant,
I was overwhelmed.

744
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,280
So am I just another problem
you have to deal with?

745
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,760
I guess you came to see me

746
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,200
because you want to end this,

747
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,800
so you won't feel guilty anymore.

748
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:44,920
That's not it.

749
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,240
I got a permanent position.

750
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,280
My prospects are looking up.

751
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,920
Dalad, did you ever love me?

752
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,920
Or did you just want to get me into bed?

753
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,760
Now you feel guilty
about making me pregnant,

754
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,400
so you want to do the right thing.

755
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,720
Cheewa.

756
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,040
You made me wait for you.

757
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:06,360
You made me suffer
every moment of every day.

758
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,280
Have you thought about that?

759
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:09,960
I didn't think it would get so serious.

760
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:13,640
So, why are you here now?

761
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,840
Is it because you love me

762
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,720
or is it because of my child?

763
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,680
If it's the latter,

764
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,760
you should just leave.

765
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,720
I don't want anyone to pity me.

766
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,160
Cheewa.

767
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,000
I really do love you.

768
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,800
After I helped you get away from Nat…

769
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:34,920
Don't follow us.

770
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,400
He took revenge on me.

771
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,480
I got the chance
to work in the city where you studied.

772
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:43,800
That's where I found the two things
I love most in my life.

773
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,240
They were you and chocolate.

774
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,600
I meant what I said that day.

775
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:57,000
You were my inspiration.

776
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,120
IT'S THE BEST CHOCOLATE I'VE EVER HAD,
THANK YOU

777
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,520
I don't believe you.

778
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,520
You're lying.

779
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,280
You don't love me.

780
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,320
You ran away from me.

781
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,440
You abandoned me. Where did you go?

782
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,640
Natsarid liked you.

783
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,600
When he found out we were together,

784
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,840
he came to see me.

785
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,560
You went after Poncheewa
when you knew I liked her.

786
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,160
Are you challenging me?

787
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,840
No.

788
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,080
Hey, don't lie.

789
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:43,520
We saw you holding hands with her
the other day.

790
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,160
Hey, hold on.

791
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,760
Where are you going?
You can clean this up later.

792
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:56,320
Nat wants to talk to you.

793
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:00,280
Why don't we talk outside like real men?

794
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:05,920
Tough guy.

795
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,800
Cheewa likes me, not you.

796
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,520
You loser.

797
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,640
Are you trying to drag an angel like her

798
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:22,120
down to the gutter with you?

799
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:24,280
-You bastard!
-Hey!

800
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,200
She's the daughter of a tycoon.

801
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,560
But look at you.

802
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,480
What are you?

803
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,520
What she pays for a single meal

804
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,360
is more than your salary
for a whole month.

805
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,360
You can never make

806
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,120
her life better.

807
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:47,440
How are you going to provide for her?

808
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:49,840
You!

809
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,240
You're strong, aren't you?

810
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,480
Even if Cheewa accepts you,

811
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:04,760
her parents won't.

812
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:07,880
They'll say you leech off their daughter.

813
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:09,640
She's your shortcut to an easy life.

814
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:14,640
Things will never work out
between you two.

815
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,080
Stop dreaming already.

816
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,200
You're a piece of trash

817
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,920
who leeches off a woman.

818
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,000
Let's go.

819
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:44,680
Dalad, are you okay? Careful.

820
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:53,400
I cried alone in my room that day.

821
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:57,280
His words were more painful
than their kicks and punches.

822
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,120
But he's right.

823
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,800
Our relationship would never work.

824
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:05,120
So you avoided me
and stopped contacting me?

825
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:25,680
I heard you came back
to Thailand shortly after that,

826
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,440
so I moved on.

827
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,080
Why are you here?

828
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:34,800
I have to work harder than others
to get close to you.

829
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,920
I have that opportunity now.

830
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,320
The owner said
he'd give me a share of the profits.

831
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,480
Do you remember the chocolate I made you?

832
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,680
I managed to sell my first recipe.

833
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:47,920
Look at this money.

834
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,480
My life is getting better now.

835
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:51,520
I'll be able to take care of you now.

836
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:58,560
I'm sorry for what I did in the past.

837
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:02,160
I love you and I want to look after you.

838
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,400
Please give me a chance, Cheewa.

839
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,120
Please, Cheewa?

840
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:19,520
Fine.

841
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,960
I'll give you another chance.

842
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:26,360
Thank you.

843
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,760
It's pretty.

844
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:28,640
Today is Sat Thai,

845
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:31,400
so my relatives are here
to make merit for our ancestors.

846
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:34,560
Do you know sesame balls?

847
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,600
The bride and groom-to-be are here.

848
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,160
All right.

849
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,240
I guess everyone is here.

850
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,680
Let me officially announce

851
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:52,640
that Cheewan, my daughter,

852
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:55,680
and Nop, Pana's beloved son,

853
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:57,600
are engaged.

854
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,720
Congratulations.

855
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,760
Dad.

856
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,800
Guys, my daughter

857
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,360
is getting married.

858
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,840
She'll have a husband soon.

859
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,160
More importantly,

860
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,960
she's getting a very good husband.

861
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,920
I'm so excited for her.

862
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,040
I hope you have children soon.

863
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:25,440
I hope you have many children.

864
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:29,120
Don't get carried away.

865
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,960
That's enough.

866
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,960
Whose house will you live in?

867
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:36,000
Right.

868
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:37,960
It makes no difference.

869
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:39,400
We're neighbors anyway.

870
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,440
That's right, Klaow.

871
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:44,600
Since we're neighbors,
how about we do this?

872
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:46,320
As they're getting married,

873
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:49,360
let's build their bridal house
in between our houses.

874
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:53,440
We'll become a family and share
the same piece of land anyway.

875
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,040
-That's a good idea, my friend.
-Right?

876
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:59,360
Hold on.

877
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:03,320
Guys, please calm down. I think--

878
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:07,280
Hold on. I thought you were engaged.
Where is the ring?

879
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:09,520
Are you really engaged?

880
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,560
-Right?
-Yes.

881
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,680
Yes, they are.

882
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,680
They got engaged at Jutathep Palace.

883
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:19,439
Madam Orn witnessed the ceremony.

884
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:20,680
-I see.
-I see.

885
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:22,000
Gosh.

886
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:25,479
Why aren't you wearing
the ring then, Cheewan?

887
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:27,720
Right? She should wear it.

888
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,279
-Right?
-Yes.

889
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:34,279
I didn't bring it with me.
I left it at the palace.

890
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,640
Well…

891
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:40,200
I don't dare wear it because it's attached
to your gold necklace.

892
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,880
She thinks it's valuable,

893
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:45,560
so she didn't bring it.

894
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:48,560
Were you scared it'd get lost?
Don't worry. It's just an object.

895
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:49,920
Your feelings are more important.

896
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,760
When I go to Bangkok next time,

897
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:59,760
I'll get it fixed for you
so you can wear it around.

898
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:03,240
It represents his feelings for you.

899
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:07,240
Since the relatives
from both families are here,

900
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:09,319
why don't we do a thread-tying ritual?

901
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,399
That's a good idea.

902
01:09:11,479 --> 01:09:13,600
-That's nice.
-Yes.

903
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:16,560
Do it now.

904
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,359
-Shall we?
-Okay, let's do it.

905
01:09:18,439 --> 01:09:20,000
-How about we do it today?
-Yes.

906
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,160
-Let's do it today.
-Yes, let's do it today.

907
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,880
What makes a good ambassador's wife?

908
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,120
She must speak many languages, right?

909
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:51,319
She must be prim and elegant.

910
01:09:51,399 --> 01:09:52,760
She must know her manners

911
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:54,480
and be considerate of others.

912
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,920
And we think that…

913
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,160
You have all those qualities, Cheewan.

914
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:03,120
Love.

915
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,440
Gosh, you're giving me goosebumps.

916
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:08,320
You make no sense.
I'm tired of talking to you now.

917
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,000
Fine, I'll be like a brother for you.

918
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,160
-Saruj.
-Where are you going, you naughty girl?

919
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,240
Stay here, you naughty girl.

920
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,680
Don't run away from me again.

921
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:55,920
