1
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,560
Let me come with you.

2
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,560
If there are drugs at the warehouse,

3
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,120
then it'll be dangerous.

4
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,440
I'll do anything for Poncheewa.

5
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,680
Tell me that you love me.

6
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,120
Catch them.

7
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,080
Saruj, can you hear me?

8
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,120
I think it's time for the Jutatheps
to come together to protect a Dhevaprom.

9
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,440
Let me clean up the broken glass
for you first

10
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,920
or it will cut you.

11
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,520
Where is the broom?

12
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,960
I'll get it for you.

13
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,800
Mr. Nava.

14
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,360
This Japanese food is really good.

15
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,520
I queued up for so long.

16
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,880
Let me clean up the broken glass,

17
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,560
so you can have your food.

18
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,600
-Why am I so--
-Shut up!

19
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,480
You talk too much!
You're getting on my nerves!

20
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,000
Hey.

21
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,720
Please don't do it, Nava.

22
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,600
I'm begging you.

23
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,880
Please don't hurt anyone.

24
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,920
Just calm down.
Don't create any more trouble.

25
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,680
Please.

26
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,760
Are you scared?

27
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,040
Not only did that Jutathep

28
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,360
snatch my wife,

29
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,480
but he's also on my case

30
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,720
and my son's case.

31
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,279
Go back and tell him this.

32
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,600
If he doesn't stop exposing us,

33
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,600
I'll blow that whole palace up.

34
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,280
Mrs. Mus.

35
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,520
Mrs. Mus.

36
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,080
We need to get out of here.

37
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,560
-Mom.
-Mus.

38
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,320
-Mom.
-Mus.

39
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400
Mom.

40
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,080
Let's get out of here. Walk carefully.

41
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,520
My car is parked outside.

42
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,640
Let's go.

43
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,880
This afternoon,
a patrol officer informed me

44
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,840
that he saw Dalad's car on this route.

45
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,080
I'm sure he'll make a stop

46
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,720
because he has driven all night long.

47
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,320
Then we must search the hotels.

48
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,480
Yes.

49
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,000
At 7:00 a.m.,

50
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,000
the car was spotted at this junction,

51
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,760
but has not been seen since,

52
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,640
so the hotel must be in this area.

53
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,400
I'll tell the officer now.

54
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,320
Okay.

55
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,480
Hey, hold on.

56
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,200
You can't do this alone.

57
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,440
You can follow me.

58
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,160
You punk.

59
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,200
So impatient.

60
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,560
Set up checkpoints. Over.

61
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,360
I think Nava's lost his mind.

62
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,960
Someone in their right mind
wouldn't point a gun at someone like that.

63
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,600
He seems to be in a very bad state.

64
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,080
I think we should report him
to the police.

65
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,720
I don't dare go back home.

66
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,160
Who knows when he'll go there again?

67
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,880
Why is he so psychotic?

68
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,120
He's so scary.

69
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,520
Cheewan.

70
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,000
That's blood.

71
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,000
-Cheewan.
-What?

72
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,280
I must have had glass in my hand

73
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,400
when he pointed the gun at me.

74
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,160
Thank you, Cheewan.

75
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,920
It would have been even worse
if it weren't for you.

76
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,120
How are you so brave?

77
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,320
I'd call it reckless.

78
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,480
You naughty girl.

79
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,320
Please excuse us.

80
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,320
Let's go.

81
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,280
I'll treat your wound.

82
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,880
Be careful.

83
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,600
I don't dare go home anymore.

84
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,680
I'm scared.

85
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,360
It's okay, Mom.

86
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,880
I'm going to cook some noodles.
Do you want some too?

87
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,960
You're not mad at me anymore, right?

88
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,160
We only have spicy ones.

89
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,360
Spicy food isn't good for our child.

90
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,240
Let's order some food.

91
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,480
I'll order it for you.

92
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,360
Why is no one picking up?

93
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,720
Is anybody here?
I want to order some food.

94
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,080
Wait a second.

95
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,440
Okay.

96
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,040
I'll go wash up.

97
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,240
Should I go left or right?

98
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,200
Little one,

99
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,280
where are you and your mom?
Can you tell me?

100
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,600
The food is here.

101
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,280
Don't worry, Cheewa. I'll do it.

102
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,080
It's okay. Let me do it.
I'm getting bored just sitting around.

103
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,080
Okay.

104
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,800
Your order.

105
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,440
-Thank you.
-No worries.

106
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,200
-Thank you.
-No worries.

107
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,320
-My gosh!
-Be careful.

108
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,920
HELP

109
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,440
I'm so clumsy.

110
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,400
I'm sorry.

111
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,760
Take that with you.

112
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,720
Sure.

113
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,560
HELP

114
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,560
What were you trying to do?

115
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,160
Get out of here.

116
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,800
You kidnapped me.

117
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,280
What do you think you're doing?

118
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,160
I'm doing this for our family.

119
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,080
No. If you wanted to help me and the baby,

120
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,640
you wouldn't have gotten involved
with Natsarid in the first place.

121
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,200
Cheewa, listen to me.

122
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,000
-No, let go of me.
-Cheewa.

123
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,280
Listen to me first, Cheewa.

124
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,560
-Let go of me.
-Cheewa.

125
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,800
-No. I won't listen!
-Cheewa.

126
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,120
-Cheewa.
-Let go of me.

127
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,760
-I told you to listen to me!
-No!

128
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,520
I didn't mean to.

129
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,200
Stop.

130
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,240
If you come an inch closer,

131
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,840
it's over between us.

132
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,080
Damn it.

133
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,520
I can't concentrate.
I can't communicate with it.

134
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,640
Right.

135
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,040
Cheewa.

136
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,720
Little one, wait for me.

137
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,960
I just want to be able to support you.

138
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,880
I want to have money

139
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,360
and be well-off

140
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,000
so I can provide for you and our child.

141
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,080
What have you gained by doing this?

142
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,600
The money

143
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,160
and happiness that you crave?

144
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,160
I need to find a hotel.

145
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,160
What's the rush?

146
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,200
Natsarid.

147
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,240
What I want…

148
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,920
is for you to turn yourself in.

149
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,040
Cheewa.

150
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,360
What are you saying?

151
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,800
I promise

152
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,240
I'll wait until you get out of jail.

153
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,120
Stop lying to yourself.

154
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,240
We won't be able to get away.

155
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,680
The money you brought along is dirty.

156
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,480
It's not our money.

157
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,400
Where are they?

158
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,360
Tell me where they are.

159
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,400
I honestly don't know.

160
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,800
I just started my shift.

161
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,000
Nat.

162
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,440
Kim was at the shop up the street.
He recognized Dalad's car.

163
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,360
No one else has one like it.

164
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,800
Also, there is only one hotel
on this street.

165
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,000
This must be the place.

166
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,480
How did Nat find us?

167
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,720
What do we do?

168
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,320
Come this way.

169
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,080
Hey.

170
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,040
Hey!

171
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,080
That's Dalad's car.

172
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,200
He's not here.

173
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,440
Damn it.

174
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,720
There they are.

175
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,320
Follow them!

176
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,800
-Hey!
-Follow them!

177
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,000
-Damn it.
-Dalad!

178
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,680
-Hey! I'm coming for you!
-Stop right there!

179
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,320
Dalad, leave me here.

180
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,400
I can't.

181
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,520
Nat can't be trusted.
Hang in there. Come with me.

182
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,960
We're almost there.

183
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,200
Hey!

184
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,680
-Hey!
-Stop right there!

185
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,200
Stop!

186
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,360
Dalad, just a second.

187
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,320
I can't run anymore.

188
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,400
Let's go up there. We can hitch a ride.

189
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,560
You're pregnant.
Someone will help us. Come on.

190
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,640
-Come on.
-Gosh, Dalad.

191
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:05,960
Why are you stopping?

192
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm tired. I'll just use this.

193
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,800
I won't miss them this time.

194
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,160
My gosh.

195
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,760
Poom!

196
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,960
Come on.

197
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,920
That's enough.

198
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,760
You put yourself in harm's way.

199
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,120
Don't you know
that this is my man's territory?

200
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,440
Mod, keep an eye on him.

201
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,720
Just me?

202
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,040
I'm going to get my money.

203
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,840
Why are you scared of him?

204
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,880
Just shoot him if he moves.

205
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm not scared of him.

206
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,520
Kim, take me to your car.

207
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,800
It's over there.

208
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,800
Hey!

209
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,520
Don't you dare move.

210
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,920
Just a little further.

211
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,040
Dalad.

212
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,520
Dalad.

213
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,720
Just a little further, Cheewa.

214
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,840
Can you carry on?

215
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,520
No, Dalad. I can't.

216
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,680
Please stop.

217
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,320
Please stop. Give us a ride.
My wife is pregnant.

218
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,320
Hey, stop! Why are you so mean?

219
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,240
Please stop.

220
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,440
-Please stop.
-Please stop. Please help us.

221
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,360
I'm not here to help you.

222
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,640
I've come to reclaim what's mine.

223
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,520
Give me back my money.

224
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,080
This money is also mine.
I was the only one working.

225
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,840
You never helped out.

226
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,520
All you did was party. I'm owed a share.

227
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,400
A share?

228
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,160
You're just a lousy gofer.

229
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,400
Do you expect me to deliver
the stuff myself?

230
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,040
It's my company.

231
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,600
They're my connections.

232
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,600
The mules are all my men.

233
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,040
Nat, listen.

234
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,000
I'm sorry. We'll give it to you now.

235
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,480
Dalad, give the money to him.

236
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,120
No. I'm not giving it to him.

237
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,760
Dalad, just give it to him.

238
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,840
Dalad.

239
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,640
I'm going to deal with you first.

240
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,440
How did the Jutatheps

241
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,960
know where my warehouse is?

242
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,280
I see.

243
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,720
You two

244
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,360
were in on this together, weren't you?

245
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,440
I knew it.

246
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,240
You've destroyed my life

247
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,800
and my dad's.

248
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:44,000
Well then, you two should die together

249
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,280
and enjoy your time
together in hell, Dalad.

250
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,760
It's not loaded.

251
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,920
Nat, please let us go.

252
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,880
You already have the money.

253
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,280
Please let us go.

254
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,160
Poncheewa.

255
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,200
I regret ever falling for you.

256
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,520
You betrayed me just like him.

257
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,200
All right, I'll tell you.

258
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,480
I'm the one who told them.

259
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,080
Cheewa is pregnant.

260
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,360
She wasn't involved.

261
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,440
Please let her go.

262
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,240
No.

263
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,400
Let's die together.

264
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,080
Cheewa, move.

265
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,240
If I'm going to jail,

266
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,280
all of you

267
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,280
must suffer more than me.

268
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,960
So,

269
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,800
you've all got to die.

270
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,520
-Hey!
-Gosh, let go.

271
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,440
Dalad.

272
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,960
-Dalad.
-Let go.

273
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,360
No, I won't.

274
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,240
-I said let go.
-Dalad.

275
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,440
-Let go!
-No.

276
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,600
Nat, the police are here.

277
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,600
Let go of me.

278
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,720
Let go!

279
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,720
No.

280
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,160
Dalad!

281
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,560
Dalad!

282
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,040
-Let go of me.
-Don't do it, Nat.

283
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,880
Dalad.

284
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,240
I'm sorry.

285
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,240
Dalad!

286
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,680
Cheewa!

287
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,440
-Dalad!
-Poom!

288
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,600
Poom.

289
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,920
I didn't forget.
I just hadn't loaded it yet.

290
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,160
Nat!

291
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,080
Poom.

292
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,080
Nat!

293
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,600
This can't be real.

294
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,720
Nat!

295
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,080
Damn it!

296
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,080
Kim, let's go! The police are here.

297
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,080
Poom.

298
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,360
Poom.

299
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,480
Poom.

300
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,920
Poom.

301
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,760
Poom.

302
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,320
Poom, hang in there.

303
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,800
OPERATING ROOM

304
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,960
Can I operate on him myself?

305
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,480
He's your cousin.
You might make a mistake.

306
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,400
The patient was shot in a critical spot,

307
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,760
so there are risks involved.

308
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,600
He might be left paralyzed
or he could die.

309
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,440
If that's going to happen,

310
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,360
then let it be by my hand.

311
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,600
Can I do it, Jak?

312
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,480
I believe you can do it.

313
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,440
Do your best.

314
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,920
OPERATING ROOM

315
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,440
Scalpel.

316
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,080
Clamp.

317
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,880
Let's fight together, Poom.

318
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,720
Don't let me fight this alone.

319
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,320
You must fight with me.

320
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,200
Suction.

321
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,280
Cheewa.

322
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,200
Dad, Mom.

323
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,880
My dear.

324
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,800
My dear.

325
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,400
You're fine, right?

326
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,280
I'm so glad you're fine.
If anything happened to you,

327
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,080
I don't know what I'd do.

328
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,920
Mom, I'm totally fine.

329
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,160
What about your baby?

330
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,840
The doctor checked me over.
Everything's normal.

331
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,040
What about Poom?

332
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,520
He's still in the operating room.

333
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,640
There's also Dalad.

334
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,160
I asked Cheewan to check on him.

335
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,800
Has she called you about him?

336
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,760
Have you heard any news about Dalad?

337
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,760
It's okay, dear.

338
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,200
I'm scared.

339
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,320
It's okay.

340
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,800
Your dad and I are here with you.

341
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,480
We're here with you.

342
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,280
Please be alive, Dalad.

343
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,000
Please find him as soon as possible.

344
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,960
There was a shooting
on the Khiri Rat Bridge last night.

345
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,920
An investigation revealed the culprit
to be Mr. Natsarid Wongpanich,

346
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,320
the son of a famous former politician,
Mr. Nava Wongpanich.

347
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,440
It is thought that Mr. Nat fell out
with his drug dealing partner,

348
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,560
who was also evading arrest,

349
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,960
after the raid of a cocaine warehouse
the previous day.

350
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,280
There were two people injured
in the clash,

351
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,080
including a female hostage

352
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,280
and air force officer,
Flt. Lt. M.L. Ronnapoom Jutathep,

353
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,760
who went to their rescue.

354
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,240
Another person is still missing
after falling into the water.

355
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,400
I raised you so well.

356
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,400
Is this how you repay me,
by screwing me over? Fucking kid!

357
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,600
Damn it!

358
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,520
OPERATING ROOM

359
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,880
That means you're in love.

360
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,600
You have a crush on your senior, right?

361
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,000
If he doesn't accept your feelings,
just tell me.

362
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,400
I'll deal with him for you

363
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,840
because I'm your real knight.

364
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,560
You're my princess.

365
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,040
I always thought
it was just a schoolgirl crush.

366
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,280
I never thought that the feelings
I had back then

367
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,840
would return so vividly today.

368
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,120
I love you, Poom.

369
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,760
RONNAPOOM JUTATHEP

370
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,480
You said you'd be my prince.

371
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,440
Don't worry.

372
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,000
I'll take care of it for you.

373
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,480
I told you, didn't I,

374
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,760
that I'd be your prince?

375
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,400
Now, your princess

376
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,120
is crying, wanting you to come back.

377
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,400
Please come back to me.

378
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,560
Poom.

379
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,520
Poom.

380
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,320
Come. I'll push you high.

381
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,000
Okay, two…

382
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,200
Darun, I'm tired.

383
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,320
Your dad is here.

384
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,520
Dad, come over here.

385
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,720
Dad?

386
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,320
Come here, Poom.

387
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,080
She said she enjoys it more
when you push her on the swing.

388
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,960
She keeps asking for you.

389
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,680
Dalad.

390
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,640
How are you?

391
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,520
Are you okay? You're fine, right?

392
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,760
I'm sorry.

393
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,840
I can't stay here anymore.

394
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,400
I'm too weak for this world.

395
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,000
No,

396
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,520
I won't let you go. Don't do this.

397
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,080
Are you going to leave me again?

398
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,560
Are you going to break your promise again?

399
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,840
Cheewa.

400
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,639
Every moment we've spent together

401
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,719
is very valuable to me.

402
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,600
You were the most beautiful thing
in my life.

403
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,400
I love you, Poncheewa.

404
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:41,199
Please stay with me.

405
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,400
Goodbye.

406
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,120
Dalad.

407
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,920
Dalad.

408
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,240
Don't go.

409
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,880
Dalad.

410
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,920
Don't go.

411
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,680
Cheewa.

412
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,160
Poncheewa.

413
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:53,360
Dalad, don't go. Please don't go.

414
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,000
Chat.

415
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,400
Cheewa, are you okay?

416
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,240
Is Dalad not here?

417
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,720
I didn't see anyone.

418
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,640
I came here to tell you
that the operation is over.

419
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,440
Poom is going to be fine.

420
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,840
Dalad is gone.

421
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,960
He's not here anymore. Dalad.

422
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,080
Dalad is gone.

423
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,360
It can't be true.

424
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,440
Chat, how is Poom?

425
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,960
He's fine.

426
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,200
He took all of my energy.

427
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,280
Will he be able to walk?

428
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,040
That shouldn't be a problem.

429
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,760
It was a very close call.
The bullet almost hit a vital nerve.

430
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,560
Thank you so much, Chat.

431
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,320
Have you found Dalad?

432
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,040
You see, Poncheewa

433
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,600
is waiting for news.

434
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,040
We found him.

435
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,560
We found him. I need to go.

436
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,680
ANESTHESIA CONSULTATION

437
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,520
Dalad.

438
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,160
Why is he so unlucky?

439
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,600
His baby is about to be born.

440
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,800
You almost got to see your baby, Dalad.

441
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,040
I'm sorry.

442
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,720
It was my fault.

443
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,680
I caused your death.

444
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,200
Dara.

445
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,120
Dara.

446
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,560
Dara.

447
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,080
Dalad wasn't ambitious.

448
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:38,520
I was the one who forced our parents
to sell our farmland

449
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,600
and forced him to go abroad with me.

450
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,520
Dalad wouldn't want you
to blame yourself like this.

451
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,360
You still have your parents.

452
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,840
How will they live if you're weak?

453
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,920
You must be strong.

454
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,440
This child…

455
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,240
is Dalad's.

456
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,080
I'm going to have it next week.

457
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,560
Dalad did everything

458
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,520
for this baby.

459
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,320
He just wanted to do
whatever he could as a dad.

460
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:27,280
Even though he doesn't have a chance
to fix his mistake,

461
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,440
all of us,

462
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,240
including you,

463
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,200
still have that chance.

464
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,160
Thank you, Poncheewa.

465
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,560
Cheewan.

466
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:45,560
I'm sorry I wasn't nice to you two before.

467
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,800
It's okay, Dara.

468
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,080
You're going to be an aunt now.

469
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,200
You must be strong.

470
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,680
DALAD

471
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,920
Poom.

472
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,080
My motivation is here.

473
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,760
It's the other way around.

474
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,400
You are my motivation.

475
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,280
Thank you for coming back to me.

476
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,000
But Dalad…

477
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,600
isn't coming back anymore.

478
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,800
I'm sorry about Dalad.

479
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,120
I pity him.

480
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,640
He only made one mistake,

481
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,720
but he didn't have a chance to fix it.

482
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,640
Poom, do you know what?

483
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,920
When you were in the operating room,

484
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,200
I was so scared.

485
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,040
Please don't do something risky
like that again.

486
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,800
I'm a pilot.

487
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,960
My life involves risk.

488
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,000
Poom.

489
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,560
Why can't you just promise me?

490
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,800
Last night,

491
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,240
I wasn't scared at all

492
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,760
because I felt that
I would make it out alive.

493
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,560
Really?

494
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,480
It's because of you and the little one.

495
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,320
The baby has been calling out to me
since the beginning.

496
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,960
She's waiting to see me.

497
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,680
Meanwhile,

498
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,120
I'm waiting to spend time
with you and her as a family.

499
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,800
When I thought about this,
deep down in my heart,

500
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,600
I knew

501
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,200
that I wouldn't die.

502
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,280
You're so strong, Poom.

503
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,280
It's because of love.

504
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,440
A child

505
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,320
can make their parents stronger.

506
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,560
I just came to understand this today.

507
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,520
I've always felt this way.

508
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,600
I've felt it for eight months.

509
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,720
I've felt it every day…

510
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,240
that a child can really make
their parents stronger.

511
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,080
It sounds like
you're ready for the big moment.

512
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,920
Yes, I'm ready.

513
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,520
My child has made me this way.

514
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,920
I have to be ready, even if I'm not.

515
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,360
Regardless of how childish I am,

516
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,480
I have to grow up.

517
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,760
Even though Dalad, your dad,
isn't here with you any longer,

518
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,480
I'll be here for you.

519
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,560
I'll be here for you, Cheewa.

520
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,200
Thank you.

521
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,920
My mom has a close friend
who lives in Chiang Mai.

522
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,880
She's staying with her. She's happy.

523
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,320
Are you still scared?

524
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:35,880
My mom and I don't dare contact anyone.
We're scared Nava will find out.

525
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:39,120
I'm just clearing my work
and other obligations right now.

526
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,440
I'm planning to fly to Chiang Mai
once I'm done.

527
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,640
That's good.

528
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:46,440
Is Mr. Nava still after you?

529
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,560
Yes.

530
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,720
He's absolutely crazy.

531
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,680
He called all of my friends
and insulted them.

532
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,760
He told them not to let me stay with them.

533
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,360
So now I have to stay in hotels

534
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,120
and move around constantly.

535
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,760
This isn't a life at all.

536
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,240
I'll get my lawyer to pressure him

537
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,720
to sign the divorce papers again,

538
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,800
so you can be free of him.

539
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,760
By the way, I'm thinking of buying
a new house for my mom.

540
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,360
I might live there as well.

541
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,800
Which one do you think I should buy,

542
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,560
is this one or this one?

543
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,640
You're asking me?

544
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,960
Yes.

545
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,960
Well,

546
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,440
I thought, if you like the look of them,

547
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,760
you might want to buy one next door.

548
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,280
My mom has friends in Chiang Mai,

549
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,600
but I don't.

550
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,880
How is Cheewa today? Has she called you?

551
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,000
Yes,

552
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,720
she's getting plenty of rest.

553
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,240
Her baby is due this week.

554
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,640
Aunt Kedsara has taken leave
to be ready for it.

555
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,360
Has Mrs. Muslin left?

556
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:41,480
Yes. This smells so good. What is it?

557
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,440
Boiled Chinese sausage.

558
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,160
Steamed fish with curry paste.

559
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,440
I used chunks of fish meat.

560
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,440
This is a soup with ivy gourd
and minced pork.

561
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,600
I only used the young leaves.

562
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:03,840
The pork is also very tender.

563
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,160
I'm getting hungry just listening to you.

564
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,280
Let's get some rice.

565
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,760
Hey.

566
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,880
This is for Madam Orn only.
There's none for you.

567
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,480
The cook isn't in a good mood.

568
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:39,880
What did I do wrong?

569
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,080
Come out nicely and easily, okay?

570
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,960
Listen to your grandma, okay?

571
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,960
You must practice breathing
for the delivery.

572
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,520
-Okay.
-Put your hands here.

573
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,720
You'll know if you're breathing
deeply enough.

574
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,840
-Now, exhale through your mouth.
-Hello, Poom.

575
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,560
One, two, three.

576
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,360
Do it about ten times.

577
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,000
It's Poom.

578
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,320
That's the third time now.

579
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,720
Don't worry about her, Poom.

580
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,760
I've prepared everything.
We're ready to go anytime.

581
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,480
How are you today, Poom?

582
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,120
You're doing physical therapy, right?

583
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,280
Yes.

584
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,480
I'm calling to remind you
about the documents.

585
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,920
Remember your house registration.

586
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,360
When will you be discharged?

587
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:35,720
And put the documents near your bag
so you don't forget them.

588
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,000
Poom.

589
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:41,560
You're a patient.
You should be taking care of yourself.

590
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,120
-Get yourself better.
-Get yourself better.

591
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,480
Okay.

592
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,960
Poom, I'm serious. Don't worry about her.

593
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,800
I'm an expert in childbirth.

594
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,360
I gave birth to three children.

595
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,600
I've trained Poncheewa for it.

596
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,520
I guarantee she'll be fine.

597
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,760
That's right.

598
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:11,880
Mom, I can feel some water coming out.

599
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,360
Do you need to pee?

600
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,320
I don't think so.

601
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,760
What? Honey.

602
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:20,120
What are we waiting for? Let's go.

603
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,720
-Let's go.
-Come on.

604
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,240
-Not me. Take her.
-Let's go. Come on.

605
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,040
-Let's go, dear.
-Can you walk?

606
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,320
-I can.
-Don't rush.

607
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,880
-Is the water still coming out?
-Su, get the stuff.

608
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,360
-What do I have to do?
-Calm down.

609
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,600
Is she about to give birth?

610
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,560
Right now?

611
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,840
Hello?

612
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,760
Hello? Why has it gone quiet?

613
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,600
I'm so excited.

614
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,160
Little one,
we'll get to see each other soon.

615
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,520
What's wrong?

616
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,400
I'm scared.

617
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,600
Don't be scared.

618
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,880
I was trying to tell myself
not to be scared,

619
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,720
but now it has come to it,
I can't help it.

620
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,760
Mom.

621
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:11,320
You were also scared like me
back then, right?

622
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,920
Of course.

623
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,640
Why is it so hard?

624
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,840
Listen to me.

625
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:38,160
This child has been through a lot.
She's strong.

626
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,360
I believe she will make it
through this as well.

627
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,920
You can do it, Cheewa.

628
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,040
Thank you, Dad.

629
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,320
Be strong, dear.

630
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,640
Don't be scared.

631
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:55,880
Hello, sir, ma'am.

632
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,280
-Hello.
-Hello, Chat.

633
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,120
I'll be right back.

634
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,480
Chat.

635
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,120
Is something wrong?

636
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,920
The child is in an abnormal position.

637
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,440
Is it very dangerous?

638
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,440
Listen to me, Poom.

639
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,680
This doctor is highly skilled at this.

640
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,640
She's delivered
many babies in cases like this.

641
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,040
Everything will be fine.

642
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:32,640
Why are there so many obstacles
in my life?

643
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,520
Listen to me.

644
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:36,720
Obstacles…

645
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,800
are there to test you.

646
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:45,360
Having a child will make you a woman.

647
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:49,040
And today is another test

648
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,560
of how strong you are.

649
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:56,360
Believe me, you can do it.

650
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,360
Cheewa.

651
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,280
This child is your special gift.

652
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:08,040
They came to change your life

653
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,920
and ours.

654
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,920
They will survive this.

655
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,040
That's right.

656
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,720
You're the only one
the little one can depend on.

657
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:26,720
Okay.

658
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,280
That's it, my girl.

659
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,160
My grandchild is the best.

660
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,160
Believe me, Cheewa.

661
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,040
You can do it.

662
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,840
You're amazing.

663
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,560
I was looking for you.

664
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,680
Why are you sitting here alone?

665
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,280
I told Cheewa
everything would be all right,

666
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,640
but I don't feel that at all.

667
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:31,400
I'm not this scared when I fly planes.

668
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,640
That's why I was looking for you.

669
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,040
Seeing you

670
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,440
reminds me of when I had my first child.

671
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,520
Is this how being a dad feels?

672
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,280
That's right.

673
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,880
You act strong
when you're in front of them.

674
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,280
But on the inside,

675
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,400
we hide our weaknesses.

676
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:58,920
And when it comes to our children,

677
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,760
we can't do anything at a time like this

678
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,480
except wait.

679
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,560
I have a sixth sense.

680
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,400
I can communicate with the baby.

681
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,560
But I'm just an ordinary person.

682
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,440
I can't control fate.

683
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,960
I don't know
if I'll get to actually meet her.

684
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,000
That's what parents
are scared of the most.

685
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,640
We know that we can't protect
our children from their fate.

686
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,440
The only thing we can do is

687
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,720
do our best.

688
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,480
That's all we can do.

689
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:58,920
Push.

690
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:03,360
Take a deep breath.

691
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,640
Take a deep breath and push hard.

692
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:06,840
One, two, three.

693
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,600
Push harder.

694
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,960
A bit more.

695
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,720
It's coming out now. Push.

696
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,800
Awesome.

697
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:51,880
Cheewa.

698
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,800
-Cheewan.
-How are you?

699
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,320
How are you, Cheewa?

700
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,440
You're glowing.

701
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,800
She's the most beautiful mom.

702
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,040
-Jeez.
-Listen to you, Poom.

703
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,840
I'm glad you're all here.

704
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,160
I'm only here today because of you all.

705
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:16,920
Cheewan.

706
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:22,640
Friends are the most important people
in our lives.

707
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,680
We started school together.

708
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,320
We took a bus for the first time together.

709
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,440
We cried together when we failed a test
for the first time.

710
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,960
When my life was at its lowest point,

711
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,080
you were the only one

712
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:44,200
who was there for me.

713
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,760
Do you know how happy I am

714
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:50,360
to have you as my cousin…

715
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,120
and friend?

716
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,280
Saruj.

717
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,920
I used to think that

718
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,320
we weren't so close,

719
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,360
as we didn't really talk much.

720
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,880
But when I was being bad-mouthed,

721
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:18,360
you chose to stand up for me

722
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:20,600
at the expense of your own reputation.

723
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,120
Thank you.

724
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,560
I still remember what I asked you

725
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,160
about being the child's dad.

726
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,040
Poom.

727
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,520
I've spoken to you on the phone every day

728
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,240
and I've thanked you every day.

729
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,640
But you haven't thanked me today.

730
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,480
Don't do this to me.

731
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:54,200
You said such nice things to these two.

732
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,240
Gosh.

733
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:06,440
Did you have to push me?

734
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,120
Didn't you hear what she said?

735
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,600
She said friendship is more important.

736
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:17,200
Let's let Cheewa decide
who is more important.

737
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,840
Cheewa.

738
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:24,960
Tell her how much you love me.

739
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,920
Cheewa, say it.

740
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,920
Tell me. I want to hear it.

741
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,120
I'm begging you.

742
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:44,160
She has been telling me
she loves me since we were five.

743
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,800
The big moment is here.

744
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:02,440
The person
you've been waiting for is here.

745
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:30,720
Let me hold her.

746
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:46,400
This child,

747
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,960
whom you've all been protecting
for so many months,

748
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:53,440
is now in front of you.

749
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,800
My little one.

750
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,480
We finally get to meet.

751
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,920
We meet face-to-face.

752
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,120
You kept calling out to me.

753
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,920
You helped your mom.

754
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:22,720
You kept me busy and confused me.

755
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,080
I've been waiting for you my whole life.

756
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,360
Can I have a look at her too?

757
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:39,440
Sure.

758
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:49,000
You're the one who taught me to grow up.

759
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:54,840
I'm the second person
who knew about you after your mom.

760
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,320
I love you.

761
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,640
I'm getting to be a dad
for the first time.

762
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,080
I love it.

763
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,880
Let me be your dad, okay?

764
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,160
I'm going to call her

765
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:28,680
Tualek.

766
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:32,000
It's what Poom has been calling her
for the last few months.

767
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:34,800
As for her real name,

768
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:39,400
I have named her Darun.

769
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,840
They're lovely names, Cheewa.

770
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,760
You're pretty like me.

771
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,360
I think she's pretty like her mom.

772
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,440
You're so adorable.

773
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,320
Look at her.

774
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,480
Do you have something urgent to do?

775
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:38,000
You keep checking your phone.

776
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,320
It's not work. It's Muslin.

777
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,520
She hasn't called me for two days.

778
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:45,360
She hasn't picked up
my calls today either.

779
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,320
Is she in Bangkok?

780
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:50,920
She went to Chiang Mai.

781
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:54,400
I'm worried Mr. Nava will find her.

782
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:56,640
I see.

783
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:00,680
Maybe

784
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,080
I should go to Chiang Mai to check on her.

785
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:15,240
Go to Chiang Mai?

786
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:16,880
You're so worried about her.

787
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:19,360
Hey, wait up.

788
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:40,000
Your phone keeps ringing.

789
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,000
It's Saruj.

790
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,000
Why aren't you picking up?

791
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:51,400
I really loved Nava when I married him,

792
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:54,000
so I thought I was over Saruj.

793
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:57,000
But actually, I never forgot him.

794
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:00,040
We were together for ten years.

795
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:01,880
It's not easy to forget that.

796
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:06,800
The only thing
an ambassador's wife needs is…

797
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,480
-love.
-Love.

798
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:09,960
Love her husband.

799
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,160
This will make her realize

800
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,040
what she can do to help her husband.

801
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:16,400
Gosh.

802
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,440
Gosh, you.

803
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:20,920
You ruined it.

804
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,560
I want to look pretty
in front of your parents.

805
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:27,560
What do you mean?
What are you trying to do?

806
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:31,760
I want to know how important I am to him.

807
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,560
How important you are to Saruj?

808
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:37,120
Are you going
to get back together with him?

809
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:41,680
I was stupid.

810
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:45,520
If I had chosen Saruj back then,
my life wouldn't have turned out this way.

811
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:49,000
Doesn't he already have a girlfriend?

812
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:50,320
Yes, he does.

813
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:51,760
Who is it?

814
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,640
She's just an ordinary girl.

815
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:00,200
It won't be difficult

816
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:01,440
to beat her.

817
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:19,960
I had someone spy on Mr. Nava.

818
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:21,680
Mr. Nava is at home.

819
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:25,040
He's busy dealing
with the warehouse and the condo.

820
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:26,800
He hasn't left home at all.

821
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:31,080
So why isn't Muslin picking up my calls?
It has been a few days already.

822
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:43,760
Maybe Mr. Nava sent his men to hurt Muslin

823
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:46,440
while he carries on as normal

824
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:47,440
to deceive the police.

825
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:58,640
Here you go.

826
01:06:58,720 --> 01:06:59,960
Thank you.

827
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,240
By the way, Cheewan,

828
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:06,120
the kaeng liang at Jutathep Palace
is the best.

829
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,840
If you get the recipe,

830
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:10,520
can you share it with me?

831
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,240
I got the recipe from Madam Orn.

832
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:15,160
I'll jot it down for you.

833
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,240
That's great.

834
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:19,880
I've been craving it for days.

835
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:22,600
Thank you so much, my dear.

836
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:23,720
No worries.

837
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:40,520
Laor.

838
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:43,680
Can I borrow your phone?

839
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:46,720
Of course.

840
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:48,800
Thank you.

841
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:51,200
Here you go.

842
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:05,960
Hello.

843
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:09,920
Hello. Who's calling?

844
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:13,040
Who the hell is this?

845
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,240
Who are you calling?

846
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:18,200
You ordered a tank of gas, right?

847
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:20,800
Gas?

848
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,359
No, I didn't.

849
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:23,640
You liar.

850
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,240
You ordered one.

851
01:08:25,319 --> 01:08:27,000
I really didn't.

852
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:29,439
Gosh, you dumbass.

853
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,120
I'm so stupid.
I keep calling the wrong number.

854
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:35,040
How much credit have I wasted now?

855
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:52,399
What were you doing, Cheewan?

856
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,840
I was catching a liar.

857
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:59,640
She won't take calls from Saruj.

858
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:02,359
She?

859
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,880
Who is she?

860
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:31,560
I'm Hero Saruj!

861
01:09:32,359 --> 01:09:34,760
I'm Hero Chatklao!

862
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:36,560
I'm Hero Ronnajak!

863
01:09:38,279 --> 01:09:40,479
Hold on.
This is meant to be the five monkeys.

864
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:41,960
What about you?

865
01:09:42,439 --> 01:09:43,640
Why are you here?

866
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:46,479
-Mus.
-Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

867
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:47,800
Mr. Nava won't divorce you.

868
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,319
If I have to die,

869
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:50,920
then I'll take you with me.

870
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:56,640
You're crazy.

871
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,760
We'll do our best

872
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:00,320
to bring Saruj back to Thailand.

873
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,360
What is it, Cheewan?

874
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:06,440
They said Saruj would be here
for a meeting and for work.

875
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:08,400
Did you get it all?

876
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:09,480
Yes.

877
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:39,720
