1
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,720
When you hug the one you love,
warmth radiates from them.

2
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,360
It's not like when you hug someone else.

3
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,560
Whose hug is warmer

4
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,840
Muslin's or Cheewan's?

5
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,920
I know a good contractor.

6
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,880
Why did you cut in front of me?

7
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,320
Ma'am.

8
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,240
This isn't wine.

9
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,960
It's called budu.

10
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,760
I have a plan to get them together.

11
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,760
- Really?
- What's the plan?

12
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,600
I have to oversee the renovation
of the house in Khao Yai?

13
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,200
Did you kiss my cheek?

14
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,840
Is it okay?

15
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,240
Please take care of Poncheewa.

16
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,200
Wait here with her. We'll be right back.

17
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,440
Poncheewa is also in the house?

18
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,400
- My leg hurts.
- Will your leg fall off?

19
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,400
Mr. Pana.

20
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,800
Please open the door for me.

21
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,400
I'm going to help the driver.
He might get lost.

22
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,480
- That's right.
- Cheewan, come here.

23
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,160
I'm worried about my mom.

24
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,920
- That's right.
- I can't go.

25
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
In that case, Nop
and you three, come here.

26
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,720
I can't. I'm worried about my dad.

27
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,000
- Mr. Pana.
- Stop it.

28
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,800
- Take me to a doctor first.
- A doctor?

29
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,760
- Let's go, Mom.
- Let's go.

30
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,120
- Let's go.
- Get on the bus.

31
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,000
- Come on.
- Hey, don't go yet.

32
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,280
Come back here first.
Open the door for me.

33
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,680
Mr. Saruj, I'll come back to pick you up.

34
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,000
Don't go yet.

35
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,680
Come back here. Open the door for me.

36
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,640
Is anybody out there?

37
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,120
Is anybody out there?

38
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,600
Can you open the door for me?

39
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,760
Cheewa.

40
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,440
Just a second. I'm here now.

41
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,480
Saruj.

42
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,800
Cheewa, move away from the door.

43
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,000
Sure.

44
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,680
Cheewa.

45
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,680
Saruj, what happened?

46
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,120
Wait here.

47
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,680
Come on.

48
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,160
Gosh, help me. My leg hurts.

49
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,800
- That's enough.
- That's enough.

50
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,320
I'm sorry. I got carried away.

51
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,280
You should be an actress.

52
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,400
She'd be good.

53
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,920
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

54
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,520
When are we going to pick them up?

55
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,760
Tomorrow.

56
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,680
That's a whole day.

57
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,560
Listen, Nop. It takes time to talk

58
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,360
and open up to each other.

59
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,080
As they've both been left behind,
they'll sympathize with each other.

60
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,200
Once that happens,
they'll fall for each other

61
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,400
and love will work its magic.

62
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,560
Right.

63
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,720
Mr. Saruj is smart though.

64
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,200
If he works out what we've done,
he'll definitely kill me.

65
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,360
Don't worry, my dear.

66
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,600
All you have to do is play dumb with him.

67
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,240
- Yes.
- Just insist you're not aware of it.

68
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,160
- That's right.
- Yes.

69
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,120
- You must be ruthless like Mr. Pana.
- Yes, completely ruthless.

70
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,080
He bullshits everyone and never repents.

71
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,440
I feel like I'm getting attacked
from behind.

72
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,360
I'm talking about her.
Why are you insulting me?

73
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,360
- I'm sorry, sir.
- I'm sorry.

74
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,120
- You brats.
- I didn't mean it.

75
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,240
The same goes for Poncheewa.

76
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,240
She has been temperamental recently.

77
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,800
If she finds out about this,
she'll be really mad at me.

78
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,800
Don't worry.

79
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,880
Once they've fallen for each other,

80
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,960
they'll thank you.

81
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,040
Don't worry, Cheewan.

82
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,560
Look at that.

83
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,080
- Come on.
- It's so beautiful.

84
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,960
- It's a nice location.
- Listen.

85
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,800
We're staying here tonight,

86
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,960
and we'll pick those two up
in the morning.

87
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,320
So we don't have to work
and we also get free accommodation?

88
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,000
Well, the bill for the resort,

89
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,280
the food, and drinks

90
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,680
have been paid for by Madam Orn.

91
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,920
- Gosh.
- That's awesome.

92
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,520
Come on. Here it is.

93
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,920
- It's this house. Cheewan, help me see
- I love free stuff.

94
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,200
- which key it is.
- Okay.

95
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,240
- Let me see.
- Gosh.

96
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,760
- Is it this house?
- It's so beautiful.

97
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,400
- It's so big.
- Which one?

98
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,920
- It's this one over here.
- I see.

99
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,880
- Gosh.
- Look at the view.

100
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,840
- The view is also nice on that side.
- Yes.

101
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,200
- It's open.
- Let's go.

102
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,520
Come on.

103
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,200
It's very big.

104
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,000
There's no signal here.

105
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,800
It has been a few hours already.

106
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,880
Is the hospital far?

107
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,080
Maybe Aunt Kratin is seriously hurt.

108
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,800
I'm afraid nothing is wrong with her.

109
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,480
What's with you?

110
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,280
Look at him standing there,
looking handsome and everything.

111
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,280
- Wait here.
- Do it.

112
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,280
Look at you spying on a girl.

113
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,720
You keep looking at her.
Why don't you just tell her how you feel?

114
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,240
What are you talking about?
Keep your voice down.

115
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,000
Come on, Nop.
You've been writing to her for years.

116
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,880
- Are you planning to wait until you die?
- Right.

117
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,440
- This is your chance. Go for it.
- Yes.

118
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,720
She's still young and I still have a year
to go before I graduate.

119
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,120
Let me graduate first.

120
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,920
- Come on.
- Come on.

121
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,200
What if she gets a boyfriend?

122
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,520
Guys in Bangkok are all good-looking.
You can't wait.

123
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,560
- You'll miss your chance.
- Exactly.

124
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,880
Just tell her now
and then you can marry her later.

125
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,120
- This is called marking your territory.
- That's right.

126
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,800
No, I don't know how to tell her.

127
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,200
Gosh, you're no good.

128
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,160
Hey, you engineering students
have a class ring, right?

129
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,040
Does Cheewan know about this?

130
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,320
Yes, she does.

131
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,080
- Take it off now.
- Do it.

132
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,560
- Why?
- Just do it.

133
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,240
- Give it to me.
- Why?

134
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,680
- Wait here.
- Where are you going?

135
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,880
- Don't follow us. Come on, Chom.
- What?

136
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,560
- We only need one.
- What are you doing with it?

137
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,200
- Yes.
- Can I have some?

138
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,880
- Let's open it up.
- What are you doing?

139
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,360
Just leave this to us.

140
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,600
Let's put it inside.

141
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,960
Cover it up well.

142
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,800
Make it look the same.

143
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,440
This is called saprise.

144
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,880
It's called surprise.

145
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,720
Whatever. It's for his future wife.
Let's chill it.

146
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,240
Go for it, bro.

147
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,040
Trust me. When Cheewan takes a bite,

148
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,320
I'm sure she will say this.

149
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,680
- What?
- "I do."

150
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,600
Marry her.

151
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,760
It's okay, but tell her
to be careful when she eats it.

152
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,600
She might swallow it.

153
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,600
- One bite is fine, but that's all.
- Let's go.

154
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,280
Mrs. Kratin will have an even
bigger problem if she chokes on it.

155
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,120
She's already hobbling around
on an injured leg.

156
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,400
What's wrong?

157
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,600
I feel nauseous.

158
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,280
Please don't worry about me.

159
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,920
Have some water.

160
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,680
Please enjoy your meal.

161
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,480
I've had enough.

162
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,720
I'm going to get some rest.

163
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,360
Are you often like this?

164
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,760
- Cheewan.
- Yes?

165
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,600
There're those buns
you like in the fridge.

166
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,280
- Really?
- There's one left.

167
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,920
I kept one for you.

168
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,480
It's so good.

169
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,800
- Dad, that's mine.
- Yes?

170
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,320
Why are you doing this to me?

171
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,640
Nop,

172
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,680
it's just a bun.
Why are you being so stingy?

173
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,080
Can you swallow it?

174
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,800
- Sure.
- Let me get some water for you.

175
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,640
Here is some water.

176
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,480
- Thanks.
- Can you swallow it?

177
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,400
- Don't worry.
- Are you okay?

178
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,360
It's so good.

179
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,080
I only chewed it twice and swallowed it.

180
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,640
It's okay, Nop.

181
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,800
Dad,

182
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,520
listen to me carefully.

183
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,560
I've never asked you for anything
since I was born.

184
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,680
What do you want?

185
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,480
Can you not flush the toilet

186
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,720
after you've taken a dump tomorrow?

187
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,640
What are you going to do with my poop?

188
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,720
Well, I'm going to look
for something in it.

189
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,160
I'll flush it for you, okay?

190
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,880
Nop, Mr. Pana, I'm going
for a bike ride with my mom.

191
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,880
I don't feel like eating now.

192
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,760
- Cheewan--
- It's okay.

193
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,520
- You can smell it just thinking of it.
- Cheewan.

194
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,560
Yes.

195
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,360
- Nop.
- Dad.

196
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,960
Why are you so stingy?
It's just a bun and I've swallowed it.

197
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,160
It's not that.

198
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,560
There's another one in the fridge.

199
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,080
Go eat that one.

200
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,560
- There's another one?
- Yes.

201
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,680
But it's really good. It's well-cooked.

202
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,760
- That was close.
- What do you mean?

203
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,360
I hid my ring inside it.

204
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,400
What?

205
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,000
I was going to tell Cheewan how I felt.

206
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,360
Hey.

207
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,400
Does that mean

208
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,320
you're going to propose to her?

209
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:01,320
- That's right.
- Damn, that's my boy.

210
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,160
That's how you do it.

211
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,800
Let me see the ring.

212
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,160
Hey, what is this ring?

213
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,600
It's my class ring.

214
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,600
You're going to propose to her
with this ring?

215
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,600
It represents my feelings for her.

216
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,440
- The ring doesn't matter if you love her.
- That's right.

217
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,280
Gosh, you're something.

218
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,040
- Let's put it back.
- Yes.

219
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,960
Go and call her back.

220
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,680
I don't think I'll do it, Dad.

221
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,840
She probably doesn't have an appetite
for anything anymore.

222
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,480
This is irritating, isn't it?

223
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,600
I always make people feel that way.

224
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,400
I mean it's irritating
that we can't contact anyone

225
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,880
and we don't know how Aunt Kratin is.

226
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,600
The hospital isn't that far.

227
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,320
Even if something serious
had happened to her,

228
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,480
they would have come back to tell us.

229
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,880
I think

230
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,920
it'll be just the two of us here tonight.

231
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,200
Why?

232
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,520
Well, Great-Grandma Orn

233
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,440
wants us to get together.

234
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,520
What?

235
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,440
Cheewan is supposed to be the matchmaker.

236
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,680
That's why

237
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,320
she has been acting so weird.

238
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:37,040
Was this all a plan
to get us alone together?

239
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,160
I think so.

240
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,280
Gosh, I need to talk to her.

241
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,760
She betrayed me.

242
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,480
I'm so mad at her,
I'm getting a headache now.

243
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,480
I'll go and get some rest.

244
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,640
Okay.

245
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,160
- My gosh.
- Cheewa.

246
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,800
You're hurt.

247
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,320
You're bleeding.

248
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,320
Gosh.

249
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,240
I'm sorry.

250
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,480
Let's go inside.

251
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,760
Okay.

252
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,120
Slowly.

253
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,400
Keep your head up.

254
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,400
I think you'll need stitches.

255
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,800
They're really not coming back.

256
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,160
Why are they so mean?

257
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,960
Why didn't they think about our feelings?

258
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,600
I don't want to stay here.

259
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,040
If I can get out of here,

260
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,280
I'll walk down the mountain to get help.

261
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,400
Please don't go.

262
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,520
I don't want to be alone.

263
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,360
Is that a car?

264
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,160
I think they're back.

265
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,520
Poom.

266
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,720
I was wishing a car would turn up.

267
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,480
You really are the guardian angel
of our family.

268
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,080
I had a meeting in town

269
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,880
and suddenly thought about
Great-Grandma Orn's house here,

270
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,320
which I had forgotten all about.

271
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,040
But I didn't come here because of you.

272
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,880
You don't need my help,

273
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,440
but someone else does.

274
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,680
Who are you with?

275
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,840
Are you okay, Poncheewa?

276
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,160
Poom?

277
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,760
Let's take her to the hospital.

278
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:36,160
The doctor is with a patient right now.
She'll be done soon. You can wait inside.

279
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,640
Okay, please tell the doctor
to do a full check-up.

280
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,960
Why do I have to get a check-up?

281
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,680
You fainted just now.

282
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,600
You look fatigued

283
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,400
and seem to have lost your appetite,
so you should get a check-up.

284
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,680
I think getting my wound dressed
is enough.

285
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,360
You should get a check-up
since you're already here.

286
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,240
Please tell the doctor this.

287
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,240
Sure, please wait outside.

288
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,320
Saruj,

289
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,520
there must be a telephone signal here.
Will you call Cheewan for me?

290
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,440
Sure, don't worry about it.

291
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,160
Thank you so much.

292
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,600
Mr. Saruj.

293
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,600
How is Poncheewa?

294
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,160
Can you run now?

295
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,400
Is your leg better?

296
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,720
My leg?

297
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,400
Oh, gosh.

298
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,040
It still hurts,

299
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,760
but I saw a great doctor
and he gave me some great medicine,

300
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,600
so it's better now.

301
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,920
So how is Poncheewa?

302
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,160
The doctor has stitched her wound.

303
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,840
Fortunately, I got there just in time.

304
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,040
I'll go and check on her.

305
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,360
Off you go.

306
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,600
You should sit down.

307
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,680
Please.

308
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,800
- Slowly.
- Okay.

309
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,280
Gosh.

310
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,360
Cheewa.

311
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,080
Cheewan, you have to help me.

312
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,840
How did you injure your head?
Does it hurt?

313
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,800
I can't let the doctor check my body.
Can you tell them not to do it?

314
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,880
Are you crying? What happened?

315
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,080
I think…

316
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,040
I…

317
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,400
I'm expecting.

318
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,320
Expecting what? Is someone coming?

319
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,200
What is it you're expecting?

320
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,760
You're expecting.

321
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,160
You mean…

322
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,960
Are you expecting a baby?

323
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,160
Yes.

324
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,120
You're the only one who can help me.

325
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,320
Do whatever you can to stop the doctor
from checking me over.

326
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,280
Don't let anyone know I'm pregnant.

327
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,280
You did it

328
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,760
because Great-Grandma asked you to, right?

329
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,880
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Saruj.

330
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,040
I didn't think it'd come to this.

331
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,560
Poncheewa and I

332
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,040
is never going to happen.

333
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,960
Please give up on this.

334
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,120
Can I ask you something?

335
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,320
How are you so sure?

336
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,680
Is your heart already taken?

337
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,800
When someone marries a Jutathep,

338
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,160
you may think they're lucky,

339
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,960
but in reality,

340
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,560
they have the duty to uphold
the reputation of the nobility.

341
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,240
Madam Orn

342
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,200
and I

343
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,280
want you to get together
with someone who has what it takes.

344
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,720
The wife of an ambassador

345
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,160
is the face of our country.

346
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,960
Not just anyone can do it.

347
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,280
Am I right?

348
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,640
How did it go?

349
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,640
I spoke to the doctor.

350
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,680
Did the doctor agree? Will she help me?

351
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,320
We've already dressed her wound.
There's nothing to worry about now.

352
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,000
Thank you.

353
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,800
What about her fatigue?

354
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,240
Did you check her over?

355
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,560
Yes, I did.

356
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,680
I have prescribed her some tonics.

357
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,600
Please don't worry.
You can take her home now.

358
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,880
Doctors are required to keep
their patients' information confidential.

359
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,520
I won't tell anyone about it.

360
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,760
The mistake you made
was not using contraception.

361
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,640
You must be brave

362
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,080
and tell your boyfriend
to use contraception

363
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:31,360
because you're the one
who is responsible for it in the end.

364
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,240
Take good care of yourself.

365
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,440
Thank you, doctor.

366
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,600
Thank you.

367
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,080
How are you, Cheewa?

368
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,240
I'm good now.

369
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,080
But I fell down
when I was alone with Saruj,

370
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,480
I was terrified.

371
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,360
I was planning to pick you up
in the morning.

372
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,400
I'm your aunt

373
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,200
and an adult.

374
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,440
I shouldn't have been so thoughtless.

375
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,960
I'm sorry, dear.

376
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,040
I'm really sorry, Cheewa.

377
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,800
That's not necessary, Aunt Kratin.

378
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,480
I'm totally fine.

379
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,880
Poom and I will take Poncheewa back
to Bangkok tonight.

380
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,400
Let's go.

381
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,200
Aunt Kratin, can I take Cheewan with me?

382
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,680
Of course.

383
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,880
Let her stay here.

384
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,080
They have already booked a resort.

385
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,040
She also has to take care of her friends,

386
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,400
Nop, and her mom.

387
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,480
Let her stay here with them.

388
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,160
I'll take care of you myself.

389
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,520
In that case,
I'll bring my car round to the front.

390
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,600
Let's go.

391
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,960
See you, Aunt Kratin.

392
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,760
Get well soon, dear.

393
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,040
Thank you.

394
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,360
- Cheewan, see you.
- Okay.

395
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,360
I don't get it.

396
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,520
How did it happen?

397
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,400
When did it happen?

398
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,360
What's the story?

399
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,120
I don't want to talk about it.

400
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,120
Who is the dad?

401
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,440
Cheewan.

402
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,840
Please don't ask me.

403
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,840
I just need your support.

404
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,040
I met with Cheewa the other day,

405
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,840
but I didn't tell you about it.

406
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,520
I asked her about Mr. Saruj.

407
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,640
She said they're not dating.

408
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,160
I wanted to ask your permission

409
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,760
to date Poncheewa.

410
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,920
It's Simon, isn't it?

411
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,720
Is it Simon?

412
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,760
Simon is a good guy.

413
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,160
Do you want me to call him for you?
He will be very happy to hear this.

414
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,160
It's not him.

415
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,720
Mr. Natsarid is here to see you.

416
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,120
Nat?

417
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,760
Hey, Cheewa!

418
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,760
It's Nat, right?

419
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,600
He forced himself on you, didn't you?
Right, Cheewa?

420
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,880
- It was him, right?
- Cheewan!

421
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,000
I told you to stop asking me.
I won't tell you. I never will.

422
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,840
Who else knows about this?

423
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,800
No one.

424
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,520
Don't tell anyone.

425
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,200
I'm not ready to let anyone know this.

426
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,080
Promise me.

427
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,640
Can you promise me?
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

428
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,520
Don't let anyone know.

429
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,440
- Promise me. Please?
- Okay.

430
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,240
I won't tell anyone.

431
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,040
So,

432
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,560
what are you going to do?

433
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,200
I don't know.

434
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,440
From the moment I wake up,

435
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,800
it's all I can think about,
but I still don't know what to do.

436
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,840
I only know that I'm a disgrace.

437
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,960
I've wronged my parents and everyone.

438
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,440
- Cheewa!
- Why am I like this?

439
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,200
- Cheewa, don't!
- Why?

440
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,320
- Cheewa, don't hit yourself!
- Why am I like this?

441
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,960
- I don't get it at all.
- Stop it, Cheewa.

442
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,920
I don't understand.

443
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,960
Don't hurt yourself.

444
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,760
I can't bear seeing you this way.

445
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,920
I've nothing left in my life anymore.

446
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,920
My hopes and dreams…

447
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,720
are ruined.

448
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,800
I can't continue my studies.

449
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,240
I'll probably never be able to marry.

450
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,880
I can't even face my parents.

451
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,120
What can I do?

452
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,160
Since the day he was born,

453
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,320
I've never seen Saruj that angry.

454
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,560
Is he also angry at Madam Orn?

455
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,880
Of course.

456
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,960
At her age, I didn't expect her
to be so thoughtless.

457
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,920
Gosh.

458
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,600
My bad. My hand slipped.

459
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,760
It's fine, madam.

460
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,080
You can throw anything at me,

461
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,000
but if Mr. Saruj chases me out,

462
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,560
you must pay me compensation

463
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,520
as I was following your orders.

464
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,120
- Compensation?
- Yes.

465
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,160
- Why do I have to pay you?
- Well…

466
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,640
- I didn't tell you to do anything.
- What?

467
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,160
Hold on.

468
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,680
Who are you?

469
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,600
What's your name?

470
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,360
I'm Pana.

471
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,520
Are you pretending to be confused
so you don't have to pay me?

472
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,520
Madam, Mr. Saruj is here.

473
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,080
Hello.

474
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,960
Greetings, dear.

475
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,440
What is it, Chat?

476
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,400
I'm Saruj, not Chatklao.

477
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,080
That's right. What is it?

478
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,000
- Hey, Kratin. I'm getting confused.
- What?

479
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,800
Is she really confused or just
putting it on to get away with it?

480
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,360
If it's the latter, then she's aced it.

481
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,880
I don't know.

482
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,800
I want to talk to you
about Poncheewa and me.

483
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,280
About Poncheewa and you, Chatklao?

484
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,800
I'm Saruj, not Chat.

485
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,200
Yes, you're Saruj. I called you Saruj.

486
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,560
And what does Chat have to do with this?

487
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,600
Great-Grandma.

488
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:57,160
Poncheewa and I will only ever
be like siblings.

489
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,280
- We can't be anything more.
- Okay.

490
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,760
Please give up on this.

491
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,480
Stop trying to match us up.

492
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,880
Do you want me to give up?

493
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,280
Sure. That's a piece of cake.

494
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,920
But what do you want me to give up on?

495
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,880
About me and Poncheewa.

496
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,440
Why? Is something wrong?

497
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,159
I'll tell you what,

498
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,199
I'll talk to her for you.

499
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,880
Madam, Mr. Saruj doesn't want

500
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,040
to get together with Ms. Poncheewa.

501
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,800
Please don't match them up.

502
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,960
I see. Is that all?

503
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,639
It's not difficult to understand.

504
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,800
You shouldn't do that, Saruj.

505
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,800
And tell Poncheewa

506
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:52,280
not to match people up either. It's bad.

507
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,239
All right?

508
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,480
I don't think
she can comprehend things today.

509
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,920
Why not?

510
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
It's not difficult to understand.

511
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:07,000
I think there's something wrong
with all of you.

512
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,840
She's sleep-deprived.

513
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,280
- I see.
- She couldn't really sleep last night.

514
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,480
She won't make sense now.

515
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,680
What?

516
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,200
Well then, excuse me.

517
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,040
Are you leaving now, Chat?

518
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,960
Goodbye.

519
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,400
Goodbye.

520
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,560
Well,

521
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,040
that was quick.

522
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,640
- Let's get going.
- Okay.

523
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,000
We'll let you get some rest.

524
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,560
Let her get some rest.

525
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,800
- I'll put this here.
- Okay.

526
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,040
Who put my phone here?

527
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,240
It's my phone.

528
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,520
- Madam.
- That means you are thinking straight.

529
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,560
Don't forget my compensation.

530
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,000
No.

531
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,080
I'm not lost or confused.

532
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,440
I won't run away, but I won't pay you.

533
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,200
You won't run away, but you won't pay me.

534
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,760
Madam Orn.

535
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,400
You're such a good actress.

536
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,600
You really had Mr. Saruj fooled.

537
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,960
What do you mean? I didn't do anything.

538
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,480
Mr. Saruj.

539
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,320
I…

540
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,720
I want to apologize to you

541
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,160
for what I did in Khao Yai.

542
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,480
I won't do it again.

543
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,880
I won't try to match you
and Poncheewa up anymore.

544
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,960
Mr. Saruj.

545
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,560
Can you say something?

546
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,560
What do you want me to say?

547
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,080
What can an unimportant person
like me say?

548
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,840
Who said you're not important?

549
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,840
When you left us there,

550
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,560
what were you thinking?

551
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,600
You were laughing, having fun,

552
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,200
and feeling smug, right?

553
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,040
No.

554
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,760
I was worried about you.

555
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,960
Do you know how scared I was

556
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,760
when I saw Poncheewa had injured her head

557
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,480
and was bleeding?

558
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,840
I'm sorry.

559
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,040
I'm sorry.

560
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,520
I'm sorry.

561
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,800
You're meant to be
Poncheewa's and my friend.

562
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,760
You should have said something.

563
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,360
You should have stopped them.

564
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,120
Maybe I was wrong.

565
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,520
Maybe I imagined I was your friend.

566
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,440
Cheewa is the one close to you.

567
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,160
Actually,

568
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,520
I'm just like any other person to you.

569
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,360
No, you've got it wrong, Mr. Saruj.

570
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,760
I asked you to just call me Saruj.

571
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,400
I've always asked you to call me that.

572
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,000
Why is it so hard for you?

573
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,920
And why are you so casual with others
and treat them like brothers?

574
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,400
What about me?

575
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,360
Why can't we be like brother and sister?

576
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,240
Mr. Saruj.

577
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,320
You're the woman
who is making me, M.L. Saruj Jutathep,

578
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,520
who has always been superior,
feel so inferior.

579
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,480
I'm inferior to a kid
who hasn't graduated.

580
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,080
Inferior to everyone.

581
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,560
Poom.

582
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,160
Poom.

583
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,280
Poom.

584
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,120
Poom.

585
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,600
Poom.

586
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,760
Poom.

587
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,960
Poom.

588
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,520
Is anything wrong?

589
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,960
What do you mean? There's nothing wrong.

590
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,560
Are you sure?

591
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,960
Yes, it's all good. I'm fine.
Everything is fine.

592
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,200
When you injured your head the other day,

593
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,080
you called me

594
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,760
and that made sense.

595
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,800
But there's nothing wrong this time,

596
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,360
so why did you call me?

597
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,080
I didn't call you.

598
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,880
Well…

599
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,760
it's your inner feelings.

600
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,920
It's in your heart.

601
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,720
I mean…

602
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,400
I keep thinking about you.

603
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,120
What?

604
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,320
Actually, when you were small,

605
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,800
it was like this too.

606
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,640
Poom.

607
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,200
What is it, Poom?

608
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,800
Just continue reading.

609
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,760
Okay.

610
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,840
What is it?

611
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,840
Why am I only like this with you?

612
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,960
Maybe you and I

613
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,040
have some kind of connection.

614
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,000
But what is it?

615
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,720
I don't want you to help me.

616
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,680
No one can help me.

617
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,320
This is infuriating.

618
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,000
That's right.

619
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,960
I'm annoying.

620
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,240
I'm also annoyed with myself.

621
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,520
Mr. Ronnapoom's sixth sense is so scary.

622
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,880
Right.

623
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,440
I'll have to be strong from now on.

624
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,040
I have to get out and about a bit,

625
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,800
so people won't get suspicious.

626
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,200
Cheewa.

627
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,800
We can't hide this for long.

628
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,520
We can't solve this problem by ourselves.

629
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,560
Have you told the child's dad?

630
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,640
Don't mention him.

631
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,920
I beg you.

632
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,320
I don't want to think of him again.

633
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,720
Then please tell your parents.

634
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,320
No, I'm not ready to tell anyone.

635
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,720
Don't tell anyone, okay?

636
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,080
Please give me time to think.

637
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,520
Please?

638
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:06,760
Please?

639
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,240
What did you cook?

640
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,320
Gosh, lon puu kem.

641
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,320
It looks so good, dear.

642
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,960
I cooked this for Mr. Saruj.

643
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,720
It's his favorite.

644
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:50,240
When I saw how angry he was that day,

645
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,760
I couldn't sleep.

646
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,920
I just found out

647
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,400
what heartache feels like.

648
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,320
Pain is a part of love.

649
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,080
If you want to know if you love someone,

650
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,720
look at how much it hurts
to see them suffer.

651
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,640
If you care a lot

652
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,840
and it hurts a lot,

653
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,000
does that mean it's love?

654
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,320
What are you feeling right now?

655
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,880
Do you care about him or love him?

656
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,280
Well, Cheewan?

657
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,040
Have you fallen for him?

658
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,000
If you, Dad, or Cheewa
looked at me that way,

659
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,400
I'd also feel hurt.

660
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,600
So how do I feel about Mr. Saruj?

661
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,400
Are you saying

662
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,400
you don't have romantic feelings
for Mr. Saruj?

663
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:56,120
I don't know that kind of love.

664
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,520
I don't think about it at all.

665
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,760
All I know is

666
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,360
Mr. Saruj is a very good person.

667
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,040
I hurt him this time.

668
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,120
I feel that I have wronged him.

669
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,960
I must fix this.

670
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,320
It's time for lunch.

671
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,920
Thank you.

672
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,280
Put it in the dining room.

673
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,400
I cooked you lon puu kem.

674
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,600
Hey, why are you still here?

675
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,400
You forget the time when you're working.

676
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,080
If I take this away,
you'll forget to eat it.

677
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:00,760
Let me put it here for you.

678
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,000
And why are you here today?

679
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:09,240
I came back to clean your house today.

680
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:16,400
Please continue working.
I'll go clean your bedroom.

681
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,080
Please don't forget to eat your lunch.

682
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,760
I cooked your favorite lon puu kem.

683
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,560
Mr. Saruj likes bedding in dark colors

684
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,880
with no patterns.

685
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,400
He doesn't like sweet colors like that.

686
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:55,960
Yes, ma'am. Why can't I remember this?
Let's do it again.

687
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,720
Sure.

688
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,120
Oh, right, most importantly,

689
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,960
Mr. Saruj likes to do his work here.

690
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:07,240
If I were you,
I'd put his things in his office.

691
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,240
But you must arrange them
in the same position

692
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:12,840
because he can get angry
if the documents get mixed up.

693
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:16,560
Gosh, I don't think
I can remember that many details.

694
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,360
I'm vulgar, vicious, and low.

695
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,960
That's enough.

696
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,200
I'll remind you.

697
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,280
- Thank you.
- No worries.

698
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,080
There's dust here, Jon.

699
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,520
Mr. Saruj is allergic to dust.

700
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,920
He'll be sneezing all day.
You must pay more attention.

701
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,960
I'll do it for you.

702
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,240
Okay.

703
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,120
You remember a lot of details
about Mr. Saruj.

704
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,840
You have such a good brain.

705
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,520
I never use my brain to memorize them.

706
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,760
I remember them without any effort.

707
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,280
That must because

708
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,520
Mr. Saruj isn't just some other guy.

709
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,080
He means a lot to me.

710
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,840
He really means a lot to me.

711
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:33,640
I'll try to be as neat as possible

712
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,000
when I clean your shoes and clothes.

713
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,800
Do you know why?

714
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,800
Why?

715
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,320
Because not only are you neat
from head to toe,

716
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,360
but your heart is also pure.

717
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,600
You speak politely.

718
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,160
You never insult anyone.

719
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,160
You respect others.

720
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,840
And most importantly,

721
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,320
you work hard for our country,

722
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:07,040
like what the Jutatheps do.

723
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,000
You're flattering me now.

724
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,040
Do you want a new toy or something?

725
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,120
No, that's not it.

726
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,640
I just wanted to tell you

727
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,320
not to think that way again.

728
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,160
You're not inferior to anyone.

729
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,680
You're always superior

730
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,400
to me

731
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,720
and everyone else.

732
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,320
Superior?

733
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,080
I don't want to be superior.

734
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,960
I want us to be equal.

735
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,240
When are you going to get it?

736
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,080
You're not my servant.

737
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,880
You're not my employee.

738
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,880
If we're not equal,

739
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,640
our relationship won't get anywhere.

740
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,240
What relationship?

741
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,960
We're equal.

742
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,480
Can't you just think of us that way?

743
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,240
No,

744
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,040
we can't be equal.

745
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,000
You're of a higher status than me.

746
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,160
Don't be sad like the other day.

747
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,120
Don't say you're inferior.

748
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,800
I couldn't bear for you
to see yourself that way.

749
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,760
Your hand will get dirty.

750
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,080
We can be equal.

751
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,720
We'll be equal one day.

752
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,280
Here, let me do the other shoe

753
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:17,160
and we can see who does a better job.
Are you in?

754
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,400
Sure.

755
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,520
Since you're challenging me,

756
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,640
how can I turn you down?

757
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,680
Just wait and see.

758
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,440
I'll make the shoe shine so brightly

759
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,200
that your eyes will hurt looking at it.

760
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:32,880
All right.

761
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:17,160
I applied to major in English,

762
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,640
but my English is terrible.

763
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,720
Will I pass the exams?

764
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,680
Thank you.

765
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,800
That's wrong.

766
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,000
It's spelled with an E.

767
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,840
Please sit still.

768
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,320
What are you doing?

769
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,960
Your neck is red.

770
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,880
Is it itchy?

771
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,400
The smell of your shirt…

772
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:47,800
You're breathing down my neck.

773
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:51,960
I'm sorry.

774
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,640
I was smelling your shirt.

775
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:58,960
I think there's a problem
with the detergent.

776
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,600
You're sensitive,

777
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,160
so you can only use one brand.

778
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,000
I'll call and tell the shop about this.

779
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:18,920
Don't do this with other men.

780
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,240
Promise me.

781
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,760
I won't.

782
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,400
You went too far.

783
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:43,840
You really went too far.

784
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,800
I'm sorry.

785
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:18,720
We just came back
from our work trip to Japan

786
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,240
and were very shocked

787
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:22,080
when we saw Mr. Saruj's text about you.

788
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,600
Are you all right? Are you hurt anywhere?

789
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:26,520
How are you?

790
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,360
My wound has healed.

791
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,080
Have a look.

792
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,560
I'm all right.

793
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,480
- Was it here?
- Yes.

794
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:34,840
Does it hurt?

795
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,520
I'm fine now.

796
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:41,600
You've fainted so often.
We can't just ignore this.

797
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,000
I think you should come home with us,

798
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,640
so we can take you to see a doctor.

799
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,920
I saw a doctor and she said I was fine.

800
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:55,440
I'm not going home.
I'm staying here with Cheewan.

801
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,400
Poom.

802
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,920
Hello.

803
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,320
Hello.

804
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:24,160
I go jogging around here every day,
so I dropped by to say hello.

805
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:27,960
We're here to take Cheewa home.

806
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,200
Cheewa.

807
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,720
Go and pack your things

808
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,760
so we can say goodbye to Madam Orn.

809
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,280
I'm not going back.

810
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:39,160
I'm grown up now.
Can you stop trying to control me?

811
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,120
Why are you being so stubborn?

812
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:45,640
And why do you seem so irritated by us?

813
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:47,120
What's wrong?

814
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:51,640
I'm grown-up now. It's my life.

815
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,080
Can you stop treating me like a child?

816
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,520
I'm not a child now. Not anymore.

817
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,800
Why are you crying?

818
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,840
Why are you crying, dear?

819
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,760
Can I make a suggestion?

820
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,800
Why don't you give Cheewa some time?

821
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,680
She's probably not ready.

822
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,320
Cheewa.

823
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,840
Tell your dad that you need some time.

824
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:33,920
How much time do you need?

825
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:39,320
Yes, I need time.

826
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,120
We'll give you
until the end of this month.

827
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,000
Just until the end of this month?

828
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:50,720
Cheewa.

829
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,440
I don't know what's wrong with you,

830
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,320
but I can tell from your eyes and behavior

831
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,640
that you're annoyed with us.

832
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:03,960
Do you know that it's upsetting for us?

833
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,880
One day,

834
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,880
when you grow up,

835
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:18,560
you'll meet many people.

836
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,120
Only then will you know that

837
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:25,480
the love of your parents
is the only valuable kind of love.

838
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,960
Only the love of your family

839
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:39,080
can heal you.

840
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:15,040
Thank you, Poom,

841
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,400
for talking to my parents for me.

842
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:27,000
Is something wrong, Poom?

843
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,480
When I was your age,

844
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,920
I also got annoyed at my parents.

845
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,640
I was the one who created trouble,

846
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,440
but I didn't tell myself that.

847
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,320
I took it out on my parents instead.

848
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:50,520
And when we let out our anger,
we feel sad for hurting them.

849
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:52,880
When they ask us out of worry,

850
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,960
we talk to them badly.

851
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:01,880
This problem of yours,

852
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:04,160
can I help you with it?

853
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,480
I know you don't trust me.

854
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,440
But your parents,

855
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,480
you can trust them, can't you?

856
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,760
Why don't you ask them to help you?

857
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,360
I can't hurt them.

858
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,840
I really can't hurt them like that.

859
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:38,040
When you have a problem,

860
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,120
an advisor is very important.

861
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:44,160
You trust your friend.

862
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:47,160
You think her support is enough,

863
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,240
but she's the same age as you.
She can't solve your problems.

864
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:53,560
You must be brave.

865
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:56,680
Face what you're scared of.

866
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,080
It might hurt you,

867
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,360
but your problem will end.

868
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,680
I can't do that yet.

869
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,320
I really can't do that yet.

870
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:21,320
Mr. Saruj, shall I put these books
in the same cabinet?

871
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,320
Okay.

872
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:44,520
Mr. Saruj.

873
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:47,400
This is from
Note Chern-Yim's latest video.

874
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:50,320
Here is the question.

875
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:55,360
When you pray,
do you light incense or candles first?

876
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,280
Candles.

877
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:59,360
No, you light a match first.

878
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:01,920
Is it funny?

879
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,560
Let's go to the next question.

880
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,840
What do you do before you sleep?

881
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,480
Take a shower and brush my teeth.

882
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:15,560
No, you sit down then lie down.

883
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:21,280
Is it funny?

884
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,120
Let's do another one.

885
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,560
What's in the sea?

886
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,080
Sharks.

887
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:35,920
No, there are waves in the sea.

888
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,440
Hanaka!

889
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:51,360
When I see you laugh,

890
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,160
I feel relieved.

891
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:58,000
When someone who rarely smiles like you

892
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:00,680
cracks a smile,

893
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,440
the world just lights up.

894
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:11,680
Do you talk to Nop this way?

895
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,080
What way?

896
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:30,880
What a child you are.

897
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:32,720
Just a child.

898
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:37,880
It's okay. I can wait for you.

899
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:40,560
Okay.

900
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:43,760
Wait for what?

901
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:53,120
Mr. Saruj. Oh my.

902
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,520
I'm sorry.

903
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:58,000
Mrs. Kratin sent me to ask
if you're free this evening.

904
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:01,400
She's planning to throw a small party.

905
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,080
A party?

906
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,440
Yes.

907
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:09,880
She's going to grill you some seafood
with spicy seafood sauce.

908
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:14,480
I think she wants to apologize to you.

909
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:17,640
Okay.

910
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:19,520
Tell her I'm free.

911
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:20,760
Sure.

912
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:24,160
Grilled shrimp and whelks
with spicy dipping sauce.

913
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,720
It sounds delicious.

914
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:29,000
I'll go and tell her now.

915
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:32,280
My gosh, Jon.

916
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:58,080
There's an insect on the rabbit's nose

917
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,520
So it chases the insect away

918
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,600
The insect flies away…

919
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:03,640
Tell me.

920
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:06,520
Something happened in Switzerland
between you and Poncheewa, didn't it?

921
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,840
You can execute our plan now.

922
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:09,880
Okay.

923
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,640
Saruj.

924
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,319
Can I go upstairs and take a rest?

925
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,359
Your job is to take photos
of Venus and Mr. Saruj.

926
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:26,560
This is bad. There's someone over there.

927
01:08:28,359 --> 01:08:29,720
My gosh.

928
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:04,640
