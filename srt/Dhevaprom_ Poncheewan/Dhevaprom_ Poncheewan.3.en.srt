1
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,680
You're so cute when you smile and laugh.

2
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,120
Do you mean it?

3
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes.

4
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,200
Mr. Saruj, there is
a big problem in Thailand.

5
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,040
Can you return to Thailand?

6
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,840
I really can't go back.

7
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,960
Madam Orn can't sponsor me any longer.

8
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,960
I think I'll have to return to Thailand.

9
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,640
We'll have half of the world
separating us now.

10
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,480
I don't know
when I'll get to see you again.

11
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,520
An ambassador who is never in Thailand

12
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,440
and a girl from the country.

13
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,640
I'll cherish the good memories
we made together.

14
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,840
My goodness.

15
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,560
Mobile phones are trending right now.

16
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,640
Well, I'm on trend.

17
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,200
Can I have your number?

18
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,560
I don't even know how to turn it on.

19
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,320
There are so many buttons.

20
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,840
I think holding it is enough.
You look elegant with it.

21
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,960
I think so too.

22
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,480
I'll carry it
to make myself look chic and all.

23
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,600
Chai Lek bought it for me.

24
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,840
If you need anything,
just call the home phone number.

25
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,080
Okay.

26
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,080
- So how's the plan going
- Yes?

27
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,840
to match Saruj with Poncheewa?

28
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,080
One of them is a workaholic,

29
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,880
while all the other does is study.

30
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,640
They're so hard to deal with.

31
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,440
Oh dear.

32
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,000
Ruj only has one son.

33
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,519
If this family's line ends here

34
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,680
without descendants,

35
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,040
how will I face Eied in heaven?

36
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,720
Why don't you avoid heaven?

37
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
It's not the only place you can go.

38
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,080
- Watch it.
- No.

39
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,120
You're telling me I'm going to hell.

40
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,640
I'm not saying that.

41
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,280
Well, there are only heaven and hell.

42
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,160
Gosh, I thought Kratin was naughty,

43
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,560
but she can't compete with Cheewan.

44
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,800
I agree, ma'am.

45
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,680
It's not true, Jaew.

46
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,520
It is.

47
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,960
Anyone who gets Poncheewa

48
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,320
as their in-law is lucky
as she's a good girl.

49
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,200
Hey, continue trying to get
Poncheewa and Saruj together.

50
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,840
Sure, ma'am.

51
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,800
And since you're going
to take care of Saruj,

52
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,880
I need you to take care
of another thing for me.

53
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,920
Go!

54
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,400
Go!

55
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,280
Go!

56
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,280
Go!

57
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,120
- Gosh.
- What is this?

58
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,720
Why are you lazing around?

59
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,360
I just took a nap.

60
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,640
I've already done all the cleaning.

61
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,120
- Is that so?
- Yes.

62
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,840
Why is there still a layer of dust?

63
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,160
You were dreaming
about cockfighting, weren't you?

64
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,480
Yes.

65
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,960
Did you win?

66
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,160
Yes, but I woke up
before I got the prize money.

67
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,560
Prize money? Take this, you lazy ass.

68
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,680
M.R. Pavornruj and Mrs. Rasa
are away in America,

69
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,000
so you think
you can laze around, don't you?

70
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,440
Hey, from now on,

71
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,680
Ms. Cheewan will be taking care
of this house as ordered by Madam Orn.

72
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,520
If you laze around again,
I'll ask her to report you to Madam Orn.

73
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,560
Gosh.

74
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,000
You'd better watch out, Jon.

75
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,280
Get to work.

76
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,480
Let's help each other.

77
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,360
It's Mr. Saruj's house.

78
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,160
I'll make sure it's spotless.

79
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,680
It's finally done.

80
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,160
Hey,

81
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,560
my little one.

82
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,280
Switzerland.

83
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,120
I miss Switzerland so much.

84
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,240
Switzerland

85
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,680
is beautiful

86
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,640
and fragrant.

87
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,040
I miss it so much.

88
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,320
Do you only miss Switzerland?

89
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,600
What about the people there?

90
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,760
Do you miss them?

91
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,720
Well…

92
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,960
The people?

93
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,360
Of course.

94
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,640
Hey.

95
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,680
Wait.

96
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,080
Hey, that hurts.

97
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,520
Hey!

98
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,040
It's really you, Mr. Saruj!

99
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,080
It's really you.

100
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,720
I'm sorry.

101
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,320
I thought I was dreaming.

102
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,320
Dreaming?

103
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,880
What were you dreaming about?

104
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,880
Do you really miss someone?

105
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,120
Who do you miss?

106
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,840
I don't miss anyone.

107
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,680
And why are you here?

108
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,360
Aren't you supposed
to be working in Switzerland?

109
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,400
Gosh,

110
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,920
you're really back, my dear master.

111
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,040
Hello.

112
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,880
You didn't tell me you were coming.

113
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,840
I wouldn't have known
if they hadn't told me.

114
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,880
I didn't tell anyone I was coming back.

115
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,160
Who told you?

116
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,040
- Come here.
- How are you?

117
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,000
Gosh.

118
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,120
I miss you all so much!

119
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,520
The five monkeys are finally reunited!

120
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,080
Did you really think
you could keep it from us?

121
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,800
It's not that easy. We have an informant.

122
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,680
Welcome home, my dear cousin.

123
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,360
Congratulations on your new position,

124
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,120
Mr. Secretary to the Minister.

125
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,040
- Gosh.
- Thank you.

126
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,720
This means you'll be in Thailand
for a while, right?

127
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,080
Yes, I'll be here for a year
for the new position.

128
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,160
- Hey.
- Yes!

129
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,840
Why don't we party every weekend?

130
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,760
Let's do it!

131
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,480
- Party!
- Party!

132
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,360
- Party!
- Party!

133
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,520
- Party!
- Party!

134
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,840
I miss you so much.

135
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,800
The people I wanted
to see the most are now here.

136
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,800
What a sweet talker you are.
Come, let's hug some more.

137
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,640
- Let's hug some more.
- I miss you!

138
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,680
Greetings, dear.

139
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,400
What is my name again?

140
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,240
Chatklao?

141
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,000
You're going to get this.

142
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,320
Saruj.

143
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,520
Come on, I remember all of you.

144
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,720
I'm just a little slow.

145
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,360
It was on the tip of my tongue.

146
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,720
Mr. Danai, my former boss back in England,

147
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,440
asked me to come back and help him.

148
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,240
He wants you to work for him?
What kind of work is it?

149
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,280
Tomorrow, Mr. Danai will be appointed

150
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,560
Minister of Foreign Affairs

151
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,160
under the new government.

152
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,000
So what does this mean?

153
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,480
Mr. Saruj came back
to serve as the secretary to the minister.

154
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,920
That's fantastic, Madam Orn.

155
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,320
Hello, Madam Orn.

156
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,760
- Hello.
- Come here, dear.

157
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,960
Mr. Danai has been involved in politics
for a year now.

158
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,360
Once he made his way up,

159
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,960
he thought of Mr. Saruj,
his skillful mentee.

160
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,720
He wants someone who knows him well
to help him out.

161
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,480
I see.

162
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,560
And who are you?

163
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,960
Madam Orn.

164
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,280
I'm Lady Veena,

165
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,880
the wife of Permanent Secretary Narong.

166
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,720
I come to greet you every year.

167
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,560
Don't you remember me?

168
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,600
Really?

169
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,880
Mr. Saruj.

170
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,600
We came here to congratulate you.

171
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,520
Thank you.

172
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,000
Madam Orn, this is Venus, my daughter.

173
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,960
She's also just returned from abroad,

174
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,880
but she'll only be here temporarily
because we're doing fine financially.

175
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,280
- Right?
- Yes, Mom.

176
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,240
Greetings, everyone.

177
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,000
Hey, Cheewan. Look at this.

178
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,680
Great job! You did it so well.

179
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,800
Are you two friends?

180
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,600
We studied together in Switzerland.

181
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,960
But they're not that close.

182
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,800
Venus is closer to Mr. Saruj.

183
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,920
She became his favorite

184
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,560
when they were in Switzerland.

185
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,200
Mr. Saruj,

186
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,240
if you assume
a high-ranking position in the future,

187
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,400
please don't forget
Permanent Secretary Narong and Venus.

188
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,080
Please look after them.

189
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,040
Yes, ma'am.

190
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,320
I haven't been here for so long.

191
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,280
It's a bit run down.

192
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,320
My parents are away
doing charity work with the UN.

193
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,640
They have a house in America.

194
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,040
No one has been staying here.

195
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,360
As for me,

196
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,360
I didn't plan to return home,

197
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,160
so I didn't have it fixed up.

198
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,200
It's not your duty to do that.

199
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,880
You're their servant.

200
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,040
It's your job.

201
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:06,319
You should have done it, Cheewan.

202
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,400
Madam Orn told you to clean it
a few days ago.

203
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,800
Are you still not done?

204
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,200
Actually, I just arrived yesterday,

205
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,040
- so--
- Don't argue with me.

206
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,720
Venus and I will take care of this.

207
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,319
We'll make sure
your servant isn't slacking off.

208
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,240
Why are you still here?
Go and clean up now.

209
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,240
You always need me to scold you
before you do anything.

210
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,200
Yes, ma'am.

211
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,600
Venus, go and keep an eye on her.

212
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,640
Sure.

213
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,200
Venus wants to help you with this.

214
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,680
You're a poor bachelor living alone.

215
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,320
Hey, Cheewan,
I'm going to test your English,

216
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,320
- so you won't forget it.
- Okay.

217
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,320
What do you call the thing
you use for storage?

218
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,680
Box.

219
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,000
And what happens when you repeat it?

220
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,040
Then it's…

221
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,480
Does that work?

222
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,160
Stop it right now.

223
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,560
Both of you.

224
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,000
Venus, I asked you to supervise her,

225
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,480
so do it.

226
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,920
Yes, Mom. Fuck!

227
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,440
I'm sorry.

228
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,200
Cheewan, you're messing with me.

229
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,600
That's enough, Cheewan.

230
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,720
I was already planning to get someone
to repair my house.

231
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,760
Okay.

232
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,720
Were you already planning
to get someone to repair your house?

233
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,360
Leave this to me.

234
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,760
I know a contractor.

235
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,440
They're an acquaintance.

236
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,160
Okay.

237
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,200
Here, hold it.

238
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,480
Wait a second.

239
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,640
Try to press it.

240
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,640
Hello,

241
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,120
I'd like to send a message to 644555.

242
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,280
Paper-thin rabbit, don't forget to eat.

243
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,720
Okay, thank you.

244
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,280
It's here.

245
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,880
PAPER-THIN RABBIT, DON'T FORGET TO EAT

246
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,960
- There it is.
- Look, honey.

247
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,040
- Yes.
- Gosh, "Paper-thin rabbit."

248
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,960
That's it. You only need

249
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,920
to remember the number, call the center,

250
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,600
and tell them your message.

251
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,440
It's so easy.

252
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,360
Here you go, dear.

253
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,920
Take it.

254
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,920
Keep it with you.

255
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,920
- Try it out.
- Carry it with you.

256
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,080
Hey, Cheewa.

257
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,720
Teenagers keep it here.

258
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,560
Does she look cool?

259
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,720
Let me see.

260
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,520
- Look at you. You look so cool.
- Gosh.

261
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,680
You look so cool.

262
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,080
Now they can send messages
to their favorite child all day.

263
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,920
We're no longer needed.

264
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,120
Come on.

265
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,480
How could you think that?

266
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,400
Did you need to say that?

267
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,520
No, Mom.

268
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,000
Watch it.

269
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,880
Cheewa, is something wrong?

270
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,600
It's nothing.

271
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,240
Dad, Mom, I'm going to stay
with Cheewan for a while.

272
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,720
Why? Stay here with us.

273
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,720
I still haven't spent
enough time with you.

274
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,000
Cheewan will enroll
at Ramkhamhaeng University.

275
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,120
I might enroll there too.

276
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,920
We're going to talk about our studies.

277
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,720
Cheewan can come and stay here.

278
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,840
No,

279
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,200
I want to stay with Madam Orn.

280
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,760
But I think…

281
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,520
Okay.

282
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,520
She has been cooped up in her room

283
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,600
since she came back.

284
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,080
She used to talk to me
about books every day.

285
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,840
She must be upset about not getting
to continue studying there,

286
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,520
so everything gets on her nerves.

287
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Now I feel guilty.

288
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,040
No, don't worry about it.

289
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,520
Poncheewa is a sensible child.

290
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,600
She'll come back once she's over it.

291
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,720
Let's go.

292
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:26,560
Mr. Saruj.

293
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,440
Hey, you startled me.

294
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,880
I fell asleep three times.

295
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,440
What time is it now?

296
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,640
It's 10 p.m. My gosh.

297
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,600
You came back later
than you did in Switzerland.

298
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,000
I had to escort Mr. Danai to a party.

299
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,320
Were you waiting for me?

300
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,720
Yes.

301
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,400
I was afraid you'd skip meals
like you did in Switzerland.

302
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,760
But I guess you've already eaten.

303
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,800
Are these your pajamas?

304
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,640
Yes, these suit me
as I'm the Jutatheps' servant.

305
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,600
Thieves won't dare break in

306
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,520
and ghosts won't dare haunt me.

307
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,080
You called me Mr. Saruj again.

308
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,120
When are you going to drop the formality?

309
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,880
No, I can't do that.

310
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,160
My mom will spank me.

311
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,960
Well then,
do it when your mom isn't around.

312
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,240
Like right now.

313
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,600
Don't call me Mr. Saruj.

314
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,560
Just call me Saruj.

315
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,560
It doesn't make a difference.

316
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,440
Get some rest.

317
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,600
I'm going to bed now.

318
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,560
- Good night.
- Good night.

319
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,960
What are we supposed to do
if we talk at the same time?

320
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,920
- Give me your hand.
- No.

321
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,160
It's okay.

322
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,480
Here you go.

323
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,720
You might touch my butt.

324
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,120
Sweet dreams, my little one.

325
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,200
Sweet dreams,

326
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,000
Mr. Saruj.

327
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,560
I haven't felt like this for a long time,

328
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,000
having someone waiting for me
no matter how late I come home.

329
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,880
Thank you

330
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,640
for making this only child's house

331
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,120
feel a little less lonely.

332
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,440
No worries.

333
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,520
I'm going to bed.

334
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,840
No!

335
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,040
It's this way.

336
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,000
No, it's not.

337
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,040
It's this way. No.

338
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,560
That way.

339
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,560
Okay.

340
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,280
I haven't felt like this for a long time,

341
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,920
having someone waiting for me
no matter how late I come home.

342
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,120
Thank you

343
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,880
for making this only child's house

344
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,360
feel a little less lonely.

345
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,480
What's with him?

346
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,360
You can sleep in my room tonight.

347
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,560
I thought you wanted to enroll
at a private university.

348
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,320
Why are you enrolling
at Ramkhamhaeng University with me?

349
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,280
Wouldn't a private university be better?

350
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,440
Sometimes, my parents' expectations
are too much to handle.

351
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,640
How?

352
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,120
They love me so much,

353
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,080
so they have high hopes for me.

354
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,920
It's their expectations

355
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,640
I'm scared of.

356
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,680
Don't leave me.

357
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,880
You're the only friend I have.

358
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,680
Come on.

359
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,360
You're the daughter of a rich man.
You should study when you have a chance.

360
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,680
I won't leave you no matter what.

361
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,520
But I want to be with a friend

362
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,800
because friends don't expect
anything of you.

363
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,400
They stick with you
through thick and thin.

364
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,240
They're there for you.

365
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,720
Right?

366
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,920
Yes, that's right.

367
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,160
I'll be here for you.

368
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,640
We've just had a bit of bad luck,

369
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,840
but our day will come soon.

370
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,480
I'm serious.

371
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,560
There, there.

372
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,080
Don't cry.

373
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,000
Don't cry.

374
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,320
There, there.

375
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,120
Hey, Cheewa.

376
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,760
Have you moved in here?

377
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,920
Cheewa.

378
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,640
Cheewa.

379
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,800
Hello, Saruj.

380
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,280
What did you ask me just now?

381
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,960
I asked if you had moved in here.

382
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,120
Yes, I moved in yesterday.

383
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:43,320
I miss the time when the three of us
were there together.

384
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,000
Are you free this afternoon, Mr. Saruj?

385
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,160
How about we go out together?

386
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,520
Just let me finish cleaning first.

387
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,160
My gosh.

388
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,800
Hey, stop right there.

389
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,680
Stop it now.

390
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,840
Don't take those albums out.

391
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,320
But they're dusty.

392
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,120
I'll clean them for you.

393
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,160
Put them back. I don't want to see them.

394
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,840
What are these photos?

395
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,320
Did he have to scold me?

396
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,760
Hey.

397
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,320
Who's in the photos with Saruj?

398
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,920
Hello.

399
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,400
- Hello.
- Hello, Mr. Saruj.

400
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,600
Today, I brought the owner
of a major construction company here.

401
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,240
Okay.

402
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,280
Hello, Mrs. Veena.

403
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,960
Hello.

404
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,199
Hey, let's take a look.

405
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,840
Hey.

406
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,600
Isn't that the woman in the photos?

407
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,560
She's Saruj's ex-girlfriend.

408
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,080
I feel so sorry for Mr. Saruj.

409
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,600
This is Mrs. Muslin,

410
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,880
the wife of Mr. Nava,

411
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,920
the owner of the best
and biggest construction company here.

412
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:58,080
This house is as beautiful as ever.

413
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,960
I totally forgot

414
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,560
that you and Mrs. Muslin

415
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,080
were friends back when
you were studying in England.

416
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,800
They weren't friends.

417
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,320
From what I heard,

418
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,360
they were…

419
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,520
dating! Fuck!

420
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,320
Mom, don't startle me.

421
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,720
You see, Mr. Nava has decided

422
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,960
to run for office in the next election.

423
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,880
He expects to get a minor position,

424
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,840
like a prime minister, perhaps.

425
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,040
And Mr. Narong will retire in a few months

426
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,680
and join Mr. Nava's party.

427
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,600
That's how I got to know Mrs. Muslin.

428
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,080
So I invited her here.

429
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,520
My company does both construction
and interior design.

430
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,360
I'll do my best to renovate
this beautiful house.

431
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,640
Okay.

432
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,560
Ms. Poncheewa. Ms. Cheewan.

433
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,160
- Yes?
- Please help me.

434
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,280
Mrs. Muslin is here. She will oversee
the renovation of Mr. Saruj's house.

435
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,920
Why are you so surprised?

436
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Well, she's married.

437
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,640
It doesn't look good
that she's at her ex-boyfriend's house.

438
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,640
But ex-lovers can be friends.

439
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,640
But her husband's
businesses are just a front.

440
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,760
He's actually a gangster.

441
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,000
I heard this from my cockfighting friends.

442
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,040
Should we talk to Madam Orn?

443
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,200
- Let's go now, Jon.
- Let's go.

444
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,320
Let's put it back first.

445
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,440
- Let's go.
- Come on.

446
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,600
I heard news

447
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,040
about Mr. Nava every day on the radio,

448
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,840
because he's building up
a big political party.

449
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,280
Yes, that's why I'm scared.

450
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,360
If Mr. Nava gets suspicious of his wife

451
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,200
and thinks she's involved with Mr. Saruj,

452
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,920
then he brings his men to Jutathep Palace,

453
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,360
we'll be in big trouble.

454
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,320
I only ever see you slacking off.

455
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,080
I didn't know you could be smart.

456
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,160
What you said sounds reasonable.

457
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,680
It would also be reasonable

458
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,920
to give me a couple of hundred
for the information.

459
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,040
Even 50 or 60 would do.

460
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,760
Gosh.

461
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,640
Get the job done
before you come for your money.

462
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,680
I'll give you 500.

463
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,400
But you must get it done.

464
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,880
What's the job?

465
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,160
Keep Muslin away from Saruj.

466
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:29,240
Don't let that flame get reignited.

467
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,680
But…

468
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,160
if Jon knows this,

469
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,160
don't you think
Mr. Saruj is also aware of it?

470
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,800
He's very careful when it comes to women.

471
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,080
I don't think he'd let it happen.

472
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,840
You're still young.

473
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,280
You don't know what love can do to people.

474
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,360
Listen.

475
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,640
Some things break…

476
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,840
How does it go again, Jaew?

477
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,880
Some things are broken with ease

478
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,560
But feelings, they do as they please

479
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,400
Like a river, love flows wild and free

480
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,920
Defying the locks and the keys

481
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,280
That's it.

482
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,200
Yes.

483
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,200
Love is nonsense.

484
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,880
What do you know about love?

485
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,080
So you'll give me 500 baht, right?

486
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,240
- Yes.
- I'll get to it right away.

487
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,280
Go now.

488
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,600
Broken with ease, like your nose.

489
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,440
Jon.

490
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,200
Madam, can you really trust him
with such an important task?

491
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,560
Well…

492
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,360
Poncheewa.

493
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,640
Yes?

494
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,240
Do you feel sorry for Saruj?

495
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,480
Yes.

496
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,160
That woman broke his heart.

497
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,840
He was so upset
that he couldn't even work.

498
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,000
Did you know that?

499
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,120
Well, I've heard about it.

500
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,800
Now that she is back,

501
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,400
it can only lead to trouble.

502
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,640
Can you let that happen?

503
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,720
Listen.

504
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,400
Why don't you take care of Saruj

505
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,600
and keep that woman away from him for me?

506
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,560
Don't let them get close to each other.

507
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,880
Can you do that?

508
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,480
Yes.

509
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,520
Very well.

510
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,280
Lady Veena didn't only bring Venus.

511
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,920
She also brought
Mr. Saruj's ex to distract him.

512
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,480
When will Mr. Saruj and Cheewa
fall in love?

513
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,760
I'm so worried.

514
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,760
It's good Poncheewa has moved here.

515
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,840
They'll get to talk to each other

516
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,360
and will fall in love one day.

517
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,240
And you,

518
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,400
don't give up just yet.

519
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,360
Yes, this mission must be a success.

520
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,240
- Good.
- It must be a success.

521
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,800
Cheewan.

522
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,640
I was talking to Madam Orn about dinner.

523
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,720
You want rice soup, right?

524
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,160
Don't forget to add pork and ivy gourd.

525
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,560
That sounds delicious.

526
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,400
I haven't said a word.

527
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,520
I see.

528
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,240
I just wanted to ask you to come with me.

529
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,600
I see. Of course.

530
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,520
Let's go.

531
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,440
- Ivy gourd soup.
- Soup.

532
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,200
I plan to return the house
to its original condition.

533
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,400
Do you want to build an extension?

534
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,880
I haven't thought about it.

535
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,520
How about we do this?

536
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,680
I'll draft a few designs for you to see.

537
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,600
How about that?

538
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,840
Sure.

539
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,560
I'll leave you two talking.

540
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,160
I need to use the bathroom.

541
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,360
- I'm coming with you, Mom.
- Okay, come.

542
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,280
Mom.

543
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,360
You want me
to get together with Mr. Saruj,

544
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,000
but you brought his ex-girlfriend here.

545
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,160
So don't blame me

546
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,800
if they get back together.

547
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,280
Hey, think carefully.

548
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,400
If Mr. Nava becomes prime minister,

549
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:09,480
Mrs. Muslin will be the first lady.

550
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:14,520
Do you think she'd be stupid enough
to get back together with Mr. Saruj?

551
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,560
There's no way.

552
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,840
You just need to get as close
to Mr. Saruj as you can.

553
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,040
Just do what I say.

554
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,960
Listen.

555
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:29,240
Mr. Saruj is both handsome and rich.

556
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,920
Don't you want him?

557
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,600
I miss your mom.
I haven't talked to her for a while.

558
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,520
There was a time

559
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,800
when I came here to learn
the violin with her.

560
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,200
Do you remember that?

561
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,080
Yes, I do.

562
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,320
Well,

563
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,760
I'll go get more tea.

564
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,840
There he is. Mr. Saruj is over there.

565
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,720
Hey, Mrs. Muslin is following him.

566
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,400
Saruj.

567
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,880
We haven't seen each other for a year.

568
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,720
Is it a bit awkward?

569
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,280
Actually, I should have asked you
before I came.

570
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,920
But you didn't.

571
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,760
They're alone together.

572
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:10,720
I must complete my mission
to get 500 baht.

573
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,920
Let's do it now.

574
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,560
Hold on, Jon.

575
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,400
Let's observe them for now.
They might just be talking.

576
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,200
Madam Orn wants me to get in between them.
What do I do, Cheewan?

577
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,280
Right. How are we going to do that?

578
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,640
Should I put myself
in between them physically?

579
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,760
Mr. Saruj isn't stupid.

580
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,720
When Lady Veena told me
you were moving back to Bangkok,

581
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,400
I was happy.

582
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,080
I miss you.

583
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,040
You miss me?

584
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,000
How can you say that?

585
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,120
Hey, I know now.

586
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,920
Do you see that tree? I'll hit
the ant's nest and make it fall on her.

587
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,080
That'll definitely get them out of there.

588
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,440
- Let me do it now.
- Hey, hold on.

589
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,320
Don't be so hasty.

590
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:09,280
Well, I assumed

591
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,200
that you'd be happy to see me.

592
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,200
But it doesn't seem to be that way.

593
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,600
Are you still mad at me?

594
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,760
You chose what was best for you.

595
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,480
You didn't do anything wrong.

596
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,400
What was best for me?

597
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,720
That hurts

598
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,120
because it's not true.

599
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,840
I used to think that it was for the best.

600
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,880
But I was wrong.

601
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,200
It was the worst thing I could have done.

602
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,920
Gosh, she's crying.

603
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,160
Hey, trust me.

604
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,240
Men can't say no to a woman
when she cries.

605
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,680
Hey, I have to stop him now.

606
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,320
- Hey, Jon.
- Hey.

607
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,920
Gosh.

608
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,080
I'm sure Mr. Saruj won't give in to her.

609
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,560
Hey, but she hasn't stopped crying.

610
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:21,400
Shouldn't she be happy?
She's married to a billionaire.

611
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,120
Should I get in their way now?

612
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,680
What should I say?

613
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,400
No, not yet.

614
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:32,280
Mr. Saruj will be able to handle it.
Trust me.

615
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,720
Gosh, they're holding hands, Cheewan.

616
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,560
Gosh, this woman.

617
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,800
It's okay.
Mr. Saruj will push her hands away.

618
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:59,320
She's going to get a talking-to.

619
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,360
I was wrong

620
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,640
for leaving you.

621
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,240
Mus.

622
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,040
Let go of her hands now. Do it.

623
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,840
Isn't he letting go?

624
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,240
I'm not sure now.

625
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,280
- Mr. Saruj!
- Cheewan.

626
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:40,240
Gosh, I'm going to get 500 baht.

627
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,600
Mr. Saruj!

628
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,840
The thing is…

629
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:56,320
I have a question about Thai manners.

630
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,640
My teacher asked,

631
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,720
is it appropriate for a married woman

632
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,720
to hold hands
with her ex-boyfriend in a private place?

633
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,760
Who are you?

634
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,760
I'm Cheewan, Madam Orn's servant.

635
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,840
Poncheewa, come here.

636
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,160
Were you two spying on us?

637
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:41,800
What should I tell
my teacher, Mrs. Muslin?

638
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,160
Cheewan.

639
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,240
I'm going to ask you a question
about manners too.

640
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,760
Is it right

641
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,320
to spy on others

642
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,600
and meddle in their business?

643
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,560
You have no right to ask me that.

644
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,440
And why are you angry at me?

645
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:57,560
Cheewan.

646
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,400
- Mus.
- Gosh, it's ants.

647
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,520
Mus.

648
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,960
Let me help you.

649
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,040
Jon, what are you doing?

650
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,400
Well, I…

651
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,040
You were talking about Thai manners.
Now, let's talk about agriculture.

652
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,880
I wanted to cut this branch,

653
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,160
but I didn't see the ant's nest.

654
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,600
I really didn't see it.

655
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,880
Mr. Saruj.

656
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,840
You can't touch a married woman like that.

657
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,000
Take your hands off her.

658
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,320
Stop it.
You have no right to order me around

659
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,320
or meddle in my private business.

660
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:43,160
You and Jon have gone too far.

661
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:48,400
Let's go inside so you can take a shower.

662
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,440
Okay.

663
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,680
Did you have to scold me?

664
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,240
Fine.

665
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,080
Cheewan.

666
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,920
Take a shower and wash your hair.

667
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,560
I'll go and find some clothes for you.

668
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,240
Okay.

669
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,600
We're worried about you.

670
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,240
Mrs. Muslin's husband is a gangster.

671
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:49,440
Nat is a thug,
but I'm sure his dad is worse.

672
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,360
Aren't you afraid he'll get back at you

673
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,360
for having an affair with his wife?

674
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,400
That's nonsense. What affair?

675
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,720
We were just talking.

676
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,320
But you were holding hands.

677
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,000
We may not be a couple anymore,

678
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,880
but she's still my friend.

679
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,760
The word friend,

680
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,040
do you know what it means?

681
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:08,080
Can you really be friends with her

682
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,760
when she hurt you?

683
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:10,880
She ditched you.

684
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,120
Yes, she ditched me.

685
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,280
She hurt me.

686
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,200
I'm well aware of that.

687
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,680
I don't need anyone to tell me

688
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,440
and repeat it right to my face.

689
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,920
I want to get hurt,

690
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,520
I want to get ditched,

691
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,200
I want to deal with this by myself.

692
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,960
You have no right to stick your nose in.

693
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:37,920
You're right.

694
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,760
I don't have the right to get involved.

695
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,360
I don't have the right to mean well.

696
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,680
I'm just a servant.

697
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,320
I'm just a servant.

698
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:55,040
Don't pretend I'm your friend
if this is all it takes to make you mad.

699
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:57,480
You probably don't regard me
as your friend.

700
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,840
I'm just a servant to you.

701
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,040
That's how it should be.

702
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,360
Cheewan.

703
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,960
Why are you crying?

704
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,640
Why are you crying, Cheewan?

705
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,680
Can't he tell that I only meant well?

706
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:17,120
Did he have to scold me like that?

707
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:21,480
- He's so mean.
- Don't do this.

708
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,680
There, there.

709
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,880
She ditched you.

710
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:34,120
Yes, she ditched me.

711
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,160
She hurt me.

712
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,200
I'm well aware of that.

713
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,680
I don't need anyone to tell me.

714
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,120
I want to deal with this by myself.

715
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,880
You have no right to stick your nose in.

716
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,680
He's so mean.

717
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,800
He's just so mean.

718
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,560
Is it still itchy?

719
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,080
Have you applied some balm?

720
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,960
There's one on my neck I can't reach.

721
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:17,960
Let me help you.

722
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,880
I'm sorry for what they did.

723
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,160
They're not normally like that.

724
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,920
That girl…

725
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,440
Cheewan.

726
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,240
She's the daughter of Mom Kratin.

727
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:49,600
The other one is Poncheewa.

728
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,480
She's Mrs. Kedsara's daughter.

729
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,480
Jon, you're supposed to keep them apart,

730
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,040
but you have put them closer.

731
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,760
You won't get the 500 baht anymore.

732
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:04,960
Oh no.

733
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,800
That was a smart question

734
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,200
about whether a married woman
should be doing that.

735
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:14,560
I should have felt ashamed.

736
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:18,760
I deserve to be insulted by her.

737
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,360
What's going on with you?

738
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,880
You said things aren't going well.

739
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,880
Nava cheated on me.

740
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,000
Someone saw him take a woman to a hotel,

741
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:53,520
even after he promised me
that I was the only one for him.

742
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,800
Did you ask him about it?

743
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,120
He said it was just a fling

744
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:01,200
and that he wasn't serious about her.

745
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,080
He said I was being petty

746
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,120
and that my expectations
of him were too high.

747
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,640
I tried to get over it.

748
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,280
I worked to make myself forget about it.

749
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,240
So you went back to work.

750
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:18,920
That's right.

751
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,680
Please let me renovate your house.

752
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,280
Please don't chase me away.

753
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:33,280
I'll go mad if I have to stay home.

754
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:28,560
You're right.
I don't have the right to get involved.

755
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,440
I don't have the right to mean well.

756
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,600
I'm just a servant.

757
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:36,320
Don't pretend I'm your friend
if this is all it takes to make you mad.

758
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,640
You probably don't regard me
as your friend.

759
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:22,360
About yesterday, I want to…

760
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,920
Muslin and I have known each other
for over ten years.

761
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,400
Even though we have broken up,

762
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:35,080
I still consider her a friend,
and I was worried about her.

763
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:38,480
You and Poncheewa are close.

764
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:39,720
I'm sure you've argued,

765
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,560
but you still care
about each other, right?

766
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,280
The same goes for me and Muslin.

767
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:49,520
Cheewan.

768
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,920
You're back, Mr. Saruj.

769
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:00,480
Well…

770
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,480
Did the girls come here?

771
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,520
No, sir.

772
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:08,200
They went to enroll
at Ramkhamhaeng University.

773
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:11,160
They asked me to tell you
that they won't come here anymore

774
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,640
because they have to focus
on their studies.

775
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,760
Mr. Saruj, Ms. Venus made you some food.

776
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,480
She wanted to eat with you,

777
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,600
but she couldn't wait and left.

778
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,120
Do you want me to heat up the food?

779
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,240
I'll go lock the gate then.

780
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,240
It's waist-high.

781
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:00,120
There you go.

782
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,160
Chest-high.

783
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:02,760
Chest-high.

784
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,040
Ms. Cheewan.

785
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:07,520
Yes?

786
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:11,160
Mr. Saruj can't find his notebook.

787
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:13,360
He said you cleaned his room,

788
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,920
so he wants you to help him look for it.

789
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,320
Which notebook?

790
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,560
Well…

791
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,800
I don't know.
I think you should talk to him.

792
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,120
He's waiting.

793
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:30,120
I'm not free. I'm busy playing this now.

794
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,200
What?

795
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,240
- Look at this, Jon.
- Okay.

796
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,640
My gosh, you're so good.

797
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37,200
Come on, Jon. Try it.

798
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,480
Me?

799
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,640
Yes. Come on.

800
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,280
- All right.
- Come on.

801
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,800
Jon.

802
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,360
- Jon.
- Jon.

803
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,400
My gosh.

804
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,280
Please lower it.

805
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,000
A bit more.

806
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,640
Come on, Jon.

807
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:57,160
Some more.

808
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:03,800
Am I good?

809
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:06,520
Awesome, but the jump was so unnecessary.

810
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:11,760
That's it.

811
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:13,320
Where are you going?

812
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,080
We need to find the notebook.

813
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,960
I'm not going. Let's continue.
We're up to ear level now.

814
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:19,960
Ear level.

815
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,320
Come on.

816
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,680
Mr. Saruj said he wanted to have lon puu.

817
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:48,600
Can you make it?

818
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:49,840
He's waiting at his house.

819
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:54,760
I'm not free.
I'm making soup for Madam Orn.

820
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:57,280
Okay.

821
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:10,560
Ms. Cheewan.

822
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,160
Ms. Cheewan.

823
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:16,640
Mr. Saruj needs to talk to you
about an important matter.

824
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:17,920
I'm not free.

825
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:19,400
What are you doing?

826
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:20,600
I'm chilling out.

827
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:23,160
Okay.

828
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:21,000
I'm a bad person.

829
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:23,960
I'm a bad person.

830
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,800
I've let my parents down.

831
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,040
I'm in Thailand.

832
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:47,680
I miss you so much. I'll go see you.

833
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,160
Gosh, it's a Tamagotchi.

834
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,120
"For Cheewan."

835
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:23,360
For me?

836
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:28,360
I wonder who it's from.

837
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:37,040
Come on.

838
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:40,360
Hey, Tamagotchi. Come here.

839
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:45,080
Where are you going? Come back.

840
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,600
Tamagotchi.

841
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,560
Gosh, you.

842
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:01,880
Fine.

843
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,720
It's for you.

844
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,120
Who says I want it?

845
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:31,160
If I hadn't lured you with a toy,
then I wouldn't get to see you.

846
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:35,640
I said I don't want it.

847
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:37,640
I just wanted to look at it.

848
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:39,840
Are you still mad at me?

849
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,960
You were also wrong

850
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,160
for meddling in my business.

851
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,680
If you want me to apologize,

852
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,440
you must promise me not to do it again.

853
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:50,960
She ditched you.

854
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,320
Yes, she ditched me.

855
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,480
She hurt me.

856
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:57,400
I'm well aware of that.

857
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,880
I don't need anyone to tell me.

858
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:01,480
I want to deal with this by myself.

859
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,360
You have no right to stick your nose in.

860
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:11,400
Yes, I shouldn't have said that.

861
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:16,080
Do you admit now that it was also wrong

862
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:18,160
to meddle in my private matters?

863
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:21,400
Yes,

864
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,520
I won't do that again.

865
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:25,240
In that case, I'm sorry

866
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:27,040
if I was too harsh.

867
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:40,720
How about this? To make up for it,
will you take me to Siam?

868
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,360
Let's go to Siam.

869
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:43,880
Sure,

870
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:45,560
I haven't been there for ages.

871
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,600
Are you asking me out?

872
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:51,920
Westerners call it…

873
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,200
It's not a date.

874
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:54,960
Poncheewa is coming too.

875
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:58,520
Fine, let's go.

876
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:02,040
Since we're going to Siam,

877
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,400
I guess you don't want this anymore.

878
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:06,360
Thank you.

879
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:09,800
Tamagotchi.

880
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:38,120
I know a good contractor.

881
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:41,520
Why did you cut in front of me?

882
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:42,960
Ma'am.

883
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,439
This isn't wine.

884
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,160
It's called budu.

885
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,960
I have a plan to get them together.

886
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,960
- Really?
- What's the plan?

887
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,800
I have to oversee the renovation
of the house in Khao Yai?

888
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Are you okay?

889
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:03,200
Gosh.

890
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:05,479
Did you kiss my cheek?

891
01:09:06,439 --> 01:09:07,960
When you hug the one you love,

892
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,000
a warmth radiates from them.

893
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,720
It's not like when you hug someone else.

894
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:14,319
Whose hug is warmer,

895
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:16,120
Muslin's or Cheewan's?

896
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:47,920
