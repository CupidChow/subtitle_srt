1
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,480
Don't tell me he's courting Cheewan.

2
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,520
I won't let him.

3
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,960
I got it. Look.

4
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,480
Nop.

5
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,720
-You thick-skinned lord.
-You old geezer.

6
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,800
She's marrying my son.

7
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,120
I can't let this happen.

8
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,280
When she smiles or laughs,
my boring life just lights up.

9
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,120
You're the only one, Cheewan.

10
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,920
No,

11
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,000
you're exaggerating.

12
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,760
I have no other choice…

13
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,200
but to fight.

14
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,760
Since the relatives
from both families are here,

15
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,760
why don't we do a thread-tying ritual?

16
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,200
That's a good idea.

17
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,120
-That's nice.
-Yes.

18
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,280
Do it now.

19
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,040
M.R. WORAPAN DHEVAPROM

20
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,000
M.R. WORAPAN DHEVAPROM

21
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,320
This stupa is where the ashes

22
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,000
of M.R. Worapan Dhevaprom,

23
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,840
my grandpa, are kept.

24
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,240
The younger brother of M.R. Dhevapan,

25
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,160
who gave up his title

26
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,280
and came to the south to farm,

27
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,040
never returning home.

28
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,760
He's a legend here,

29
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,200
because he hid his identity
when he came here.

30
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,920
He took on a rubber tapping job
just like any other poor person.

31
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,200
He must have wanted an adventure
like young men do.

32
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,440
Probably.

33
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,320
He passed away before I was born,

34
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,760
but my mom told me

35
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,080
that he fell in love with my grandma

36
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,400
and this place.

37
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,520
-I see.
-He never acted like a palace person.

38
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,480
He never taught my mom
or his grandchildren to be one.

39
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,680
I've only been here for a few days.

40
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,160
Life here has been fun.

41
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,000
He was probably like me

42
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,640
and my mom,

43
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,440
as we feel that palace life is boring

44
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,480
with all those ceremonies and rituals.

45
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,240
That way of life isn't for everyone.

46
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,520
Your parents were clear about

47
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,280
how they felt about my visit.

48
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,440
I don't want to be in conflict with them.

49
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,680
Given how difficult this is going to be,

50
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,920
it'll be hard for me to fight on

51
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,560
if you don't help me.

52
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,560
I have to go back today.

53
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,400
I can't take any more time off.

54
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,880
Are you really going
to stay here for a month?

55
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,400
I'm planning to do that.

56
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,520
I'll miss you a lot.

57
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,440
I can't live without you anymore.

58
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,720
Gosh.

59
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,280
You're exaggerating.

60
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,920
You were fine without me before.

61
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,960
Once you get back to work,
you'll forget about me again.

62
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,280
It'll be hard.

63
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,320
Just thinking about you
having a good time with Nop

64
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,480
and your parents and relatives

65
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,720
arranging your wedding,

66
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,040
I'm already so sad.

67
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,640
It'll be torture to be without you.

68
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,800
You're acting differently.

69
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,120
But I won't fall for it.

70
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,320
Can't you come with me?

71
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,040
I don't think I can.

72
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,760
I'll wait for you
at Hua Lamphong station tomorrow.

73
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,080
I'll wait for the evening train.

74
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,600
Hold on.

75
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,960
When did I say I would go?

76
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,240
Don't wait for me there.

77
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,560
I'll wait there, just in case.

78
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,680
If you don't come back tomorrow,

79
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,280
you might come the day after.

80
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,760
I can't stay at home anyway.

81
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,480
I know that

82
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,960
I'll feel very lonely if I go back home.

83
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,280
It'll be torture.

84
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,120
Saruj.

85
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,040
I'm not going back.

86
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,360
I want to be ready, just in case.

87
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,520
If you decide to never go back again,

88
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,120
I can't do anything, can I?

89
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,600
I'll wait as long as I can.

90
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,960
I'll be as sad as I can.

91
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,320
It's how I get over something.

92
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,320
Hey.

93
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,800
Don't pressure me like this.

94
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,560
I'm not pressuring you.

95
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,280
I just want you to know how I feel.

96
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,200
I want you to understand me.

97
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,640
I'm not going back.

98
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,240
I want to rest as I planned.

99
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,200
I'm not going back.

100
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,880
I'm not going back no matter what.

101
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,640
Don't wait for me there.

102
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,040
I told you

103
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,160
that I'd feel lonely at home.

104
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,600
I can't stay there alone.

105
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,560
Just let me be.

106
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,600
I'll get going.

107
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,400
I need to pack

108
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,600
and go to the airport.

109
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,120
This is so good.

110
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,560
-Come and eat.
-Come.

111
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,680
Give her a plate.

112
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,960
Yes.

113
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,520
Thank you.

114
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,280
Here is your spoon.

115
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,200
Sai will help plan your wedding.

116
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,600
She used to work at a hotel in Bangkok.

117
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,560
She has a lot of experience in this.

118
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,080
-We also have to build a bridal house.
-Yes.

119
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,440
That will take a year.

120
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,360
Don't worry.

121
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,720
Leave the construction work to me.

122
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,080
I'll make it big and luxurious,

123
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,120
so it'll be the talk of the town.

124
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,560
Gosh.

125
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,880
Not the talk of the province?

126
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,000
Yes.

127
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,080
It's fun just to think about it.

128
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,200
-It'll be a grand event and so much fun.
-Right?

129
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,520
-Yes.
-It'll be so much fun!

130
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,240
-Congratulations.
-Exactly.

131
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,440
What's so fun?

132
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,480
My chest is about to explode already.

133
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,040
Nop.

134
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,400
You can't marry Cheewan.

135
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,520
Why not?

136
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,560
They're already engaged.

137
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,360
You missed the news.

138
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,360
Then he must break off the engagement.

139
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,680
Your son got my daughter pregnant.

140
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,320
-What?
-What? Pregnant?

141
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,040
Nop and…

142
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,120
Venus?

143
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,960
Nop.

144
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,520
Is this true?

145
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,080
Well…

146
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,600
Cheewan. Come here.

147
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,160
We need to talk.

148
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,480
How did it happen?

149
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,520
Where are they going?

150
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,480
What's going on?

151
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,920
-Pana.
-I don't know.

152
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,320
What are you eating?

153
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,120
We have steamed fish in sauce,
stir-fried bitter gourd with egg,

154
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,160
fried chicken with salt,
and some eggplants. Do you want some?

155
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,680
What happened exactly?

156
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,200
When did you and Nop…

157
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,600
sleep together?

158
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,760
When was it?

159
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,960
I never knew about this.

160
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,160
I won't answer
until you answer my question.

161
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,960
What question?

162
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,440
About Nop.

163
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,480
You said you'd never marry him.

164
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,920
Were you serious?

165
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,720
Of course.

166
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,160
Are you sure?

167
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,440
Of course.

168
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,520
Hey, are you really pregnant?

169
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,120
Let's leave that for later.
It's not important.

170
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,280
Are you crazy? How is it not important?

171
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,000
You're pregnant.

172
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,960
Well, our friendship is more important.

173
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,000
If you love Nop,

174
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,200
I won't come between you two.

175
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,480
Even if I get pregnant

176
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,960
or I have to suffer the rest of my life,

177
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,880
I'll do it for you.

178
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,960
The same goes for me.

179
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,840
I insist

180
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,200
that if you and Nop love each other,

181
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,320
I'll make way for you.

182
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,240
My dear friend.

183
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,680
Venus.

184
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,440
-Where are you?
-My mom is calling me.

185
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,080
-Let's go.
-Okay.

186
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm Lady Veena.

187
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,400
My husband is the Permanent Secretary
in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

188
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,680
What you've done

189
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,200
is an affront to my dignity.

190
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,400
I'm going to make you pay for this.

191
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,680
Please calm down.

192
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,480
If the kids love each other,

193
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,440
I believe you can talk it out.

194
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,600
No.

195
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,280
Yes, I love him so much.

196
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,920
We love each other.

197
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,240
Hold on.

198
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,800
So…

199
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,760
are you pregnant?

200
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,960
Have we ever…

201
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,640
done it?

202
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,320
There we go. I knew it.

203
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,360
I don't care who has been up to no good,

204
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,280
but it's definitely not my son.

205
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,560
How can that be?

206
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,960
Your son slept over at my house
for a few nights when I was away.

207
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,400
You've ruined my daughter's future.

208
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,800
This also ruins my son's future.

209
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,280
Hey, how can you say that?

210
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,800
Do you know that a bright future
was waiting for her?

211
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,080
She was going to continue
her studies abroad,

212
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,600
but this lowlife has put a stop to that.

213
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,040
Gosh.

214
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,440
Do you think your daughter
is the only one with a bright future

215
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,080
and that everyone who doesn't
get to study abroad is all low-class?

216
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,040
Listen.

217
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,800
My son has been an outstanding student
for six consecutive years.

218
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,680
Not only that,

219
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,800
he'll graduate with
a first-class degree with honors.

220
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,280
-That's right.
-But…

221
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,160
his future is getting crushed

222
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,880
because your daughter went
and got pregnant.

223
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,400
-My gosh.
-Yes.

224
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,360
Don't you dare blame my daughter.

225
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,320
Are you saying
she is trying to tie your son down?

226
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,560
-Well?
-Yes.

227
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,720
You filthy bastard. You're scum.

228
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,000
You're just unhygienic.

229
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,480
You keep saying I'm dirty.

230
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,440
Sir.

231
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,520
In that case, take this.

232
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,080
-Hey.
-My gosh!

233
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,720
My gosh!

234
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,640
-That's enough.
-Honey.

235
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,200
-Gosh.
-Mom.

236
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,120
That's enough. Please calm down.

237
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,120
-Do you want more?
-Gosh.

238
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,320
That's a big one, Pana.

239
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,600
Please be careful or you'll slip.

240
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,240
Pana, calm down.

241
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,640
You too, ma'am. Please listen
to what the kids have to say first.

242
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,480
Nop.

243
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,520
Are you sure you didn't make her pregnant?

244
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,840
Tell that snooty lady over there

245
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,680
that you didn't do it.

246
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,520
-Tell her.
-Do it, Nop.

247
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,720
If Cheewan isn't interested in you,

248
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,000
there are still many women out there

249
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,840
who are interested in you.

250
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,480
There's one sitting here next to you.

251
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,080
Venus.

252
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,440
Nop.

253
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,440
Well, I'm not…

254
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,480
I'm not sure.

255
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,640
-What?
-What?

256
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,120
Well…

257
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,560
We were very drunk that day.

258
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,440
And we…

259
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,360
I don't remember.

260
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,520
-Oh my.
-What?

261
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,760
It's okay.

262
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,720
If you can't remember that night,

263
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,920
then I'll consider nothing happened.

264
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,839
But in reality,

265
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,880
it was an amazing night

266
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,560
and it meant so much to me.

267
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,280
Hold on, Venus.

268
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,400
-Here we go.
-Here we go.

269
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,080
He's stopping her.

270
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,840
-It's crystal clear.
-Yes.

271
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,120
Nop, did you really do it?

272
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,320
Well, I'm not sure.

273
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,200
See? Do you get it now?

274
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,760
Your son doesn't deny it.

275
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,600
All right.
If you did it, you must admit it.

276
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,320
Fine, I'll take responsibility
for my grandchild.

277
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,400
And what about my daughter?

278
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,600
Aren't you going
to be responsible for her?

279
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,880
She's your daughter,
so the responsibility is yours.

280
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,120
Why do we have to take her in?

281
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,960
Just my grandchild is enough.

282
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,240
Besides, your daughter

283
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,760
is not suitable for my son at all.

284
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,840
How can you say that?

285
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,320
It's your son

286
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,560
who isn't suitable for my family.

287
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,200
Is that so?

288
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,320
Girl,

289
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,040
how old are you? Are you 20 yet?

290
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,640
-Yes.
-You are?

291
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,520
You're not going to jail.

292
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,280
We have the advantage.

293
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,080
Honey.

294
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,760
Cheewan can't marry Nop anymore.

295
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,280
Nop.

296
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,440
You're such a nice boy,

297
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,560
I didn't think you'd do
something like that.

298
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,480
And our whole family has witnessed it.

299
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,400
I don't think it can happen anymore.

300
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,440
I can go right.

301
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,600
Left…

302
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,680
I can't.

303
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,120
I can't go left or right.

304
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,240
I ended up here anyway.

305
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,880
Let's go.

306
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,720
-After you.
-Thank you.

307
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,880
Mo Chit, please.

308
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,600
Is something wrong?

309
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,680
What? It's nothing.

310
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,040
Nop.

311
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,640
How do you feel about Venus?

312
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,560
Well, I admire her.

313
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,480
She has a very good heart.

314
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,200
I feel at ease

315
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,120
when I'm with her.

316
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,200
On the night you kissed her,

317
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,840
were you drunk,

318
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,360
or did you get carried away by her beauty?

319
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,280
That's not it.

320
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,760
Back then, I was…

321
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,680
happy.

322
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,920
And now that you're not drunk,
do you want to do it again?

323
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,040
-Cheewan.
-Well…

324
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,360
Well…

325
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,440
Look at you.

326
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,640
You're blushing.

327
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,360
You do have feelings for her.

328
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,280
But Cheewan…

329
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,320
Yes?

330
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,840
I've always thought
that you would be my bride.

331
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,680
I'm sorry, Nop.

332
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,760
I've always seen you as my brother.

333
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,640
I got engaged to you

334
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,320
because I didn't want my mom
to lose face in front of Madam Orn.

335
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,240
So, it's over between us, right?

336
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,040
Listen, Venus is a good person.

337
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,080
She's adorable

338
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,960
even though her mom is…

339
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,440
But I think

340
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,840
you two should give it a go.

341
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,600
What can I do?

342
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,280
I already made the mistake.

343
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,520
I have to take responsibility.

344
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,040
From now on,

345
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,760
I'll be here for you, Venus.

346
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,000
You're such a gentleman.

347
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,880
I don't regret loving you.

348
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,760
Look at you.

349
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,920
-You're happy, right?
-Yes.

350
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,000
I only have one daughter.

351
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,840
I was hoping

352
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,920
to have her marry an ambassador,

353
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,800
so she'd be a madam ambassador

354
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,600
and her dad and I wouldn't have to worry.

355
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,680
But now,

356
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,760
she's ending up

357
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,720
with a good-for-nothing brat,

358
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,200
the son of a slob like you.

359
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,400
I'm as disappointed as you are.

360
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,560
I was hoping my son

361
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,920
would marry my dear friend's daughter,

362
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,360
so we could live together

363
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,200
and help each other build up our wealth,

364
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,960
not a girl from some high-class family

365
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,200
who are bold, outdated,

366
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,000
and extravagant.

367
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,720
You know, those who go to parties at night

368
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,560
and look down on others.

369
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,920
My goodness.

370
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,320
Lady Veena, please calm down.

371
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,640
Pana.

372
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,640
I'm sad.

373
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,400
My daughter is a good-for-nothing.

374
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,360
She's such a disappointment.

375
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,080
Venus!

376
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,880
And that loser too.

377
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,800
He destroyed my daughter.

378
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,640
He destroyed my life.

379
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,640
Where are the tissues, honey?

380
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,200
Tissues.

381
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,560
I'm no less sad than you.

382
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,000
Klaow,

383
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,280
will we really not get to become family?

384
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,640
I wanted to make this bond with you,

385
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,080
but now I can't do that anymore.

386
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,880
Here.

387
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,000
Lady Veena, please calm down.

388
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,920
Calm down.

389
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,520
It's okay, my friend.

390
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,440
We'll be like brothers
until the day we die. All right?

391
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,440
Those two may not become husband and wife,

392
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,840
but they can be like brothers and sisters.

393
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,440
I want them to be husband and wife.

394
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,760
What will my daughter's life be like
with a husband like that?

395
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:17,480
Will she have to suffer
on a rubber plantation?

396
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:21,080
Oh dear, my dear Venus.

397
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,240
Please don't worry about that.

398
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,880
Pana has established
a large construction company

399
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,840
in Bangkok for Nop.

400
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,040
He's just teasing you.

401
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,440
Venus won't suffer in the future.

402
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,800
Kratin, listen to me.

403
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,520
People like her

404
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,160
are never satisfied.

405
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,760
You want your daughter
to marry an ambassador, do you?

406
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,560
You can do whatever you want.

407
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,760
You can give me my grandchild.
I'll raise them myself.

408
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,680
I don't want

409
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,480
a high-class daughter-in-law.

410
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,440
Hey, are you not going to take
responsibility for her?

411
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,440
Your son got her pregnant.
Aren't you going to take responsibility?

412
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,160
This is embarrassing enough for me,
and now you're doing this.

413
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,160
Oh no, my dear Venus.

414
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,560
I'll take responsibility

415
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,520
for both Venus and our child.

416
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,680
Did I ask you to take responsibility?

417
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,960
I…

418
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,960
No. No, you didn't.

419
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,720
-Are you going to ditch my daughter?
-No.

420
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,880
No, I won't ditch her.

421
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,600
I won't.

422
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,440
I can tell he loves you.

423
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,840
See? Like a real husband and wife.

424
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,840
Please sit, ma'am.

425
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,080
-Ma'am.
-I didn't know your mom was so dramatic.

426
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,880
Aren't you used to it?

427
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,560
It's over.

428
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,000
Why…

429
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,520
are my tears sticky like this?

430
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,680
-Look.
-Let me see.

431
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,840
Well,

432
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,520
it's normal.

433
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,560
They get sticky when you're very upset.

434
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,600
Is this normal?

435
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,680
Yes.

436
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,800
I grew up here.

437
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,000
This is my family's farmland.

438
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,720
But my parents took a mortgage out on it
to pay for us to study abroad.

439
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,160
Dara wanted to study abroad.

440
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,400
We really made the wrong decision.

441
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,200
But she picked up some language skills.

442
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,320
Doesn't Dara work with foreign tourists?

443
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,000
You're right.

444
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,400
I was thinking of doing that
with her for a bit

445
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,160
and opening a shop in Bangkok later.

446
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,840
That sounds great.

447
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,360
There aren't any shops that sell
good Swiss chocolate in Thailand.

448
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,080
You might be the first person
to be successful at this in Thailand.

449
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,960
Thank you.

450
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,760
Okay.

451
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,280
It's so much fun to rest
and play games on weekends.

452
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,800
Stop thinking about it.

453
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,600
Poncheewa went on a trip
with her boyfriend

454
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,640
and the little one gets
to be with their dad.

455
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,720
Isn't it great?

456
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,880
Stop thinking about it.

457
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,920
This is the best restaurant in the area.

458
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,440
Do you have fish today?

459
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,640
Yes, ma'am.

460
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,360
Their fish are big.

461
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,240
We won't be able to eat it all.

462
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,760
It's expensive.

463
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,800
In that case, I'll get pandan chicken.

464
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,960
Sure.

465
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,720
So…

466
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,480
are you going to have a big meal?

467
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,760
I won't eat then.

468
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,680
I'm already happy to see you eat.

469
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,640
-Please bring her some rice too.
-Yes, sir.

470
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,760
I've changed my mind.
Let's have some noodles.

471
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,480
Is their pad thai good?

472
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,680
Yes.

473
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,520
-We'll get two pad thais.
-Sure.

474
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,120
Allow me to take the menus.

475
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,040
-Sure. Thank you.
-Thank you.

476
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,160
Thank you.

477
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,040
It has been so long
since I last had pad thai.

478
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,000
I'm getting hungry now.

479
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,480
I'm sorry.

480
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,360
It's just for now,

481
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,640
but it'll get better soon.

482
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,080
I'll wait for you
at Hua Lamphong tomorrow.

483
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,720
I'll wait for the evening train.

484
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,480
If you don't come back tomorrow,

485
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,960
you might come the day after.

486
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,320
I can't stay at home anyway.

487
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,560
I know that

488
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,840
I'll feel very lonely
if I go back home after work.

489
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,440
I'd rather drive my car
around Hua Lamphong.

490
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,560
Jon.

491
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,680
-Jon.
-Hey.

492
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,400
I'm back. Can you take these?

493
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,800
Gosh, you have a lot of stuff.

494
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,200
What sort of dream is this?

495
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,240
Stop dreaming. That's enough.

496
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,000
How was your trip to the south?
Did you enjoy it?

497
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,400
Yes.

498
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,240
Hey, I brought you stink beans
and melinjo leaves.

499
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,400
You can cook them with eggs.

500
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,880
It's my favorite. I'll cook it today.

501
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,800
Okay.

502
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,360
Nop did that to Venus?

503
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,080
I know, right?

504
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,920
But it already happened.

505
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,159
So you're single now.

506
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,920
You're not engaged to Nop anymore, right?

507
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,520
Yes, I'm single now.

508
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,560
I don't have to get engaged or married.

509
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,280
I don't have a boyfriend.

510
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,199
I only have my friends

511
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,000
and a big brother.

512
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,159
Thank you for coming back to me.

513
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,000
Hey.

514
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,120
I came back to register for my classes.

515
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:40,520
The deadline is approaching.

516
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,480
You know nothing.

517
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,320
Didn't you already register for them?

518
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,000
You even showed me the receipt.

519
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,320
You registered for two English courses.

520
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,160
So I guess

521
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,880
you broke up with Nop

522
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,640
and came back here
to get together with me.

523
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,440
What are you talking about?

524
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,240
I came back here
to take care of my friend.

525
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,360
Cheewa has
an antenatal appointment tomorrow.

526
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,960
You know nothing.

527
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,680
The appointment was the other day.

528
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,920
Poom already took care of it.

529
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,240
Do you have any other excuses?

530
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,560
If you don't,

531
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,560
please…

532
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,080
accept my love, will you?

533
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,920
Gosh.

534
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,080
You make no sense.
I'm tired of talking to you now.

535
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,360
Fine, I'll be like a brother for you.

536
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,600
Can I hug you like a brother then?

537
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,240
Hey, you can't do this.

538
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,120
Just stay still for two minutes.

539
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,280
Let your brother be happy
for just two minutes.

540
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,640
This is all I ask of you.

541
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,560
If you hadn't come back,

542
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,680
I'd have gone to wait for you
at Hua Lamphong again.

543
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,160
No one else's food tastes any good.

544
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,520
Who would have taken care of my house

545
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,880
and clothes?

546
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,720
Who would have made me laugh like you?

547
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,360
No one can.

548
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,000
-Take this!
-That hurts.

549
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,720
Who said you could kiss me?

550
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,360
I only let you hug me.

551
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,080
I kissed you like a brother does,

552
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,560
just like when we were little.

553
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,280
Why are you being so fierce?

554
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,920
You're so sly.

555
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,720
I gave you an inch, but you took a mile.

556
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,120
I'm not talking to you anymore.

557
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,960
Thank you for coming back.

558
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,640
Remember this.

559
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,920
How did it go?

560
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,120
I…

561
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,600
I…

562
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,080
I came here to get desserts
from Mrs. Kedsara.

563
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,600
I wanted to have some.

564
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,640
Did you two go to Suphan Buri?

565
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,000
Yes.

566
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:54,120
I took Cheewa to visit my parents.
We stayed the night.

567
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,720
How did you get there?

568
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,920
We took a bus. They go every hour.

569
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,200
What?

570
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,160
Did you take a bus there and back?

571
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,160
Yes.

572
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,560
They drive too fast.

573
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,160
Why didn't you rent a car?

574
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,960
She's pregnant with your child.

575
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,560
It's expensive to rent a car.

576
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,080
I have to be economical.

577
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,400
Yes,

578
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:21,240
and there were so many pregnant women
on the bus. Nothing happened to them.

579
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,840
You can't do this.

580
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,800
You must change yourself.

581
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,960
You can't act like a kid anymore.

582
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,440
You must take care of your wife
and child better than this.

583
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,360
You can't act like a teenager

584
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,320
with no responsibility like before.

585
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,440
I'm poor.

586
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,240
This is all I can afford.

587
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,560
This is the best I can do
to take care of her.

588
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,840
I wasn't born a Jutathep like you.

589
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,160
What's that got to do with it?

590
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,240
Everything.

591
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,760
I'm not well-off like you.

592
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,400
This world is unfair.

593
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,360
It has no place for a poor person like me.

594
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,520
Hey, come back here.

595
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,200
I'm trying to reason with you.

596
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,840
I'm not looking down on you. Come here!

597
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,200
-Come back here!
-Poom.

598
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,840
That's enough, Poom.

599
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,360
Let him go.

600
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,440
But he didn't listen to me.

601
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,320
He misunderstood me.

602
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,080
Poom, I said stop.

603
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,840
Cheewa.

604
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,920
I want to give him a chance.

605
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,560
I want my family to be together.

606
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,080
Because I'm not the dad of your child.

607
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,840
I'm not the real dad.

608
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,280
That's right.

609
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,840
You're not.

610
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,360
How are you, Mus? Are you better now?

611
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,720
I still have some bruises.

612
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,240
Thank you for thinking of me.

613
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,120
Ms. Cheewan.

614
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,320
Hey. Come here.

615
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,160
Gosh, what are you doing here?

616
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,480
-I'm watering the trees.
-What?

617
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,840
Watering the trees?

618
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,960
See this?

619
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,160
I see.

620
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,000
I already watered the trees
at Madam Orn's house,

621
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,280
so I came to water more here.

622
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,080
You're so diligent.

623
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,240
Thank you.

624
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,160
What about the lawsuit?

625
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,280
The lawyer is putting together
the final draft and will file it soon.

626
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,080
They said I'll win, no matter what.

627
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:11,080
I have also moved back to my mom's house.

628
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,640
At first, she didn't want me
to get divorced.

629
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,600
But when she saw my bruises…

630
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,280
I think she needs some time.

631
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,920
I see.

632
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,320
Well, I cleaned my room
and found some things you gave me,

633
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,400
so I wanted to give them back to you.

634
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,600
Here you go.

635
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,160
Hey.

636
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,800
Isn't this the doll
I got you on our first date?

637
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,120
You still have it.

638
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,800
I used to keep it on my bed.
I looked at it every night.

639
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,640
His eyes are glistening.

640
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,360
The ticket for our first movie.

641
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,280
Yes.

642
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,160
But I was so mad at you that day.

643
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,920
What kind of guy takes his girlfriend
to watch a horror movie?

644
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,880
Well, I wanted you to get scared
and hug me.

645
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,720
You were so sneaky.

646
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,920
Gosh, he's so annoying.

647
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,520
-This is too much.
-Gosh.

648
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,880
Ms. Cheewan.

649
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,440
You don't have to water this tree.

650
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,840
It won't grow anyway.

651
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,000
Hey, I'm sorry, Jon.

652
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,560
It's okay. I'm just all wet.

653
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,440
-You're all wet. Who did it?
-Yes.

654
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,040
Here,

655
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,480
your reward.

656
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,120
Thank you for watering my trees.

657
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,640
I guess they'll stay hydrated
until next month.

658
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,440
It's okay. There's no need to thank me.

659
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,480
We're neighbors,

660
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,480
so I need to help keep an eye on things.

661
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:30,440
Yes, you were keeping an eye on me,

662
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,960
but you're still saying…

663
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,320
Gosh, stop saying that.

664
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,760
Don't say it.

665
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,920
I've told you 100 times
that I'm just worried about you.

666
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,400
You'd better be careful.

667
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,760
They haven't divorced yet.

668
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,440
Drink it.

669
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,400
Come on.

670
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,720
You don't want me to say it
because it's true that you're…

671
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,640
Stop it.

672
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,640
I said don't say it.

673
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,800
I was just warning you.

674
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,040
Well,

675
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,600
your love must run deep.
I bet you have many fond memories of her.

676
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:14,280
Muslin always seems to irritate you.

677
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,480
It must be because…

678
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,000
I told you not to say it.

679
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,400
Fine, I won't say it.

680
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,840
I'll write it.

681
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,360
-Write it? Write what?
-Yes.

682
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,680
JEALOUS

683
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,480
Hey! I said I'm not jealous.

684
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,640
I'm not. Take it back.

685
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,160
No.

686
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,920
Mr. Saruj.

687
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:53,960
Excuse me.

688
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,960
M.R. Ruj and Mrs. Rasa need your help.

689
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,640
With what?

690
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,240
They want to have dinner with Mrs. Muslin.

691
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,520
What? Is she still here?

692
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,080
She was very close to my mom.

693
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,520
My mom is worried about her.

694
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,680
My mom invited her over to talk.

695
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,320
They have been talking
for an hour already.

696
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:22,560
Well, she must be preparing
to be their in-law.

697
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,680
Here is a list of dishes
they want you to order from this hotel.

698
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,360
It's French cuisine.

699
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,400
Mus's favorite.

700
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:36,960
Sure.

701
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,680
I'll take care of this.

702
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,400
Yes, sir.

703
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,200
Hang in there.

704
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,680
In no time,

705
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,920
she'll be divorced
and she can be your in-law.

706
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,600
French cuisine.

707
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,480
JEALOUS

708
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,560
A luxurious dinner from a hotel

709
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,120
for a dad, a mom, their son,

710
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,640
and their future daughter-in-law.

711
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:28,240
How can it beat my food?

712
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,360
It looks so appetizing.

713
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,600
Ms. Cheewan,

714
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,640
Mrs. Rasa and Mrs. Muslin
are about to eat.

715
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,240
They want more ice.

716
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,120
Get some from the fridge then.

717
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,720
I can't do that.

718
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,360
They said they want you
to serve it to them.

719
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:54,960
I don't want to.

720
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,280
Please go.

721
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,720
Fine, I'll go.

722
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,760
Do I really have to?

723
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,600
Go and take your seat.

724
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:29,960
Thank you.

725
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:42,800
Hold on.

726
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,360
Where are you going?

727
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,320
Come and sit down.

728
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,120
It's okay.

729
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,880
Please let me know
if you need anything else.

730
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,320
No.

731
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,560
Come and sit with us.

732
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,840
We laid you a place.

733
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,680
Well…

734
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,960
I'm not used to eating this kind of food.

735
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,120
I'll eat what I'm used to.

736
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,720
Cheewan.

737
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,160
My husband and I want to talk to you.

738
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,920
See? Come here.

739
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,240
-Come on.
-Okay.

740
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,040
It's okay. I'll get the chair myself.

741
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,520
Did you receive the gift
from the French ambassador?

742
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,080
Yes.

743
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:44,520
He was very impressed
by your determination in helping them.

744
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,640
Actually, I should apologize for that.

745
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:52,480
It was a big event for the Jutatheps.
It should have gone smoothly,

746
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,400
but…

747
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,360
I messed it up.

748
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,160
Who said you messed it up?

749
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:03,720
You did your best
to take care of the guests.

750
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,040
The food is here.

751
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,560
This is the starter.

752
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,560
I remember you like this.

753
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,040
Yes.

754
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,560
Let's eat.

755
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,080
You use the ones on the outside first.

756
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,760
You can use the small fork.

757
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,040
Okay.

758
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,040
Do you remember our trip to Auxerre,

759
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,040
where we spent the night at a vineyard?

760
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,320
Right.

761
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:23,920
You mean the half-timbered house
and the family with the pretty daughters?

762
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,800
-Yes.
-That's right.

763
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,320
Their eldest daughter works for the UN.

764
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,040
She recognized us.

765
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:33,400
Yes, she asked about both of you.

766
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:37,680
We went there again during school break
and stayed for two weeks.

767
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,520
Yes, that trip was so much fun.

768
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,920
Yes.

769
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:14,520
This is duck confit. It's very good.

770
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,200
Saruj asked me the other day

771
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,720
what makes a good ambassador's wife.

772
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,320
I think we should ask M.R. Pavornruj

773
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,680
as he was the youngest ambassador
in Thailand

774
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,680
thirty years ago.

775
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,400
No, we should ask
the prettiest madam ambassador.

776
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,720
She must speak many languages, right?

777
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,840
It's not really necessary.

778
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,480
Does she have to be prim and elegant?

779
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,680
That depends on the person.

780
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,600
You can't force someone
to change themselves.

781
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,400
She must know her manners

782
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,080
and be considerate of others.

783
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,480
That is more important.

784
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,440
And we think that…

785
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,880
You have all those qualities, Cheewan.

786
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,880
Do you mean me?

787
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,920
I asked my parents

788
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,440
if you would be suitable.

789
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,600
Did you ask them?

790
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,160
Why did you ask them?

791
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,400
Who wants to know this?

792
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,640
I don't want to know.

793
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,440
Listen.

794
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:04,520
The only thing
an ambassador's wife needs is…

795
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,480
-love.
-Love.

796
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:09,920
Love for her country.

797
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,360
Once she loves it, she'll know

798
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,680
what's best for the country.

799
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,080
Love her husband.

800
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,280
This will make her realize

801
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,160
what she can do to help her husband.

802
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,680
See? It's so easy.

803
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,400
It's not hard, right, Cheewan?

804
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:36,240
Tell them it's not hard.

805
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,120
Gosh.

806
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,160
Gosh, you.

807
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,640
You ruined it.

808
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,160
I want to look pretty
in front of your parents,

809
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,120
but I never have.

810
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,440
Not even once.

811
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:02,480
She reminds me of Kratin
when she was young.

812
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:05,280
Yes, you're so adorable.

813
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,840
I'm sorry.

814
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:12,960
I'm sorry.

815
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:50,560
Hey, what is it?

816
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:54,640
What did you discuss
with your parents about me?

817
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,960
You're so pretty.

818
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,440
Hey, you'll choke on your food
if you eat that way.

819
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:07,320
I'm going to film this and show it
to your friends at the ministry.

820
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,320
Can he?

821
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,320
Dad, please stop it.

822
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,400
Mom, look at him.

823
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,560
I heard what happened to Muslin.
I feel so sorry for her.

824
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:24,280
Can you set up an appointment
with her for me?

825
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:30,040
If she can get over her husband,
she'll divorce him.

826
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,320
And suppose she can divorce him.

827
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,240
What will happen between you and her?

828
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,800
I was thinking of talking
to you two about this.

829
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,680
What do you think of Cheewan?

830
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:48,320
Look at you.
You seem head over heels for her.

831
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,040
What about Mus?

832
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,760
Are you two really just friends?

833
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,000
Do you prefer Mus?

834
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:00,480
I like the person you like.

835
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,760
What about you, Dad?

836
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,280
Same here.

837
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,440
Every Jutathep

838
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:11,920
has an instinct when it comes to women.

839
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:15,240
An instinct?

840
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,480
We choose our women using our hearts.

841
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,280
If it tells you she's the right person,
then she is.

842
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:27,440
Well then, can you two

843
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,400
help me talk to her?

844
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,440
Please?

845
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,840
Please help me.

846
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,960
Let me film this as evidence.

847
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:39,200
I told them what I told your parents.

848
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:45,760
Okay, I get it now.

849
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:47,440
You want to hear it again.

850
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,840
Then listen to me carefully.

851
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,280
I love you.

852
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,560
I love you.

853
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,760
I love you.

854
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,120
No, that's not it.

855
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:04,920
I mean…

856
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:06,600
I mean

857
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,440
about being a madam ambassador.

858
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,520
Well, you're worried about that,
aren't you?

859
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:16,680
My parents said that
you're suitable to be one.

860
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,640
You just need…

861
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:21,800
love.

862
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,000
Love.

863
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,600
Gosh, you're giving me goosebumps.

864
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:31,000
My hair is standing on end. Gosh.

865
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:32,600
That's enough.

866
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:35,080
I'm not talking to you anymore.
Let's just say,

867
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,360
don't talk to other people
about me that way again.

868
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,920
It was lucky I didn't choke on the duck.

869
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,960
Hey, why is your hair standing on end?

870
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,280
I'm not a ghost.

871
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:48,560
You brat.

872
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:49,760
Hey.

873
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,360
Madam ambassador.

874
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,360
My madam ambassador.

875
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:00,600
-My madam ambassador.
-Stop it.

876
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,440
-My madam ambassador.
-I'm not one.

877
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,880
-My madam ambassador.
-No!

878
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,200
-My madam ambassador.
-No! Say it somewhere else.

879
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,200
-Mine.
-No, I don't care.

880
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,800
-My madam ambassador.
-My gosh!

881
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,320
Just go over there.

882
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,600
I'm not one.

883
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,440
I'm not.

884
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:17,720
Madam ambassador.

885
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:30,160
It's good you have some manners.

886
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:34,240
Poom, I should be the one saying that.

887
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,040
I'm sorry. I got carried away.

888
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,040
I'd like to apologize to you

889
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:53,440
and Poom for taking so long
to come and greet you.

890
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,600
At least you came.

891
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:00,000
Let bygones be bygones.

892
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,680
I've finished cleaning the room.

893
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:16,240
Good. You should go and take some rest.

894
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,800
Make yourself at home, Dalad.

895
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:21,080
Please take care of Poncheewa for me.

896
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,120
Okay.

897
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,960
-This way.
-Okay.

898
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,000
Hey!

899
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:37,400
Hold on.

900
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:48,480
How could you let Cheewa
carry such a big bag?

901
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,400
I'm fine.

902
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,520
I'm stronger now.

903
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,680
The doctor also told me
to get some exercise.

904
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:07,800
Let's go, Dalad.

905
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:09,320
Okay.

906
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,200
I won't argue
about how you take care of Cheewa.

907
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,880
You've done a really good job
of taking care of her.

908
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:31,840
But

909
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:35,480
you can't compete with the biological dad.

910
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,920
Are you also taking Dalad's side?

911
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,800
Well, what did Dalad do wrong?

912
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,960
They're a family.

913
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,800
Why are you getting in their way?

914
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,560
I'm not,

915
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:51,760
but I could do a better job than him.

916
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,080
Just wait and see.

917
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:56,480
I'll prove to you
that I can be a better dad than Dalad.

918
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:01,160
Do you know what you can never
be better than Dalad at?

919
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,640
I'm telling you there's nothing.

920
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,840
Status, appearance, IQ, EQ.

921
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,240
I'm better than him in every way.

922
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,040
You and Poncheewa don't love each other.

923
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:11,560
The love between siblings

924
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,840
isn't the same as that between lovers.

925
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:16,760
That's true.

926
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,040
Do you know that?

927
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:19,760
If you knew,

928
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,800
I wouldn't have to suffer like this.

929
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,560
Pass.

930
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,280
Please go to the next question.

931
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,920
How do you know I don't like Poncheewa?

932
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,320
What?

933
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,520
Well…

934
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,520
I can't tell.

935
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,240
Just like you can't tell.

936
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,680
Pass.

937
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,680
I'm not doing this anymore.
I'll get going.

938
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:58,280
Poom, this isn't something
you should compete over.

939
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:59,920
Just step aside for Dalad

940
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,720
or you'll put Poncheewa
in a difficult situation.

941
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:38,440
When you feel bad,

942
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:41,920
think of our child.

943
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,160
You're right.

944
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,160
Little one,

945
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,920
please root for me, okay?

946
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:14,760
This restaurant serves good food.
Eat plenty, Dalad.

947
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:15,920
Sure.

948
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,720
Cheewa told me you're a good cook.

949
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,560
Which restaurant do you work at?

950
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:24,320
I'm not that good.

951
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,280
I just work in a regular cafe.

952
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,000
I don't think I could be a chef.

953
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:36,720
What are you saying, Dalad?
You're so skillful.

954
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,960
Dad, Dalad is very good
at making desserts.

955
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:44,600
He just sold a chocolate recipe
to the cafe owner.

956
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:49,520
If you came up with your own recipe,

957
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:52,640
then I'm sure you can come up
with more recipes.

958
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:57,280
The harder you work at it,
the more you will progress.

959
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:00,240
You'll be able to have
your own business in the future.

960
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,760
That's right.

961
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,920
The chocolate recipe only made
a few tens of thousands.

962
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,080
I don't think
I can build a fortune with it.

963
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:15,760
Don't you want to start
your own business in the future?

964
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:20,840
With my salary and what I got
for my chocolate recipes,

965
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:24,400
I think running a business for me

966
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,080
is probably impossible.

967
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:29,640
You don't want to take risks
or think outside the box.

968
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:34,440
Are you thinking of being an employee
and selling chocolate until you die?

969
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,440
Vit.

970
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:40,440
Listen.

971
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:42,360
Before,

972
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:44,960
I used to make desserts for sale.

973
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:47,760
I also started small.
We can talk about this later.

974
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:50,040
That's right.

975
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,280
But let's eat first

976
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:54,080
before the food gets cold.

977
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,560
-Sure.
-Dig in.

978
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,080
-Let's dig in.
-Sure.

979
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:02,840
If you need financial support,
there are many of us here.

980
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,440
-Gosh.
-Thank you so much.

981
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:07,760
Enjoy.

982
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:15,240
You should eat up too.

983
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:16,440
Okay.

984
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,360
Let's eat.

985
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:21,040
Tell me how it is, chef.

986
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,840
I'll see you next week.

987
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,560
Meanwhile, I'll make a list of the things
our child will need.

988
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,200
Let's buy them together.

989
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:36,800
Are you still thinking
about what they said?

990
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,400
I can't blame them.

991
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:42,000
They're your family.

992
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:47,760
My parents

993
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,920
just want to be confident

994
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,880
that you won't leave me.

995
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:55,160
I'll never leave you, but…

996
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:57,840
I'm not sure about giving you
a comfortable life--

997
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:01,480
We can work on it together slowly.

998
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:03,280
You know what?

999
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:05,760
No one is born successful.

1000
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:11,120
I'll fight for you

1001
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,680
and you,

1002
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,240
my little one.

1003
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:21,920
Get home safely
and tell me when you arrive.

1004
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,480
Okay.

1005
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,520
Mr. Saruj, when the rope is ready,

1006
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,360
please toss it over that branch.
I'll climb up and cut it.

1007
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:04,360
Okay.

1008
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:05,920
Saruj.

1009
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:13,880
I need your advice.
I couldn't sleep last night.

1010
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,400
What is it?

1011
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:18,040
When did you realize
that your feelings for Cheewan

1012
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:19,960
aren't just brotherly?

1013
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:20,960
And how did you know?

1014
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:27,760
I'll go cook some congee for Madam Orn.

1015
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:29,160
Hey.

1016
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:35,960
Saruj.

1017
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,880
Where are you going, you naughty girl?

1018
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:40,520
-Saruj! What are you doing?
-Mr. Saruj, you're so cool.

1019
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:44,120
Jon.

1020
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:48,920
I like cowboy movies.

1021
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,440
I practiced this for a while.

1022
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,120
Stay here, you naughty girl.

1023
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,560
Don't run away from me again.

1024
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:59,360
Just tell me. This is stressing me out.

1025
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,400
Then you need to test your feelings.

1026
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:06,560
Cheewan.

1027
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,880
Can you go and get Poncheewa?

1028
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:46,319
I have a lot of evidence

1029
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:49,160
showing you embezzled money
from construction projects.

1030
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:52,439
Mr. Nava, if you want to get
another charge for assaulting me,

1031
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:53,640
then go ahead.

1032
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:55,160
May you prosper.

1033
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:56,640
Hey.

1034
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:59,040
-You must hug me to congratulate me.
-Nat.

1035
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,240
-Let go of me.
-Damn you.

1036
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:07,439
Do think everyone will give in to you
just because you're rich?

1037
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,560
Just go home, you liar.

1038
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:12,640
You're not welcome here anymore. Go.

1039
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:16,080
This is such a tough battle.
I can't let you wage it alone.

1040
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:17,840
There's a saying that goes,

1041
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,040
"Love the person who loves you

1042
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,279
more than you love them."

1043
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,279
Make a smart choice, Nop.

1044
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:26,960
You're awesome, Venus.

1045
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:57,160
