My Dear Brothers EP10

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 10

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Let them go.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I promise you.

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hao Quan.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
No!

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
vendor.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Even if you get into my body,

9
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,000
it's also a cage.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You can't reincarnate from this point on.

11
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,200
You will watch all of me go to die.

12
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,000
You did it on purpose?

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You want me to aka you?

14
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,000
Then kill me.

15
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,080
좋은ちょ כ yea?

16
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,360
It's urgent.

17
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,700
Do you hear me?

18
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,720
You can't get away from me

19
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,560
without missing me!

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I know all.

21
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,560
But she doesn't always answer me.

22
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,360
Why can't I rest is because...

23
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,120
There are no means to step back?

24
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,480
I want to learn retreat.

25
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,680
Do you know

26
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,280
if I bolt at the end of the

27
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,960
rapes,

28
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,280
does love and hate

29
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,520
pretend to be gentleman ?

30
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,980
Er, let go of me

31
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,480
Old bauener, it's you again

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,660
Little rascal niin

33
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,760
Jian's gone

34
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,100
Well, see whose stride is deeper

35
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,160
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,040
Li Li.

37
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,040
This is the formation map

38
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,120
we saw in the underground of Wanlong.

39
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,240
Li Li.

40
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:03,960
How is it?

41
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,800
The battle is long.

42
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,440
The transformation skill is strong.

43
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,120
Once it succeeds,

44
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,920
Ao Jue will become

45
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,720
his puppet.

46
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,920
Is there any other way?

47
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,800
It's good to have one.

48
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,200
But...

49
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,520
Chengping.

50
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,800
He's about to die.

51
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,360
Li Li.

52
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,000
Is there any other way?

53
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,240
Is this Ao Feng's mother?

54
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,240
Yes.

55
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,600
It seems that Ao Feng is also a poor child.

56
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,960
Poor.

57
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,560
Pity.

58
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,400
I'm counting on you.

60
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,680
The soul-parting skill is the ancient skill.

61
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,120
Once the primordial spirit is separated,

62
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,600
you'll die.

63
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,960
Even if you save Ao Jue,

64
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,240
you'll die.

65
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,320
I've made up my mind.

66
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,120
Ast losses could go ham by the same path.

67
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,160
I wish the wind can reduce hares,

68
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,800
and my father can love rather more.

69
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:04,920
Sister.

70
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:05,960
Is it true?

71
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,280
Don't worry.

72
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,600
Li Li is here to Cor risen to퍼.

73
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,080
You'll help us.

74
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,080
Go and guard outside.

75
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,080
Go outside and guard.

76
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,320
Don't let anyone come in and disturb you.

77
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,120
Can you not hear me?

78
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,480
Li Wen!

79
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,980
Ming terus

80
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,820
Ming neon

81
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,820
My

82
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,820
Your

83
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,820
Your

84
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:20,820
My feet, my shoulders, will become my strength.

85
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:26,820
Never let me down.

86
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,820
Don't let my heart be broken.

87
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,820
I am the only one for you.

88
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:40,820
I am the only one for you.

89
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,820
My name is my love.

90
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:48,820
I will always remember you.

91
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:53,820
I can't help but miss myself.

92
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,820
I am here. Don't be afraid.

93
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,820
It's not the time to show your love.

94
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,820
Let's crush them first.

95
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,820
Don't be afraid.

96
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,820
Don't be afraid.

97
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,820
Don't be afraid.

98
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:32,820
My feet, my shoulders, will become my strength.

99
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,820
Never let me down.

100
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,820
Don't let my heart be broken.

101
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,820
I am the only one for you.

102
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,820
I am the only one for you.

103
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:52,820
I am the only one for you.

104
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,820
I am the only one for you.

105
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,820
I am the only one for you.

106
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,820
Yan Shun!

107
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,820
Everything you see is a demon.

108
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,820
You must not be fooled by the demon.

109
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
You must let go of everything before you can succeed.

110
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,820
Kill me.

111
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,820
Kill me.

112
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,820
Kill me.

113
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,820
Come on.

114
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,820
Come on.

115
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,820
Sister Yuzi, save me.

116
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,820
Brother Zhen Xuan.

117
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,820
My good sister, I am cold.

118
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,820
Don't leave me.

119
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,820
Brother Zhen Xuan, thank you.

120
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,820
You saved my life.

121
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,820
I will not forget.

122
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,820
But I have something important to do now.

123
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,820
I can't be with you for too long.

124
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,820
I am your husband.

125
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,820
You don't love me anymore.

126
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,820
Brother Zhen Xuan,

127
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,820
I will never forget you.

128
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,820
Every time I want to retreat,

129
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,820
you will tell me

130
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,820
that the most in the world is the dragon.

131
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,820
But now,

132
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,820
I am going to save the one I care about.

133
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,820
Thank you.

134
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,820
Farewell.

135
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,820
Sister Yuzi,

136
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,820
farewell.

137
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,820
Ming Kan,

138
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,820
stop it.

139
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,820
Why?

140
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,820
Why do you love Ao Quan and Wu Zhen Xuan

141
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,820
but not me?

142
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,820
I am the one who is drunk with you.

143
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,820
I love you more.

144
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,820
Who are you?

145
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,820
What?

146
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,820
You are Ao Feng,

147
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,820
Zhang Ming Kan,

148
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,820
and my dear mask master.

149
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,820
I am your master.

150
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,820
I am your master.

151
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,820
He is my dear mask master.

152
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,820
My dear mask master,

153
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,820
he saved me from danger,

154
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,820
taught me to live a peaceful life,

155
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,820
and taught me to be a good person.

156
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,820
I love Zhang Ming Kan.

157
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,820
He knows I am cold,

158
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,820
knows I like him,

159
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,820
and treats me like his brother.

160
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,820
As for Ao Feng,

161
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,820
I have been thinking about you for years.

162
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,820
Because I am like you,

163
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,820
I am old and lonely.

164
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,820
But only you,

165
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,820
you are always hiding under the mask,

166
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,820
never letting me see clearly.

167
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,820
What about Ao Quan?

168
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,820
Can he see clearly?

169
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,820
No.

170
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,820
At least he gave me a chance to see clearly.

171
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,820
I can't say anything when I am sad.

172
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,820
But as long as I love you,

173
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,820
it will never end.

174
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,820
Yun Shu, don't waste time.

175
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,820
Kill him.

176
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,820
It's too late.

177
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,820
Let them go.

178
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,820
I will stay with you.

179
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,820
I will stay with you.

180
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,820
I will stay with you.

181
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,820
I will stay with you.

182
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,820
I will stay with you.

183
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,820
I will stay with you.

184
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,820
I will stay with you.

185
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,820
I will stay with you.

186
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,820
I will stay with you.

187
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,820
I will stay with you.

188
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,820
I will stay with you.

189
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,820
I will stay with you.

190
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,820
I will stay with you.

191
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,820
I will stay with you.

192
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,820
I will stay with you.

193
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,820
I will stay with you.

194
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,820
I will stay with you.

195
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,820
I will stay with you.

196
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,820
I will stay with you.

197
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,820
I will stay with you.

198
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,820
I will stay with you.

199
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,820
I will stay with you.

200
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,820
I will stay with you.

201
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,820
I will stay with you.

202
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,820
I will stay with you.

203
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,820
I will stay with you.

204
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,820
I will stay with you.

205
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,820
I will stay with you.

206
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,820
I will stay with you.

207
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,820
I can't say it out.

208
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,820
The pain of love is like this.

209
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:57,820
I won't end the story.

210
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,820
Because of the story

211
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,820
After a thousand years

212
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,820
Love you through the years

213
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,820
Running to meet you

214
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,820
I don't want to end the story

215
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,820
Because of the story

216
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,820
After a thousand years

217
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,820
Sadness doesn't say anything

218
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,820
The pain of love is like this

219
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:48,820
I won't end the story
