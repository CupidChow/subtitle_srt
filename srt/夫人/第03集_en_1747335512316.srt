My Dear Brothers EP10

2
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,000
Madam.

3
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,520
Wash it quickly.

4
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,240
Long'er,

5
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,000
you're so rude.

6
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:49,720
Get out.

7
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,400
If you call me Long'er again,

8
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,720
I'll show you how rude I am.

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,480
Have you forgotten our three rules?

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,600
No.

11
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,520
I'm just your bodyguard.

12
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,840
But

13
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,760
I need to protect myself.

14
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,680
Are you afraid?

15
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,040
You want to threaten me?

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,280
No.

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,880
I think you're handsome

18
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,640
and you're young.

19
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,280
I don't dislike you.

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,080
Why don't you marry me

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,040
and be the princess of my Donghai Palace?

22
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,240
Long'er,

23
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,760
I think you're crazy.

24
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,160
Although

25
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,360
I'm against marriage with the Human Clan,

26
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,320
my father will understand me.

27
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,600
Shen Yun Shu,

28
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,800
I won't treat you badly.

29
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,040
Madam,

30
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,760
do you need help from Chong Ming?

31
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,600
Chong Ming,

32
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,000
get Long'er out of here.

33
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:44,920
Chong Ming,

34
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,320
if you don't want to be beaten by me,

35
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,760
don't bother.

36
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,400
We both have no power now.

37
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,600
In terms of skill,

38
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,600
it's not certain who will be the leader.

39
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,480
Chong Ming,

40
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,680
don't waste your energy

41
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,160
and ruin my plan.

42
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,080
You won't get the Dragon Bead.

43
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:04,880
Long'er,

44
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,480
it's okay if I don't get it.

45
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,800
As long as you don't get it,

46
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,480
I'll be happy.

47
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,400
Really?

48
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,760
Hold on,

49
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,480
lighter.

50
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,800
Get out!

51
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,960
Who knew you can ban this so severely?

52
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,800
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,080
So this is the ban you were talking about.

54
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,800
Untie us now.

55
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,880
How?

56
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,800
I don't know how to do it.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,640
Focus on the spirit.

58
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,600
Unleash the meditation.

59
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,280
Do you realize your mistake?

60
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,400
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,200
What about you, Long?

62
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,680
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,560
What?

64
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,480
I didn't hear you.

65
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,200
Madam, I'm sorry.

66
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,800
You little brat.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Wait and see.

68
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,480
It seems that someone hasn't realized his mistake.

69
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,760
You're so annoying.

70
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,120
How can you hear that?

71
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,320
Chong Ming, go back to your room.

72
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,520
As for Long Er,

73
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,080
kneel here until you repent sincerely.

74
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,880
I didn't expect this to be useful.

75
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,200
Let's go.

76
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,800
Brother Yu, don't be afraid.

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,080
I'm going to protect you.

78
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,560
Can only see Long Zhu from me.

79
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,320
Is it enough?

80
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,600
is the key to the Dragon.

81
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,560
I'll get it no matter what.

82
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,640
The Dragon Bead is the Dragon King's life.

83
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,520
If I don't let go of it,

84
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,920
I'll kill you.

85
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,120
Despicable monster.

86
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,120
You have a helper.

87
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,840
Who are you?

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Who am I?

89
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,400
The important thing is that the Dragon Bead can only be mine.

90
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,200
The Dragon Bead is a secret treasure of the Dragon Clan.

91
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,120
It's a rare talent.

92
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,200
How did you know about the Dragon Bead?

93
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:54,720
The Dragon Bead is a long-lasting

94
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,880
treasure.

95
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,440
Brother Zhenxuan, they are immortals.

96
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,480
Don't talk.

97
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,440
Who's there?

98
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,440
Come out.

99
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,560
Little girl,

100
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,600
give me this bead.

101
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,200
I can fulfill any of your wishes.

102
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,960
Can I have any wishes?

103
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,720
Of course.

104
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,480
It's fake.

105
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,560
He's lying to you.

106
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,960
What's this?

107
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,360
Dragon Bead.

108
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,480
We were planted by the Dragon Bead.

109
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,080
Give me the Dragon Bead.

110
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,680
Brother Zhenxuan.

111
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,000
Brother Zhenxuan.

112
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,640
The seven-leaf clover has been cut.

113
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,920
We are destined to be the servants of the little girl.

114
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,440
I'll go back to Shanggu first.

115
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,680
I'll protect Youqi.

116
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,040
What's going on?

117
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,560
The Dragon Bead is a pearl.

118
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,960
The seven-leaf clover has been planted.

119
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,480
The seven-leaf clover will be connected to the master.

120
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,160
The girl will kill them.

121
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,360
The culprit will be punished.

122
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,400
Only her blood can restore our power.

123
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
The Seven-leaf Clover

124
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,120
The Seven-leaf Clover

125
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,120
The Seven-leaf Clover

126
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,120
The Seven-leaf Clover

127
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,120
The Seven-leaf Clover

128
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,120
The Seven-leaf Clover

129
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,120
The Seven-leaf Clover

130
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,120
The Seven-leaf Clover

131
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,720
Madam.

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
As your bodyguard,

133
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,680
what happened today

134
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,800
is my mistake.

135
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,000
I promise you

136
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,240
that it won't happen again.

137
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,920
How is Long'er?

138
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,560
She has fainted.

139
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,120
She's really desperate.

140
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,880
It seems that

141
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,080
she can't be carried by the way of a bird.

142
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,160
She needs to find some books to read.

143
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,200
I'll go to the library to read.

144
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,200
Wait a minute.

145
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,520
Thank you for yesterday.

146
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,760
It's my honor to serve you.

147
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,360
You're a good student.

148
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,880
People have to bow down

149
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,480
under the roof.

150
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
I've always been a teacher.

151
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,040
Is there anything else

152
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,320
that I don't know about the Dragon Bead?

153
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,000
The one who is separated from you

154
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,920
will be called back automatically

155
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,120
when you are hurt.

156
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,080
After fulfilling your three wishes,

157
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,000
the Qi will be removed automatically.

158
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,720
Or

159
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,720
you can give up your life.

160
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,400
There is only one Dragon Bead.

161
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,080
If I give it to you,

162
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,800
with the character of Aujue,

163
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,800
he will kill me.

164
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,040
As long as you promise to cooperate with me,

165
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,760
I'm willing to protect you for the rest of my life.

166
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,280
Are you his opponent?

167
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,440
With the Dragon Bead,

168
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,600
Aujue is not my opponent.

169
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
So confident.

170
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,720
Because I have something he doesn't have.

171
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:58,960
What?

172
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,360
Brain.

173
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,240
Is anyone else's brain?

174
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,720
So ì¦¥hanshan.

175
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,080
You're very smart and humorous.

176
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,560
Wait for me.

177
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,720
What's wrong with me?

178
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,640
Every time you use the power of Seven Yin,

179
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,840
it will consume your Golden Goose God.

180
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,000
If you don't want to become a dragon,

181
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,720
a lunatic, or a fool,

182
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,760
you should use the power of the forbidden.

183
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,840
It's all my fault.

184
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,000
Any power needs to pay a price.

185
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,000
This is probably the way he wants to get the Dragon Pearl.

186
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,920
This selfish,

187
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,800
simple-minded second wife.

188
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,120
I'm not that stupid.

189
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,720
Eat first.

190
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,920
I have to make up for it.

191
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,520
I'm sorry.

192
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,520
I'm sorry.

193
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,520
I'll make up for it.

194
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,520
Anyway,

195
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,320
welcome to the restaurant.

196
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,920
This meal is all for you.

197
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,120
Is this for human?

198
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,720
This fish is not a sea fish.

199
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,720
And it's been put for a long time.

200
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,720
Is this grass or leaves?

201
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,120
You usually eat this.

202
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,920
It also has a smell of mud.

203
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,720
Is it good, Chong Ming?

204
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,920
The food tastes good.

205
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,320
The lady is beautiful.

206
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,920
Chong Ming.

207
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,320
She poisoned the food.

208
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,520
Even if we are evil,

209
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,520
you can't say such disgusting words.

210
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,120
You can leave without eating.

211
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,920
There's no need to stay here.

212
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,520
There's no need to be here

213
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,120
to talk and make people feel quiet.

214
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,920
Don't be angry, lady.

215
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,120
Aujue is deliberately making you angry.

216
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,120
He's using your energy and strength.

217
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,520
Aujue.

218
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,320
I think you're not enough to be punished.

219
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,520
I think so.

220
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,720
I'm afraid of you.

221
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,720
I'm afraid of you.

222
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,120
I'm afraid of you.

223
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,120
I'll deduct the compensation

224
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,320
from your salary.

225
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,320
Lady, the rooms of the two guests have been cleaned.

226
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,120
What happened here

227
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,320
is not allowed to be spread.

228
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,720
Yes, lady.

229
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,720
You can leave first.

230
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,720
Yes.

231
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,720
Would you like to take a look at your room

232
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,920
and then continue?

233
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,920
Please.

234
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,720
Wait.

235
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,720
What's wrong, Long'er?

236
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,320
If you call me Long'er again,

237
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,520
I'll move out right now.

238
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,720
Then you have to ask my bodyguard

239
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,720
if he agrees.

240
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,920
You can continue.

241
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,920
I have to do something very important.

242
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,120
Yes, lady.

243
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,920
Keep an eye on him.

244
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,920
This is your task for tonight.

245
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,520
Yes, lady.

246
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,720
That's what happened.

247
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,320
I also think it's suspicious.

248
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,520
But what I said is true.

249
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,920
I saw it with my own eyes.

250
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,320
You escaped from your men

251
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,320
and hurt yourself like this.

252
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,720
It seems that the two people around this lady

253
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,720
are not ordinary people.

254
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,920
Are you all right?

255
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,520
I'm fine.

256
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,120
That's good.

257
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,120
Go and solve Zhao Xuyang and Zeng Yiniang.

258
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,320
Then send someone

259
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,120
to check the system of the Shanyun Book.

260
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,720
Yes.

261
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,720
Father, mother,

262
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,920
I became the chairman of Dongsheng Trade Company.

263
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,720
I have enough strength

264
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,120
to fight against the murderer of the Mou family.

265
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,920
You wait for me to avenge you.

266
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,920
I will become my strength

267
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,920
and accompany myself.

268
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,520
Don't be afraid of me.

269
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,520
This dream is just my one and only.

270
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:17,120
My life is destined to you.

271
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,720
My name, my meaning

272
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,720
have been turned into a strong and gentle memory.

273
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:32,520
I can't help but look at myself.

274
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,720
I will become my strength and accompany myself.

275
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,920
My name, my meaning

276
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,120
have been turned into a strong and gentle memory.

277
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,920
My name, my meaning

278
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,120
have been turned into a strong and gentle memory.

279
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:19,320
My name, my meaning

280
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,720
have been turned into a strong and gentle memory.

281
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:28,520
My name, my meaning

282
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,720
have been turned into a strong and gentle memory.
