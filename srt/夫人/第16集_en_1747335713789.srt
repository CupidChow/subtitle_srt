00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
My Little Princess

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 4

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,800
Yuzu.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,760
Yuzu.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,800
Sister.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Sister.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Sister.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Madam.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Yushu.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Sister.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Madam.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Madam.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Madam.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Sister.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What's wrong with me?

16
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,120
You fainted.

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,120
Do you feel anything wrong?

18
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,600
Nothing.

19
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,240
I'm just a little tired.

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,120
Say it again.

21
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,120
What happened just now?

22
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,440
I came in with my sister just now.

23
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,160
Then she cried.

24
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,000
She fainted right after that.

25
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,600
If you dare to play tricks,

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,080
I'll kill you.

27
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,400
Chongming,

28
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,880
it's not about her.

29
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,000
I was gambling and I was blind.

30
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,360
I was gambling and I was blind.

31
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,640
I was a little hurt.

32
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,120
Go back.

33
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,880
You're back.

34
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,880
How is it?

35
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,000
Is it beautiful?

36
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,240
What are you doing?

37
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,560
I saw that the house was cold.

38
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,280
My sister has also grown up recently.

39
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,760
I decorated it with Aojue.

40
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,880
It's a celebration.

41
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,000
So many seafood.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I haven't seen it.

43
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,400
Did you make all of this?

44
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,960
Most of it is made by me.

45
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,000
Aojue brought the ingredients.

46
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,160
Where is Aojue?

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm back.

48
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
I'm back.

49
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,600
I'm back.

50
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
I'm back.

51
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
I'm back.

52
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
I'm back.

53
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
I'm back.

54
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,600
I'm back.

55
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
I'm back.

56
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,600
I'm back.

57
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
I'm back.

58
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,600
I'm back.

59
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
I'm back.

60
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,600
I'm back.

61
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,600
I'm back.

62
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
I'm back.

63
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,600
I'm back.

64
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,600
I'm back.

65
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,600
I'm back.

66
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
I'm back.

67
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,600
I'm back.

68
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,600
I'm back.

69
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,600
I'm back.

70
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
I'm back.

71
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
I'm back.

72
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
I'm back.

73
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
I'm back.

74
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
I'm back.

75
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,600
I'm back.

76
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,600
Madam.

77
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Happy birthday.

78
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
Please have some cake.

79
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
You got it wrong.

80
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,200
Today is not my sister's birthday.

81
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,800
My sister's birthday is in January.

82
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,800
I've seen it.

83
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,800
No.

84
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,600
Your sister's birthday is the fifth day of Yin Li's birth.

85
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,600
I almost forgot.

86
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,800
To hide my identity,

87
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,000
I changed Yin Li's birthday to Yang Li's.

88
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,600
It's been so many years.

89
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,800
How did you know?

90
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,400
Aojue found out.

91
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,400
You're not a fake model.

92
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
You're really a big guy.

93
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
You're really funny.

94
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
Okay.

95
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,400
I'll take the flowers.

96
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,400
Thank you for celebrating my birthday.

97
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
Let's have some cake first.

98
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,400
Thank you, Li Li.

99
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,400
As long as you're happy.

100
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,400
Please sit down.

101
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
High-class heart.

102
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,400
Despicable.

103
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,400
So many seafood.

104
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,400
I haven't eaten it yet.

105
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,400
Let me taste your cooking.

106
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
Where did you get these?

107
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,400
These are the relatives of the villagers.

108
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,400
Your relatives are the ones who are in charge of the fish and shrimp.

109
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,400
Is this a joke?

110
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,400
What a cold joke.

111
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,400
You...

112
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,400
Make a wish first.

113
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,400
Then cut the cake.

114
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,400
Happy birthday to you.

115
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,400
Happy birthday to you.

116
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,400
Happy birthday to you.

117
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,400
Your Majesty.

118
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,400
Madam.

119
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,400
Chong Ming.

120
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
What's up?

121
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,400
Madam.

122
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
I'm not ready today.

123
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,400
This is a special gift from our clan.

124
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,400
It's a birthday gift for you.

125
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Thank you, Chong Ming.

126
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,400
Madam.

127
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,400
You should rest early.

128
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,400
Okay.

129
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,400
Sister.

130
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Ming Tai.

131
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,400
I didn't have time to prepare for the sneak attack.

132
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,400
These are the flowers I prepared for you.

133
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,400
Happy birthday.

134
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
Wild lily.

135
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,400
It's my favorite flower.

136
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,400
I used to visit my family when I was a kid.

137
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,400
Sister, don't worry.

138
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Next time, I will give you a precious birthday gift.

139
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
No need. I like this very much.

140
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,400
Then you rest first.

141
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
I'm going back.

142
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,400
You haven't slept yet?

143
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
What's up?

144
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Nothing.

145
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Thank you for today.

146
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
I haven't had a birthday like this for a long time.

147
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
I'm very happy.

148
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
Is the little box in your hand

149
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,400
a gift for me?

150
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,400
I'm sorry.

151
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,400
I'm sorry.

152
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,400
I'm sorry.

153
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
I'm sorry.

154
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
I'm sorry.

155
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
I picked it up on the way.

156
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
What do you want to try?

157
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,400
What is it?

158
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,400
I don't know.

159
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,400
You see for yourself.

160
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,400
Give it to me.

161
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,400
It's so beautiful.

162
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
You...

163
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,400
I like it.

164
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
Help me put it on.

165
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
I'm sorry.

166
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,400
I'm sorry.

167
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,400
Aju.

168
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,400
Aju.

169
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
Aju.

170
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,400
Aju.

171
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,400
God of War.

172
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
Go to see God of War first.

173
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
Don't worry.

174
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,400
He won't die.

175
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,400
It's you.

176
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,400
You have a heart attack.

177
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,400
If you didn't lie,

178
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,400
you would go to see your ancestors now.

179
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,400
Aju.

180
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,400
Say it.

181
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,400
I'm listening.

182
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
Aju.

183
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,400
What?

184
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
How is sister?

185
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,400
I just checked her blood pressure.

186
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
I checked her body.

187
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,400
I can't find anything.

188
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,400
There are dragon beads in her body.

189
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,400
In theory,

190
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,400
it won't be controlled by magic.

191
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,400
But just now I saw her eyes.

192
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,400
It seems to be controlled again.

193
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
What should we do?

194
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,400
Dragon beads in her body.

195
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,400
So there will be no life danger.

196
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,400
We'll see later.

197
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,400
That's all.

198
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,400
Where is Aju?

199
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,400
How is Aju?

200
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
She's not hurt.

201
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
I'll go see her.

202
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,400
Go.

203
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,400
I think the wound...

204
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,400
Her heart vein was hurt by her own evil spirit.

205
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,400
Fortunately, the angle was a little bit wrong.

206
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
Otherwise,

207
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,400
it's hard to save even a god.

208
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,400
I gave her the blood of Shanyun.

209
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,400
Now she's recovering faster.

210
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,400
I checked the situation of Shanyun.

211
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
There is no strange thing.

212
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,400
Did anything strange happen

213
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,400
when you went out?

214
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,400
Madam fainted in the old house of the Shans yesterday.

215
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,400
But she woke up soon.

216
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,400
She didn't check any abnormalities.

217
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,400
There are dragon beads in Shanyun's body.

218
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,400
Magic can't control her.

219
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
In this world,

220
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,400
is there anything except magic

221
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,400
that can control the spirit of human?

222
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,400
Have you heard of Wudu?

223
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,400
Wudu?

224
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,400
In ancient times,

225
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,400
dragon's surname is Ying.

226
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,400
The dragon is not the only dragon.

227
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Dragon's seed is left everywhere.

228
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,400
The queen of dragon clan thought the dragon king didn't love herself.

229
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,400
In order to save the dragon king's heart,

230
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
she went to the big house of Miao River

231
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,400
and asked for a kind of medicine.

232
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,400
After the dragon king took the medicine,

233
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,400
he killed the queen.

234
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,400
Since then, the dragon clan has a special Wudu.

235
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
Zhan Xiang.

236
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
Go.

237
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,400
Nansheng, get out.

238
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
No. I want to wake up my sister.

239
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
I want to check her body.

240
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
It's inconvenient for you to be here.

241
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
Get out.

242
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
Okay.

243
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,400
I'm sorry.

244
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Don't be afraid.

245
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,400
I'm dizzy.

246
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,400
If you're dizzy, go upstairs.

247
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Why are you here?

248
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,400
Will something happen to my sister?

249
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
If something happens to you,

250
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,400
Shan Yun Shu will not be in trouble.

251
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,400
Stop it.

252
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,400
You're so annoying.

253
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,400
No.

254
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,400
What happened last night?

255
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,400
You were injured.

256
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,400
My sister was poisoned.

257
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,400
You should make it clear.

258
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,400
I went to give her a gift yesterday.

259
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,400
Then there was an accident.

260
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,400
Give a gift?

261
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,400
Why didn't anything happen when I gave her a gift?

262
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,400
How could I know?

263
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,400
You're so bad luck.

264
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,400
Since my sister met you,

265
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,400
she has never been better.

266
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,400
What did you say?

267
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
Who is bad luck?

268
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
You...

269
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,400
Let me tell you.

270
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
I'm listener.

271
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,400
We were kissing yesterday.

272
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,400
Don't talk rubbish!

273
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
My sister will never fall in love with you.

274
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,400
She doesn't like you at all.

275
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,400
If you don't believe me,

276
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,400
ask her when she wakes up.

277
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,400
How is she?

278
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,680
As I know,

279
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:40,840
it's the poison-free

280
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,640
Crescent Thread.

281
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,640
It should be

282
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,960
put into food.

283
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,480
Someone would come

284
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,400
to poison the house

285
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,400
without any reason.

286
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,960
Crescent Thread?

287
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,440
Crescent Thread is a poison.

288
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,000
It won't harm

289
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,040
the body of the poisoned person,

290
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,440
but it will affect

291
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,600
the mind of the poisoned person.

292
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,400
The more you love someone,

293
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,480
the more you want to kill someone.

294
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,560
As long as you're moved,

295
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,720
you'll be killed.

296
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,920
You can only kill

297
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,120
the person you love

298
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,200
to ease the pain.

299
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,880
Poison is a life-long evil.

300
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,600
Only the one who forgets the love will be saved.

301
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,720
But most of the poisoned people

302
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,120
will die from the torture

303
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,040
of the one they love.

304
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,480
Even if they don't die,

305
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,120
their spirit will be divided into two.

306
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,240
Life is not like death.

307
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,560
You're too much.

308
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,880
Why are you laughing?

309
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,840
She loves me.

310
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,400
You...

311
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,800
Sister.

312
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,680
Wake up, sister.

313
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,160
What's going on?

314
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,480
It seems to be Meng Ye.

315
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,940
The

316
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,740
The

317
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,740
The

318
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,740
The

319
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,740
The

320
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,740
The

321
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,740
The

322
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,740
The

323
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,740
The

324
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,740
The

325
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,740
What's wrong with me?

326
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,940
Sister, you're awake.

327
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,220
You're poisoned.

328
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,540
It's Crescent Thread.

329
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,820
I used magic

330
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,940
to suppress it for the time being.

331
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,820
It won't kill you immediately.

332
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,540
Is he okay?

333
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,740
He's hurt his heart.

334
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,620
But he's recovered quickly after drinking your blood.

335
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,620
He's probably having fun

336
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,780
somewhere.

337
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:44,900
Having fun?

338
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,740
The poison of Crescent Thread

339
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,260
will only kill the one he loves.

340
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,580
Now he knows

341
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,780
that he's the one you love.

342
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,580
He has forgotten

343
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,780
that you killed him.

344
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,020
What's wrong?

345
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,340
When I think of his happy face,

346
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,820
I feel like I want to kill him.

347
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:07,780
Me too.

348
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,500
You can kill him for me.

349
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,340
But after your sister and Zhang Mingkai

350
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,660
heard me explain the effect of Crescent Thread,

351
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,460
they seemed to be a little different.

352
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,260
I...

353
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,980
Crescent Thread is poisonous,

354
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,220
but it can prove

355
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,860
who cares about it the most.

356
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,620
I care about my sister the most.

357
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,660
How could it be?

358
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,540
I'm not asleep yet.

359
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,540
I just passed by the toilet.

360
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,300
Did I wake you up?

361
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:13,980
No.

362
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,180
I'm waiting for your apology.

363
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,580
Your wound...

364
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:21,940
It hurts.

365
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:23,940
But I can't die.

366
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,460
What about you?

367
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,140
I'm fine.

368
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:30,820
I'm fine.

369
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,500
I'm fine.

370
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:33,740
I'm fine.

371
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,380
I'm fine.

372
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,100
I'm fine.

373
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:35,700
I'm fine.

374
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,260
I'm fine.

375
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,200
I'm fine.

376
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,440
I'll go back if I'm fine.

377
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,320
You're so perfunctory.

378
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,200
I almost died today.

379
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,480
But you're not dead yet.

380
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,000
And I can't control it.

381
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,960
Am I poisoned?

382
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,880
You know the principle of that poison, right?

383
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,640
I just woke up.

384
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,880
I don't know the principle of Crescent Thread.

385
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:07,880
What's wrong?

386
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,200
I didn't say it's Crescent Thread.

387
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,960
What do you mean?

388
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,120
I can't see you,

389
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,640
but I can feel your emotions.

390
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,680
What's wrong with me?

391
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,880
Are you going to hurt me

392
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,280
or like me?

393
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,300
Or you want to like me?

394
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,220
Aojue, listen to me.

395
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,700
I'm a married woman.

396
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,940
I like Brother Zhenxuan.

397
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,020
You can't think nonsense.

398
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,300
And you can't tell others.

399
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,540
Or I'll tear your mouth apart.

400
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,740
You tore my heart apart.

401
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:54,980
I don't care.

402
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,820
Are you really Aojue?

403
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,980
How can you say such disgusting words?

404
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,740
I'm not.

405
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,500
Then you can throw up.

406
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,220
But I still want to say

407
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,860
I didn't ask you to forget him.

408
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,260
He sacrificed his life for you.

409
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,260
It's good that you know.

410
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,220
But

411
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,220
I've sacrificed my life for you several times.

412
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,460
If my flesh and blood were all dead,

413
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,620
would you cry in my grave

414
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,060
because of indigestion?

415
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,260
Good people don't live long.

416
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,380
You can't live for a thousand years.

417
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,660
You're still alive.

418
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,260
I'm leaving.

419
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:35,740
I'm leaving.

420
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,340
I'm leaving.

421
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:36,980
I'm leaving.

422
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,620
I'm leaving.

423
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,100
I'm leaving.

424
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:38,940
I don't want to hit you.

425
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,540
I'm leaving.

426
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,020
He likes me.

427
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,700
Admit it.

428
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,820
I like you.

429
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,020
From Auzom.

430
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,280
What did he say?

431
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,080
What else can he say?

432
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,760
He doesn't admit that he likes me.

433
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,280
I'm not talking about this.

434
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,160
I'm talking about the poison.

435
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,240
The Crescent Thread is a dragon-type special poison.

436
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,920
And it's already out of the realm.

437
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,640
The Black Robe can get the poison

438
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,960
that only dragon-type people have.

439
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,280
It seems that

440
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,520
you may know it.

441
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,880
I actually have a feeling that I know who it is.

442
00:19:59,400 --> 00:19:59,920
Who?

443
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,200
Do you know that I stole the dragon-type

444
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,200
to save my brother?

445
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,560
I don't know.

446
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,880
He was poisoned by the Crescent Thread.

447
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,240
My father cut off the bond between Ao Feng and his mother.

448
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,400
He poisoned him with the food I sent him.

449
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,320
He killed his own mother with his own hands.

450
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,160
Your brother died of such a poison.

451
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,640
In theory, this poison

452
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,440
should have been out of the realm.

453
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,360
How can the Black Robe get it?

454
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,120
Although I have repeatedly overturned my guess,

455
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,600
the most likely one is my brother,

456
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:31,880
Ao Feng.

457
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,720
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

458
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,920
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

459
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,120
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

460
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,320
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

461
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,520
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

462
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,880
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

463
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,280
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

464
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,720
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

465
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,080
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

466
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,480
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

467
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,880
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

468
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,280
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

469
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,680
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

470
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,080
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

471
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,680
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

472
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,080
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

473
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,680
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

474
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,280
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

475
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,080
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

476
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,680
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

477
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,280
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

478
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,880
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

479
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,480
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

480
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,080
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

481
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,480
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

482
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,080
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

483
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,680
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

484
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,280
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

485
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,880
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

486
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,480
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

487
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,280
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

488
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,880
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

489
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,680
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

490
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,280
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

491
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,080
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

492
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,880
I'm afraid that I can't prove it.

493
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,080
Thank you.
