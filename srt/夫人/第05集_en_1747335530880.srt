00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
My Dear Brothers EP10

2
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,600
Please step aside.

3
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,240
I'm doing my work.

4
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,200
If you're innocent,

5
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,600
I, Zhang Mingkang,

6
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,360
will definitely pay her back.

7
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,080
You don't want it?

8
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,120
Be quiet.

9
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,040
Don't disturb her rest.

10
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,440
Then please

11
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,880
wake her up.

12
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,000
Otherwise,

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,640
once she becomes a resistance,

14
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,080
she'll be dead.

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,160
It seems

16
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,440
you don't want it.

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,440
Then I'll be sorry.

18
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,040
Detective Zhang.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,520
Madam.

20
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,440
I haven't invited you to dinner.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,560
You came to me first.

22
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,440
Good morning, madam.

23
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,800
Last night, the Green Wings Firm was on fire.

24
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,320
Zeng Yiniang and Zhao Xuyang were killed.

25
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,840
You took them away.

26
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,880
Director asked me to invite you back to ask.

27
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,240
I did go to the Green Wings Firm last night.

28
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,960
Before I went,

29
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,680
they were killed.

30
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,440
You're so kind.

31
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,760
But there's another secret behind it.

32
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,520
Why don't you

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,160
go back to the police station with me?

34
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,360
Don't worry.

35
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,880
If you're innocent,

36
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,480
I'll definitely clear your name.

37
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,040
I want to know

38
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,600
who reported the case.

39
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,920
Director said it was a servant of the family.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,360
The Green Wings Firm

41
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,280
It seems

42
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,840
I'm the biggest suspect.

43
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,560
I don't think so.

44
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,360
After all,

45
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,840
we haven't had dinner yet.

46
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,880
Alright.

47
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,400
I'm willing to go back with Detective Zhang.

48
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,640
But before that,

49
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,800
can you wait for me?

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,160
I have a few words

51
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,480
to say to the two bodyguards.

52
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,000
Madam, please.

53
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,200
I'll wait outside.

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The Green Wings Firm

55
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,640
Madam is so beautiful.

56
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,600
She's so beautiful.

57
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,960
This is the first time

58
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,000
I've seen her.

59
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,600
Detective Zhang, you're too kind.

60
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,960
I'll just ask

61
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,960
whatever you want to know.

62
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,480
Go ahead.

63
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,000
Madam, what did you do

64
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,440
last night?

65
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,680
I went to interrogate Zeng Yiniang and Steward Zhao

66
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,880
about the cause and effect of the assassination.

67
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,000
Did you kill Zeng Yiniang and Steward Zhao?

68
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,760
No.

69
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,000
Did you find out the cause and effect?

70
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,480
The person who assassinated me

71
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,200
wasn't Zeng Yiniang and Steward Zhao.

72
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,160
Someone behind them ordered

73
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,240
that the murderer was someone else.

74
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,120
Who was the murderer?

75
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,760
Mosheng Hai.

76
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,600
Do you have any evidence?

77
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,360
No evidence.

78
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,920
So you're now

79
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,440
accusing Mosheng Hai

80
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,200
of ordering the two of them to assassinate you?

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,600
Yes.

82
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,280
Then why did he kill you?

83
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,880
For the sake of the East China Trade.

84
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,120
But Madam,

85
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,680
you don't have any evidence to prove

86
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,120
that Mosheng Hai killed him.

87
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,120
I've found a new breakthrough.

88
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,400
So you're going to

89
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,240
confront Mosheng Hai?

90
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,160
Not just confront him.

91
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,040
I'm already doing it.

92
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,120
I've been in charge of the East China Trade

93
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,880
since the first day.

94
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,120
Madam,

95
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,440
can you give me a hand?

96
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,480
What do you mean?

97
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,720
To be honest,

98
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,320
I've been investigating you for a long time.

99
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,560
I came to Mocheng Police Station

100
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,480
to collect evidence of Mosheng Hai's crime.

101
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,480
Mosheng Hai is not an easy case.

102
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,800
This thing is mine.

103
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,640
I want to post a case

104
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,120
for you and your wife.

105
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,000
styles.

106
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,040
Who are you?

107
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,120
It's hit.

108
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
Can you feel it?

109
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
Qu Ling Zhen

110
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,120
may be in danger of life.

111
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,120
Qu Ling Zhen

112
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,120
may be in danger of life.

113
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,120
Are you worried about him

114
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,120
or about the dragon pearl in his body?

115
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,120
Is there any difference?

116
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,120
I'm afraid that you will pretend to be real

117
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,120
and then go deep into the love net.

118
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,120
You can't report it.

119
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,120
You didn't

120
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,120
do anything last night, right?

121
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,120
It's up to you.

122
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,120
You'd better take care of yourself first.

123
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,120
I'm only concerned about the dragon pearl.

124
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,120
I thought you'd do something else

125
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,120
if you didn't attack me yesterday.

126
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,120
I didn't expect you to be so quick.

127
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,120
You did it on purpose.

128
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,120
You're smart

129
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
and bold enough.

130
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,120
But you overestimate yourself.

131
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,120
Even if your two bodyguards come,

132
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,120
they can't save you.

133
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,120
Do you think

134
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,120
there's a dragon pearl protecting you

135
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,120
so I can't hurt you?

136
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,120
Let me tell you.

137
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,120
I've been under the fear of being banned for the past 20 years.

138
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,120
I finally found the Giant Spirit Formation.

139
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,120
With this formation,

140
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,120
I can not only weaken the power of the ban,

141
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,120
but also forcefully take the power of the dragon pearl in your body.

142
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
You're from Mosheng Sea.

143
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,120
As long as you cooperate with me,

144
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,120
I can let you suffer less.

145
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,120
I can give you the dragon pearl

146
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,120
as long as you help me kill Mosheng Sea.

147
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,120
What do you think?

148
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,120
What I want

149
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,120
doesn't need your approval.

150
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,120
If you agree,

151
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,120
the Giant Spirit Formation is ready.

152
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,120
I can get the dragon pearl.

153
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,120
Can you tell me before I die

154
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,120
why you want the dragon pearl?

155
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,120
It's useless to delay.

156
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,120
If I guess right,

157
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,120
the Giant Spirit Formation

158
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,120
not only weakens the power of the ban,

159
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,120
but also limits your ability.

160
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,120
Am I right?

161
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,120
You think I didn't notice?

162
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,120
You did.

163
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,120
You're right.

164
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,120
Let him go.

165
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,120
You can't run.

166
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,120
If you continue to learn,

167
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,120
you will die today.

168
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,120
It seems that Qiyin's restriction on you

169
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,120
is stronger than you thought.

170
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,120
Don't you know?

171
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,120
You must die if you kill him.

172
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,120
Your form

173
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,120
is the magic of the dragon tribe.

174
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,120
You're from the dragon tribe.

175
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,120
I'm not a member of the dragon tribe.

176
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,120
I don't need you to be so modest.

177
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,120
But I have a trick

178
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,120
that can make the two eyes meet.

179
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,120
Do you want to hear it?

180
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,120
Go ahead.

181
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,120
I'm sure you know

182
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,120
the Giant Spirit Formation.

183
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,120
With this formation,

184
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,120
you can take out

185
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,120
the power of the dragon pearl on this woman.

186
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,120
At that time,

187
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,120
I can divide the power of the dragon pearl into three parts.

188
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,120
We can take what we need

189
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,120
to make it work.

190
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,120
What do you think?

191
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,120
It's a good idea.

192
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,120
Then please,

193
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,120
Lord Chongming and the Crown Prince,

194
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,120
enter the formation together.

195
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,120
Let's complete the Giant Spirit Formation together.

196
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,120
Are you two

197
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,120
going to betray

198
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,120
our promise?

199
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,120
We promised you

200
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,120
that as long as we get the dragon pearl,

201
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,120
we will kill Mo Shenhai

202
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,120
and avenge you.

203
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,120
Just rest in peace.

204
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,420
The technique of

205
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,120
You're hurt.

206
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,120
Let me check it for you.

207
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,120
Ying Wuzhang.

208
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,120
What are you looking at?

209
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,120
When did you give the spirit to her?

210
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,120
I'm doing things

211
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,120
to make you ask me.

212
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,120
The spirit?

213
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,120
What is it?

214
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,120
The dragon knows the spirit

215
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,120
and will be killed.

216
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,120
The spirit is the hardest thing in the world.

217
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,120
It's also the place where the dragon can't touch.

218
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,120
It's the dragon's guardian spirit.

219
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,120
The guardian spirit is only given to the dragon tribe

220
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,120
willingly.

221
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,120
You actually gave it to her.

222
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,120
That's used to deal with you.

223
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,120
I'm afraid you can't steal the pearl

224
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,120
without my attention.

225
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,120
So,

226
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,120
when did you

227
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,120
put it on me?

228
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,120
Why don't I have the right?

229
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,120
I'm a god.

230
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,120
How can I let you know?

231
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,120
Take care of yourself.

232
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,120
Don't cause me any trouble.

233
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,120
Madam.

234
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,120
Mingkai.

235
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,120
Madam, I'm here.

236
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,120
Are you okay?

237
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,120
Madam, you're so worried about me.

238
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,120
If anything happens to you,

239
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,120
I won't live.

240
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,120
I'm fine.

241
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,120
You look badly hurt.

242
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,120
Madam, don't misunderstand.

243
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,120
I had a sister when I was little.

244
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,120
But I was taken away by bad people.

245
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,120
So I thought of her when I saw you.

246
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,120
Especially her.

247
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,120
Madam,

248
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,120
don't blame me.

249
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,120
Thank you.

250
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,120
Madam,

251
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,120
how about I let you be my god sister?

252
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,120
Your enemy will be my enemy in the future.

253
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,120
How about it?

254
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,120
So sudden.

255
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,120
Madam,

256
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,120
are you unwilling?

257
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,120
I promise you.

258
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,120
Chu Ming,

259
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,120
I've lived for so long.

260
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,120
Why haven't I heard about

261
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,120
Mocheng's green tea?

262
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,120
So famous.

263
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,120
I only drink.

264
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,120
I'm not interested in green tea.

265
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,120
Green tea?

266
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,120
Does this brother like to drink green tea?

267
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,120
I have good ones in my house.

268
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,120
I'll send it to you next time.

269
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,120
Don't get close to me.

270
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,120
Who is your brother?

271
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,120
Okay.

272
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,120
How is it going there?

273
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,120
Mocheng's sister is in danger.

274
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,120
The important suspect was taken away.

275
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,120
She was killed by her brother.

276
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,120
The chief was very angry.

277
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,120
I've been looking for you for a long time.

278
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,120
What's going on?

279
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,120
Who is that bandit?

280
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,120
It should be Mo Shenghai.

281
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,120
Mo Shenghai again?

282
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,120
Mo Shenghai is really crazy.

283
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,120
Is sister in danger?

284
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,120
Do you need me to protect you?

285
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,120
You?

286
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,120
Protect her?

287
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,120
Don't make trouble for me.

288
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,120
That's right.

289
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,120
You two are so good at protecting.

290
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
I've already found someone else.

291
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,120
I'm really useless.

292
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,120
But sister.

293
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,120
You can still call me anytime.

294
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,120
After all, my brother is here.

295
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,120
Mo Shenghai will take care of her.

296
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,120
Thank you very much.

297
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,120
Shameless.

298
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,120
Sister, I'll send you back.

299
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,120
Go.

300
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,120
Okay.

301
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,120
The End

302
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,120
Stinky girl.

303
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,120
Don't pretend to be drunk. Get up.

304
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,120
You're drunk and talk so much.

305
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,120
You even call me brother.

306
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,120
Don't want to embarrass me.

307
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,120
Of course.

308
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,120
I didn't come here on purpose to take your corner.

309
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,120
Get up. I have something to say.

310
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,120
The End

311
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,120
You're drunk at this point.

312
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,120
This is a good opportunity to be in the south.

313
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,120
It's a pity that I don't take revenge on you.

314
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,120
You have the dragon orb. I can't hurt you.

315
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,120
Then I'll give you a turtle king.

316
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,120
To relieve my heartache.

317
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,120
I'm hot.

318
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,120
What are you doing?

319
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,120
I'm hot.

320
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,120
I'll fan you.

321
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,120
I'm hot.

322
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,120
You're pretending.

323
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,120
Is this a joke or a joke?

324
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,120
Okay.

325
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,120
Because after the snow

326
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,120
After a thousand years

327
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,120
I love you more than I wish

328
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,120
I want to be with you

329
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,120
I don't want to end the encounter

330
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,120
Because after the encounter

331
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,120
After a thousand years

332
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,120
I can't say it

333
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,120
I hope this love will last forever

334
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,120
I won't end the encounter

335
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,120
Because after the encounter

336
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,120
After a thousand years

337
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,120
I want to be with you

338
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,120
I don't want to end the encounter

339
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,120
Because after the encounter

340
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,120
After a thousand years

341
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,120
because it's the recess

342
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,880
It often enters a thousand years later

343
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,480
Don't talk out of the sang

344
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:50,180
Theising is the

345
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,160
ラ
