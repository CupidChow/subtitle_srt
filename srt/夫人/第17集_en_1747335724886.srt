My Dear Brothers EP10

2
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Mom,

3
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
we've been waiting here for half a month.

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
When will father come?

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Does he not want me?

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Xiaofeng,

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
didn't I tell you?

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Your father has a lot of things to do.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
He will come to see us when he receives the letter.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Oh.

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Who are you?

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You are Zhang.

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I am...

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I am Ao Jue.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Crown Prince Long is Ao Jue.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You are my father.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
He is your brother.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Brother?

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Thank you.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Xiaofeng has not been so happy for a long time.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's my duty.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
He is my brother.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Your father

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
won't come to see us, will he?

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The dragon tribe is a heartless place.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's not worth your time.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I brought you some money.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's useless for you.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You can take it and leave.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I didn't come for the letter.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I didn't want to enjoy the dragon tribe.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I took the money.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You don't have to be embarrassed.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I have been observing for half a month.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
If you don't have the money, how can you live?

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Don't fight for a man who doesn't love you.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Money is the first priority.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I am dying.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I was not feeling well a few months ago.

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The doctor said I couldn't live long.

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I didn't come for the person who doesn't love me.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I came for the person I love.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I hope someone can take care of Ao Feng.

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I heard that your dragon tribe doesn't accept humans.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You are taking the child as your half-man and half-dragon.

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's for the sake of the bloodline.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Please take care of him for me.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I understand.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Wait for me here.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I will explain your situation when I go back.

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Go.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Zhang Shi.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Zhang Shi.

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Zhang Shi.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What's wrong, Ao Feng?

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Wake up.

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Wake up.

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Brother.

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Brother.

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What happened?

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Brother, someone killed my father.

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I will protect you.

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's okay.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's okay.

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You hurt your head yesterday.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Why are you still laughing?

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
He loves me.

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Are you done?

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I am happy.

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Can't you see?

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I should have hit you with a bucket yesterday.

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The deeper the love, the more hurt it is.

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
He loves me.

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
He loves me.

76
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
He loves me.

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
He loves me.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
He loves me.

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Look.

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Love that is everywhere.

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Hao Jue.

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
If you say another word, I will tear your mouth.

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay.

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I won't laugh.

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Ming Kai.

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Bring the food to my room.

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Okay.

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Okay.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Why are you still laughing?

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The more hurt he is, the deeper the love.

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Do you think I can't laugh?

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Is there any problem?

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
He is poisoned by the poison of the incense.

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
There is poison in his body.

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That is to say, from now on,

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
if you still want to use your power,

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
you can only rely on me to suppress the poison of the incense.

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So,

99
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
you have to speed up to find the root.

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Don't drag me into it.

101
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So we have to fight quickly.

102
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Where are you going?

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
To find Huo Yuan, my dear brother.

104
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
We can't wait any longer.

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The more we wait, the more passive we are.

106
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What I thought at that time was to protect you first.

107
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I took the initiative to delay the time.

108
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I didn't expect them to be so impatient.

109
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What should we do next?

110
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The black robe man, Mo Shanhai and Wu Ju Cheng

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
must be destroyed one by one.

112
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Otherwise, they will collude with each other and it will be difficult to deal with.

113
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I can think of a way to deal with Mo Shanhai.

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What is the way?

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The reason why Mo Shanhai can control Wu Ju Cheng

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
is because he left a lot of evidence of bribery.

117
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And the accounts that framed our parents for stealing opium

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
are all in his safe.

119
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I have to find a way to steal it.

120
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
At that time,

121
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Wu Ju Cheng and the others can naturally be a dog and a dog.

122
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm going to be a dog.

123
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
OK.

124
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But you have to be careful.

125
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Mo Shanhai is very cunning.

126
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm afraid he is in defense.

127
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You take Chong Ming with you.

128
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Then I'll go first.

129
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Call me if you need anything.

130
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
OK.

131
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Sister, the meal is ready for you.

132
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Eat it.

133
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Thank you.

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You have something to say to me.

135
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Well...

136
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Sister,

137
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
do you want to kill me?

138
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Why do I want to kill you?

139
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Sister, don't pretend to be stupid.

140
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The poison you were poisoned with

141
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
is the person I want to kill.

142
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Do you like me?

143
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Of course I like you.

144
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
If you don't like me, I'll let you live in my house.

145
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I mean the kind of relationship between men and women.

146
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Why are you thinking about it?

147
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I won't have a crush on men and women anymore.

148
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Then...

149
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What about Ao Jue?

150
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Anyway,

151
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I have married someone in my heart.

152
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
My husband died for me.

153
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I will never get married again.

154
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Sister, you're lying.

155
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You like Shang Ao Jue, not me, right?

156
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I don't know if I like Ao Jue.

157
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I know I like you.

158
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I treat you as my brother.

159
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You help me to stop the harm.

160
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You help me to do things.

161
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You help me to cook what I like.

162
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I, Shan Yun Shu, will never forget it.

163
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You will be my favorite brother forever.

164
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
No one can replace you.

165
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I don't want to be your brother.

166
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I like you.

167
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What's the difference between the love between a brother and a woman?

168
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's the same.

169
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You know it.

170
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You know it.

171
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Are you trying to get in my way?

172
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Sister, what are you talking about?

173
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm not that kind of person.

174
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm just kidding.

175
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I didn't expect you to be so fussy.

176
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's not that I'm not fussy.

177
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
There are many people who are in love.

178
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But love is the only one.

179
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I want to be the only one for you.

180
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The only one for you.

181
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Why are you looking at me like this?

182
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Don't say it.

183
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I really want to kill you now.

184
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Is it true?

185
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Is it okay?

186
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Wait a minute.

187
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Are you sure there are books in Wan Long's book?

188
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Be careful.

189
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm not sure.

190
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
We can sneak in.

191
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But we have to make sure where he transferred the books.

192
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
We can only wait for the night to come.

193
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
No need.

194
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Hold me.

195
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Come in.

196
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
People are so quiet now.

197
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's easy to be found.

198
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
We'd better act in a more rational way.

199
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You didn't say it earlier.

200
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Let's go.

201
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
No.

202
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Don't do this.

203
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's easy to be found.

204
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's good.

205
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Brother Chong Ming.

206
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You have a good chest.

207
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Don't run around.

208
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm sorry.

209
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
President.

210
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's been two days.

211
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
How to deal with the books?

212
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It won't take long.

213
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Just wait and see.

214
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I've made a perfect arrangement.

215
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
As long as he dares to come, it will be difficult.

216
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm only worried about the two people around him.

217
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
No need to look.

218
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
In my secret room,

219
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Mr. Hei Pao has already set up the dragon formation.

220
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Why are you panicking?

221
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
President.

222
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
A woman downstairs wants to see you.

223
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Woman?

224
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Sha Yun Shu?

225
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
No.

226
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
She's a woman with a bad temper.

227
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Bad temper?

228
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I won't see her.

229
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
President.

230
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Don't you have any other words to describe a woman?

231
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I hate it when people call me bad temper.

232
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Who are you?

233
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What do you want?

234
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What?

235
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I have a message for you.

236
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I want to meet you at the Royal Temple tonight.

237
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Did you hear me?

238
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Come, drink a glass of wine.

239
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I remember the first time I saw you,

240
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
it was also such a night.

241
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You were in aunt Zhang's arms.

242
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Don't mention my mother.

243
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm your brother.

244
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So you want the dragon bead to save your mother?

245
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Not entirely.

246
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Then why don't you ask me for it?

247
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I can give you the dragon bead.

248
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I've told you many times.

249
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Then you say,

250
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
the dragon bead is the sacred thing of the dragon clan.

251
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's more important than anything.

252
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
People die and die,

253
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
it's natural.

254
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Anyway, in your eyes,

255
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
the dragon clan and the dragon bead are more important than anything.

256
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Since your mother died,

257
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I've always taken care of you as my brother.

258
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I taught you magic to live with you.

259
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
What else are you unsatisfied with?

260
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Brother, I know.

261
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
In this world,

262
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
except my mother,

263
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
you're the best to me.

264
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But do you know

265
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
how my mother died?

266
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
She didn't let the dragon king die,

267
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
she didn't let the dragon clan die.

268
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
They killed her favorite woman.

269
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Brother, how can I forget?

270
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
How can I forget my mother's pain?

271
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
How can I forget the desperate eyes

272
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
before my mother died?

273
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That's betrayal.

274
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
If it's your mother,

275
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
or Shan Yushu,

276
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
how can you forget?

277
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So you want to get the dragon bead

278
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
and then kill the dragon clan, right?

279
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yes.

280
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Including me.

281
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I've let you go many times.

282
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Don't forget.

283
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Is it painful?

284
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I tell you,

285
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
this is your favorite person.

286
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
This is your feeling of death.

287
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
This is the most desperate feeling

288
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
before my mother died.

289
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
If you forget this,

290
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'll forget everything.

291
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Then there will be a thunder.

292
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
If your mother had the power of heaven,

293
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
she would be very painful

294
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
to see you like this.

295
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
But she sent you to the dragon clan

296
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
to let you live a good life.

297
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Now you are blinded by hatred.

298
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You killed the only person who loved you.

299
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What power does a dead person have?

300
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Ao Feng,

301
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I won't let you hurt Shan Yushu.

302
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I won't let you hurt her.

303
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You

304
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
fell in love with her?

305
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yes.

306
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Then she

307
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
is the next mother.

308
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Don't you really know

309
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
how your mother died?

310
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Go back with me now.

311
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I will protect you.

312
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Enough. Enough.

313
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You said this a few decades ago.

314
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm an outsider to the dragon clan.

315
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm blinded by hatred and humiliation.

316
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
The dragon clan has fallen.

317
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Don't mention the past.

318
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Yes.

319
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
If I didn't kill them,

320
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
how could the dragon clan fall?

321
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
What?

322
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Otherwise,

323
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
how could your crown prince position

324
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
be so strong?

325
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Go.

326
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
In such a shabby place,

327
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
is the account book here?

328
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
From what I know about Mo Shenghai,

329
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
the most dangerous place

330
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
is the safest place.

331
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
This old man

332
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
really hid so many treasures here.

333
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Brother Chongming,

334
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
can you use magic

335
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
to change all these?

336
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
No.

337
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Why are you so vulgar?

338
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Then you say some curse words

339
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
and find the account book.

340
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
No.

341
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
No. No.

342
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
No.

343
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
No.

344
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You men can't say no.

345
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Don't you know?

346
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Stop talking.

347
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Find the account book.

348
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I found it.

349
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I found it.

350
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I found it.

351
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I found it.

352
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I found it.

353
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I found it.

354
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I found it.

355
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I found it.

356
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I found it.

357
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I found it.

358
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I found it.

359
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I found it.

360
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I found it.

361
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I found it.

362
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I found it.

363
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I found it.

364
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I found it.

365
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I found it.

366
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I found it.

367
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I found it.

368
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I found it.

369
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I found it.

370
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I found it.

371
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I found it.

372
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I found it.

373
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I found it.

374
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I found it.

375
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I found it.

376
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I found it.

377
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I found it.

378
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I found it.

379
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Not me.

380
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
So what?

381
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I didn't thank me.

382
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Suddenly you twins are now at a lost cause.

383
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
He sent a message.

384
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Address a personal call.

385
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Copy it.

386
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Copy it.

387
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You know how to adopt me?

388
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Is he I?

389
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Rabbit.

390
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It dich break!

391
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I don't think so.

392
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Sit down.

393
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Give it to me!

394
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Berber.

395
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
See, your delaying really fixed it.

396
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
We should just pay more attention to just how badly it happened.

397
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
If it happened understandably then we can continue.

398
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,800
You know everyone,

399
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,800
The trigger.

400
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,640
It's like a

401
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,600
dumpster.

402
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,300
Respect to your design.
