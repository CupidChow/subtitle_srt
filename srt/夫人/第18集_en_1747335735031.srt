00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
My Dear Brothers

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Hurry up, follow us.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Why are we still at the dock?

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Don't talk.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hurry up.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Brother Chong Ming, you are injured.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
My hair is getting better.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hurry up.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Hurry up.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Shan Yun Shu,

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
how dare you kidnap my family?

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You are so angry.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Son, son, are you okay?

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Shan Yun Shu,

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
what do you want?

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You misunderstood.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I heard that you have a son.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I heard that you have a son,

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
but you are sick because of tuberculosis.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I happen to have a friend who is good at medicine.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So I took Young Master and Madam Zun

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
to treat him.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Didn't I tell you?

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Don't go out without my order.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Master,

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
the chief of the committee said that

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I was so angry that I could cure our son's disease.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And it was really magical.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Shan Yun Shu,

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
what do you want?

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What do you want?

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You are thinking too much.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You have worked hard for the people of Mo City for many years.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You have taken care of me.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And I just did a little bit of cotton.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I cured your son's disease.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I just let you feel no regret.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You can leave now.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Come here.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Okay.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We are wise people.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
How do you want me to help you?

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I want all the information about the destruction of the Mo family.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I gave you.

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Can Mo Shen Hai let me go?

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
If you don't give me,

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Mo Shen Hai won't let you go.

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Mo Shen Hai has made a plan

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
to get something he shouldn't get.

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He has already made a plan to gather the money.

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He secretly transferred the assets

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
to himself to keep the future.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Chief Lu will not know.

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The case of the Yan Tu back then

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
was a death sentence.

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You think for him.

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
He doesn't care about your life.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You have seen it.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I have many capable people around me.

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Heipao people and Mo Shen Hai can't win.

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
As long as you give the information to Zhang Ming Kai,

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I promise you

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
you can get off safely.

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And the conditions I promised you before

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
are not changed.

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Okay.

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I promise you.

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I will resign immediately.

71
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I will give the secret information to Zhang Ming Kai.

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I will not participate in your grudges.

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Deal.

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Why are you looking at me like that?

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I am not a man.

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I am a woman.

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I am a woman.

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Madam.

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Mo Yu Han.

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What are you doing?

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You don't recognize me as your sister now?

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What do you like?

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I don't like Madam.

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I respect her.

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You are so stubborn.

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I want to sleep for a while.

88
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Don't disturb me.

89
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
In Mo City,

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
everyone praises you.

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But I tell you.

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I am not worse than my sister.

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
No matter how handsome or smart I am.

94
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's just that I was born with a bad identity.

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Otherwise,

96
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I would be the first beauty in Mo City.

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And I am younger than my sister.

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
If I had appeared earlier,

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I would not have been as handsome as my sister.

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Brother Zhang Ming.

101
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What's wrong with you?

102
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Don't come near me.

103
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Don't come near me.

104
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Are you feeling better?

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's dangerous.

106
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Stay away from me.

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Get up.

108
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You are all human.

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You can run away.

110
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You can absorb the oxygen of humans.

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Are you okay?

112
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I don't need

113
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
to be with them.

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I can't let go.

115
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I can't let go.

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I can't let go.

117
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I think I've already

118
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
got used to

119
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
waiting alone

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
and waiting alone.

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Until we meet again

122
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
in the future.

123
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The journey of the past.

124
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The love and hate suddenly

125
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
become dust.

126
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The love and hate suddenly

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
become dust.

128
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Sister Li Li.

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Thank you for helping me.

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You are welcome.

131
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I am helping you.

132
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Are you jealous?

133
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I...

134
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I am not jealous.

135
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Do you want to eat something?

136
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I am hungry.

137
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Okay.

138
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Let's go.

139
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Boss.

140
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Two bottles of plum wine

141
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
and some osmanthus tea.

142
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Okay.

143
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You've known Aojue for a long time, right?

144
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Almost a hundred years.

145
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
At that time,

146
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I went to the East Sea to get a cup of love water.

147
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I almost got killed by the dragon's thunder.

148
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Fortunately, Aojue saved me.

149
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Love water?

150
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Is there such a thing in the world?

151
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
No.

152
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But in that process,

153
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I almost forgot the man in that orphanage.

154
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Because of Aojue,

155
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I have his credit.

156
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I've been in the East Sea for half a year.

157
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
He is the most simple man I've ever seen.

158
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Although he looks cold and ruthless,

159
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
he is actually sincere.

160
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You like Aojue?

161
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Yes.

162
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
But that's a kind of love for my brother.

163
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Just like you and Zhang Mingkai.

164
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What about you?

165
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I can't like him.

166
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm serious.

167
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I've married someone.

168
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You mean Young Master Hu?

169
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
He risked his life to protect me.

170
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I can't let him down.

171
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You seem to be smart.

172
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
In fact, you are a silly woman.

173
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What?

174
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Our Hu family does have the ability to see through Yin and Yang.

175
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
In fact,

176
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Young Master Hu has been by your side all the time.

177
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What do you mean?

178
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Do you think how you and Aojue and the dragon's qi formed?

179
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Dragon's qi and soul's qi.

180
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's probably the strong will of the Hu family

181
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
that formed qi before the death of the young master.

182
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
This qi can be said to be drawn by Young Master Hu.

183
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Really?

184
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Of course.

185
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The qi protects you from being hurt.

186
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
But it doesn't stop you from being loved.

187
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I can send your mind to Qizhou

188
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
to see the heart of Young Master Hu.

189
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yu Zi.

190
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Brother Zhen Xuan, I miss you so much.

191
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's you who have been protecting me.

192
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
This is my promise to you.

193
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I hope you can live well.

194
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Brother Zhen Xuan, let's be like this forever.

195
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Let's never leave, okay?

196
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I will never leave you.

197
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I will never leave you.

198
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Let's never leave, okay?

199
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Silly girl, I'm dead.

200
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Now it's just a will.

201
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Sister, you have to live happily.

202
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Don't let go of my meaning for the past twenty years.

203
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
No one is like you who is like a snake to me.

204
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I won't let you leave.

205
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
There are always people who are good to you.

206
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Don't close your heart for me.

207
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It will cut off all the possibilities in life.

208
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I don't want to see this.

209
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I care about you.

210
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I hope you can be happy.

211
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Don't be immersed in hatred and regret.

212
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But how can I forget you?

213
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You can't go.

214
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You don't need to forget me.

215
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's like you won't forget all the people who love you.

216
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You can put my love in your heart.

217
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Put it in the place that belongs to you and me.

218
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But life is short.

219
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I hope you can be happy.

220
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Then I can be at ease.

221
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Please get rid of the worries and loneliness of the past twenty years.

222
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Leave you and reincarnate.

223
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I hope you can be happy.

224
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Enjoy life.

225
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Don't be afraid of hatred.

226
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The world is full of perversions.

227
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm willing to be with love.

228
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm willing to be a star and accompany you.

229
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
There is a deep love in this world.

230
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
How can you not be attracted?

231
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm willing to be with you, too.

232
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You are awake.

233
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Why you?

234
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Where is Lei Li Qian?

235
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
She is the most recent one.

236
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
you'll be happy.

237
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,320
Life is hard to get a long life.

238
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,040
It's good

239
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,080
to live a happy life.

240
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,000
Actually, you can do it too.

241
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,960
You've seen me drunk before.

242
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,840
I'm sorry.

243
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,640
Is there any progress

244
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,640
with Director Wu?

245
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,320
I think it's all ready.

246
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,240
Have you found the man in black?

247
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,920
The man in black is my brother, Yao Feng.

248
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,520
He betrayed me.

249
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,760
For Long Zhu?

250
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,120
He's a poor man too.

251
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,040
In order to save his mother,

252
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,440
he did so many wrong things

253
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,840
for the sake of his mother's hatred.

254
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,240
Now he can't go back.

255
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,640
What's wrong?

256
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,880
I remember something.

257
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,800
I think I've heard

258
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,720
a similar story.

259
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,760
Sister.

260
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,200
Do you want to hear my story?

261
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,720
What's the matter?

262
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,800
I don't have any evidence yet.

263
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,720
I'll tell you next time.

264
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,680
Where are my sister and Chong Ming?

265
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,840
I don't know.

266
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,760
But Chong Ming is here.

267
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,480
Don't worry.

268
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,880
You still want to drink?

269
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,360
What are you going to do

270
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,520
with Shen Yun Shu?

271
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,240
Don't worry.

272
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,520
Everything is under control.

273
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,400
He has found me.

274
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,880
He threatened me with my wife and child.

275
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,960
Do you have any idea?

276
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,600
Director Wu.

277
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,640
I haven't tried it for so many years.

278
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,880
Don't worry.

279
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,600
You haven't tried it?

280
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,640
How many times have you failed

281
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,120
in Shen Yun Shu's world?

282
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,360
I've made you lose your reputation.

283
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,000
It also starts to pay attention

284
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,720
to the case of Yan Tu who was killed twenty years ago.

285
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,960
And there are so many capable people around him.

286
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,960
You can't even balance yourself with the black robe.

287
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,200
What can I do?

288
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,600
If I can't do it,

289
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,400
I can only protect myself.

290
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,960
Actually,

291
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,320
I also thought of something.

292
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,080
What is it?

293
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,240
Death flag.

294
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,600
Clean it up.

295
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,440
Send Director Wu's body to Shen Yun Shu.

296
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,960
Yes.

297
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,640
This stinky man.

298
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,640
Why...

299
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,960
I didn't leave.

300
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,960
I went to find food.

301
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,240
I didn't dare to break into your luggage.

302
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,600
Does it still hurt?

303
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,040
Much better.

304
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,880
How about you?

305
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,800
I feel a little sore.

306
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,280
Brother Chong Ming.

307
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,200
Why are you shy?

308
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,440
I...

309
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,680
I'm not.

310
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,440
You're not?

311
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,720
I've been living for hundreds of years.

312
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,640
I've never seen any woman.

313
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,800
Don't talk nonsense.

314
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,880
I'm not that kind of person.

315
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,560
I will

316
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,480
take responsibility.

317
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,800
I don't need you to take responsibility.

318
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,360
You were hurt because you protected me.

319
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,560
Just take it as my repayment.

320
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,840
And

321
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,760
I'm not that kind of conservative woman.

322
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,600
I'm not what you think I am.

323
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,720
I will take responsibility for you.

324
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,280
I will take responsibility for you.

325
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,840
I will take responsibility for you.

326
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,120
I will take responsibility for you.

327
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,560
I will take responsibility for you.

328
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,840
I will take responsibility for you.

329
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,240
I will take responsibility for you.

330
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,640
I will take responsibility for you.

331
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,880
I will take responsibility for you.

332
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,160
I will take responsibility for you.

333
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,440
I will take responsibility for you.

334
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,800
I will take responsibility for you.

335
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,040
I will take responsibility for you.

336
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,440
I will take responsibility for you.

337
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,680
I will take responsibility for you.

338
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,920
I will take responsibility for you.

339
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,160
I will take responsibility for you.

340
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,280
I will take responsibility for you.

341
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,520
I will take responsibility for you.

342
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,800
I will take responsibility for you.

343
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,040
I will take responsibility for you.

344
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,280
I will take responsibility for you.

345
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,440
I will take responsibility for you.

346
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,640
I will take responsibility for you.

347
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,280
Why?

348
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,080
Because I think

349
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,320
after a thousand years

350
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,360
we would be once again in love

351
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:14,400
I want to be with you

352
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,480
and chatter together

353
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:22,000
Because I think

354
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,600
after a thousand years
