My Dear Brothers EP10

00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 10

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Headache?

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hao Quan, why are you standing on the window?

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You scared me.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You forgot?

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You asked me to stand here.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
When?

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You really don't remember?

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We were just having a chat.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What kind of fake wine is this?

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
My head hurts.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Take a closer look.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Don't move while standing on the window!

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You remember?

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Help me untie the static on my body.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You remember?

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What are you doing?

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
If you dare to tell anyone about this,

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
you'll be dead.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You're so mean.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What do you want?

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Look at your face.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Untie it first.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You're free.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You're so skinny.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I didn't expect you to carry so much.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You should eat less.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You're not full, are you?

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm leaving.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Wait.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What's wrong?

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Wipe your face with lipstick.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If others see you,

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
they'll misunderstand you.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You didn't wipe it clean.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I can't see it.

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Why don't you help me?

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You're so stupid.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Commandant Jin,

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm off.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,600
We're

43
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,600
роХ

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Everyone is free now.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What are you doing?

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm so embarrassed.

47
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,640
Why are you here?

48
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,440
Long'er, your friend?

49
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
A Buddha.

50
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,920
Long'er?

51
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,600
You sound so familiar.

52
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,800
You've got it now.

53
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,040
It's not Long'er.

54
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,480
It's Long'er.

55
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,720
Why are you here?

56
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,400
Because I'm here to see you.

57
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
I'm here to see you.

58
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
I'm here to see you.

59
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,400
I'm here to see you.

60
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,400
I'm here to see you.

61
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,400
I'm here to see you.

62
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,400
I'm here to see you.

63
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,800
I'm worried about you.

64
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
I'm worried about you.

65
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
I'm worried about you.

66
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,000
It seems that you're worried for nothing.

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm fine. Let's go.

68
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
You're so heartless.

69
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,800
I ran all the way here,

70
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,800
and my throat is hoarse.

71
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,600
Why didn't you buy me a cup of tea?

72
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,600
What tea?

73
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,600
Miss Hu.

74
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,600
There's tea here.

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's you who know the pain of the heart.

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,200
No wonder you can get the heart of a man.

77
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,200
My throat is hoarse.

78
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
Your mouth is hoarse.

79
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,200
Drink it.

80
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,200
What brings you here, Miss Hu?

81
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,200
I'm here to ask for a debt.

82
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,200
Debt?

83
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,200
Did Aujue take anything from you?

84
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,200
No.

85
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,200
Don't talk nonsense.

86
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,200
I didn't take anything.

87
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,200
I just didn't pay the debt.

88
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,200
And I took away a love letter.

89
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
Give it to me. I'll give you anything you want.

90
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,200
Shut up.

91
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,200
Do you have money?

92
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,200
She doesn't want money.

93
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,200
Miss.

94
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,200
Miss.

95
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,200
Help me.

96
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,200
You...

97
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,200
What are you doing, Mingkai?

98
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,200
I'm here to talk to you.

99
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,200
You have no place to go. Get out.

100
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,200
You're a bodyguard.

101
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,200
You didn't even tell me.

102
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
You're so clumsy.

103
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,200
Where are Yu Han and Chong Ming?

104
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,200
They left the police station long ago.

105
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,200
Didn't they come back?

106
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,200
That's good.

107
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,200
Chong Ming should be fine.

108
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,200
Yu Han.

109
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,200
You're finally back.

110
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,200
Miss.

111
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,200
Sit down.

112
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,200
Miss.

113
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,200
This is...

114
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,200
I'm Aujue's friend.

115
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,200
My name is Hu Lili.

116
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,200
Call me Lili.

117
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,200
You're really good at it.

118
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,200
Handsome guy.

119
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,200
What's your name?

120
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,200
My name is Zhang Mingkai.

121
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
Miss.

122
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,200
Can I live here?

123
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
Of course.

124
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,200
If you want to live here,

125
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,200
just live here.

126
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,200
I want to live here too.

127
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
Why do you want to live here?

128
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,200
I'll give you what you want.

129
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
Leave now.

130
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
Do you have money?

131
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,200
You want a lot of money.

132
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,200
Why do you want money?

133
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,200
I'm willing to.

134
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,200
I'll live here if I have no money.

135
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
I'll just pay the rent.

136
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,200
He's your man.

137
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,200
Live in your house.

138
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,200
Is that reasonable?

139
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,200
It's reasonable.

140
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,200
It's reasonable.

141
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,200
Why is it always him in my head?

142
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,200
Did I really fall in love with him?

143
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
Who is it?

144
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,200
Miss, it's me.

145
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,200
Come in.

146
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
Sit down.

147
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
How is it? Are you ready?

148
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
What else do you need?

149
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
Everything is ready.

150
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,200
You came so late.

151
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,200
I just want to see you for a while.

152
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
Wait.

153
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,200
Do you remember this bracelet?

154
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,200
This is...

155
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,200
Do you remember?

156
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
This is...

157
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
Do you remember?

158
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,200
This is my mother's legacy.

159
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,200
We sisters know it.

160
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
I'm sorry.

161
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,200
I'm sorry.

162
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,200
I couldn't find you earlier.

163
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
I let you suffer.

164
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,200
You don't have to say it.

165
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,200
I know it.

166
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,200
I helped Moshenghai

167
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
collect a lot of information about you.

168
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,200
But I didn't know you were a sister.

169
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,200
Let's not talk about the past.

170
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,200
We sisters will live a good life in the future.

171
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,200
Then do you know how to deal with Moshenghai?

172
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
What do you think?

173
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,200
I knew you were against Moshenghai

174
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,200
because he was kind to me.

175
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,200
But I don't owe him anything now.

176
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,200
I don't know him.

177
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,200
But I only know that he has been with Moshenghai for many years.

178
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,200
Moshenghai can have today.

179
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,200
He is not without merit.

180
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,200
This person is mysterious.

181
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,200
He has many tricks and brains.

182
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,200
Even if I have a trick and a pet,

183
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,200
I have been killed by him several times.

184
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
I almost got a big loss.

185
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,200
Now I can only hold him back for now.

186
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,200
Then make a plan.

187
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,200
He is not on the same page with Moshenghai.

188
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,200
He has been with Moshenghai for so many years.

189
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,200
But he didn't tell him about Jiang Mingzhu.

190
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,200
Or I stole it from the grudge?

191
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,200
Grudge is always serious.

192
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
How could it be...

193
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
Sister, don't blame me.

194
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
I was drunk.

195
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,200
You like him?

196
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,200
Yes.

197
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,200
I think he is good.

198
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
But what does he think?

199
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,200
I don't know.

200
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,200
But he invited me to dinner.

201
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,200
As long as you can figure it out,

202
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,200
I won't stop you.

203
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,200
But you have to know that

204
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,200
he is not a human.

205
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,200
He is destined to die.

206
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
I understand.

207
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,200
Sister?

208
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,200
I found that Aozhi, Zhang Mingkai and Chong Ming

209
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,200
all like you.

210
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,200
I am a member of the Hu family.

211
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Brother Zhenxuan has protected me with his life.

212
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,200
How can I betray him?

213
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
Aoxue.

214
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,200
You asked me out

215
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
just to fight?

216
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,200
You told Moshenghai about the dragon orb.

217
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
I just want to break the relationship

218
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
between Moshenghai and the black robe man.

219
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,200
Or you want to kill me

220
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,200
through the black robe man

221
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,200
and take over the Shanyun Book?

222
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
I thought about it.

223
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
But you didn't see it.

224
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
The Shanyun Book is now in my heart.

225
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
Who is it?

226
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,200
Are you pretending to be stupid

227
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
or really stupid?

228
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
Zhang Mingkai.

229
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,200
I don't know about him.

230
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
I don't know about him.

231
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,200
But the Shanyun Book is sincere to you.

232
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
That day, I stopped him from sending him to the dead

233
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,200
outside the warehouse.

234
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,200
I could see it from the light in his eyes.

235
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,200
He cares about you

236
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,200
and he even lost his life for you.

237
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
Really?

238
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,200
Do I have to lie to you?

239
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,200
I won't fight him for you.

240
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
But the dragon orb

241
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,200
is the key to my life.

242
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
Dragon orb.

243
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,200
I can give you the dragon orb.

244
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,200
But I have to fight him for the life.

245
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,200
No.

246
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
What do you mean?

247
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
I can't wait for so long.

248
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
The day has come.

249
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,200
If I don't get the dragon orb,

250
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
I will die.

251
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
You are already in the dark.

252
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
What do you mean?

253
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,200
We are both under the spell of the dragon orb.

254
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
This is the biggest trap.

255
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
If we fail,

256
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
we will die with the Shanyun Book.

257
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
The Heaven's Trap won't fall on you.

258
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,200
Otherwise,

259
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,200
we have been sealed for twenty years.

260
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
You have long been dead.

261
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
You mean

262
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,200
the Shanyun Book

263
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,200
is the Heaven's Trap.

264
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,200
We are both under the spell of the black robe.

265
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
We are both under the same spell.

266
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,200
Only one of us can survive.

267
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
Why do you tell me this?

268
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,200
I wanted to get the dragon orb.

269
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,200
But I fell in love with the Shanyun Book.

270
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,200
I suddenly feel

271
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,200
if we can be together for a hundred years,

272
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,200
we will grow old together.

273
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
It's much better than

274
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,200
the merciless dragon palace.

275
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,200
Don't be so proud.

276
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
From my observation,

277
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,200
the Shanyun Book doesn't dislike Zhao Mingkai.

278
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,200
You have to work harder.

279
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
Long'er, what are you doing?

280
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,200
I'm here.

281
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,200
Because we will meet again after a thousand years

282
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,200
I love you and wish for it

283
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,200
I can only be with you

284
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,200
I don't want to end up together

285
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,200
Because we will meet again after a thousand years

286
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,200
I can't say it out

287
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,200
I hope this love will last forever

288
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,200
I won't stop

289
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,200
My heart and soul

290
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,200
Sister Yisi, I will protect you with my life.

291
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
How can you let me down?

292
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,200
Your dark circles slept last night?

293
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
Sister

294
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,200
Look

295
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,200
This table is all the delicious food I prepared for you.

296
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,200
You don't need to hire people anymore.

297
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,200
I will make breakfast for you for a lifetime.

298
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,200
You are so good.

299
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,200
Of course.

300
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,200
I am.

301
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
I will do it for you.

302
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,200
I will do it for you.

303
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
I will do it for you.

304
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,200
You are so good.

305
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,200
Of course.

306
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,200
This is so delicious.

307
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,200
Brother, if someone marries you in the future,

308
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
I will be so happy.

309
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
Sister

310
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,200
Eat, sister.

311
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,200
Is it delicious, sister?

312
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
It doesn't matter at all.

313
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,200
Then I have to be fat like a pig.

314
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,200
How can it be?

315
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
At most, it's like the princess.

316
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,200
How can it be a pig?

317
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,200
You are so sweet.

318
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,200
Brother, aren't you going to eat?

319
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,200
Why are you so small?

320
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,200
You are really a pig.

321
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,200
You are so big.

322
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
I am not a pig.

323
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
I am a pig.

324
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,200
I am a pig.

325
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
I am a pig.

326
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,200
I am a pig.

327
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,200
I am a pig.

328
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,200
I am a pig.

329
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,200
You are really a thousand-year-old pig.

330
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,200
You are so beautiful.

331
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,200
You are so low.

332
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,200
Come on.

333
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,200
Yuxiu

334
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,200
Yuxiu said he liked me last time.

335
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,200
No.

336
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,200
Why did he surprise me with Zhang Mingkai?

337
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,200
Who is it?

338
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,200
I don't eat the food he cooked.

339
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,200
Take it away.

340
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,200
You, Shan Yunshu.

341
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,200
Why are you here?

342
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,200
Where is Shan Yunshu?

343
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,200
Shan Yunshu, Shan Yunshu.

344
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
You know it.

345
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,200
You know it.

346
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,200
Where is he?

347
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,200
Why didn't you tell me?

348
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,200
He went to his old house.

349
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,200
No.

350
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,200
We are in danger.

351
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,200
I will go to him.

352
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,200
Don't worry.

353
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,200
He has a lot of people.

354
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,200
He will be fine.

355
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,200
Look at you.

356
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,200
You are so depressed.

357
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,200
You are so humiliated.

358
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Is it that obvious?

359
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,200
My crown prince.

360
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,200
You are really a fool.

361
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,200
He wants a boyfriend.

362
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,200
Not a big one.

363
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,200
He wants a big boyfriend.

364
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,200
He wants a big boyfriend.

365
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,200
He wants a big boyfriend.

366
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,200
He wants a big boyfriend.

367
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,200
He wants a big boyfriend.

368
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,200
Not a big son.

369
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,200
Please show us the charm of mature men.

370
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Okay?

371
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,200
I am so childish.

372
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,200
You are so childish.

373
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
You are so childish.

374
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
What should I do?

375
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,200
Your highness.

376
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,200
Please open your big eyes.

377
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,200
And look at your opponent.

378
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
He is young and fair.

379
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,200
He is young and fair.

380
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,200
He is young and fair.

381
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,200
He can drive.

382
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,200
He can cook.

383
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
He is young and fair.

384
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,200
He is young and fair.

385
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,200
You are like a rich man.

386
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,200
If I see him,

387
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,200
I will give him a big thumbs up.

388
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,200
Is it enough?

389
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,200
How about you use the magic of the witch tribe

390
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
to get rid of him?

391
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,200
And stop his thoughts on the rite of war?

392
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,200
In this way, you can get rid of the evil spirit.

393
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
Your highness.

394
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Listen to me.

395
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,200
When you have time,

396
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,840
Don't just practice your power and body.

397
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,200
Read more books.

398
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,880
You'll have a brain.

399
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,480
Don't go.

400
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,120
Help me.

401
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,440
I can't run for nothing.

402
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,720
What do you want?

403
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,360
The golden dragon blood.

404
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,920
It's golden lotus blood.

405
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,760
Got it?

406
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,760
Are you a pervert?

407
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,200
Why do you want the golden dragon blood?

408
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,120
I'm a nerd.

409
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,480
I'll give it to you.

410
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,240
Come in.

411
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,320
It serves you right.

412
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,440
Jing.

413
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,360
I'll stop by the

414
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,880
signal Room.

415
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,940
No No No

416
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,540
Okay

417
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,060
It's your song

418
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,540
Do you know how to write Speaker?

419
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,740
Gradually

420
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,740
Love and hate entangle

421
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,740
Pretending to be gentle

422
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,740
The soil of the night flowers

423
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,740
The secret is not full

424
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,740
Always alone

425
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,740
Always alone

426
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,740
Stop

427
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,740
Mom, what is this?

428
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,740
This is a jade pendant

429
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,740
After my sister's birth

430
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,740
My sister also has a jade pendant

431
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,740
But hers is a peach flower

432
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,740
In the fire of the firework

433
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,740
Suddenly the heart suddenly became silent

434
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,740
Still being held

435
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,740
Dad, mom

436
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,740
Yuhan, what are you doing?

437
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,740
We are playing games

438
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,740
Are you cold?

439
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,740
Not cold

440
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,740
Please be quick

441
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,740
I only want to meet you after a long time

442
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,740
Dad, mom

443
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,740
What is this?

444
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,740
I want to love you after a thousand years

445
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,740
Pass through the world

446
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,740
Running to meet you

447
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,740
I don't want to end the encounter

448
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,740
Because the encounter

449
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,740
I want to be in a thousand years

450
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,740
But I can't say it

451
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,740
With the love of friends

452
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:52,740
I will not end the encounter

453
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,740
Dad, mom

454
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,740
Yuhan, what are you doing?

455
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,740
I want to love you after a thousand years

456
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,740
Pass through the world

457
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,740
Because the encounter

458
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,740
I want to love you after a thousand years

459
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,740
Pass through the world

460
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,740
Running to meet you

461
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,740
I don't want to end the encounter

462
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,740
Because the encounter

463
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,740
I want to be in a thousand years

464
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,740
But I can't say it

465
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,740
With the love of friends

466
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:46,740
I will not end the encounter

467
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,740
Thanks for watching
