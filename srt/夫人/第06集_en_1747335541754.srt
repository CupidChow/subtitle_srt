1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
My Dear Brothers

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Okay.

4
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,480
Shan Yishu, what are you doing?

5
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,480
Don't move.

6
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,480
Zhenxuan,

7
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,480
you finally came to see me in my dream.

8
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,480
I miss you so much.

9
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,480
Look clearly.

10
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,480
Who am I?

11
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,480
Why don't you come to see me?

12
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,480
You're still in Guiyang.

13
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,480
I'm here to see you.

14
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,480
I'm here to see you.

15
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,480
I'm here to see you.

16
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,480
I'm here to see you.

17
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,480
You're still in Guiyang, right?

18
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,480
Let go of me.

19
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,480
I won't.

20
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,480
Don't move.

21
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,480
Don't move.

22
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,480
Don't move.

23
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,480
I won't.

24
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,480
I don't believe you.

25
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,480
Unless you promise me.

26
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,480
Promise?

27
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,480
How?

28
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,480
You'll use one thing as your enemy.

29
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,480
What?

30
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,480
The most precious thing.

31
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,480
The thing you cherish the most.

32
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,480
But I don't have anything on me.

33
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,480
I want to be with you.

34
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,480
I want to be with you.

35
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,480
Because after the end,

36
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,480
we'll meet again.

37
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,480
Mr. Zhen.

38
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,480
You little bitch.

39
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,480
Although Song'er is a good girl,

40
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,480
I can see that she's a good person.

41
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,480
You little bitch.

42
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,480
I've given you the most precious thing.

43
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,480
We'll definitely avenge you.

44
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,480
What are you playing?

45
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,480
Stop pretending.

46
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,480
Stop pretending.

47
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,480
Let go of me.

48
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,480
Zhenxuan.

49
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,480
I really miss you.

50
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,480
Can you come to the dreamland to see me?

51
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,480
Little bitch.

52
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,480
Little bitch.

53
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,480
Little bitch.

54
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,480
Let me go first.

55
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,480
Don't die.

56
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,480
Little bitch.

57
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,480
I've given you the dragon scale.

58
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,480
Let me take a breath.

59
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,480
Come out.

60
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,480
Thank you for your kindness.

61
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,480
No one is hurt.

62
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,480
You're not stupid.

63
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,480
What are you looking for me for today?

64
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,480
The blood dragon gate.

65
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,480
I believe you are the director of Mocheng Police Station.

66
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,480
No matter what you do,

67
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,480
I want to see Shan Yingshu's body.

68
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,480
President.

69
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,480
Don't be angry.

70
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,480
I'll find a way.

71
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,480
Get out.

72
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,480
OK.

73
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,480
An'an.

74
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,480
You follow her.

75
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,480
I'm getting more and more worried about Wu Xin's current work.

76
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,480
I understand.

77
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,480
You're here.

78
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,480
Chongming.

79
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,480
Do you feel that

80
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,480
since we were restricted by Qi,

81
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,480
the organs on our body

82
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,480
don't feel like ours?

83
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,480
What organs?

84
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,480
For example,

85
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,480
heart,

86
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,480
liver, spleen and kidney.

87
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,480
They say Long Qingyin,

88
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,480
you've fallen in love with her.

89
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,480
What are you thinking?

90
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,480
How could I fall in love with her?

91
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,480
Have you heard of

92
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
the dragon gate?

93
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,480
Sister.

94
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,480
I'm here to see you.

95
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,480
I've got the news you wanted.

96
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,480
Dragon Gate.

97
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,480
What does she want?

98
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,480
Sister.

99
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,480
Here are all the information you wanted.

100
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,480
According to your description,

101
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,480
I've found so many information

102
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,480
about your sister.

103
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,480
You have a sister?

104
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,480
My sister was taken away.

105
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,480
I think she must be still alive.

106
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,480
Moshenghai has trained many orphans.

107
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,480
As a confidant or killer,

108
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,480
they usually do some secret business.

109
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,480
But I don't think

110
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,480
they can do it.

111
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
As a confidant or killer,

112
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,480
they usually do some

113
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,480
assassinations or spy work.

114
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,480
That's why Moshenghai has been

115
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,480
a loser for so many years.

116
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,480
I'll take a closer look.

117
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,480
I'll take a look with you.

118
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,480
Bro.

119
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,480
I happen to be looking for you.

120
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,480
What... what are you doing?

121
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,480
Come with me.

122
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,480
You...

123
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,480
Brother Hao.

124
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,480
I've told you.

125
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,480
I have a common enemy with my sister.

126
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,480
We're on the same boat.

127
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
You two are her bodyguards.

128
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,480
We're on the same boat.

129
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,480
If you keep talking nonsense,

130
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,480
I promise

131
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,480
you won't have to

132
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,480
talk nonsense again.

133
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,480
I see.

134
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,480
Bye.

135
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,480
Wait, I'll go...

136
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,480
Brother.

137
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,480
Wait.

138
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,480
Brother, where are you going?

139
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,480
Don't joke around.

140
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,480
It's 50 miles away from here.

141
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,480
Brother.

142
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,480
Hao Jue.

143
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,480
You bastard.

144
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,480
You bastard.

145
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,480
Madam, you're here.

146
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,480
Manager Li.

147
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,480
Is everything normal in the shop?

148
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,480
Report to Director.

149
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,480
Uncle Jiu, the reward is here.

150
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,480
Yes.

151
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,480
The Moon Dragon Gate.

152
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,480
The paper

153
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,480
was torn off

154
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,480
from the secret place.

155
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,480
It's clearly recorded.

156
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,480
The Dragon's Lair

157
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,480
opens the sky.

158
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,480
As long as a dragon falls,

159
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,480
the Dragon Gate will open.

160
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,480
Then,

161
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,480
whoever can pass through the Dragon Gate

162
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,480
will be able to become a real dragon.

163
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,480
But Hao Jue has strong magical power.

164
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,480
Even if I try my best,

165
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
I may not be able to kill him.

166
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
That's right.

167
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,480
He has someone

168
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,480
who can kill him.

169
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,480
You mean

170
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,480
Shan Yun Shu?

171
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,480
Yes.

172
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,480
In order to protect Shan Yun Shu,

173
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,480
Hao Jue gave him his protective forest.

174
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,480
In this world,

175
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,480
it's impossible to kill a real dragon.

176
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,480
Except for the Dragon Bead,

177
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,480
it's a counter-attack.

178
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,480
As long as Jiayi uses it,

179
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,480
the protection he gives to Shan Yun Shu

180
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,480
will also give him

181
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,480
the most fatal attack.

182
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,480
By then,

183
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,480
you'll become a dragon.

184
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,480
I'll take my Dragon Bead

185
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,480
and take it one step at a time.

186
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,480
What are you doing here?

187
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,480
I want to make a decision.

188
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,480
What are you doing here?

189
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,480
I'm copying the map of the Spirit Formation

190
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,480
to see if I can find

191
00:07:48,480 --> 00:08:01,820
the power to suppress the

192
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,480
Dragon Bead.

193
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,480
No.

194
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,480
The Crown Prince's expression

195
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,480
has betrayed himself.

196
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,480
What are you doing?

197
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,480
Today, I'll see

198
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,480
what kind of power you have.

199
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,480
I'll never let you

200
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,480
get away with this.

201
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,480
Hao Jue,

202
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,480
today is your death day.

203
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,480
It turns out that Director Wu

204
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,480
is here.

205
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,480
There's a reason.

206
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
Mrs. Shan,

207
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,480
where are your two bodyguards?

208
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,480
They're not here.

209
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,480
I don't know why

210
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,480
Director Wu is looking for them.

211
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,480
Why?

212
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,480
You know it well.

213
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,480
I was caught by the police two days ago.

214
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,480
I suspect that

215
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,480
your bodyguards are with the bandits.

216
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,480
What's the point?

217
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,480
It's a shame.

218
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,480
I'm afraid you've misunderstood.

219
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,480
The bandits were sent by Mo Shenhai.

220
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,480
They hurt my housekeeper

221
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,480
and my aunt.

222
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,480
I've explained the reason

223
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,480
to Detective Zhang.

224
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,480
Do you have any evidence?

225
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,480
Evidence?

226
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,480
Director,

227
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,480
I'm the victim.

228
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,480
Shouldn't I be responsible

229
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,480
for finding evidence?

230
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,480
You point out others,

231
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,480
but you don't know the evidence.

232
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,480
Then please

233
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,480
come with us.

234
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,480
We'll make it clear in the bureau.

235
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
You want to rebel?

236
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,480
Leave us.

237
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,480
I'll be back soon.

238
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,480
Take care of the store and the dock.

239
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,480
Yes, Madam.

240
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,480
Let's go.

241
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,480
Director Wu,

242
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,480
it seems that

243
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,480
we're not going back to the Bureau.

244
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,480
There are other things to do.

245
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,480
Don't bother.

246
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,480
Director,

247
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,480
the road ahead is blocked by the trees.

248
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,480
Then let's go around.

249
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,480
Yes.

250
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,480
Go.

251
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,480
Don't move.

252
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,480
Stand up.

253
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,480
Don't move.

254
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,480
Lin Chen.

255
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,480
Lin Chen.

256
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,480
I said you're not my opponent.

257
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,480
I underestimated you.

258
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,480
You challenged me

259
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,480
for the sake of the Book of Good Words.

260
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,480
If I say you're my opponent,

261
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,480
you can't hide anything.

262
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,480
I want the Dragon Bead.

263
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,480
No.

264
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,480
No.

265
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,480
Are you okay?

266
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,480
Don't talk.

267
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,480
I'll take you to the hospital.

268
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,480
Lin Chen,

269
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,480
am I going to die?

270
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,480
Can you kiss me?

271
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,480
It makes me feel better.

272
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,480
Do you know?

273
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,480
This is the first time

274
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,480
I've seen you so closely.

275
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,480
It's great.

276
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,480
Don't be silly.

277
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,480
You can still have a chance.

278
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,480
Lin Chen,

279
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,480
can't you even

280
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,480
satisfy my wish?

281
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,480
I...

282
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,480
I forgot this.

283
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,480
You're good at acting.

284
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,480
You almost fooled me.

285
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,480
Why don't you go to the theater?

286
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,480
Get out of here.

287
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,480
Great.

288
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,480
I finally got the killer to do the same.

289
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,480
Lin Chen,

290
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,480
you can rest assured.

291
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,480
Go back.

292
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,480
Are you okay?

293
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,480
I'm sorry, Madam.

294
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,480
We're late.

295
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,480
The play hasn't finished.

296
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,480
Lin Chen,

297
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,480
I'm sorry.

298
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,480
I'm sorry.

299
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,480
I'm sorry.

300
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,480
I'm sorry.

301
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,480
I'm sorry.

302
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,480
I'm sorry.

303
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,480
I'm sorry.

304
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,480
I'm sorry.

305
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,480
I'm sorry.

306
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,480
I'm sorry.

307
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,480
I'm sorry.

308
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,480
I'm sorry.

309
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,480
I'm sorry.

310
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,480
I'm sorry.

311
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,480
I'm sorry.

312
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,480
I'm sorry.

313
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,480
I'm sorry.

314
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,480
I'm sorry.

315
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,480
I'm sorry.

316
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,480
I'm sorry.

317
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,480
I'm sorry.

318
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,480
I'm sorry.

319
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,480
I'm sorry.

320
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,480
I'm sorry.

321
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,480
I'm sorry.

322
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,480
I'm sorry.

323
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,480
I'm sorry.

324
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,480
I'm sorry.

325
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,480
I'm sorry.

326
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,480
I'm sorry.

327
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,480
I'm sorry.

328
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,480
I'm sorry.

329
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,480
I'm sorry.

330
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,480
I'm sorry.

331
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,480
I'm sorry.

332
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,480
I'm sorry.

333
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,480
Baby

334
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,480
Sorry.

335
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,480
Sorry.

336
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,480
Sorry.

337
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,480
What?

338
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,480
Baby

339
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,480
I thought Niannian had just taken a rest for two hours in the park 단調

340
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,480
Of course, that's true .

341
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,480
Just then

342
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,480
In the car

343
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,280
I dug my way by a far agenda

344
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,480
You wish, dear

345
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:53,100
Because of our contact, after a thousand years, I want to love you through time

346
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:59,740
Running to meet you, I don't want to end the contact

347
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:09,600
Because of our contact, after a thousand years, I want to feel sad without telling you
