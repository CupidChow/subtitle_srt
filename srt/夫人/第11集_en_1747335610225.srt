00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
My Dear Brothers EP1

2
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You are really not a human.

3
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What benefits did he give you

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
to let you be so selfish?

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Sister, the more you know, the more you die.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I don't like to die.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I like to eat fresh food.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:18,200
Isaw the

9
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,000
Yuhan, how is it?

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,240
I am much better, don't worry.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I was chatting with Sister about yesterday.

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,600
It's my honor.

13
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,400
You two are getting along so fast.

14
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,360
Are you hungry?

15
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,440
Do you want to eat something?

16
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,360
I'll make it for you.

17
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,600
Steamed or deep-fried,

18
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,600
he can do both.

19
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,480
Brother Chong Ming,

20
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,040
you know me.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,400
What's going on?

22
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,160
I've only been gone for a few days.

23
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,400
And this happened?

24
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,000
It's hard to explain.

25
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,920
How about I move here

26
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,920
to protect you?

27
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,240
I'm worried about you.

28
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,400
I was impulsive yesterday

29
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,640
and hurt Mo Shan Hai.

30
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,560
I'm afraid it won't be easy to get back.

31
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,440
What?

32
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,720
You hit Mo Shan Hai?

33
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,040
I saw you were hurt.

34
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,240
I suspect Mo Shan Hai

35
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,000
had a mysterious person come to warn me.

36
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,760
So I let Ao Jue hurt him.

37
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,960
That's so funny.

38
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,360
It's better to kill him

39
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,800
than to kill him.

40
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,480
It's troublesome to keep him alive.

41
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,560
Some people think they're the Goddesses.

42
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,480
My parents were framed by Mo Shan Hai.

43
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,600
The Mohist School has been in the dark for 20 years.

44
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,880
I wish Mo Shan Hai would die

45
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,200
more than anyone else.

46
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,920
But if he really dies,

47
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,440
it'll be hard to prove my parents' innocence.

48
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,440
And I promised Yu Han

49
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,960
that I'd spare him this time.

50
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,120
I won't owe him anything anymore.

51
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,840
What should we do now?

52
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,280
Let's wait and see.

53
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,880
Let's see what we can do.

54
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,720
Let's eat first.

55
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,040
Let's eat first.

56
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,480
Why don't you

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,440
stay with me for a few more days

58
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,400
so that I can take care of you?

59
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,440
No.

60
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,160
If I stay here for a few more days,

61
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,040
Mo Shan Hai might be unfavorable to you.

62
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Let me go back.

63
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,520
Maybe I can be a jade

64
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:44,040
to make a

65
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,600
jade bowl.

66
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,160
No need.

67
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,160
You just take care of yourself.

68
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,160
Mo Shan Hai doesn't dare to do anything to me.

69
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,160
Sister, I beg you.

70
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,160
You say it.

71
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,160
I'm injured now.

72
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,160
It's not convenient to move.

73
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,160
Can you send me a baby?

74
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,000
Can you send me a bodyguard?

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,520
Okay.

76
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,600
Who do you want?

77
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,400
Him.

78
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,640
Okay.

79
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:06,960
Chong Ming.

80
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,720
From tomorrow on,

81
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,880
you follow my sister first.

82
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,640
Come back when she's recovered.

83
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,200
Yes, Madam.

84
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,560
I'm not eating.

85
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,080
Sister, I'll go back to the police station

86
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,560
to see if Mo Shan Hai has called the police.

87
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,400
I'll leave first.

88
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,680
Okay.

89
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,640
Sister, I'm not eating.

90
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,960
I'll pack up and go back.

91
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,480
Okay.

92
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,480
Do you need my help?

93
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,160
No.

94
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,000
Let Chong Ming help me.

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,760
Chong Ming,

96
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,000
help my sister back to the room first.

97
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,320
Thank you, Chong Ming.

98
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,480
Long Er.

99
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,160
I brought you dumplings.

100
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,920
Open the door.

101
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,360
Long Er.

102
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,040
Are you still angry?

103
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,240
You were really angry yesterday.

104
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,240
You were angry yesterday.

105
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,360
It was really my fault yesterday.

106
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,760
I shouldn't have said that about you.

107
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,120
I know you did it for my own good.

108
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,000
I apologize to you.

109
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,960
Come out and eat.

110
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,000
You're a mortal now.

111
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,200
You'll get hungry if you don't eat.

112
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,600
It's none of your business if I don't eat.

113
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,640
Long Er.

114
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,440
That's enough.

115
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,080
You're a man.

116
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,280
You're the Crown Prince.

117
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,640
You're angry with a woman.

118
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,480
If it's spread, people will think you're mean.

119
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,320
I'm not in the room.

120
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,840
I'll put the dumplings outside the door.

121
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:21,780
Yo Yo.

122
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,400
The Crown Prince is here,

123
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,840
unlike a nonsmokers.

124
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,920
Are you mad at me orство cheap?

125
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,200
That's enough.

126
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,160
I won't talk about it anymore.

127
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,200
Eat now.

128
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,680
I won't eat and I won't be hungry.

129
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,160
Eat it.

130
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,160
Don't be stubborn.

131
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,800
Then you're wrong.

132
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,920
I know. I know.

133
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,040
What's wrong?

134
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,480
You said I was wrong.

135
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,400
So I was wrong.

136
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,360
Look.

137
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,160
You know it clearly.

138
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,800
You care about this brother's feelings.

139
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,760
You care about that sister's feelings, too.

140
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,320
You care about their feelings

141
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,360
when you're just hanging out with them.

142
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,200
You don't care about my feelings.

143
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,160
Who said that?

144
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,640
Of course I care about your feelings.

145
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,920
I didn't know you were hungry

146
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,360
so I brought you dumplings.

147
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,680
You always look down on me.

148
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,320
You're not a ruma or a city leader.

149
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,360
I'm your bodyguard.

150
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,440
I'm not your slave.

151
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,080
I won't do this again.

152
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,960
Okay. Okay.

153
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,440
I'll care more about your feelings

154
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,600
and your thoughts in the future.

155
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,520
You're clear.

156
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,720
Next time.

157
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,920
Sha Yun Shu.

158
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,120
What's wrong?

159
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,920
Someone is helping you kill someone.

160
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,920
Come with us.

161
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,320
It's okay.

162
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,760
Eat the dumplings first.

163
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,160
You're here to steal the records.

164
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,440
This beef cake is delicious.

165
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,320
Try it.

166
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,760
Don't get in the way.

167
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,840
Where did you put it after you stole the records?

168
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,760
I ruined it.

169
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,400
What else can I do?

170
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,200
Come on.

171
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,880
This...

172
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,680
This cotton candy is delicious.

173
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,120
You must have never eaten it.

174
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,760
You're so loyal to Mo Sheng Hai.

175
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,840
You don't have to betray your own sister.

176
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,840
Brother Chong Ming.

177
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,440
My sister asked you to take care of me.

178
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,920
Not to interrogate me.

179
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,640
Right?

180
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,320
Or

181
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,480
you want to get rid of me from your sister

182
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,200
and take the opportunity to sneak attack.

183
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,600
I advise you not to waste time.

184
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,800
What are you doing?

185
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,360
You look quite serious.

186
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,240
But why are you talking so much?

187
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,200
Are you tired?

188
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,600
Do you like Sha Yun Shu?

189
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,520
What's wrong with liking?

190
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,320
What's wrong with not liking?

191
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,800
It's your business.

192
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,000
All strangers like him.

193
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,560
Do you think we look alike?

194
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,000
Yes.

195
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,600
A little.

196
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,800
Do you like me?

197
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,280
Yes.

198
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,440
I like to eat it grilled.

199
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,840
Dip it in sauce.

200
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,040
Steamed or braised,

201
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,920
it's all good.

202
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,520
You're funny.

203
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,880
But I like you.

204
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,640
Let's go.

205
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,440
Let's eat noodles.

206
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,440
Let go.

207
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,320
Let go.

208
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:49,920
Let go.

209
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,320
Let go.

210
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:51,720
Let go.

211
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,960
Why are you so slow?

212
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,720
Are you shy about your book?

213
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,160
Why are you so ferocious?

214
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,920
What are you?

215
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,280
How long can you live?

216
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,800
Are you longer than my grandfather's grandfather?

217
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,160
Sha Yun Shu.

218
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,760
Someone reported the case last night.

219
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,200
He reported you were assaulting at the dock.

220
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,560
Do you admit it?

221
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,000
It was Mo Shan Hai who reported it, right?

222
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,360
I did hit him yesterday.

223
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,200
I'm willing to take the responsibility and compensation.

224
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,840
Good.

225
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,880
I'm afraid you can't afford it.

226
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,880
Who are they?

227
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,400
You don't recognize them?

228
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,240
You let your subordinates

229
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,600
kill the innocent.

230
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,720
You killed seven people in total.

231
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,600
Shan Hui Chang.

232
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,640
You're too impulsive.

233
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,200
You caused such a big bloodshed.

234
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,080
I'm useless, too.

235
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,480
I did have a conflict with Mo Shan Hai last night.

236
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,720
But it didn't cause the death of the staff.

237
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,640
If you want to frame me,

238
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,560
at least you need evidence.

239
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,920
How dare you?

240
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,480
If you say I framed you again,

241
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,560
what evidence do you have to prove

242
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,240
that I killed these people?

243
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,680
I think you're not crying because you didn't see the coffin.

244
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,240
We not only have evidence,

245
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,720
but also witness.

246
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,200
I'll see how you'll explain it.

247
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,920
Can I see the witness?

248
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,800
I didn't expect you to be a good drinker.

249
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,120
One more.

250
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,120
No more.

251
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,360
You know you're drunk.

252
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,800
But you're not.

253
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,000
To be honest,

254
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,560
I've been with you for so many days.

255
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,040
This is the most relaxing and happy day for me.

256
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,040
Your sister loves you very much.

257
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,720
She's been looking for you for a long time.

258
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,280
You can't

259
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,880
let her down.

260
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,200
Do you care about her that much?

261
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,320
Of course I care about her.

262
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,520
She and I

263
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,240
are like dragon and pig.

264
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,120
Dragon and pig?

265
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,280
Yes.

266
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,160
Dragon and pig are sacred animals.

267
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,960
They can kill people,

268
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,160
kill people,

269
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,560
and have endless power.

270
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,640
Twenty years ago,

271
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,480
she accidentally entered your sister's body.

272
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,520
So we both became her bodyguards.

273
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,360
I protected her

274
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,880
to get the dragon and pig back.

275
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,360
You revealed the dragon and pig to her on purpose.

276
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,480
What do you want?

277
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,720
If you want to kill me,

278
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,640
you must kill me first.

279
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,200
I don't want to keep Mosheng Sea.

280
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,920
I still need her.

281
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,480
I won't let you kill her.

282
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,440
What if I exchange the life of Aojue and the dragon and pig with yours?

283
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,200
At that time,

284
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,880
the car of Mosheng Sea's president passed by.

285
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,280
Suddenly, a car was turned over.

286
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,120
Then, the bodyguards of Shanyun Shu

287
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,880
started to beat the president and his men.

288
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,160
Soon after, Shanyun Shu came too.

289
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,520
They continued to beat them.

290
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,040
This is what I saw.

291
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,040
Why do you look so long?

292
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,240
Nothing.

293
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,600
I'm a little uncomfortable.

294
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,720
Mosheng Sea is prepared this time.

295
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,520
Is there any way to save her?

296
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,480
Zhang Jingkai,

297
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,320
what are you talking about?

298
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,000
Director,

299
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,480
I'm interrogating the case.

300
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,320
What's the matter?

301
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,720
According to what you said,

302
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,760
you only saw

303
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,080
Shanyun Shu and her bodyguards

304
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,040
beating Mosheng Sea and her men.

305
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,520
You didn't see

306
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,840
if the dead person was dead, right?

307
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,640
Yes.

308
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,960
It was raining.

309
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,160
They beat her with their weapons.

310
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,760
We didn't dare to get close.

311
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,520
We watched them fight.

312
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,880
Zhang Jingkai,

313
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,200
what do you mean?

314
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,800
The witness didn't see the murderer kill someone.

315
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,080
That doesn't count?

316
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,840
Director,

317
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,320
you've seen the bodyguards of Shanyun Shu.

318
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,760
If you really want to kill someone,

319
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,960
you don't have to do so much.

320
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,880
Besides,

321
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,120
the wound on the body

322
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,080
is obvious

323
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,880
that the murderer was killed by the group of European countries.

324
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,920
Zhang Mingkai,

325
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,200
I think you don't want to work here.

326
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,280
You are turning the murderer upside down

327
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,360
and turning the truth upside down.

328
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,440
Director,

329
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,280
the murderer is here.

330
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,040
Good.

331
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,280
Don't you want to see the witness?

332
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,880
I'll let you die a good death.

333
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,680
Bring the person in.

334
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,640
Yes.

335
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,640
Mu Yuhan,

336
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,200
you saw the crime scene?

337
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,720
Yes.

338
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,640
Mu Yuhan,

339
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,120
you are so heartless.

340
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,080
Zhang Mingkai,

341
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,520
stop talking nonsense.

342
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,880
Bring her in.

343
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,280
Yes.

344
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:58,960
Mu Yuhan,

345
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,160
you framed your own sister.

346
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,000
You are not a human.

347
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,880
Go on.

348
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,280
Last night,

349
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,320
I saw the murderer

350
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,080
kill the bodyguard at the dock.

351
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,200
Good.

352
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,840
Who is the murderer?

353
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,720
They.

354
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,480
You framed us.

355
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,560
Did you point the wrong person?

356
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,720
I saw it with my own eyes.

357
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,040
These workers

358
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,760
killed the bodyguard.

359
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,120
I saw the stranger kneeling just now.

360
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,480
He said the same thing.

361
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,040
The...

362
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,960
The head of the Mo Shenhai Group said so?

363
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,960
If you don't believe me, you can call him.

364
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,120
Take them away.

365
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,360
We'll find him another day.

366
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,440
Go.

367
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,760
Director,

368
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,680
we are innocent.

369
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,120
We are innocent.

370
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,880
Director.

371
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,560
Director.

372
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,280
We are innocent.

373
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,480
We are innocent, director.

374
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Director.

375
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,160
We are innocent.

376
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,760
Are you still not done?

377
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:10,960
Sister.

378
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,040
The head of the Mo Shenhai Group said

379
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,120
if you apologize to your bodyguard,

380
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,640
he can forget about it.

381
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,640
Apologize?

382
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,560
I won't go.

383
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,960
I won't go.

384
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,120
Because Mo Shenhai used you

385
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,080
and hurt you.

386
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,520
I did nothing wrong.

387
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,880
My good sister.

388
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm sorry.

389
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,840
Don't be angry.

390
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,080
Just apologize.

391
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,120
Just go, sister.

392
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,400
A good man doesn't eat a good meal.

393
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,120
Don't be afraid.

394
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,320
I can go with you.

395
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,360
I will never go.

396
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,880
I will never go.

397
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,960
It depends on the time.

398
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,840
Your bodyguard should be here soon.

399
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,160
Soon?

400
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,760
What do you mean?

401
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,560
I will never go.

402
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,120
I will never go.

403
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,400
I will never go.

404
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,840
I will never go.

405
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,440
I will never go.

406
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,880
I will never go.

407
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,280
I will never go.

408
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,640
I will never go.

409
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,120
I will never go.

410
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,600
I will never go.

411
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,120
I will never go.

412
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,640
I will never go.

413
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,120
I will never go.

414
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,640
I will never go.

415
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,120
I will never go.

416
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,600
I will never go.

417
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,120
I will never go.

418
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,640
I will never go.

419
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,120
I will never go.

420
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,640
I will never go.

421
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,240
Zhou Jinzhen

422
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,200
Impact

423
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,440
Need love

424
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,440
Because of the storm

425
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,120
after a thousand years

426
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,100
I love you for generations

427
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,940
running to see you
