00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,360
mejor

2
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,360
b

3
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,600
Who is the ghost?

4
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,760
Report your name

5
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,680
Neither a man or a ghost

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,680
Chief.

7
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,600
This is...

8
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,840
This is the murderer who hurt Zeng Baozhu and Zhao Xuyang

9
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,960
and tried to sneak into the police station

10
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,560
to kill Madam's uncle.

11
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:08,880
But

12
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,240
I've caught him.

13
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,760
He confessed everything.

14
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,440
Chief.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,520
I brought my two bodyguards

16
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,680
to apologize to you.

17
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,400
Please show your mercy.

18
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,360
You two are so great.

19
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,640
I don't think you're robbers.

20
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:23,840
It's a misunderstanding.

21
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,440
It must be a misunderstanding.

22
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,760
Let's go.

23
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,400
Chief.

24
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,520
Sister.

25
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,240
I'm leaving, too.

26
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,440
Why don't you talk?

27
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,360
Are you unhappy about your revenge?

28
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,640
The one who died just now

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,240
wasn't the murderer who killed me.

30
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,720
How do you know?

31
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,800
I've fought with the murderer many times.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,720
I know his attack moves and ability to assassinate.

33
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,120
The one who attacked me today tried his best to imitate me.

34
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,240
He's far from the murderer.

35
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,320
Why didn't you tell me just now?

36
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,720
Chief Wu has been looking for me many times.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,600
He must have something to do with Mosheng Hai.

38
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,520
He drove me around today

39
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,120
to set up this trap.

40
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,760
Trap?

41
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,600
They

42
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,240
want to know the bottom line of Madam.

43
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,560
If they succeed,

44
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,800
they'll kill Madam and end the trouble.

45
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,200
If they fail,

46
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,840
they'll break free

47
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,200
and get rid of the suspect.

48
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,720
What should we do next?

49
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,440
We'll do what we can.

50
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,200
If the enemy thinks we've relaxed the security guard,

51
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,560
they'll show their claws.

52
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,880
Madam.

53
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,200
It's okay.

54
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,000
By the way,

55
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,040
what did you two do today?

56
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,440
I saw you two were all in a daze when you came.

57
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,080
Madam.

58
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,480
Nothing.

59
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,840
Don't think too much.

60
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,880
She wanted to fight with me.

61
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,200
But I defeated her easily.

62
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,840
What?

63
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,400
Are you afraid of losing face?

64
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,280
Hao Jue, you...

65
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,840
Childish.

66
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,880
Hao Jue, don't be so proud.

67
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,240
I'll defeat you.

68
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,080
You're always so arrogant.

69
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,400
It seems that

70
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,120
I should give you less of my blood.

71
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,760
Or you'll cause me trouble.

72
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,160
You're still concerned about us?

73
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,680
You should take care of yourself.

74
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,320
You don't know how bad your alcohol tolerance is.

75
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,400
Long,

76
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,440
mind your own business.

77
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,240
I'm an obedient girl after drinking.

78
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,240
I just like to sleep.

79
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,520
Madam.

80
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,760
Who said you're good at drinking?

81
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,360
If you're good at drinking,

82
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,800
you'll have a good reputation in the whole world.

83
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,360
If you don't believe me, ask Chong Ming.

84
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,600
You even call me brother Chong Ming.

85
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,560
You're so arrogant.

86
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,520
Impossible.

87
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,520
Long,

88
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,200
don't ruin my life.

89
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,200
Believe it or not, I'll punish you.

90
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,080
Punish me?

91
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,120
You're so horrible

92
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,360
after drinking.

93
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,720
If you have the ability,

94
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,960
just kill me.

95
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,440
I'm clean.

96
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,640
Hallelujah.

97
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,640
Sorry.

98
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:20,220
Don't

99
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:20,760
hurt me.

100
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,360
The mountains and rivers, the roads and roads,

101
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,360
there will always be an end.

102
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,360
Love and hate are entangled, pretending to be gentle.

103
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,360
The black night flowers are always in the way.

104
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,360
You are always alone, always alone.

105
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,360
Why can't I control it?

106
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,360
I remember Vice President is so strong.

107
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,360
I'm sorry.

108
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,360
They all say you are not my opponent.

109
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,360
It seems that killing Ao Jue is not a good idea.

110
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,360
God is not afraid of danger.

111
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,360
I'm sorry.

112
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,360
Chief Zhang, you can leave the hospital.

113
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,360
Your injury is not a big problem.

114
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,360
It hurts.

115
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,360
I endure it. Change the medicine.

116
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,360
I want to hurry up and go to see sister.

117
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,360
Ming Kai.

118
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,360
Sister, you are here.

119
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,360
Don't worry. I don't hurt at all.

120
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,360
I went to the police station yesterday.

121
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,360
I just heard that you didn't get out of the hospital.

122
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,360
Are you feeling better now?

123
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,360
The doctor said it's nothing serious.

124
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,360
But I have a little pain.

125
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,360
I don't know what's going on.

126
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,360
Pain all over the body.

127
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,360
Did you lie down for too long?

128
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,360
How about I help you down and walk?

129
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
Okay.

130
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,360
Madam is weak.

131
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,360
I'll take you to walk.

132
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,360
Don't pull me.

133
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,360
Sister, save me.

134
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,360
Ao Jue.

135
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,360
Sister.

136
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
Let go of Ming Kai.

137
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,360
Don't pull me.

138
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,360
Stop.

139
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,360
I can't sit still.

140
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,360
The doctor said

141
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,360
you used the mirror for her.

142
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,360
You bitch.

143
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,360
I won't be your brother if you keep bothering me.

144
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,360
You didn't find me.

145
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,360
My lord.

146
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,360
Who are you?

147
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,360
You are not conscience.

148
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,760
A hundred years ago, in the snowy mountains in the south.

149
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,720
So you're the fox fairy I saved.

150
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,960
Your Highness,

151
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,520
they all said that you disappeared when you arrived at the Dragon Pearl.

152
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,080
I was so sad for days.

153
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,800
What are you doing here?

154
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,720
Don't mention it.

155
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,280
It's all bad luck.

156
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,800
Do you want me to help you

157
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,880
to get rid of bad luck?

158
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,920
Forget it.

159
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,920
Qiqi,

160
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,720
do your two bodyguards

161
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,600
like you?

162
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,560
Like me?

163
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,360
Me?

164
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,640
How is that possible?

165
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,160
I think they're not normal to you.

166
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,640
Especially that Zhao Aojue.

167
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,960
You're mistaken.

168
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,920
We only have Qi Yuan.

169
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,520
They don't care about me.

170
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,840
I just have what they need.

171
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,960
You're miserable.

172
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,000
You're in love.

173
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,040
Nonsense.

174
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,880
When did I fall in love with someone?

175
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,480
It's because you haven't fallen in love in a thousand years.

176
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,920
That's why you look so scary.

177
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,760
Impossible.

178
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,880
Did you have a woman around you recently?

179
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,440
And you can't get rid of her for a while.

180
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,040
That's not love.

181
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,320
And there are many men around her.

182
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,000
You'll feel uncomfortable when you see her with these men.

183
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,360
How about I let you be my sister?

184
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,360
I promise you.

185
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,000
Are you feeling better now?

186
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,480
Yes.

187
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,600
You touched her.

188
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,760
And you're not annoying.

189
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,160
You even want to approach her.

190
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,560
Whenever you're bored,

191
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,920
you think about her and can't sleep.

192
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,240
Once she misses you,

193
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:46,400
you will Bill president

194
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,960
the blockhead of the station.

195
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,760
No matter who asked you that,

196
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,840
you will never return me the favor.

197
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,400
Because you can forget me.

198
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,560
Like you do?

199
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,720
Why?

200
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,960
You can forget me?

201
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,120
Then you will be lonely.

202
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,400
You are meat and vegetables.

203
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,720
You like meat a lot.

204
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,040
Don't overreact.

205
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,760
My mother and I have been through a lot.

206
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,560
My father

207
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,400
killed my mother

208
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,920
for the benefit of his family

209
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,440
and his future.

210
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,560
I'm the only one

211
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,120
in this world.

212
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,760
This is your thousand-year-old love knot.

213
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,960
You can't avoid it.

214
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,840
If you can't handle it,

215
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,440
you'll be in danger.

216
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,360
Either you kill him

217
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,440
or you conquer him.

218
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,920
There's no other way.

219
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,200
I can't kill him.

220
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,840
I can only conquer him.

221
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,560
I'm afraid I can't kill him alone.

222
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,480
I can only let him conquer him.

223
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,480
You're fired.

224
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,000
We don't need you anymore.

225
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,240
It's enough that you're with us.

226
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,480
You can leave now.

227
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,880
What are you doing?

228
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,440
Do you know?

229
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,720
You fired me.

230
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,080
We only listen to you.

231
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,000
Besides,

232
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,200
how about the pay?

233
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,040
Yes.

234
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,760
And my sister, Yao Yao.

235
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,080
You fired me.

236
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,800
Where can I find a job?

237
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,920
Yes.

238
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,480
Where can I find a job?

239
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,880
I'll give you a job.

240
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,280
You can't do that.

241
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,480
You can't do that.

242
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,720
You can't do that.

243
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,640
I'll give you

244
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,560
the money and treasure

245
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,800
that you'll never need.

246
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,560
This is my kindness to you.

247
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,520
Take the money and leave.

248
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,560
Wang Xun, are you serious?

249
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,920
After they leave,

250
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,800
who will clean up?

251
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,880
Who will cook?

252
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,320
Who will clean the courtyard?

253
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,200
You.

254
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,440
Me?

255
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,040
I can't do that.

256
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,840
Then leave one to cook.

257
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,680
Where is he?

258
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,360
Sha Yun Shu thought you were dead.

259
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,360
This is the right time

260
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,000
for you to approach him.

261
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,280
You mean...

262
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,600
From now on,

263
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,560
you don't have to live in the dark.

264
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,080
From now on,

265
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,080
don't be sorry.

266
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,800
I'll be sorry.

267
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,000
I'll be sorry.

268
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,240
I'll be sorry.

269
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,440
I'll be sorry.

270
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,640
I'll be sorry.

271
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,840
I'll be sorry.

272
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,040
I'll be sorry.

273
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,240
I'll be sorry.

274
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,440
I'll be sorry.

275
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,640
I'll be sorry.

276
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,840
I'll be sorry.

277
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,040
I'll be sorry.

278
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,240
I'll be sorry.

279
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,440
I'll be sorry.

280
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,640
I'll be sorry.

281
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,840
I'll be sorry.

282
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,040
I'll be sorry.

283
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,240
I'll be sorry.

284
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,440
I'll be sorry.

285
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,640
I'll be sorry.

286
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,840
I'll be sorry.

287
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,040
I'll be sorry.

288
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,040
I'll be sorry.

289
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,640
I'm running to meet you.

290
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,640
I don't want to end this.

291
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,840
Because after this,

292
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,040
after a thousand years,

293
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,440
I can't say it.

294
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,240
For the sake of love,

295
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:30,640
I won't end this.

296
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:39,040
I'm running to meet you.

297
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,840
I don't want to end this.

298
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,240
Because after this,

299
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,640
after a thousand years,

300
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:52,240
I can't say it.

301
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,840
For the sake of love,

302
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,840
I won't end this.

303
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,040
Because after this,

304
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,240
after a thousand years,

305
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:10,040
I can't say it.

306
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,040
For the sake of love,

307
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:23,640
I won't end this.
