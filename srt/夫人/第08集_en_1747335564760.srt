00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
My Dear Brothers EP10

2
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,200
How did you do it?

3
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,080
Where are the maids?

4
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,400
I was so happy that I left.

5
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,000
We'll be your maids and bodyguards in the future.

6
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,600
I'm a bodyguard.

7
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,480
You're a maid.

8
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,320
Don't get me wrong.

9
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:58,720
You...

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,120
May I ask

11
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,920
who can cook?

12
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,880
Who can cook such a terrible dish?

13
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,000
Is it that bad?

14
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,280
Well,

15
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:27,920
let me try.

16
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,640
It's better to be here earlier than to be here now.

17
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,880
I just made breakfast.

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,520
Let me try.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,360
Is it edible?

20
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,600
Who told you to eat it?

21
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,600
I'm glad I'm here.

22
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,320
Or my sister wouldn't have to do it.

23
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,280
She can make the dishes

24
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,640
disgusting.

25
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,120
You'd better eat what I brought.

26
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,680
Mingkai,

27
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,000
are you feeling better?

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,200
You care about me.

29
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,840
I'm feeling much better now.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,880
Don't worry.

31
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,520
I'm here to visit you.

32
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,080
I have three things to tell you.

33
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,160
Go ahead.

34
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,040
The first thing is

35
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,040
I want to be in the same league with you

36
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,280
and deal with Moshenghai together.

37
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,240
The second thing is

38
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,960
the director has asked the female killer

39
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,640
to settle all the charges.

40
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,320
The third thing is

41
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,000
Moshenghai has the majority of the shares

42
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,720
of Dongsheng Trade Company.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,320
If I'm right,

44
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,080
Moshenghai will do everything

45
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,360
to take Dongsheng Trade Company as its ally.

46
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,280
Sister,

47
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,480
you need to make a plan earlier.

48
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,720
I'll think about the first thing carefully.

49
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,400
I want to hear your thoughts

50
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,520
about the second thing.

51
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,120
I can help with the second thing.

52
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,960
I need some time for the third thing.

53
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,880
To move to Moshenghai,

54
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,720
we need to make the long-distance line bigger.

55
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,920
I've got some illegal activities

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,160
in Moshenghai.

57
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,800
If you're interested,

58
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,160
you can come to me anytime.

59
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,520
I'll go to Moshenghai

60
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,600
and tell him where he is.

61
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,520
If it's that simple,

62
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,440
you don't need to worry about it.

63
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,800
Is revenge that complicated?

64
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,400
You think too much.

65
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,040
Moshenghai

66
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,840
can't be solved by death.

67
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,920
What I want

68
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,200
is not only Moshenghai's death.

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,680
Sister, you need to stabilize the internal and external affairs.

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,840
You can solve the external affairs

71
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,360
later.

72
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,880
There must be a reason

73
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,960
for Moshenghai to be the chairman.

74
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,920
These are the clues I've found these years.

75
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,760
Moshenghai is the murderer who killed my parents.

76
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,560
He is the president of Mocheng's largest chamber of commerce

77
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,120
and the biggest charity.

78
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,200
He is doing all kinds of disgusting things in secret.

79
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,080
It's not that complicated

80
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,680
to kill him directly.

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,480
To bring down Moshenghai,

82
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,520
we need to follow the rules of human beings.

83
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,200
We can't do it by force.

84
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,520
And it's easy to die.

85
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,400
But it's too easy for Moshenghai.

86
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,000
Haoqu,

87
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,720
your methods are not working

88
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,760
in the human world.

89
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,280
Maybe it's a good choice

90
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,720
to join hands with Zhang Mingkai.

91
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,000
That guy is so stubborn

92
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,200
and annoying.

93
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,640
I'm worried.

94
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,520
Madam,

95
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,760
I'll go with you.

96
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,560
You're worried about Zhang Mingkai

97
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,280
or about Heipaoyun?

98
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,320
Heipaoyun.

99
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,840
I'm happy that you came to see me.

100
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,160
Because

101
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,440
I'm not alone in the battle.

102
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,440
You've been investigating me.

103
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,080
What did you find?

104
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,560
I know who you are.

105
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,360
How did you know

106
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,920
about this secret?

107
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,960
I told you.

108
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,120
I'm a very good friend.

109
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,040
I'll try my best to protect you.

110
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,120
Sister. Sister.

111
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,000
You'd better

112
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,560
practice to protect yourself.

113
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,800
Don't get hurt.

114
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,720
Be gentle.

115
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,800
I'm sincere to you.

116
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,200
I'll keep you safe.

117
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,360
Sister. Sister.

118
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,640
I'm a man.

119
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,360
I'll do my best.

120
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,240
Let's get to the point.

121
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,000
I'll hold

122
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,680
the life-saving ceremony tomorrow.

123
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,200
Mo Shaihai will choose to start now.

124
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,560
What's your plan?

125
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,720
My plan is

126
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,880
to get out of here

127
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,920
tomorrow.

128
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,880
I'm sorry.

129
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,280
What are you doing?

130
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,080
We're not your allies.

131
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,560
We don't deserve to know the plan.

132
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,120
Only when we know the plan

133
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,000
can we cooperate better.

134
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,040
Mingkai.

135
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,480
Say it out loud.

136
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,800
We should

137
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,360
hear it out.

138
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,240
Well...

139
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,640
Hello, shareholders and managers

140
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,600
of Dongsheng Trade.

141
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,520
Thank you for coming.

142
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,920
You're the shareholders of Dongsheng.

143
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,520
You're the future of Dongsheng Trade.

144
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,000
Recently, the company has been

145
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,520
in a whirlwind.

146
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,760
Now, I've

147
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,200
put an end to it.

148
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,320
Next,

149
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,040
I'll follow the will of the former president

150
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,560
to continue to lead everyone

151
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,280
to fight for Dongsheng.

152
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,720
Let's welcome

153
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,160
Dongsheng's bright future together.

154
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,920
Great.

155
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,200
Great.

156
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,800
Great.

157
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,640
Chen Yingshu.

158
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,520
Dongsheng.

159
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,640
You're not the right president

160
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,160
to be Dongsheng.

161
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,520
I'm not.

162
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,520
This is our family business.

163
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,160
Why are you talking nonsense with an outsider?

164
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,360
Yes.

165
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,000
Get out.

166
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,880
You're not welcome here.

167
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,680
Everyone.

168
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,040
Get out.

169
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,040
You're not welcome here.

170
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,440
Be quiet.

171
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,040
Dongsheng was

172
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,200
founded by the Mo family and the Hu family.

173
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,480
Dongsheng has 30% of the shares of Dongsheng.

174
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,200
Twenty years ago,

175
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,960
the Mo family was killed.

176
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,720
The Mo family's shares

177
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,040
were taken over by the Hu family

178
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,560
and became the chairman.

179
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,680
After the Mo family was killed,

180
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,120
the shares were taken over by the Hu family.

181
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,360
It's none of your business.

182
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,560
You're not the descendant of the Mo family.

183
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,760
Well said.

184
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,760
I, Mo Chenhai,

185
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,560
and the Mo family's master

186
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,680
were friends.

187
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,680
After a lot of research,

188
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,440
I finally found the Mo family's last name.

189
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,440
The second daughter of the Mo family,

190
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,240
Mo Yuhan.

191
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,120
Yuhan.

192
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,560
Come out and say hello to everyone.

193
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,560
Mo Yuhan

194
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,600
President Shan.

195
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,280
Shouldn't you

196
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,000
return the Mo family's shares?

197
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,920
The Mo family's shares

198
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,960
can be re-established.

199
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,960
Mo Chenhai.

200
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,840
You're blocking the old position of President Shan.

201
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,480
Do you have someone in mind?

202
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,200
This is the agreement

203
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,880
signed by your former chairman,

204
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,520
Zong Baozhu and the butler, Zhao Xuyao,

205
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,680
to transfer the shares.

206
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,680
I now have 21% of Dongsheng shares.

207
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,240
Yuhan

208
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,120
authorized me to take over

209
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,240
30% of the Mo family's shares.

210
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,080
I, Mo Chenhai,

211
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,120
have 51% of Dongsheng shares.

212
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,120
I'm the chairman of Dongsheng.

213
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,240
Everyone,

214
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,480
please take it to the Mo family.

215
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,000
Is this agreement real?

216
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,640
This is troublesome.

217
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,960
Don't look.

218
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,720
It's troublesome.

219
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,800
Why don't I send it directly to Shang Xiting?

220
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,360
Yuhan.

221
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,720
You and your mother look alike.

222
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,840
President Shan.

223
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,160
20 years ago,

224
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,120
the Mo family was in a bad situation.

225
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,520
I was the only one who managed to escape.

226
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,160
Thanks to Uncle Mo Shenhai's care,

227
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,120
I hope

228
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,840
the Wu family can get the Mo family's shares back.

229
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,240
How can you

230
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,240
do that?

231
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,440
You're the one who's in trouble.

232
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,640
You're the one who's in trouble.

233
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,720
You're the one who's in trouble.

234
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,520
Why do you say you're Mo Yuhan?

235
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,280
This jade pendant is the family's last name.

236
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,760
Everyone has a jade pendant.

237
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,760
There's a secret message engraved on it.

238
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,120
It can prove my identity.

239
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,520
The people of the Mo family

240
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,160
died 20 years ago.

241
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,200
Who can prove it to you?

242
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,840
Yeah.

243
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,040
Who can prove it to you?

244
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,800
I can.

245
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,800
Yuhan.

246
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,160
Don't you remember me?

247
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,440
I'm your sister.

248
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,280
I'm Mo Yuzi.

249
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,480
You're my sister?

250
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,640
Uncle Shenhai.

251
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,400
You're the eldest daughter of the Mo family.

252
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,400
Are you Si Ma?

253
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
Really?

254
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,520
You two look alike.

255
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,440
Do you know

256
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,080
what's the secret message engraved on the jade pendant?

257
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,200
You were born on the first day of April.

258
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,400
In your jade pendant,

259
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,520
there are a bunch of flowers.

260
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,400
And I was born in winter.

261
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,040
In my jade pendant,

262
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,640
there are a bunch of plum blossoms.

263
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,360
Yuhan.

264
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,480
Is your chest better now?

265
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,080
That year,

266
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,480
you accidentally put the charcoal in the fire.

267
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,840
It fell on your chest.

268
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,840
I blamed myself for it for a long time.

269
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,600
Yuhan.

270
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,920
Don't come over.

271
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,720
That's a big news.

272
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,520
I was hunted by the killers.

273
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,640
Then I was caught by the Hu family.

274
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,000
My fiance, Hu Zhenxuan, asked for it.

275
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,800
Since then,

276
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,920
I've been secretly buried in the Hu family.

277
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,640
I agreed to let the Hu family

278
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,760
take care of the Mo family's shares.

279
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,120
I didn't expect

280
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,680
there was such an experience at the committee.

281
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,920
They say sisters are like mothers.

282
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,520
Since you two know each other well,

283
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,920
Mo Shihai.

284
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,560
Don't worry about the Mo family's shares anymore.

285
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,080
President Shan has 60% of the shares.

286
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,040
There's no problem.

287
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,280
That's not true.

288
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,720
The daughter who got married

289
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,480
is like the water that's poured out.

290
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,880
President Shan is still the wife of the Hu family.

291
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,160
Even if he has shares,

292
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,000
he can't control them all.

293
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,320
Even if you two have 15% of the shares,

294
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,520
President Shan

295
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,720
only has 45% of the shares.

296
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,320
He can't be the president

297
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,080
without the shareholders' vote.

298
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,840
Besides, Zeng Yiniang

299
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,920
transferred some shares

300
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,360
to Mo Shihai.

301
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,080
Zeng Yiniang has been killed.

302
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,440
I don't know

303
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,280
if the shares were agreed on

304
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,080
because of the coercion.

305
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,200
President Shan.

306
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,880
All the shares were transferred voluntarily.

307
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,480
There was no coercion.

308
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,760
Besides,

309
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,520
Zeng Yiniang has been

310
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,320
secretly acquiring the shares for so many years.

311
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,880
What she's afraid of is the East.

312
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,480
She'll be taken down.

313
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,360
Mo Shihai.

314
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,480
Did Zeng Yiniang and the shareholders' transfer

315
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,480
get approved?

316
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,600
The truth

317
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,400
is right here.

318
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,360
Everyone.

319
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,680
I'm Zhang Mingkang, a police detective

320
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,600
of Mo City Police Bureau.

321
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,120
Before Dong Baozhu and Zhao Xuyao died,

322
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,360
they left a regretful message.

323
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,320
Then,

324
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,480
a murderer named Fen killed them.

325
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,520
Although the murderer killed them,

326
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,840
he left some evidence.

327
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,880
Everyone, listen.

328
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,480
What are you doing here?

329
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,720
The case is over.

330
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,840
It has nothing to do with Mo Shihai.

331
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:44,960
Director.

332
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,280
I didn't say

333
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,080
it had something to do with Mo Shihai.

334
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,440
I'm sorry.

335
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,320
I'm sorry.

336
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,240
I'm sorry.

337
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,240
I'm sorry.

338
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,240
I'm sorry.

339
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,240
I'm sorry.

340
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,240
I'm sorry.

341
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,240
I'm sorry.

342
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,240
I'm sorry.

343
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,240
I'm sorry.

344
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,240
I'm sorry.

345
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,240
I'm sorry.

346
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,240
I'm sorry.

347
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,240
I'm sorry.

348
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,240
I'm sorry.

349
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,240
I'm sorry.

350
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,240
I'm sorry.

351
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,240
I'm sorry.

352
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,240
I'm sorry.

353
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,240
I'm sorry.

354
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,240
I'm sorry.

355
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,240
I'm sorry.

356
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,240
I'm sorry.

357
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,240
I'm sorry.

358
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,240
I'm sorry.

359
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,240
I'm sorry.

360
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,240
I'm sorry.

361
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,240
I'm sorry.

362
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,240
I'm sorry.

363
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,240
I'm sorry.

364
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,280
Sorry.

365
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,400
Because after the dispersion

366
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,400
and?

367
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,880
Send you back to Hope

368
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,560
Move then hug

369
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,600
I do not want to end the unbelievably

370
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,560
Because after the dispersion
