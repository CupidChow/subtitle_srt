My Dear Brothers EP10

2
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,600
Mi Ka.

3
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,800
Mi Ka.

4
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,200
Mi Ka.

5
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,000
Sister.

6
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,600
I can finally do something for you.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,800
Don't talk.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I can definitely do something for you.

9
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,200
In the next life,

10
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,200
in the next life,

11
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,000
please

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,000
date me.

13
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,000
Mi Ka.

14
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:16,800
Mi Ka.

15
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,000
It's all my fault.

16
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,800
When I was sleeping in Mo Shenghai's hand,

17
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,800
I met a black-clad man.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,800
I came too late.

19
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,000
Sister.

20
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,800
I was wet from the trout oil and overwet from the 끝.

21
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,800
Per podcastались my eyes met firearm god.

22
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,100
The best weapon for General Ye and its professional members

23
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,000
had been the White Dragon Wha.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,200
The Black Battle Pose.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,800
My Dear Brothers

26
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,600
ied with low blood pressure.

27
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,200
So I ones after others.

28
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,200
One after the other,

29
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,000
WuTCHAO

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,840
where is Inอง incident?

31
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,840
Way weaker thing again.

32
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,600
iedz'as

33
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,760
Go.

34
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,300
360 говор 바로

35
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,380
I'm sorry pants.

36
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,420
I shouldn't have suspected you.

37
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,300
You must wake up.

38
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,220
Come out, Aofeng.

39
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,380
I know you're here.

40
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,740
How does it feel to lose the one you love?

41
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,740
You owe me two lives.

42
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,220
Be good.

43
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,740
Or you'll lose more.

44
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,620
I'll get them back for you.

45
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,940
You're overestimating yourself.

46
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,540
There's only one Long Zhiqi left.

47
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,140
How can you be so confident

48
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,140
to defeat Ou Jue and Chong Mi at the same time?

49
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,740
You're a bad person.

50
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,140
How dare you offend me?

51
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,340
Offend you?

52
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,540
It's just a little bit of a pain you gave me.

53
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,340
You'd better think it through.

54
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,540
If anything goes against my will,

55
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,740
your brother and Chong Ming

56
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,740
will be summoned immediately.

57
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,740
Can we talk now?

58
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,940
What do you want to do?

59
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,540
I want to make a deal with you.

60
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,140
With Long Zhu?

61
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,140
Yes.

62
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,740
What?

63
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,940
Ming Kai's life.

64
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,140
Is his life more important than yours?

65
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,340
I owe him too much.

66
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,340
But if Ou Jue and Zhang Mingkai die at the same time,

67
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,740
and I can only save one,

68
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,540
who do you want me to save?

69
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,940
You seem to care about

70
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,940
the relationship between us.

71
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,140
If he dies,

72
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,140
you'll remember him forever.

73
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,940
Isn't that great?

74
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,540
I won't forget him even if he's alive.

75
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,940
Do you know what Long Zhu means to you?

76
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,740
Of course I know.

77
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,540
Aren't you afraid that I'll regret it after I get Long Zhu?

78
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,940
So I want to make a deal with you.

79
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,140
As long as you promise me three things,

80
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,740
Long Zhu will be yours.

81
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,140
Which three?

82
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,340
First,

83
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,140
save Ming Kai.

84
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:25,940
Second,

85
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,940
don't hurt the one I love.

86
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,540
Third,

87
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,140
after you get Long Zhu,

88
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,940
leave Mo City forever.

89
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,940
Sacrifice yourself to protect the one you love?

90
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,140
Are you so naive?

91
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,940
I'm not naive.

92
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,940
You should be mistaken.

93
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,540
Once the contract is completely broken,

94
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,340
you really won't have a chance.

95
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,340
I'm really looking forward to it.

96
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,540
I know you've worked so hard to save another man.

97
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,940
His pain and despair.

98
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,540
They're coming back.

99
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,540
Mr. Ge Wu.

100
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,140
The lady's bed is clean.

101
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,340
She should have left last night.

102
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,140
Mo Sheng Hai's body is gone, too.

103
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,340
Stinky girl.

104
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,740
She always thinks she's a living Buddha.

105
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,140
She must stop her

106
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,740
from making the ugly cakes.

107
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,540
Are you sure it wasn't stolen by Aofeng?

108
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,540
If the lady was stolen,

109
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,140
there wouldn't be any trace of her.

110
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,940
And Long Zhu's spirit hasn't been cleared.

111
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,340
It's impossible.

112
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,940
The lady wrote in the letter

113
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,540
that she's going to kill me.

114
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,340
I'm afraid I can't save her.

115
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,140
I'm afraid I can't save her.

116
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,940
I'm afraid I can't save her.

117
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,140
The lady wrote in the letter

118
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,540
that she's going to find the truth about Long Zhi Qi.

119
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,540
What does it mean?

120
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,940
She did say

121
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,340
that she saw me,

122
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,540
Chong Ming and the Black Robe Man

123
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,540
doing something behind her back.

124
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,740
Zhang Ming Kai shouldn't have appeared in the contract.

125
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,940
In theory,

126
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,940
the one who broke the contract will be recorded.

127
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,740
You already know that

128
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,540
Zhang Ming Kai is the Black Robe Man.

129
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,540
I,

130
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,540
Ao Jue and Aofeng

131
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,340
are all people who have contracts with Long Zhu.

132
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,540
Besides,

133
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,140
Long Zhi Qi will record all our three behaviors.

134
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,540
We don't know how to break the contract.

135
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,740
If the lady made us do it on purpose,

136
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,740
she must have known

137
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,940
the secret.

138
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,940
She's not that simple.

139
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,140
This stupid girl is going to do something stupid.

140
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,140
To break the contract,

141
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,740
we must use Long Zhi Qi to start the big battle.

142
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,540
I saved Zhang Ming Kai yesterday.

143
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,940
I gave him my blood.

144
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,140
The lady is in danger.

145
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,740
Let's split up.

146
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,740
Let's go.

147
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,140
Look at this.

148
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,940
I'm afraid we can't enter this door.

149
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,740
What are you doing?

150
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,540
I don't have the power now.

151
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,740
I can't be suspicious.

152
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,340
I know.

153
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,940
This time, it's up to me.

154
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,940
This way.

155
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,140
The secret passage?

156
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,140
Yes.

157
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,140
When I was a killer,

158
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,140
it was inconvenient to enter from the door.

159
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,740
I had to enter from here.

160
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,740
Hurry.

161
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,940
You came to me

162
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,940
not just for Zhang Ming Kai.

163
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,940
Who are you?

164
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,340
Why are you asking?

165
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,140
I entered Long Zhi Qi's fantasy

166
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,740
and saw some things

167
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,540
I've never seen before.

168
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,540
Oh.

169
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,940
What did you see?

170
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,540
How did you control Zhang Ming Kai to spy on me?

171
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,540
You found out?

172
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,940
This time, you designed his death?

173
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:25,940
No.

174
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,740
This is his own will.

175
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,940
Mo Shen Hai betrayed me.

176
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,540
It seems that Zhang Ming Kai really cares about you.

177
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,540
You poisoned me

178
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,740
and so many people.

179
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,940
You hate him so much

180
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,540
just to get rid of Ao Jue?

181
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,940
Why should I hate him?

182
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,940
My brother has nothing to say to me.

183
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,140
I hate him because of his dragon clan.

184
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,740
I want to get rid of the dragon clan.

185
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,140
But as long as my brother is here,

186
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,740
the dragon clan will not die.

187
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,740
Just like you and Wan Long.

188
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,740
As long as Mo Shen Hai is still here,

189
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,140
Wan Long will not die.

190
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,340
You must understand what I mean.

191
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,940
I'm different from you.

192
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,140
The one who killed my parents is Mo Shen Hai.

193
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,940
Wan Long is the foundation of Mo Shen Hai.

194
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,340
I want to destroy Wan Long,

195
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,140
but I won't hurt innocent people.

196
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,940
Your father killed Mo Shen Hai's father.

197
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,340
Mo Shen Hai killed your father to avenge me.

198
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,940
Now you killed Mo Shen Hai.

199
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,740
Mo Shen Hai also has a child.

200
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,540
In the future, Mo Shen Hai's child will kill you.

201
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,340
Will you fight against Kaifu?

202
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,740
I killed the dragon clan, only leaving Ao Jue.

203
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,740
It will only make me and him

204
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,340
enemies.

205
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,140
I'd rather kill him

206
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,540
than let him and I

207
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,340
live in hatred.

208
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,540
You are really a bastard.

209
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,740
You have to make up a reason for yourself to do bad things.

210
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,540
Otherwise, my hatred and time for a hundred years,

211
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,340
what do you want me to do?

212
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,740
How did you spend these twenty years?

213
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,340
Ten times more than you.

214
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,740
The secret passage is so developed.

215
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,340
Mo Shen Hai has been running this place for so many years.

216
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,540
Even I don't know much about it.

217
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,540
I dare not look at it during the day.

218
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,540
What?

219
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,940
Black light blind fire?

220
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,340
You have the guts?

221
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,940
The dragon turned into a night owl?

222
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,540
That night,

223
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,740
do you want to have a good chat?

224
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,340
I said, you don't have to help me.

225
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,740
You are so free-spirited.

226
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,140
This is different from your sister.

227
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,540
In her heart,

228
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,340
she only thinks about one man.

229
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,740
What's wrong?

230
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,140
Can you not compare me to my sister?

231
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,140
You are jealous of your sister.

232
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,140
If you like my sister, you can go after her.

233
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,940
Why are you here talking to me?

234
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,140
I can't even catch up with you,

235
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,940
and you are still chasing after your sister?

236
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,540
You have lived for hundreds of years.

237
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,140
What kind of woman didn't see you?

238
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,540
I found out

239
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,140
that you shouldn't be a killer,

240
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,340
but a writer.

241
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,740
You humans are short-lived.

242
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,740
In your heart, you only think about life and the world.

243
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,340
Unlike us, non-humans and gold-bombs,

244
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,740
long-lived,

245
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,940
we are not what you think we are.

246
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,540
Am I okay?

247
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,140
You are okay.

248
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,940
So I caught up with you.

249
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,340
There is another question.

250
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,540
What is it?

251
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,140
I am a human.

252
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,940
I don't have such a long life.

253
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,740
I will get old and die.

254
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,140
Then after you are born,

255
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,540
I will find you again.

256
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,540
I will make you fall in love with me again.

257
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,140
Stop being so beautiful.

258
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,740
It's not a certain life.

259
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,340
It's the next life.

260
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,540
Do you love Zhao Ming Kai?

261
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,740
The kind of man and woman?

262
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,140
I love him,

263
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,140
but not the kind of man and woman.

264
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,140
Ming Kai is a man of great difficulty.

265
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,940
I promised him

266
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,940
that as long as I am alive,

267
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,140
he will have a family.

268
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,140
Here.

269
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,740
Someone really lives here.

270
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,940
From what I know about Mosheng Sea,

271
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,940
this is not his place.

272
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,140
Madam.

273
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,740
Look.

274
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,740
This is a trick

275
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,940
that I have been waiting for.

276
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,740
Ao Feng.

277
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,340
Zhang Ming Kai.

278
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,540
When I was still in Qi Yue,

279
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,340
he came to find Shan Yun Shu.

280
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,740
Ao Feng.

281
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,940
What are you doing?

282
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,140
Save Ming Kai.

283
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,340
Sister.

284
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,740
Ao Feng is Zhang Ming Kai.

285
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,340
Zhang Ming Kai is Ao Feng.

286
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,340
As long as you like him,

287
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,940
I can be Zhang Ming Kai for the rest of my life.

288
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,540
So,

289
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,340
you didn't control Zhang Ming Kai,

290
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,940
but you have been lying to me.

291
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,340
It doesn't matter.

292
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,540
What matters is that I like you.

293
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,940
I love you.

294
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,140
You lied to me.

295
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,940
You said you would forgive me.

296
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,540
I didn't lie to you.

297
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,340
This time,

298
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,340
it's for Brother Zhen Xuan's sake.

299
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,140
If you don't die,

300
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,340
we will be even.

301
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,740
Sister.

302
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,540
You did hurt me.

303
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,340
Can you give me another chance?

304
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,140
Stinky bitch.

305
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,340
I want to love you for a thousand years

306
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,340
and travel through the ages

307
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,140
I want to run to meet you

308
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:14,140
I don't want to end up together

309
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,340
Because we are meant to be together

310
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,740
I want to be silent

311
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,940
for a thousand years

312
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,540
I will not end up together

313
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,740
with the love that I have

314
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:33,740
for you

315
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,140
I want to love you for a thousand years

316
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,540
and travel through the ages

317
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,740
I want to run to meet you

318
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,140
I don't want to end up together

319
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,140
Because we are meant to be together

320
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,140
I want to be silent

321
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,140
for a thousand years

322
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,140
I will not end up together

323
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:16,140
with the love that I have

324
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:21,140
for you

325
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,740
The Love by Hypnotic
