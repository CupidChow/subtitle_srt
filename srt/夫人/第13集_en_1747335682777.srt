Episode 17

3
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,540
Don't do it.

4
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,280
Seize the Red judo.

5
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,340
Kill me instantly.

6
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,580
Kill me instantly.

7
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,880
All these were arranged by you, right?

8
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,160
Wang Liying,

9
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,540
they were all arranged by you, right?

10
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,340
I have told you much earlier if you really hurt your uncle

11
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,500
I have told you much earlier if you really hurt your uncle

12
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,000
I would kill you.

13
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,420
I nap arrived here to save you.

14
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,400
I also slept with Yi in here.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,520
I might find the sister and her husband.

16
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,280
What's wrong with Shan Yun Shu?

17
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,520
He won't die.

18
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,000
I've been serving him for a whole night.

19
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,640
I didn't see him.

20
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,240
You planned all this.

21
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,120
Why did you go back on your word?

22
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,160
Why would Brother Chong Ming go back on his word?

23
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,680
Shan Yun Shu can't die.

24
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,840
I can't die either.

25
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,160
Do you have any conspiracy?

26
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,080
Conspiracy?

27
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,000
Let me think about it.

28
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,760
I made a deal with Mo Sheng Hai.

29
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,440
He wanted the dragon pearl.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,960
I wanted my freedom.

31
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,160
And the life of Shan Yun Shu.

32
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,280
But he lied to me.

33
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,880
The dragon pearl

34
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,680
almost got me killed.

35
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,040
You offended your sister and Mo Sheng Hai at the same time.

36
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,760
Or do you want to know what you should do?

37
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,920
I'll have Brother Chong Ming protect me.

38
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,120
Why?

39
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,200
Because you're a good person.

40
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,040
A good person

41
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,840
is more important to my sister than her life.

42
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,560
You dare to threaten me?

43
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,760
No.

44
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,720
It's He Zong.

45
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,560
My good brother.

46
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,980
Song Han Shou

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,760
You bastard, you takes me for a cheap pay.

48
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,200
You think that's a cheap pay?

49
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,360
I'm treating you forsythiac.

50
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,000
You sold a big ring yesterday.

51
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,480
If not me,

52
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,720
years ago, you'd be a king's son.

53
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,680
You're not

54
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,280
How did you treat him?

55
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,560
How else can I?

56
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,680
With my mouth.

57
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,240
Then this blood test...

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,800
Could it be...

59
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,920
What are you thinking?

60
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,120
It's not what you think.

61
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,720
Then why did you take off your clothes?

62
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,600
To save you.

63
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,560
How did you save me?

64
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,400
Guess.

65
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,240
I'm fine now.

66
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,440
You can go back.

67
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,160
You're the only one who's alive.

68
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,440
You don't even thank me.

69
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,360
If I had gone earlier, I would have been in trouble.

70
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:43,920

72
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,860
Made me musst be hospitalized

73
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,640
for the whole night.

74
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm going to take a break,

75
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,600
I need skincare.

76
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,480
You two...

77
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,880
Go ask Shan Yu about it.

78
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,000
By the way,

79
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,720
where did you go yesterday?

80
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,720
I...

81
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,960
went to chase the black cannon man.

82
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,600
The most important thing.

83
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:21,600
The Black Cannon Man

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,240
I made a mistake this time.

85
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,840
I didn't expect Mo Yuhan

86
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,320
to betray me.

87
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,120
I was naive.

88
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,040
I didn't expect the black cannon man to turn against me.

89
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,320
I was willing to take the chance to turn into a dragon.

90
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,040
You're going to save Shan Yu.

91
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,360
Yes.

92
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,040
As long as you're fine,

93
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,520
we still have a chance to take the dragon.

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,200
I still want to thank you for

95
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,520
fighting back the dragon

96
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,840
and trying so hard to find such a bloodbath.

97
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,200
You're too kind.

98
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,600
We're friends.

99
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,000
But you should have told me

100
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,360
about the dragon.

101
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,600
Maybe we would have got it long ago.

102
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,600
I'm not a man who is ungrateful.

103
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,160
I won't forget your kindness.

104
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,080
But the dragon is only a beast.

105
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,400
It has no tail.

106
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
It's a beast.

107
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,680
I'll listen to you from now on.

108
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,120
Yes, Master.

109
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,240
The food today is delicious.

110
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,160
Who made it?

111
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,360
Thank you for your compliment.

112
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,520
Eat more if it's delicious.

113
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,520
It's such a good show.

114
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,320
Did you poison it?

115
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,320
The dragon prince is afraid of poisoning.

116
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,040
It's so painful.

117
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
Poison is nothing.

118
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,080
When will you leave?

119
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Sister, what's your attitude?

120
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,240
Ao Jue is right.

121
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,120
I was too kind to you before.

122
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,600
That's why you're so mean.

123
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,920
I plan to live here.

124
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,760
I offended Mo Shenghai for you.

125
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,920
Now he's after me everywhere.

126
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,000
You're asking for it.

127
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,720
There's no one to help you.

128
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,680
You can just clean up a room and live here.

129
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,640
It's okay.

130
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,360
Brother Chongming will help me.

131
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,720
Don't play tricks.

132
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,520
If I hadn't saved you in Mo Shenghai's hands,

133
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,560
you wouldn't be here eating.

134
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,920
Chongming, let him live here.

135
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,400
Keep an eye on him.

136
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,040
Yes.

137
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,280
Sister.

138
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,080
Mingkai, why are you here?

139
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,080
Sister, are you okay?

140
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,240
You scared me.

141
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,640
I was in a hurry yesterday.

142
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,080
But it's okay now.

143
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,000
Don't worry.

144
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,640
I have to live here today

145
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,640
to protect you.

146
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,080
What else do you want?

147
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,600
You knocked me out yesterday.

148
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,360
You even tried to kill me with Mo Shenghai.

149
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,680
You're so heartless.

150
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:57,840
Stop it.

151
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,400
I'll break your arm.

152
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,280
I admit I was wrong yesterday.

153
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,600
But I saved you.

154
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,680
You're like a dog.

155
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,560
You're so stubborn.

156
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,760
You said you'd protect me.

157
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,160
But I couldn't even take a single hit.

158
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,080
You're so shameless.

159
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,960
You...

160
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
Eat your food.

161
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,360
Mingkai, you should eat too.

162
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,240
I'm not fighting with you.

163
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,440
I'm just hungry.

164
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,400
Sister.

165
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,000
I was so scared when I heard you were seriously injured.

166
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,720
I was as hurt as I was hurt.

167
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,800
I ran here because I couldn't help it.

168
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,640
Sister.

169
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,000
Tell me about yesterday.

170
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,600
I was seriously injured yesterday.

171
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,600
What?

172
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,640
You...

173
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,200
You didn't get hurt.

174
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,400
How did you heal?

175
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,640
I used dragon blood to cure your sister's wound.

176
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,080
Dragon blood?

177
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,040
You spat on my sister's saliva?

178
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,720
Of course not.

179
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,080
I'm a very good actor.

180
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,080
I used my lips

181
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,400
to wipe your sister's skin.

182
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,800
I'm so tired.

183
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,440
I'm a living Buddha.

184
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,520
Amitabha.

185
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,280
Amitabha.

186
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,320
Right?

187
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,920
Isn't it real?

188
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,640
Long'er.

189
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,440
Stop right there.

190
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,160
I'll rip your mouth off.

191
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,080
Long'er.

192
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,680
You're so mean.

193
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,720
Help me clean up the room.

194
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,600
Here.

195
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,440
This is Mo Yuhan's

196
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,800
list of assassins and murderers

197
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,240
as a killer.

198
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,480
Hand it over to the police.

199
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,480
Yes.

200
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,560
This is the evidence

201
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,120
of the smuggling of

202
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,800
the smoke and soil of the Wu Family

203
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,160
twenty years ago.

204
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,520
Hand it over to the procuratorate.

205
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,200
Well...

206
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,080
President.

207
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,560
The smuggling of the smoke and soil

208
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,360
was also involved in the Wanlong Chamber of Commerce.

209
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,920
If we find out the truth,

210
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,400
we'll lose all our money.

211
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,080
There's something more important

212
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,800
than the Eastern Courtyard.

213
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,760
Even if it's the police,

214
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,360
it's not enough.

215
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,120
Go.

216
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:41,920
Yes.

217
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,160
What are you doing?

218
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,720
Captain.

219
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
Where's Mo Yuhan?

220
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,640
Captain.

221
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,880
Don't you know?

222
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,440
We just received the report.

223
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,320
It says that there's evidence of the smuggling of the smoke and soil

224
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,880
twenty years ago.

225
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,600
And the sister of the director

226
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,560
seems to have killed

227
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,280
the former director's wife, Zeng Yiniang.

228
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,960
The director decided to take her there.

229
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,920
Thank you.

230
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,960
Brother Chongming, wait for me.

231
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,000
Why?

232
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,720
I just helped you clear the suspicion.

233
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,880
You didn't just dare to ask me,

234
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,080
but also targeted me.

235
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,880
I didn't ask you.

236
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,120
Chongming,

237
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,680
my sister asked you to take care of me.

238
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,040
Is this how you take care of her?

239
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,600
The latest instruction I got

240
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,720
was to keep an eye on you.

241
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,840
It's not taking care of you.

242
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,800
Okay. Okay. Okay.

243
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,120
I'll tell Ao Jun when I get back

244
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,280
that you and the black robbers

245
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,200
are planning to kill her.

246
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,800
Are you afraid?

247
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,200
Afraid?

248
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,520
I never write the word, afraid.

249
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,440
But if you say you're afraid,

250
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,080
and you say you're a secret agent,

251
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,600
I'll dry your blood

252
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,160
before you go home.

253
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,960
I'll make you shut up forever.

254
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,600
Brother Chongming,

255
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,920
can you change the way you threaten me?

256
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,920
You don't want to kill me,

257
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,920
but you want to dry my blood.

258
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,520
You think I'm a kid?

259
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,680
What?

260
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,000
You think I don't dare?

261
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,400
No, you dare.

262
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,560
You're too bold.

263
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,920
But you can't do it.

264
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,040
What?

265
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,120
Sha Yun said that

266
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,000
he's not interested in my relationship anymore.

267
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,360
But I'm his sister.

268
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,160
If you kill me,

269
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,720
he'll hate you.

270
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,000
You care about him so much.

271
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,480
You don't dare.

272
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,600
You're kidding.

273
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,360
I just want the Dragon Bead.

274
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,680
If I'm not wrong,

275
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,760
do you and Ao Jun

276
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,840
have any secret contract with him?

277
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,080
You can't kill him,

278
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,000
and you have to obey him.

279
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,680
The Dragon Bead is in my sister's body now.

280
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,920
Even if you can separate the Dragon Bead in the future,

281
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,520
you have to face the Black Robe Man

282
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,040
and Ao Jun as two opponents.

283
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,400
You have 100% of the power.

284
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,160
I advise you not to meddle in the business.

285
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,560
But if you want to fight the Dragon Bead,

286
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,040
I'll make sure you're dead.

287
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,800
Why are you so stingy?

288
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,200
You're so gentle and elegant in my sister's body.

289
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,360
You're so obedient.

290
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,800
But I'm so obedient.

291
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,160
Obedient?

292
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,400
You're a killer.

293
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm afraid there are more people

294
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,320
you killed than us.

295
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,640
Don't waste time.

296
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,760
Let's go.

297
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,160
What are you doing?

298
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,520
Someone reported this woman

299
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,080
to kill the former president of Dongcheng Company.

300
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,680
She's under arrest now.

301
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,440
Everyone, leave here now.

302
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,920
Yushu, come on.

303
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,520
Madam.

304
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,520
Madam.

305
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,800
Madam, bad news.

306
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,880
The chief of the police station

307
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,720
took all our goods from the dock

308
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,320
and used the Dongcheng branch as bait

309
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,240
to steal our shares.

310
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,720
Madam.

311
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,720
Madam.

312
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,640
This is today's newspaper.

313
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,640
Take a look.

314
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,880
The newspaper said

315
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,560
your sister killed many businessmen

316
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,120
and said she was a spy killer.

317
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,760
She's been arrested by the police.

318
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,320
She's been arrested by the police.

319
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,760
She's been arrested by the police.

320
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,120
She's been arrested by the police.

321
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,520
She's been arrested by the police.

322
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,560
She's been arrested by the police.

323
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,360
Let's go.

324
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,240
Chief Wu, what are you doing?

325
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,560
President Shen, I'm sorry.

326
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,520
I'm just doing my job.

327
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,200
I have evidence to prove

328
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,400
Dongcheng Trade is illegal to smuggle opium.

329
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,040
I'm ordered by the superior

330
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,400
to confiscate all your assets.

331
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,240
If you're not satisfied,

332
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,160
you can report to the superior.

333
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,840
Do you have a control order?

334
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,640
Did Moshenghai report it?

335
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,160
Yes.

336
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,440
It's a crime.

337
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,400
If Wanlong Chamber of Commerce reported it,

338
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,360
they couldn't get away with it.

339
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,200
Wanlong was

340
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,840
President Hu's partner.

341
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,640
You don't have to worry about that.

342
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,000
We'll find out the truth ourselves.

343
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,840
It seems that Moshenghai is really a poor man.

344
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,480
He actually came up with a way

345
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,480
to get me arrested.

346
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,960
But Chief Wu,

347
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,160
once Wanlong and Dongcheng Trade are down,

348
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,080
you'll be in danger.

349
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,480
What do you mean?

350
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,560
As far as I know,

351
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,520
back then, President Hu and President Wan

352
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,920
were both very filial.

353
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,840
Once we find out the truth,

354
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,280
will you be so surprised?

355
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,760
Moshenghai used this trick

356
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,800
to take everyone down.

357
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,640
Why are you so confused?

358
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,640
Moshenghai couldn't defeat me.

359
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,080
It's already the last battle

360
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,680
for the poor.

361
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,280
You've seen

362
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,760
both of my bodyguards.

363
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,560
He can't hurt me at all.

364
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,640
Once the two biggest companies in Mocheng are down,

365
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,440
even if you

366
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,880
find out the truth,

367
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,040
when the time comes,

368
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,760
if you want to get in trouble,

369
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,560
it's not just us.

370
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,480
Yes.

371
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,040
What do you think?

372
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,280
It's better to come early than to come late.

373
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,480
You can find out the truth slowly.

374
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,560
I won't forget you.

375
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,960
The Wu family has some property

376
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,720
in your hometown.

377
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,560
Just take it as a gift

378
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,360
I gave you

379
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,240
to raise two children.

380
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,360
The money will go

381
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,520
into the name of Auntie.

382
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,720
This case

383
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,760
was Supreme Court's.

384
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,320
I can't wait until then.

385
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,200
I needn't bother you, near-条ector.

386
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,200
I'll do it.

387
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,800
Please let meqi me into your family a second time.

388
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,880
After a thousand years, I will love you through the ages

389
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,560
I'm running to hug you

390
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,440
I don't want to end up together

391
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,960
Because after a thousand years

392
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,360
I can't say it

393
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,080
With the love of my life

394
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:23,520
I will not end up together

395
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,680
Because after a thousand years

396
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,040
I will love you through the ages

397
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,720
I'm running to hug you

398
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,680
I don't want to end up together

399
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:56,200
Because after a thousand years

400
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,240
I can't say it

401
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,920
With the love of my life

402
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:15,920
I will not end up together
