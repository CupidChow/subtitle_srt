My Dear Brothers EP10

2
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,400
You said dragon bead can make people live forever.

3
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:43,840
Yes.

4
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,240
So,

5
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,960
you killed Shan Yun Shu in Dragon King Temple.

6
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,120
He was revived by dragon bead?

7
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,160
Yes.

8
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,080
I couldn't figure it out at that time.

9
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,760
Now I understand.

10
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,920
Dragon bead is more important than life in the east, right?

11
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,880
Yuhan, you did a good job this time.

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,680
But dragon bead is in my sister's body now.

13
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,720
It's not easy to get it.

14
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,320
And she has two bodyguards.

15
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,800
Leave it alone.

16
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,880
I have my own way.

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,360
Go to the police station

18
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,760
and get Shan Yun Shu here.

19
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,440
President,

20
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,760
this is the last thing I can do for you.

21
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,800
From now on,

22
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,200
I don't owe you anything.

23
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,680
You don't want to be your sister's enemy.

24
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,760
I can understand.

25
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,560
As long as you are free

26
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,120
with this handkerchief.

27
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,160
You are here just in time.

28
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,760
Do me a favor.

29
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,040
What favor?

30
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,480
I want dragon bead.

31
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,760
I want to live forever.

32
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,600
Where is it?

33
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,400
It's over there.

34
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,720
Are you sure

35
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,200
that Shan Yun Shu was caught by Mo Sheng Hai?

36
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,840
Yes.

37
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,760
That girl told me so.

38
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,160
Go to the spirit formation?

39
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,520
Listen.

40
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,160
Give me the dragon bead.

41
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,320
I can ensure you and this woman won't die.

42
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,280
I can ensure you and this woman won't die.

43
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,160
She is not Shan Yun Shu.

44
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,680
You can't fool me.

45
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,640
Just because you want the dragon bead,

46
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,360
I will kill you.

47
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,480
Kid,

48
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,280
you used magic to sneak attack me yesterday.

49
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,560
Today,

50
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,240
I will pay you back with my life.

51
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,880
If you are wise enough to give me the dragon bead,

52
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,680
I can ensure you won't die.

53
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,760
It seems that

54
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,080
you have spent a lot of time on me.

55
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,840
But the black robe man didn't tell you

56
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,920
that even if I can't use magic power in the magic formation,

57
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,120
you will die.

58
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,520
You will die until your death.

59
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,360
Let's see how I will play with you today.

60
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,600
Go.

61
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,320
Is it all fake?

62
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,640
From the beginning to now.

63
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,560
Not all.

64
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,960
Where is Chong Ming?

65
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,840
He is probably still drunk in the tavern.

66
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,920
So,

67
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,320
you killed me for Mo Shen Hai.

68
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,680
I am here to help you.

69
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,000
If you give me the dragon bead,

70
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,440
Mo Shen Hai will never be far from you.

71
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,120
This is the last thing I can do for him.

72
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,880
What about your parents?

73
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,440
You won't take revenge on me?

74
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,280
I will find them in the future.

75
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,640
Are you possessed or are you out of your mind?

76
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,520
You killed me twice before.

77
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,040
I can forgive you.

78
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,400
You lied to me twice.

79
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,320
I can forgive you.

80
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,320
Mo Shen Hai is in love with you.

81
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,160
I can understand that you can't bear to kill him.

82
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,280
But if you don't even care about your parents' innocence and life,

83
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,240
you really don't deserve to be the daughter of the Mo family.

84
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,960
Do they take me as their daughter?

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,800
What?

86
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,000
I was young that year,

87
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,000
but I clearly remember.

88
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,160
How dare you run away?

89
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,680
You can only choose one of the two daughters.

90
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,920
Who will die?

91
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,960
You have killed my whole family.

92
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,840
As long as you let my daughter go,

93
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,600
I will agree to anything.

94
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,000
You don't want to, do you?

95
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,000
I'll help you.

96
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,520
Don't shoot.

97
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,960
It's always you.

98
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,640
In their hearts, you are always more important than me.

99
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,160
It was so sudden.

100
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,480
Where did parents come up with so many ideas?

101
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,280
It's just Xia Yi who protected the most recent child.

102
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,400
You really don't know?

103
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,320
Really?

104
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,800
When the killer rushed in,

105
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,440
I was chosen.

106
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:55,840
Go.

107
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,320
Mom.

108
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,440
Zaoer.

109
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,840
Mom.

110
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,800
You remember?

111
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,320
I really can't remember

112
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,400
many things.

113
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,520
But I will never forget.

114
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
I was hiding in the corner with my mother.

115
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,000
She cried and told me

116
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,600
to go back and save you.

117
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,200
I can't forget that look for the rest of my life.

118
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,200
That was the best.

119
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,120
She hoped that the eldest daughter would live,

120
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,080
but she would never die

121
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,200
because of her daughter.

122
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,320
So she went back

123
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,600
to create that new life.

124
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,520
So

125
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,080
you were always the first.

126
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,880
At that time, my mother asked me to go out to move the troops.

127
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,320
You were too young.

128
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,360
So the troops

129
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,360
were too small.

130
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,120
I've said everything.

131
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,440
Believe it or not,

132
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,760
you're here to hold me back

133
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,200
just to deal with Ao Juan.

134
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,280
An outsider

135
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,520
is more important than your sister.

136
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,880
She saved your life.

137
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,640
And you,

138
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,560
you're always my sister.

139
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
I'm sorry.

140
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,400
I'm sorry.

141
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,080
I'm sorry.

142
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
I'm sorry.

143
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
I'm sorry.

144
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
I'm sorry.

145
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
I'm sorry.

146
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,800
I'm sorry.

147
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,800
I'm sorry.

148
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
I'm sorry.

149
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
I'm sorry.

150
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
I'm sorry.

151
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
I'm sorry.

152
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
I'm sorry.

153
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
I'm sorry.

154
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,880
I'm sorry.

155
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,240
guys are so many.

156
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,320
Interesting.

157
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,000
Brother, you're honest this time.

158
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,040
Shanyu Tree.

159
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,840
What's wrong with him?

160
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,520
I can feel it.

161
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,440
I'm afraid it's too late.

162
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,640
My men have gone to kill him.

163
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,040
Even if you're the only one,

164
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,480
you can't fight him.

165
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,960
What about the Black Robe Man?

166
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,840
The Black Robe Man said that your chest is weak.

167
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,680
It's the weakest place.

168
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,480
You're right.

169
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,760
horse godÎ¯

170
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,120
Seven Eaststand Dragon Lost.

171
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,800
Xiao Zang,

172
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,160
let others play pushing me too.

173
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,920
Yiru,

174
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,600
Yiru,

175
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,480
you must hold on.

176
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,280
Put him down.

177
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,520
Duoxi.

178
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,200
Madam.

179
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,240
Chengming,

180
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,200
you're here at the right time.

181
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,360
Let's go find Ao Juan.

182
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,400
There are two formations,

183
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,360
the Giant Spirit Formation and the Dragon Formation,

184
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,200
on the dock.

185
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,400
You and I will die if we go there.

186
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,680
Don't go.

187
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,600
What about Ao Juan?

188
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,520
There are many people there.

189
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,720
If we go there, we'll die.

190
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,880
I can't watch Ao Juan die in front of me.

191
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,720
You like him?

192
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,600
It has nothing to do with love.

193
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,200
I'll do this to anyone of you.

194
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,440
You respect me.

195
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,640
I respect you.

196
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,480
Besides,

197
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,320
Ao Juan saved me more than once.

198
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,760
Chengming,

199
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,080
let go.

200
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,920
You'll really die.

201
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,840
I didn't scare you.

202
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,120
Do you remember what I said to you

203
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,240
about living?

204
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,920
If I let you or Ao Juan

205
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,640
die in front of me,

206
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,760
I can't do anything wrong.

207
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,240
I'd rather die first.

208
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,080
It's too late.

209
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,200
The Dragon Gate is open.

210
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,000
Ao Juan is dead.

211
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,080
It's done.

212
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,200
It's finally done.

213
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,400
Chengming,

214
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,120
go to the Dragon Gate.

215
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,280
I'll go to the Dragon Pillar.

216
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,960
We'll meet each other.

217
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
When the time comes,

218
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,520
we'll cooperate happily.

219
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,520
If I were the one lying there now,

220
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,040
it would be great.

221
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,480
Chengming,

222
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,800
I regret it.

223
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,040
It's not a good time.

224
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,000
Ao Juan!

225
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,640
Chenghuang,

226
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,280
you can't die yet.

227
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,200
I've been ruined by your success.

228
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,840
If you don't exist,

229
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,640
I'll be alone in this world.

230
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,120
What's the point?

231
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,400
Zhan Yingshuang,

232
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,600
hand over the Dragon Pillar.

233
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,160
I'll make sure you don't die.

234
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,760
Chenghuang,

235
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,000
although you're fighting with me,

236
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,440
fighting with me,

237
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,520
and fighting with me,

238
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,120
you're really protecting me

239
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,440
and caring about me.

240
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,880
I want to say thank you to you.

241
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,320
Thank you

242
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,640
for giving me the feeling of being accompanied by my family.

243
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,280
What's your name?

244
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,120
You can call me Crown Prince Long.

245
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,480
I'm your personal bodyguard now.

246
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,680
I saved you again.

247
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,600
How are you going to repay me?

248
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,480
You're so generous.

249
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,600
You're drunk.

250
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,400
Don't leave.

251
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,800
Why are you wearing this?

252
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,960
Zhan Yingshuang,

253
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,400
I don't want to have anything to do with you.

254
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,160
If anything happens,

255
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,200
you must discuss it with me.

256
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,280
Chenghuang,

257
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,320
Dragon Pillar.

258
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,840
It's mine.

259
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,760
I don't care about your debt.

260
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,600
You bitch.

261
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,800
I gave you the Dragon Pillar.

262
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,200
Let me crunch it.

263
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:18,920
I want you to live.

264
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,920
Then I bought it tear-p transforming.

265
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,640
I can't forget my lyrics.

266
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:48,640
The warm wind blows through the mountains and the streets at night

267
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:57,640
The heart is beating fast, I can't let go, I can't let go

268
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,640
I think I'm used to being alone

269
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:07,640
You're not going to believe me anymore?

270
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,640
I'm sorry

271
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,640
I'm sorry

272
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,640
I'm sorry

273
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:47,640
I think I'm used to waiting alone

274
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,640
Waiting alone

275
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,640
Waiting alone

276
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,640
Waiting alone

277
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,640
Until the wind blows slowly

278
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,640
The clouds and fire are all over

279
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,640
The love and hate are suddenly not in the sky

280
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,640
The world is full of the hands of the past

281
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:19,640
The warm wind blows through the mountains and the streets at night

282
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:29,640
The heart is beating fast, I can't let go, I can't let go

283
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,640
Little girl

284
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,640
How dare you say I can't do it?

285
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,640
I can't do it

286
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,640
I can't do it

287
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,640
Hurry up

288
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,640
Yun Shu

289
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,640
Shen Yun Shu

290
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,640
Don't pretend to die

291
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,640
Can't he die?

292
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,640
The dragon is in his body, he won't die

293
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,640
But just now, in order to save me, I used too much energy

294
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,640
I have to think of a way to give sister blood

295
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,640
You go out

296
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,640
I want to use the dragon tribe's method to save him, you go out

297
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,640
Little girl, hold on

298
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,640
Little girl, your heart is not working

299
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,640
Why did you lie to me?

300
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,640
You

301
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,640
You are wasting my heart

302
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,640
Yun Shu, come

303
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,640
Yun Shu

304
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,640
Yun Shu

305
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,640
Yun Shu

306
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,640
Yun Shu

307
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,640
Yun Shu

308
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,640
Yun Shu

309
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,640
Yun Shu

310
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,640
Yun Shu

311
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,640
Yun Shu

312
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,640
Yun Shu

313
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,640
Yun Shu

314
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,640
Yun Shu

315
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,640
Yun Shu

316
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,640
Yun Shu

317
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,640
Yun Shu

318
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,640
Yun Shu

319
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,640
Yun Shu

320
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:18,640
Yun
