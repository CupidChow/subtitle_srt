My Dear Brothers EP10

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The End

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Long'er, you do the role.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Don't call me Long'er again.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I won't do the role.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Long'er.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Long'er.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'll make you dumplings if you laugh again.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Do you believe it?

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Sister.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then you make dumplings.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I do the role.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
No.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Then what do you do?

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
He only eats.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Shut up, you monster.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You...

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You drove away all the servants.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You don't know anything.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Then what are you doing here?

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I...

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'll make the noodles.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This should be fine.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Are you sure?

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Long'er, you are really...

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Drink some blood.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Let me recover my power.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Let's start the test right away.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You can't do anything.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You are the first one to be angry.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This scene reminds me of my childhood.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Making dumplings with my mother and sister.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's also such a scene.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Sister.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I believe you will be reunited with your sister.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I will help you.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Thank you, Xiao Kai.

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Do you need help?

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yuhan.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm so happy that you can come.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Eat more.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What's this?

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Sister.

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I want some too.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You can't forget your brother when you have a sister.

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Eat.

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You...

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's hot to eat dumplings with a fairy.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Is it funny or ugly?

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Eat your food.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You talk too much.

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Okay, stop it.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Second Miss.

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yuhan.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You can come back this time.

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Your sister is warm in her heart.

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Come back often.

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Actually, I came back this time

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
to see the gifts from my parents.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Is it okay?

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Of course.

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What are you doing?

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Do you remember this dress?

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Sister, love?

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This is the design my mother made for me.

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yesterday, it was so cold.

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Today, this is a picture.

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You said you liked the picture of the little tiger.

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I don't believe it.

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
He sewed these himself.

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The enemy doesn't move.

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I don't move.

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I remember.

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Let's wait and see.

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And this.

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
This is the bandage my father sewed

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
for you when you were born.

80
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You didn't let go of it.

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I don't remember.

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You were too young.

83
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's normal that you don't remember.

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Don't worry.

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I only remember that my mother fell down

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
because of the heat of the sadness.

87
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And the back of your departure.

88
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I will never forget

89
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
how my mother fell down.

90
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And the way she looked like.

91
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And your helpless crying.

92
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So I must revenge.

93
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I must find the murderer.

94
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Especially Mo Shanhai.

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I won't stop you from revenge.

96
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But I won't help you.

97
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Okay.

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I understand.

99
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Because you told me

100
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Mo Shanhai has raised you.

101
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I will help you pay back this favor.

102
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But I must revenge this.

103
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Sister.

104
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Can I live here today?

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Of course.

106
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You can do whatever you want.

107
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You just live in my room.

108
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You don't need to prepare anything.

109
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Chengming.

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You...

111
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Hurry up.

112
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Take my sister back to my room.

113
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yes, madam.

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Chengming.

115
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Chengming.

116
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Chengming.

117
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Chengming.

118
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Chengming.

119
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Chengming.

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Chengming.

121
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Chengming.

122
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Chengming.

123
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Chengming.

124
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Chengming.

125
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Chengming.

126
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Chengming.

127
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Chengming.

128
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Chengming.

129
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Chengming.

130
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Chengming.

131
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Chengming.

132
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Chengming.

133
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Chengming.

134
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Chengming.

135
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Chengming.

136
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Chengming.

137
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Chengming.

138
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Chengming.

139
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Chengming.

140
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Chengming.

141
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Chengming.

142
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Chengming.

143
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Chengming.

144
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Help me kill him.

145
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Calm down.

146
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Calm down?

147
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Chengming.

148
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
No one else but Mosheng Hai did this.

149
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
He hurt me.

150
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I can bear it.

151
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
He can hurt my sister.

152
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
He will die.

153
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'll kill him for you.

154
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
With your sister's skills,

155
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
if this person can hurt her

156
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
and is not discovered by us,

157
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
such a person is almost...

158
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Shut up.

159
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I don't want to listen.

160
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I want Mosheng Hai to die.

161
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I promise you.

162
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
This time,

163
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
you must kill him secretly.

164
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Wait a minute.

165
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Right now!

166
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
If you kill Mosheng Hai now,

167
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
you will be disrupted.

168
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
How will your parents find out the truth?

169
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What will your sister say?

170
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,760
Ah.

171
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,480
Ah.

172
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,320
Bai Ying!

173
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:20,920
Youâ€”

174
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,960
Wu Er.

175
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,120
I'm sorry.

176
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,640
I regret it.

177
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:31,880
You brat,

178
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:32,920
don't be scared.

179
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,240
Kill faintly,

180
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,280
and you'll be over.

181
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,960
you'll regret it.

182
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,400
If I kill you today,

183
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,720
it'll be too easy for you.

184
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'll take everything you took from our family

185
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,400
back.

186
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,160
I'll make you feel nothing

187
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,920
but the ten times more pain I felt.

188
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,280
I'll make you live in fear every day

189
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,120
and die.

190
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,480
Madam, the police are here.

191
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,320
I promised my sister

192
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,480
that even if I gave her your breast-feeding paper,

193
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,280
if she dares to hurt the one I love,

194
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,040
it'll be your death.

195
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,680
Okay.

196
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,040
Tell those secrets I need to meet them.

197
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,360
Aujuan,

198
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,640
sorry.

199
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,120
I was afraid that you'd be impulsive

200
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,720
and kill Full-Scale Air

201
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,160
so I used my tutto power to stop her from its miracle.

202
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,920
I'm impulsive?

203
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,600
You get me into complicated problems

204
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,360
and tell me to go kill her?

205
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,520
You're the one who stopped me.

206
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,600
When you were trying to use your power,

207
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,720
did you think of me?

208
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:19,920
I'm sorry.

209
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,920
I was hurt by my sister.

210
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,960
I was too impulsive.

211
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,240
I was too impulsive.

212
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,920
You only saw your sister's wound

213
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,400
and saw Zhang Ming Kai's wound.

214
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,160
Did you care about my wound?

215
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,440
You're hurt.

216
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,440
Xinli!

217
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,120
You can punish me

218
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,440
for everyone.

219
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,360
I'm sorry.

220
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,840
Can you...

221
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,600
Impossible.

222
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,440
Don't you think Chong Ming is right?

223
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,040
That's your sister's weakness.

224
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,120
That means she's loyal to Mo Shen Hai

225
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,080
and is far more loyal to you.

226
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,600
Why did you keep her?

227
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,760
You're dying in your mind,

228
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,640
and you don't care about her?

229
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,720
Impossible.

230
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,640
She must have her reasons.

231
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,080
Will you help me or not?

232
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,320
I won't help you.

233
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,720
It would be better if she died.

234
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,720
Do you want my sister to die?

235
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,880
I want you to live.

236
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,320
Your Ladyship.

237
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,360
Chong Ming.

238
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,000
Your Ladyship.

239
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,080
You've used too much of your power.

240
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,880
Chong Ming.

241
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,280
Go and check on Yu Han for me.

242
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,840
Take care of him for me.

243
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,360
Thank you.

244
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,560
You're awake.

245
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,760
How do you feel?

246
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,600
My wound still hurts a little.

247
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,080
But it's much better.

248
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,680
What happened yesterday?

249
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,640
I wanted to go downstairs yesterday.

250
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,520
But I saw a black eye.

251
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,720
I followed it into the secret room.

252
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,240
I wanted to scare you,

253
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,960
but it attacked me.

254
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,120
It's a very accurate knife.

255
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
It avoids all the places where you know your fate.

256
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,000
What do you mean?

257
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,680
Stop pretending.

258
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,200
There's no black eye.

259
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,240
You're a good person.

260
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,240
It's all your own doing.

261
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,400
You can fool your sister,

262
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,720
but you can't fool me.

263
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,960
What do you want?

264
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,480
I know your plan.

265
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,920
But if you dare to hurt your sister,

266
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,560
I'll kill Mo Shen Han

267
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,120
and everyone he knows.

268
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,160
I'll eat you alive.

269
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,280
I love snacks

270
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,400
that can satisfy your stomach.

271
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,000
Even if you're his sister.

272
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,000
Got it?

273
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,200
I love you for a thousand years.

274
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,840
I'm running to meet you.

275
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,000
I don't want to end our encounter.

276
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,200
Because we'll meet again.

277
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,480
After a thousand years,

278
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,680
I can't say no more.

279
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,480
I'll be with you forever.

280
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:06,720
I won't end our encounter.

281
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,160
Because we'll meet again.

282
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,160
After a thousand years,

283
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:20,160
I can't say no more.

284
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,160
I won't end our encounter.

285
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,160
Because we'll meet again.

286
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,160
After a thousand years,

287
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,160
I can't say no more.

288
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,160
Because we'll meet again.

289
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,160
After a thousand years,

290
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:44,160
I can't say no more.

291
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,160
I'll be with you forever.

292
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:59,160
I won't end our encounter.
