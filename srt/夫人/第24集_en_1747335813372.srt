1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,480
grams!

2
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,440
Yushu.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,920
I know what I should do,

4
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,500
and I don't want to go against you!

5
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,880
As a man,

6
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,800
nothing matters!

7
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,360
You've come back?

8
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,640
I've seen them,

9
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,600
and I just can feel that

10
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,440
I'm a man against her now!

11
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,080
Today,

12
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,760
I know

13
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,860
you're bad.

14
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,240
crystal beads.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,920
So

16
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,640
he didn't want to come out alive, right?

17
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,480
Yes

18
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,720
But I couldn't stop him

19
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,880
It's not your fault

20
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,760
Can you try it again?

21
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,640
Send me in

22
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,920
No

23
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,600
Shanyun Tree used its own blood

24
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,680
to open the formation

25
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,560
and sealed the Aofeng forever

26
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,960
without its blood

27
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,040
No

28
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,760
No

29
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,600
It has my blood in it

30
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,280
It has its blood in it

31
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,200
What?

32
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,960
Dragon Bead

33
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,120
Let me try this.

34
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,480
Eunuch Long can help you now.

35
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,320
Now they're even more arrogant than me.

36
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,160
If Madam dies,

37
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,720
Yuhan will be very sad.

38
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,920
She's Yuhan's only family.

39
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,720
Brother Chongming.

40
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,440
Yuhan.

41
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,840
Don't be sad.

42
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,520
You...

43
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,240
I will never,

44
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,120
never forget you.

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,920
I love you.

46
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,880
Yushu.

47
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,000
Yushu.

48
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,760
Come with me.

49
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,960
My parents died that year.

50
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,760
Zheng Xuan died for the third time.

51
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,120
It was painful 열� Je ne peux pas pourer,

52
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,840
and I couldn't live it for a long time.

53
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,280
Shi Egg Feng

54
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,240
broke into a park,

55
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,860
taught me martial arts,

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,760
and現在他很辛苦,

57
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,360
taught me medical skills.

58
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,000
I even beat him one day.

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You two are alike.

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,200
I'm luckier than her.

61
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,760
The Hu family treats me well.

62
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,200
You know how to deal with hatred

63
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,240
than Aofeng.

64
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,360
It's not that Aofeng can't let go of hatred.

65
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,240
It's that she can't forgive herself.

66
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,800
Who are you?

67
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,520
I'm a woman.

68
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,520
I'm a woman.

69
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,520
Who?

70
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,520
He's my sister's boyfriend.

71
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,000
Just call him brother.

72
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
He...

73
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,800
He'll stay forever

74
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,560
in the night before you appeared.

75
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,160
Sister, I'm hungry.

76
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,760
I'll get you something to eat, okay?

77
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,760
It's probably the medicine.

78
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,040
Are you okay?

79
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,320
Why are you so careless?

80
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,320
Does it still hurt?

81
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,640
No.

82
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,600
I'll take care of you.

83
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,040
You can't get hurt.

84
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,360
Can you do that?

85
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,640
I've lived for a thousand years.

86
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,520
I can do anything.

87
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,960
You've lived for a thousand years.

88
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,720
Why is cooking so bad?

89
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,200
Well...

90
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,040
I'm the Crown Prince.

91
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,960
I can do anything for others.

92
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,920
Well,

93
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,000
my dear Crown Prince,

94
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,920
would you like to...

95
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,920
I'd like to...

96
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,520
grill a chicken?

97
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,240
Sure.

98
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,080
Where's the chicken?

99
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,960
It's not cooked. Don't eat it.

100
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,360
It's not bad. It's not bad.

101
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,240
Maybe

102
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,200
this is the life that Aofeng really wants.

103
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,520
Yeah.

104
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,160
Why did you come back?

105
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,760
I don't want to leave.

106
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,320
When you committed suicide in my yard,

107
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,640
did you think of me?

108
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
That's different.

109
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,280
I'd rather die than let you get hurt.

110
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,000
But I'm like you.

111
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,480
Silly.

112
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,160
You're always so selfish.

113
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,680
You don't consider my feelings.

114
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,560
I'm sorry.

115
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,880
But now it's fine.

116
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,640
We may be trapped here forever.

117
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,800
I'm not afraid of you.

118
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,360
Link concentrating

119
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,920
He was right.

120
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,000
More good to be with you.

121
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,080
Sis.

122
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,880
What are you guys doing?

123
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
Sis.

124
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,240
You got目vision.

125
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,360
Let me blow for a while.

126
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,360
You're so naughty.

127
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,640
What nonsense are you talking about?

128
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,600
Nonsense?

129
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,960
She'll know sooner or later.

130
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,440
It's good to tell her sooner.

131
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,000
Why are you laughing?

132
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,960
Do you want to have a baby?

133
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,200
Yes.

134
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,760
My mother told me

135
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,840
that a man and a woman

136
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,080
are in love when they kiss.

137
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,880
They want to have a baby.

138
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,760
Although there's a subtle difference,

139
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,480
they do look alike.

140
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,360
Mother, you're back.

141
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,520
Mother, where have you been?

142
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,920
I miss you so much.

143
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,160
I miss you too.

144
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,800
Wait a minute.

145
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,240
Sister, brother, I'm leaving.

146
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,120
Thank you for waiting for me.

147
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,280
Haojun,

148
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,840
Shanyun said...

149
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,840
Sister.

150
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,840
Sister.

151
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,800
Sister Li.

152
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,280
What's going on?

153
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,560
I don't know either.

154
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,440
Maybe it's the dragon orb.

155
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,920
Chongming has recovered.

156
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,920
Look.

157
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,880
Two people HOLLYWOOD

158
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,840
So what about them?

159
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,840
You...

160
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,200
Sister.

161
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,440
I'm fine.

162
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,360
Don't cry.

163
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,440
I'm fine.

164
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,800
Are you all right?

165
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,320
We're fine.

166
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,120
Yun Shu found a solution.

167
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,120
Ao Feng let go of his hatred

168
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,280
and reunited with his mother.

169
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,480
Brother Chong Ming...

170
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,760
Maybe it's because of Long Zhu.

171
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,040
Chong Ming won't die.

172
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,760
Come on.

173
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,800
I'm hurt to save you.

174
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,000
No one cares about me.

175
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,440
No one has a conscience.

176
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,600
I'm fine.

177
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,720
I'll have a good lunch.

178
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,720
You should take a rest, okay?

179
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,920
You should eat less.

180
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,920
I know, sister.

181
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,920
You should take care of yourself.

182
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,440
Okay.

183
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,680
Is your wife going to give birth?

184
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,560
Did you give her a name?

185
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,240
I've thought about it.

186
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,640
But I haven't decided yet.

187
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,720
You brat.

188
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,600
You look like a dog.

189
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,880
I didn't expect

190
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,400
you would be the first one to be adopted.

191
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,400
Your Highness.

192
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,960
Are you

193
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,160
a man?

194
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,360
Of course not.

195
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,120
I'm just concerned about Yun Shu.

196
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,360
You're not

197
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,760
inexperienced, are you?

198
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,200
Nonsense.

199
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,840
We've been married for a long time.

200
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,480
You're bragging.

201
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,960
If you could do it,

202
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,960
she would have married you long ago.

203
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,360
I haven't been able to afford it recently.

204
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,960
I have to get married with a good price.

205
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,680
Otherwise, I'll be looked down upon.

206
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,240
What?

207
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,160
Are you very greedy?

208
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,480
It's that fox.

209
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,680
You eat so much every day.

210
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,840
You want me to pay for it?

211
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,880
I think

212
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,080
you have a good idea.

213
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,320
You can eat so much?

214
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,320
You ate so much.

215
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:52,960
Yes.

216
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,080
You ate so much chicken.

217
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,080
You're still eating.

218
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,080
You're still eating.

219
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,080
You're still eating.

220
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,640
Boss.

221
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,880
Another twenty chickens.

222
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,080
Another twenty chickens?

223
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,640
Another twenty chickens?

224
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,640
Sir.

225
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,280
You've eaten so much.

226
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,680
Only one chicken.

227
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,280
Only one chicken?

228
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,040
How can you do business with so many chickens?

229
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,040
Sir.

230
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,480
This is the last chicken.

231
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,480
You can't eat it all.

232
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,480
You can't eat it all.

233
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,480
Sir.

234
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,200
You've eaten all the chickens in Mo City.

235
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,360
I brought this chicken

236
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,360
from another place.

237
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,800
You know, I helped my friend

238
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,360
to lose some popularity.

239
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,960
The popularity has grown.

240
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,720
If you can't eat it all,

241
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,720
I'll bring some more chickens.

242
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,480
How many do you want?

243
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,840
Twenty chickens.

244
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,200
Twenty chickens?

245
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,200
Okay.

246
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,040
Twenty chickens and geese.

247
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,040
Wait a minute.

248
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,480
Don't move.

249
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,480
I'm dizzy.

250
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,480
It's been a long time.

251
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,480
You haven't come out yet.

252
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,480
You've been giving birth for so long.

253
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,480
It's okay to make a mistake.

254
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,480
Love is not a child of Uncle Shanyun.

255
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,480
You're not anxious.

256
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,480
I'm not like you.

257
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
Even if Uncle Shanyun hurt the child,

258
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,480
I won't be like this.

259
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,480
You

260
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,480
should let him get pregnant first.

261
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,480
You're questioning me.

262
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,480
You're not afraid of me.

263
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,480
You're not afraid of me.

264
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,480
You're not afraid of me.

265
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,480
You're not afraid of me.

266
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,480
You're not afraid of me.

267
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,480
You're not afraid of me.

268
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,480
How is it?

269
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,480
It's okay.

270
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,480
Don't worry.

271
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,480
I have a small question to ask you.

272
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,480
What is it?

273
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,480
Is your dragon clan getting married

274
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,480
because of Xia Dan?

275
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,480
Because the pregnant woman said

276
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,480
she saw a round thing.

277
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,480
A round thing?

278
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,480
Why are you laughing?

279
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,480
My question is very serious.

280
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,480
It's about how to get pregnant after the pregnant woman.

281
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,480
No.

282
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,480
I was born with human feelings.

283
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,480
I won't give birth to Xia Dan.

284
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,480
Then I can rest assured.

285
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,480
Maybe.

286
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,480
After all, I'm from Dan.

287
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,480
Is it so strange?

288
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,480
You look at me like this.

289
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,480
Then I won't give you a birth.

290
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,480
Don't.

291
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,480
I'm kidding.

292
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,480
Young Master.

293
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,480
Congratulations.

294
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,480
You have a son.

295
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,480
Uncle Yun.

296
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,480
Uncle Yun.

297
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,480
I was wrong.

298
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,480
Let's make progress.

299
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,480
Uncle Yun.

300
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,480
Because after the blood,

301
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:18,480
I will love you for a thousand years.

302
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,480
I run to meet you.

303
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,480
I don't want to end the blood.

304
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,480
Because after the blood,

305
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,480
I will be silent for a thousand years.

306
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,480
I will not end the love

307
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:43,480
I will not end the blood

308
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,480
Because after the blood,

309
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:05,480
I will love you for a thousand years.

310
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,480
I run to meet you.

311
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,480
I don't want to end the blood.

312
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,480
Because after the blood,

313
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:21,480
I will be silent for a thousand years.

314
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,480
I will not end the love

315
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:35,480
I will not end the blood
