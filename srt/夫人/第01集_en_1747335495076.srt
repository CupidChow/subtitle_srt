blossoming

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,000
Yourattيع

3
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,300
Mr. suffered a cardiac arrest

4
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,900
I heard that Chairman Hu has fallen ill.

5
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:02,660
No wonder that

6
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,540
Shan Yun Shu is holding a banquet today.

7
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,100
He's going to be

8
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,780
the head of Dongsheng Trade Company.

9
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,700
I heard that

10
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,540
she's the daughter-in-law of Hu's unmarried daughter.

11
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,340
Really?

12
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,940
That's because Young Master Hu

13
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:14,940
died early.

14
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,420
I also heard that

15
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,940
Master Hu's second wife

16
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,300
is in the middle of the night.

17
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,060
I heard that

18
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,860
she's the second wife of the second husband.

19
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:22,660
Really?

20
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,180
That's because Young Master Hu

21
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,180
died early.

22
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,820
I also heard that

23
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,060
Master Hu's second wife

24
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,900
is fighting for her right to inherit the power.

25
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,140
Dear seniors,

26
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,340
dear elders,

27
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,100
ladies and gentlemen,

28
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,020
welcome to

29
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,860
Dongsheng Trade Company.

30
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,180
I, Shan Yun Shu,

31
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,580
am the chairman of Dongsheng Trade Company.

32
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,180
I can't live without your support.

33
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,300
I'm willing to

34
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,020
work together

35
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,820
to contribute to the people of Mo City.

36
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,980
Thank you, everyone.

37
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,740
Cheers.

38
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,580
Cheers.

39
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,660
Madam,

40
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,500
Master Hu is dying.

41
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,660
Yun Shu,

42
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,820
I have something to tell you.

43
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,300
I only gave you

44
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,460
the life of the Hu family,

45
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,820
but I didn't give you

46
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,100
the share of the Hu family.

47
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,380
Uncle Hu,

48
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,180
I'm married to Zhen Xuan.

49
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,300
Zhen Xuan saved my life.

50
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,900
Although I didn't officially join the Hu family,

51
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,980
I'm already the daughter-in-law of the Hu family.

52
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,420
Yun Shu,

53
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,060
I...

54
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,140
I want

55
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,100
to marry Zhen Xuan.

56
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,660
You buried me here.

57
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,100
Leave here.

58
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,500
Master.

59
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,940
Master.

60
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,380
Master.

61
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,260
Master.

62
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,580
Master.

63
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,140
Master.

64
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,340
Master.

65
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,700
Master.

66
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,940
Hand over the throne.

67
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,180
My son, Mu Xian Gui,

68
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,020
Jin Dou Li Jin,

69
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,740
shall tender his marriage.

70
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,740
Father, mother,

71
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,100
20 years ago,

72
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,620
our family was slaughtered.

73
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,780
Uncle Hu raised me up.

74
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,500
Now,

75
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,020
I'm the chairman of Dongsheng Trade.

76
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:40,980
Don't worry.

77
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,700
I'll find my sister

78
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,780
and find the murderer

79
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,740
to avenge you.

80
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,740
Father, mother,

81
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,740
20 years ago,

82
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,740
our family was slaughtered.

83
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,740
Don't worry.

84
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,740
I'll find my sister

85
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,740
and find the murderer

86
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,740
to avenge you.

87
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,740
Don't worry.

88
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,740
I'll find my sister

89
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,740
and find the murderer

90
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,740
to avenge you.

91
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,740
Don't worry.

92
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,740
Don't worry.

93
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,740
Who sent you?

94
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,740
Who sent you to kill me?

95
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,740
I forgot when I was dead.

96
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,740
Get on it!

97
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,740
It's you.

98
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,740
I'm dead, aren't I?

99
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,740
It's the Dragon Bead.

100
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,740
It protected you.

101
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,740
It called us here

102
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,740
to protect you from harm.

103
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,740
It's been so many years.

104
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,740
I didn't expect the seven-winged eagle to be here.

105
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,740
Don't worry.

106
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,740
I won't let you die.

107
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,740
Kill them?

108
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,740
What are you doing?

109
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,740
I'm the master of the Dragon Bead.

110
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,740
You need to give me some time.

111
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,740
Okay.

112
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,740
The Dragon Bead

113
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,740
Ao Xue,

114
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,740
who can you compete with?

115
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,740
Chong Ming,

116
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,740
confidence is different from self-confidence.

117
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,740
You...

118
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,740
Go!

119
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,740
The woman with the eight-faced lotus

120
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,740
has the key clue I need.

121
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,740
I have the key clue.

122
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,740
Can you

123
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,740
go to her first?

124
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,740
No.

125
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,740
Then get out of the way.

126
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,740
I'll go to her myself.

127
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,740
You're still as stubborn as before.

128
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,740
What do you mean?

129
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,740
Our power

130
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,740
is limited by the prohibition of the qi.

131
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,740
Anything that goes against her will

132
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,740
is a trap.

133
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,740
How can we get rid of the qi?

134
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,740
The Dragon Bead and her are one.

135
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,740
The one who gets rid of the qi will die.

136
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,740
Or he will be willing to

137
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,740
bleed to the last drop.

138
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,740
The qi will be removed automatically.

139
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,740
We can't kill him.

140
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,740
How can we let him bleed to the last drop?

141
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,740
He's a human.

142
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,740
He has many things to ask from us.

143
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,740
As long as we use the human's participation well,

144
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,740
we can wait for the day.

145
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,740
You're thinking too much.

146
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,740
I'm going to have a rest.

147
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,740
It seems that I'm not the only one

148
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,740
who's not in the mood today.

149
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,740
The qi that's going to kill me

150
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,740
has restricted my power.

151
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,740
I'm going to kill you.

152
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,740
I'm going to kill you.

153
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,740
I'm going to kill you.

154
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,740
I'm going to kill you.

155
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,740
I'm going to kill you.

156
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,740
I'm going to kill you.

157
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,740
I'm going to kill you.

158
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,740
I'm going to kill you.

159
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,740
I'm going to kill you.

160
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,740
I'm going to kill you.

161
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,740
I'm going to kill you.

162
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,740
I'm going to kill you.

163
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,740
I'm going to kill you.

164
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,740
I'm going to kill you.

165
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,740
I'm going to kill you.

166
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,740
I'm going to kill you.

167
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,740
I'm going to kill you.

168
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,740
I'm going to kill you.

169
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,740
I'm going to kill you.

170
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,740
I'm going to kill you.

171
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,740
I'm going to kill you.

172
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,740
I'm going to kill you.

173
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,740
I'm going to kill you.

174
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,740
I'm going to kill you.

175
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,740
I'm going to kill you.

176
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,740
I'm going to kill you.

177
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,740
I'm going to kill you.

178
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,740
I'm going to kill you.

179
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,740
I'm going to kill you.

180
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,740
I'm going to kill you.

181
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,740
I'm going to kill you.

182
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,740
I'm going to kill you.

183
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,740
I'm going to kill you.

184
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,740
I'm going to kill you.

185
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,740
I'm going to kill you.

186
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,740
I'm going to kill you.

187
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,740
I'm going to kill you.

188
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,740
I'm going to kill you.

189
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,740
I'm going to kill you.

190
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,740
I'm going to kill you.

191
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,740
I'm going to kill you.

192
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,740
