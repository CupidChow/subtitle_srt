00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
My Dear Brothers

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I can give you anything.

4
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But not my wife.

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
How dare you come without magic power?

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'll kill you.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You smelly bastard.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Let me see what you can do.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You...

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Fulong Town.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Zhang Mingke is here.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Zhang Mingke is here.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Detective Zhang,

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
there's a new evidence and news.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Mo Shanhai

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
created the case of the Mo family's death.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
He also killed the Mo family's late uncle, Shan Yunshu.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Do you know anything about it?

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The police station has received the relevant information.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But we can't reveal anything

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
after further investigation.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Where is Mo Shanhai now?

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Where is Chief Zhang?

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Mo Shanhai is the chief.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He knows the biggest evil.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You're the one who's guilty.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Chief,

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
is there any other news?

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yes, Chief Zhang.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Chief Zhang.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Please tell us.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Chief Zhang.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Please tell us.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Everyone,

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
nothing else is known.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Please wait.

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This...

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This...

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This is not easy.

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What should we do?

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This is not easy.

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This is not easy.

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The third flag

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
is gone.

45
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Then you're not

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
free from the seal.

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Isn't this good?

48
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This means

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
the black robe people

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
can torture your sister more.

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Back, back.

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The police station has sealed Mo Shanhai's two major business meetings.

53
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Back, back.

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Chief Zhang, look.

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What's going on?

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What does it say?

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What's going on?

58
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Mo Shanhai of our business meeting.

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Mo Shanhai

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
killed the Mo family

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
because he smuggled the opium.

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Now he's committing suicide for his crime.

63
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Suicide?

64
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Then why was Dongsheng also sealed?

65
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The Dongsheng family

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
also participated in the smuggling of opium.

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm afraid they're not well-off.

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Then Chief Wu...

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Chief Wu is not a good person.

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
He's good at using the law of blood.

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You have to be careful.

72
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He's my sister.

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
He's dead.

74
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Zhang Mingkai won't hurt your sister now.

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Why?

76
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Zhang Mingkai is so anxious to catch us.

77
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
He must be trying to implement a plan

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
to scare us.

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Before he catches us,

80
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
he will never act rashly.

81
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This woman is a bodyguard?

82
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That woman is a killer.

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I've told Chong Ming about your identity.

84
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
They're on their way.

85
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Brother.

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The ban has been lifted.

87
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You can't hurt me.

88
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Don't be so proud, my good brother.

89
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I've had a way to deal with the dragon clan for so many years.

90
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You have to hurry.

91
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You've been practicing the skill of sacrifice.

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You can't live long if you don't use it well.

93
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yes.

94
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But it's different with the dragon pearl.

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Is it worth it?

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You've done this for hatred and desire.

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Since my mother was poisoned to death,

98
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I have no way back.

99
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
If your mother knew you're like this now,

100
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
she would be very painful.

101
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm sorry.

102
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
My mother

103
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
will understand me.

104
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Your mother was seriously ill

105
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and had a body disease.

106
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
She took you to the dragon clan

107
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
to let you grow up in the rich.

108
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You've failed her.

109
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
May your mother have a good life.

110
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The most painful thing is not your stabbing her,

111
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
but your stabbing your own countless heads.

112
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So the stabbing of Shanyun tree

113
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
makes you happy.

114
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You...

115
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What if she stabs her own countless heads?

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Hao Feng,

117
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
if you dare to touch a single hair of Shanyun tree,

118
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'll kill you.

119
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What's the difference between your kindness and love?

120
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You love Shanyun tree more than your life.

121
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I love my mother more than my life.

122
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You can't bear to hurt a single hair of Shanyun tree.

123
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Can I

124
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
bear the stabbing on my mother's heart?

125
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Why should I be punished like this?

126
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Why?

127
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Even if I'm killed by Zhan Xing,

128
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm still the murderer.

129
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
If I don't let the dragon clan go,

130
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
how can I let myself go?

131
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Right?

132
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You can blame me for the dragon clan's hatred.

133
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It has nothing to do with Shanyun tree.

134
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Brother Hao Jue,

135
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
the dragon clan should die.

136
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But you shouldn't.

137
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You know my kindness.

138
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Without you,

139
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I can't live.

140
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You taught me magic since I was a child.

141
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You grow up with me and make me strong.

142
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You've made up all my fantasies about my father.

143
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
In this world,

144
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
except for my mother,

145
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
you're the best to me.

146
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You're the most important to me.

147
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Even the poison you brought

148
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
caused a tragedy behind you,

149
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I still can't bear to kill you.

150
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I can't bear to.

151
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But

152
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
my mother's hatred

153
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
torments me day and night.

154
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I have many chances to kill you.

155
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But I can't do it.

156
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I killed myself

157
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
to get the dragon orb.

158
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's also for you to leave the dragon clan.

159
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
But I didn't expect

160
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
you'd betray the whole dragon clan

161
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
and stole the dragon orb.

162
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Hong Fen,

163
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
don't forget it.

164
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'll never forget it.

165
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Look at this.

166
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Your mother has been killed.

167
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
How could you dig her body out?

168
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You...

169
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's all because of you.

170
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I still have a little bit of humanity.

171
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I missed several chances

172
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
in the hell.

173
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm in a state of irreversible regret.

174
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The dragon orb has turned me against the god.

175
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The blood I've been training

176
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
is not enough.

177
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I also have

178
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
my primordial spirit is about to run out.

179
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's too late to stop.

180
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Hong Fen,

181
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
don't hurt Shen Yun Shu.

182
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm begging you.

183
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's not impossible.

184
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You just need to cooperate with me.

185
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Okay.

186
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
As long as I can do it,

187
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
you can use your own blood

188
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
to open the magic needle behind you.

189
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I can keep Shen Yun Shu alive.

190
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Since you love him so much...

191
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Sister,

192
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
what are you thinking about?

193
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You've been with me for so long.

194
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Why didn't you do it?

195
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Because I like you.

196
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I can't bear it.

197
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I don't believe it.

198
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
A person who can betray everything

199
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
would give up for a woman.

200
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I don't believe it either.

201
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I actually like you.

202
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I was weak and hesitated

203
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and missed countless chances.

204
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I thought you would resist.

205
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It seems that I was thinking too much.

206
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Why?

207
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Didn't you ask how Ao Jue is doing?

208
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You can't kill him.

209
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But I can torture him.

210
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The torture you gave your brother

211
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
is always in time.

212
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I can't let you kill him.

213
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I can't let you kill him.

214
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I can't let you kill him.

215
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I can't let you kill him.

216
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The torture you gave your brother

217
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
is always in time.

218
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
He cares about you more.

219
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It seems that

220
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
he has thought about my matter.

221
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
He stole the Dragon Bead for you.

222
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So you know

223
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
that Dragon Bead should be mine.

224
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You owe me.

225
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I've paid back

226
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
what I owe you.

227
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Why do you think so?

228
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I was sad and sad for your death.

229
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I was so sad that

230
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
you were killed.

231
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I shouldn't have been alive.

232
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So,

233
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
you can borrow me for the rest of my life.

234
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Your life is short

235
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
and you are a man.

236
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Don't pretend to be stupid.

237
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You are not suitable for your age.

238
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You're right.

239
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'll say something that I don't pretend.

240
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I was hurt by the Dragon Bead.

241
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I can only continue to live

242
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
if I keep changing my body.

243
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The body you see now

244
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
belongs to your dead brother, Zhenxuan.

245
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I dug it out of the tomb.

246
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
The Dragon Bead can't hurt me.

247
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm just kidding.

248
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
My body is mine.

249
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You can change it as you like.

250
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You disgust me.

251
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You should thank me.

252
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm sorry.

253
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I let you see

254
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
how your brother Zhenxuan looks like.

255
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Get out of here.

256
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I don't want to see you again.

257
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
But I can't leave you.

258
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I've tried it many times.

259
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
What do you mean?

260
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Do you think

261
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
you can still live well

262
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
and become the first lady of Mo City?

263
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Do you think

264
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
why you could escape

265
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
so many killers' death

266
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
twenty years ago?

267
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And

268
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
who taught you

269
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
all these?

270
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Listen.

271
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You can say that

272
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm sorry to anyone in the world.

273
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
But I can only

274
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
let you know.

275
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Brother Zhenxuan.

276
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I can't run anymore.

277
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Leave me alone.

278
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Go by yourself.

279
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Sister Yuzi.

280
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I can't leave you.

281
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm here to save you.

282
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Come on.

283
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'll carry you.

284
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Brother Zhenxuan.

285
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
We'll both die like this.

286
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Go by yourself.

287
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Leave me alone.

288
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
No.

289
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I won't leave you.

290
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Twenty years ago,

291
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I saw you being hunted.

292
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I was shocked.

293
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I used my side-eye to save you.

294
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But I didn't expect

295
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
the dragon ball would get into your body.

296
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Take good care of her.

297
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Tell me immediately

298
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
when you wake up.

299
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yes.

300
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
After that, I found you.

301
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I want to kill you

302
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
with the help of my servant.

303
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I want to kill you

304
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
with the help of my servant.

305
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I want to kill you

306
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
with the help of my servant.

307
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Okay.

308
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
But you...

309
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Mom.

310
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Please give me your money.

311
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Mom.

312
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Mom.

313
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Then I'll spare your life.

314
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Doctor.

315
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
How is she?

316
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
She has a heart disease.

317
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Her medicine won't work.

318
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Unless she wakes up.

319
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Okay.

320
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'll leave you now.

321
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The girl

322
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
is not a girl.

323
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
She's a girl.

324
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I know.

325
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Zhen Xuan saved you with his life.

326
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
If you have a break,

327
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
my guilt

328
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
will be even worse.

329
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Master.

330
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Master.

331
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Master.

332
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Master.

333
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
There's a doctor outside.

334
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
He said he could cure her.

335
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Please.

336
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Yes.

337
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'll approach you in the name of treatment.

338
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I want to see

339
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
how you grew up.

340
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Sir.

341
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
What's your name?

342
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Zhang.

343
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Mr. Zhang.

344
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Can you really cure me?

345
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I have a rare

346
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
heart-dead pill.

347
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
If it works,

348
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'll be grateful.

349
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
No need.

350
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I have a disciple.

351
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
After he wakes up,

352
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'll come to the mansion

353
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
to welcome him once every five days.

354
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Okay.

355
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Until that day,

356
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
the little devil

357
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
could bite me.

358
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Sorry, master.

359
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I was wrong.

360
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I told you

361
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm not your master.

362
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yes.

363
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You and I have been friends for a long time.

364
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You can leave now.

365
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
But...

366
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But...

367
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You said you'd help me take revenge.

368
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You have to

369
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
hang your own hands on the pain.

370
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I've already

371
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
handed you everything.

372
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You have to

373
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
take your own path.

374
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Then you don't need me.

375
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You can take revenge on your own.

376
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Take this.

377
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I lied to you

378
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
to forget about the pill.

379
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
We let each other go.

380
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Did you forget?

381
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
We'll never

382
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
meet again.

383
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,640
Because of the

384
