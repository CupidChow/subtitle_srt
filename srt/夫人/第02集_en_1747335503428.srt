1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
My Dear Brothers

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That means

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
his blood and dragon orb power

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
can help us restore our power temporarily.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm afraid so.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I didn't expect this Qi

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
to be more powerful than the legend.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Is there no way

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
to let us restore our power first?

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
There is a legend that

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
the three wishes of the Manchu Festival reporters

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
will be reduced if Qi is stopped.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Maybe we can restore our power.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Are you sure?

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I don't have time

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
to waste time with a little girl.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
If you don't believe me,

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
you can figure out a way

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
to get rid of her.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Stinky girl.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You don't need to be a doctor when you wake up.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You've wasted a lot of energy on me.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
When did you wake up?

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's probably when you said

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
you needed my blood to restore your power.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Girl.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Hurry up and make three wishes.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yes, hurry up.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What's your name?

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Chong Ming.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You can call me the dragon prince.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Make three wishes.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Are you an immortal or a demon?

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm an immortal.

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
She's a demon.

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Ao Xue.

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Show me some respect.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Chong Ming.

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
When I restore my power,

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I will make you a talent

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
by drawing gold and playing drums.

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You...

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Why are you arguing with me?

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Make a wish.

46
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Make a wish.

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Can you

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
let my deceased family come back to life?

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
No.

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Can you let time flow?

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
No.

52
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Can you make a reliable wish?

53
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
A reliable wish?

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
An immortal can't do anything.

55
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Why don't you two go back to your original body

56
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and let me have a look?

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I've only seen dragon and sedan in the shadow play.

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The law is too weak.

59
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's not good.

60
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Do you two want to go to the river to take a look?

61
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Immortals, demons and the crown prince.

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You're dressed like a opera singer.

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You think you're crazy.

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Move aside. I have something important to do.

65
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
No.

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Let's get rid of our anger first.

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We have to help each other.

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You help me catch the killer.

69
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'll consider helping you get rid of the anger.

70
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Chairman Zeng.

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm late.

72
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I hope you can forgive me.

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
President Mo can come.

74
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's my Dongsheng Trade Company.

75
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's also my Zeng Baozhu's good fortune.

76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Dongsheng Trade Company

77
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
has been close to the Wanlong Chamber of Commerce.

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
But Dongsheng Trade Company

79
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
has never joined the Wanlong Chamber of Commerce.

80
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's a pity for Wanlong Chamber of Commerce.

81
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
That's what you said, President Mo.

82
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Next, I want to thank Wanlong Chamber of Commerce.

83
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm so proud of President Mo

84
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
for coming to my Zeng Baozhu's memorial ceremony.

85
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Our Dongsheng Trade Company

86
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
is honored to have President Mo and Wanlong Chamber of Commerce

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
to attend the memorial ceremony.

88
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Great.

89
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You brat.

90
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We've used all our power to save you.

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm patient.

92
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I told you I would kill you.

93
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
If you could kill me, I would have done it long ago.

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I don't know the exact reason.

95
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But I think it must have something to do with Longzhu and the contract.

96
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Why don't you do it now?

97
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You brat.

98
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
One day, you will beg me.

99
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What are you talking about?

100
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm not begging you.

101
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You are begging me.

102
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Then...

103
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What's the matter?

104
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Since you can't leave me,

105
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I have to tell you the rules.

106
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
First,

107
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I don't take useless people.

108
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Since my blood can give you strength

109
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and let you enjoy the treatment of the gods,

110
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I will give you a good treatment.

111
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Second,

112
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I can give you strength

113
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and let you enjoy the treatment of the gods.

114
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You should pay a little price

115
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
to follow me,

116
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
protect me,

117
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and serve me.

118
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
As long as I'm happy,

119
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I can reward you every day.

120
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You are thinking too much.

121
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Strength belongs to us.

122
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You stole Longzhu

123
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and caused us to be sealed.

124
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You want me to serve you?

125
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'd rather die than be wrong.

126
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Second,

127
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I don't like to be a bad mouth.

128
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You can do whatever I ask you to do.

129
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You must mention me

130
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
when you talk to me.

131
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Third,

132
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I like to be polite.

133
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You must use your respect

134
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
when you talk to me.

135
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You must call me

136
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Madam.

137
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Do you understand?

138
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Even if I die,

139
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I will teach you a lesson.

140
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You...

141
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I heard that the former chairman,

142
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Mo Chengdi,

143
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and Madam Yi died.

144
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Is this true?

145
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes.

146
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Shan Yingshu

147
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
is the daughter-in-law of our Hu family.

148
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Two days ago,

149
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
he died in the funeral.

150
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I still can't find him.

151
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I feel so sad.

152
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But for the company's development,

153
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
for Wanqian's employees,

154
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I have to accept

155
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
our Dongsheng Trade Company.

156
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Please understand.

157
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Madam,

158
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
don't pretend to be a star.

159
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Madam Zeng is a good actress.

160
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You are so good at acting.

161
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Shan Yingshu.

162
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Are you disappointed that I'm not dead?

163
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's really hard for you and Zhao Xuyang

164
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
to send so many killers to assassinate me.

165
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
In order to take over the Dongsheng Trade Company,

166
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
the chairman really worked hard.

167
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I wonder if there are any masters behind it.

168
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Shan Yingshu,

169
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
don't be so cold-blooded.

170
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Our Hu family treats you well.

171
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You are not kind.

172
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Don't blame me for being not kind.

173
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Get out of the way.

174
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Twenty years ago,

175
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
you killed our young master.

176
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You didn't support him and stayed in the Hu family.

177
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You didn't leave.

178
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You seduced our master with your beauty.

179
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You made trouble with the master.

180
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You made the old and sick master

181
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
to be more beautiful.

182
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You destroyed our Hu family.

183
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
How can I give the company to you?

184
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's nothing to insult me.

185
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You are really annoying

186
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
to insult the master and young master.

187
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You are planning to get the property.

188
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's too late for me to find out

189
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
whether you are the master or not.

190
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Now the drugs and evidence have been sent to the police station.

191
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
If you dare to slander Uncle Hu and Zhen Xuan,

192
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I will make you die.

193
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I will also save you.

194
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Say it.

195
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Did Zeng Yiniang and Zhao Xuyao

196
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
let you kill me?

197
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yes.

198
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What's this?

199
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What's going on?

200
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
How could this happen?

201
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
How can this happen?

202
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's really a little bit.

203
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
These are all just the masks.

204
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Come out.

205
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Come out.

206
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's my arrangement.

207
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You know you are in danger.

208
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You don't have to be afraid.

209
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I am not afraid.

210
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm not afraid.

211
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm not afraid.

212
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So what if you know?

213
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You have to die today.

214
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The End

215
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I saved your life again.

216
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
How are you going to repay me?

217
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Get out of the way.

218
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Block my vision.

219
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Are you a dog?

220
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You don't know.

221
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The end

222
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Don't move.

223
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The End

224
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I think this person who just saved my life

225
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
is Mocheng's first wife, Shan Yushu.

226
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Who are you?

227
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I am Mocheng's police detective, Zhang Mingkai.

228
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm Zhang Mingkai, the detective of the police.

229
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm Zhang Mingkai, the detective of the police.

230
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Please come in.

231
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I don't know what detective Zhang means.

232
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Madam,

233
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
These two are...

234
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
They are my bodyguards.

235
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Don't be so frivolous.

236
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm not your bodyguard.

237
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Then if you are not,

238
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm going to take these two people.

239
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
was stolen.

240
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,040
And

241
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,240
they hurt the shopkeepers and the boss

242
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,320
who came to ask for money.

243
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,600
They were blessed

244
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,560
to have worn the clothes of their shop

245
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,720
for the whole life.

246
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,120
They were given treasures

247
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,600
because they didn't know the goods

248
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,240
and were so lazy.

249
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:45,920
Madam,

250
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,400
I told them

251
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,360
you would pay.

252
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,960
But Aojue was too impulsive

253
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,160
and insisted on giving them the dragon scale.

254
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,520
The Chen family thought he was crazy.

255
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,960
Detective Zhang,

256
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,800
they are really my bodyguards.

257
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,920
But

258
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,680
I have a problem with my brain.

259
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,640
Don't blame me.

260
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,640
How about this?

261
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,120
I will buy the clothes

262
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,560
they wear for five times the price.

263
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,920
And I will pay ten times the medical expenses

264
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,080
of the shopkeeper.

265
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,720
Since you said so,

266
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,440
I will take it as nothing happened.

267
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,520
But

268
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,000
it's what you owe me.

269
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,000
I will treat you to a meal later.

270
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,840
It's a deal.

271
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,240
Leave.

272
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:30,840
Alright.

273
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,200
Since you two are following me,

274
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,880
I won't treat you badly.

275
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,440
Remember our three rules.

276
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,160
As long as you do your best,

277
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,920
I will make your life

278
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,920
a better one.

279
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,680
By the way,

280
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,680
your name is too cute.

281
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,120
I will call you

282
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,040
Long'er.

283
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,960
It suits you.

284
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,920
You are still laughing.

285
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,400
Although you are inferior to me,

286
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,960
you are still a dragon.

287
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,920
You can be this girl

288
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,760
and be as beautiful as a dragon.

289
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,880
I can bear it

290
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,280
for the dragon pearl.

291
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,960
As for Long'er,

292
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,040
you should know it.

293
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,160
You let him play with you?

294
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,080
Chang漂ing has this over志r iemand

295
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,720
to win the dragon pearl without you.

296
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,280
I will answer him.

297
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,160
Lady.

298
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,800
Come to me and listen to the beautiful music
