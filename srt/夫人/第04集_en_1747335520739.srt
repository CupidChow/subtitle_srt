1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
waited Thats first and then died

2
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,260
damn it

3
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,860
i got easily injured

4
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:42,800
The fire is in

5
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,080
Go

6
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,960
Mother

7
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,240
Her countenance

8
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,940
Keep breathing

9
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,060
I know

10
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,220
blood and hatred will eventually be over.

11
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,540
There is no way back

12
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,180
for revenge.

13
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,180
Today, I'll

14
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,060
seek justice for you.

15
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,340
Thank you.

16
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,700
How dare you treat your aunt like this?

17
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,540
My lord's power is powerful.

18
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,060
He must be disappointed.

19
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,260
I see that you care too much about my lord.

20
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,420
How about

21
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,900
you hand them over?

22
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,940
If you say anything false,

23
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,500
you'll be in jail.

24
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,540
Do you hear me?

25
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,540
I understand.

26
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,180
Madam,

27
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,420
I'm asking you.

28
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,180
Who sent someone to kill me?

29
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,740
Who helped you to take Dong Sheng away from me?

30
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,620
How could you do that?

31
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,100
I won't say anything.

32
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,540
Kill me if you want.

33
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,380
I know

34
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,980
that you always understand his turbines.

35
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:37,980
So I won't die.

36
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,100
Then I'll...

37
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,100
Didn't you just...

38
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,100
Don't move!

39
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,740
You can't bear to leave?

40
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,540
I sent someone to kill you.

41
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,660
I also saved you from the hell.

42
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,100
I also took the inheritance rights from you.

43
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,580
I also

44
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,740
poisoned Master's medicine every day.

45
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,380
Just for the property,

46
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,540
Master treated you well.

47
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,380
You didn't even have a meal.

48
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,580
What else are you unsatisfied with?

49
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:07,860
Of course not.

50
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,860
It's all because of you.

51
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,300
Because of me?

52
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,300
In order to save you,

53
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,500
Young Master was in the dark.

54
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,940
Brother Zhenxuan's revenge

55
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,540
was never forgotten by Uncle Hong.

56
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,300
I never forget it either.

57
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,220
I dare not forget it.

58
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,220
Since you're the City Leader of the Dragon Gang,

59
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,620
you must know

60
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,140
the whole family of Mo Wenkai

61
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,420
was destroyed by him, right?

62
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,620
Tell me.

63
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,500
Did Mo Shenhai do it alone?

64
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,220
If I'm not wrong,

65
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,100
you're the daughter of Mo Wenkai,

66
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,340
the leader of the Dragon Gang.

67
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,780
You can leave now.

68
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,500
Why are you laughing?

69
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,820
You really think

70
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,180
Hu Zeyuan

71
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,020
is the Master you mentioned?

72
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,180
Is he innocent?

73
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,420
What do you mean?

74
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,660
Twenty years ago,

75
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,020
the case of the Mo family's destruction,

76
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,500
Hu Zeyuan was the biggest accomplice.

77
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,220
He was the one who killed your Mo family.

78
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,060
Stop talking nonsense.

79
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:04,940
Many years ago,

80
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,180
Master was also involved in the violence of the Yan Tu.

81
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,100
That's why he was the first to speak.

82
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,100
Later, your father was in prison.

83
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,380
In order to get rid of your father,

84
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,620
Mo Shenhai

85
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,780
knew the truth.

86
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,740
So, your Yuan Ping was not here yet.

87
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,700
You're so smart.

88
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,020
You should have known it.

89
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,500
He was just

90
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,220
trying to make up for his guilt.

91
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,540
Half of the assets of Dongsheng

92
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,820
were also affected by your parents.

93
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,580
As for Mo Shenhai...

94
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,780
Qingye Temple

95
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,940
Long time no see.

96
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,260
Little girl.

97
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,620
It's you.

98
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,460
The Dragon Orb's power.

99
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,220
It belongs to me.

100
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,940
Hunt for two of my synthetic needle pearls from Tao.

101
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,780
How about a play?

102
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:30,700
Kate.

103
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:36,340
You sleep after eating or sleeping while you're海�xy

104
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,020
Don't jave water for couple Government viens

105
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:41,840
I want to belong to your스� lazım

106
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,180
He was attacked.

107
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,180
He hurt my heart.

108
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,100
You prepared for this.

109
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,140
It seems that you are trapped by the Dragon's Air

110
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,900
and you can't hurt him yourself.

111
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,060
After the meeting,

112
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,340
after a thousand years,

113
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,580
Long'er.

114
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,300
You still want to torture me at this time?

115
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,500
Dragon's Blood can heal wounds.

116
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,060
What are you thinking about?

117
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,540
You...

118
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,100
Then you don't have to kiss him.

119
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:11,740
Besides,

120
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,260
at least you should dress up.

121
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,860
You are really a dog-eating dog.

122
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,700
I was called directly.

123
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,460
I don't have time to dress up.

124
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,660
You are not bad just by looking at your body.

125
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,500
Long'er.

126
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,860
You are so disgusting.

127
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:11,880
Leng Dachuan.

128
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,340
Swallow them all.

129
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,700
Swallow theirding all away.

130
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,540
Theég는데 n divin d resurrected in my family

131
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:32,820
is Hu Ze Yuan.

132
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,500
This is the biggest Kievan.

133
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,580
He talks about is that he wants to kill your Mo Family!

134
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,180
My wish to have you

135
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:52,360
Left behind in someone

136
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,020
My name, my exercise

137
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,480
Creating the dream

138
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,860
Endlessly

139
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,340
Unclear

140
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,260
There's no Français.

141
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:12,680
You think the

142
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,040
It's because of us.

143
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,280
You did what you want.

144
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:29,100
Be八

145
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,740
And then

146
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,380
You can go first.

147
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:36,720
I can just...

148
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,300
You did a good job,

149
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,940
Maybe he has some way

150
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,780
to weaken the power of the Qi.

151
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,380
What are you afraid of?

152
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,580
I'll kill him next time.

153
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,460
But

154
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,740
what on earth did he use

155
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,780
to weaken the power of Qi?

156
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,460
It's good if he can get it.

157
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,620
You want to get rid of my control?

158
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:56,900
What else?

159
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,940
I called you forcibly today.

160
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,220
I'm taking a bath.

161
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,820
You beat me and scold me.

162
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,340
Don't you see yourself?

163
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,540
How can you say I take advantage of you?

164
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,020
What's wrong with me?

165
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,660
I'm the most beautiful girl in Mo City.

166
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,300
Look at me.

167
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,300
Am I that bad?

168
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,780
You have a thick skin.

169
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,820
You must be drunk.

170
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,860
Yes.

171
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,300
I'm drunk.

172
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,900
No one in this world

173
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,900
can protect me

174
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,260
like the Zhenxuan Princess.

175
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,140
They don't want my money

176
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,540
but my beauty.

177
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,140
Now you two

178
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,780
are trying to get the dragon.

179
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,300
Madam, you're drunk.

180
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,540
Let me help you upstairs.

181
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,100
Shan Yushu,

182
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,460
I don't want to blame you.

183
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,220
But you're not the one who's in danger.

184
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,300
If anything happens,

185
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,260
you must discuss it with me.

186
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,620
Okay.

187
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,740
Who else can I trust

188
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,020
in this world?

189
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,340
Even Uncle Hu is lying to me now.

190
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,020
Sometimes I really think

191
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,620
the mortal world is boring.

192
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,060
I feel spectacular

193
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,220
and Pompeiius-like.

194
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:32,120
Even the

195
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,700
King Hu is unbelievable

196
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,900
and the Emperor of Wowu.

197
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,220
Today we have to

198
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:38,820
You...

199
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,140
You hug me.

200
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,620
Okay.

201
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,780
Are you angry with me

202
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,420
or are you seduced by her?

203
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,020
It's your business.

204
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:13,220
I'm always alone.

205
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,820
I want to hold on to the words I'm used to.

206
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,700
Brother Zhong Min,

207
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,220
thank you.

208
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,620
You got drunk after drinking two cups of wine.

209
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:27,700
When you wake up tomorrow,

210
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,580
you'll remember what happened tonight.

211
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,460
You'll regret it.

212
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,380
I'm afraid I'll regret it.

213
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,060
Do you think

214
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,660
I'm really that generous?

215
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,620
You let me see Zhen Xuan?

216
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,380
You have many brothers.

217
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,460
You can't dream big.

218
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,980
The one you really miss

219
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,140
will come to you.

220
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,420
But my life is not mine.

221
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,140
It's my parents' life.

222
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,060
It's Zhen Xuan's life.

223
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,380
How can I be so weak?

224
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,020
I want to avenge them.

225
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,500
I want to avenge them.

226
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,860
Maybe they don't want you to be like this.

227
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,420
They love you.

228
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,540
So they must hope

229
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,460
you can find something more valuable

230
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,380
and more important in your life.

231
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,380
Is Brother Zhong Min the same?

232
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,020
I...

233
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,220
I don't know.

234
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,020
The wind blows, the clouds fly.

235
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,380
The scenery is so beautiful.

236
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,180
Zeng Bao Zhu and Zhao Xu Yao are dead.

237
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:20,740
But

238
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,340
I didn't kill Uncle Shanyun.

239
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,100
Did you find anything?

240
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,460
Uncle Shanyun has burned the place

241
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,780
where Zeng Bao Zhu and Zhao Xu Yao were interrogated.

242
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,340
What is that place?

243
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,740
The ruins of Qinglin Lane.

244
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,340
A ruins?

245
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,380
Could it be...

246
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,060
Keep an eye on Uncle Shanyun.

247
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,220
Since Zeng Bao Zhu and Zhao Xu Yao are dead,

248
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,180
let Chief Wu come here.

249
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:53,540
Yes.

00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:56,740
