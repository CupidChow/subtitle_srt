My Dear Brothers EP10

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The End

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Are you done?

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I told you it's not a good move.

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Your Highness,

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
you asked me to

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
eliminate the evil.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm trying to figure out a way.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You're using it now.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Are you kidding me?

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Your Highness,

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
is it full of

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
the woman's words and actions,

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
actions, actions,

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
smiles,

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and heart?

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You're a good actress, right?

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Can you talk to me?

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The best way to forget a woman

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
is to fall in love with another

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
excellent woman.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Like me.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Are you a dog brain?

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
If I could fall in love with you,

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I would have done it hundreds of years ago.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Why do you still wait?

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You're a dog brain.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You're a dog brain.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm a fox.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Don't insult me.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
An old man of over a thousand years old

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
was suddenly tortured by a girl

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and he couldn't sleep at night.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
He fell in love with her.

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
He was so desperate.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I was helping you.

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You were so picky.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That...

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's because you asked me to conquer her.

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But now,

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
the more I do it,

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I can't get out of it.

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
This is your thousand-year-old love story.

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's not that easy.

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
They say that no matter how hard it is,

46
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
if you can't,

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
you can take the initiative to solve the problem.

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Let me marry Shan Yun Shu?

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I said you're a blind woman.

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You still don't admit it.

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
How can I just say that?

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I mean,

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
you can't avoid it,

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
so you take the initiative to join it.

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Enjoy it.

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Why are you making it difficult for yourself

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
like this?

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It seems to make sense.

59
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What should I do next?

60
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Next?

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Who?

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
If you keep talking nonsense,

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'll break your heart.

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You're not a good singer.

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Of course, you should confess your love.

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Confess my love?

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Confess my love?

68
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You must look into each other's eyes.

69
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You must be gentle.

70
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You must have firm eyes.

71
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Shan Yun Shu.

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
No.

73
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yun Shu, I love you.

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Jue.

75
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Shan Yun Shu.

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Why are you here?

77
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You scared me.

78
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Why are you so fierce?

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I called you several times,

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
but you didn't hear me.

81
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's okay.

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
No need to explain.

83
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Come with me to a place.

84
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I...

85
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What's wrong?

86
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Shan Yun Shu.

87
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I like you.

88
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Sister, come with me.

89
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'll send you there.

90
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Ming Kai, why are you here?

91
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Sister,

92
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
how could I not know

93
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
such a big thing happened?

94
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This time,

95
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I must guard you well.

96
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What happened?

97
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Mosheng is planning to gather the evidence

98
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
to report my sister's killer identity

99
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and the incident of the smuggling of opium

100
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
with the Hu family twenty years ago.

101
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
By the way,

102
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
what did you say just now?

103
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I didn't hear it.

104
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's okay.

105
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Let's go to the police station first.

106
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Brother Chong Ming,

107
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
you don't have to accompany me.

108
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I just followed

109
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
your sister's instructions.

110
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
With your skills,

111
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
you can escape completely.

112
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So do you have another plan

113
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
or do you have another conspiracy?

114
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Do you have to

115
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
think so badly of me?

116
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Of course.

117
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I did make many mistakes before.

118
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But

119
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
that was before I knew my identity.

120
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Now, I just want to be a good person.

121
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Now even Lord Yan

122
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
doesn't dare to believe you.

123
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I can escape

124
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and can't control me directly.

125
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's just

126
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
that I'll fall into the trap of Mosheng

127
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
and Director Wu.

128
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The killing will

129
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
fall into the double-challenge.

130
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Don't you hate your sister the most?

131
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yes.

132
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Why do you think it through now?

133
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I do hate her.

134
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Maybe

135
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm extremely angry.

136
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So

137
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
what do you want to express?

138
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
On the one hand,

139
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I want to repay Mosheng Hai

140
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
for raising me.

141
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
On the other hand,

142
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I want to try her.

143
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
She left me for so many years.

144
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Since she didn't find my body that year,

145
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
why didn't she come to me?

146
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Your sister never gave up on finding you.

147
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
She just didn't dare to fight.

148
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Did you get the dragon pearl

149
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
for the transformation?

150
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yes.

151
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What's the difference

152
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
between the transformation and the transformation?

153
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Living.

154
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's the meaning of living.

155
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You're a story-teller.

156
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What's your plan after you leave?

157
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I never thought of leaving.

158
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What do you mean?

159
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I've been following Mosheng Hai for so many years.

160
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
He actually came up with

161
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
a way to bring us together.

162
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's not like his style of doing things.

163
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
There's only one possibility.

164
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's the way he controls

165
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
his black robe.

166
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He turned into a knife

167
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
to cut my sister's hair.

168
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I also turned into a knife.

169
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Only I

170
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
can kill Mosheng Hai.

171
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Just do me a favor.

172
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Just be a good son

173
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
to my dead parents.

174
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
If you die,

175
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
how sad will your sister be?

176
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The dead are not worth it.

177
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The living

178
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
should be cherished.

179
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I've witnessed her

180
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
longing for you

181
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
during my time with your sister.

182
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
If I die,

183
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
please tell her

184
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
to take care of herself.

185
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And tell her

186
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I miss her too.

187
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yuhan,

188
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
what are you talking about?

189
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Sister,

190
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
be careful of the poison in the tea.

191
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's poisonous.

192
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Don't worry.

193
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Black Robe Man and Mosheng Hai

194
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
want to get the Dragon Bead and the Eastern Holy Water.

195
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
But they didn't get it.

196
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
They don't dare to touch me.

197
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm here.

198
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Don't worry.

199
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Don't worry?

200
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
When did you not come?

201
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You're here so late.

202
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You're not welcome.

203
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
President Mo,

204
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
let's not be polite.

205
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Let's meet at the mountain.

206
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I want to meet Black Robe Man.

207
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Chen Yingshuo,

208
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
you can't meet Black Robe Man

209
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
as you want.

210
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Tell me

211
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
what you're here for tonight.

212
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Let my sister

213
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
get rid of the charge

214
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
against the Hu family and the Eastern Holy Water.

215
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Why?

216
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Because I have the Dragon Bead

217
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
that Black Robe Man wants.

218
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I can give it to her.

219
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
We have other ways

220
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
to get the Dragon Bead.

221
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's not a condition.

222
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Really?

223
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:31,700
Don't overestimate your

224
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
hatred.

225
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You know her ability.

226
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
If she wants to leave,

227
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
no one can stop her.

228
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm here to talk to you

229
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
because I hope

230
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
she can get through the second half safely.

231
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
As for you and Black Robe Man,

232
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
which one of you

233
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
can beat the two bodyguards

234
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
beside me?

235
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
If Black Robe Man

236
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
can get the Dragon Bead

237
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
and doesn't hurt me,

238
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm willing to cooperate.

239
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But if she dares to hurt my sister again,

240
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I can't care about it.

241
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Don't forget

242
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
the lesson at the dock last time.

243
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
If you want to die,

244
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
you have to die first.

245
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I don't believe you.

246
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
The blood

247
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Black Robe Man took last time

248
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
is almost used up.

249
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Take this bottle as my sincerity.

250
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I hope to see my sister

251
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
before I go home.

252
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm sorry.

253
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm sorry.

254
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I asked Uncle Hu

255
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
to bury them here.

256
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I didn't even dare to write their names

257
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
or come to the base.

258
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Long,

259
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
have a drink with me.

260
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Long.

261
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Long,

262
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
thank you.

263
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
This is not your style.

264
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Actually,

265
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
you've saved me several times.

266
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Twenty years ago,

267
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
twenty years later,

268
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
and a few days ago.

269
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You've saved me too.

270
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
We're even now.

271
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I remember you said

272
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
you wanted Long Zhu

273
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
to save your brother.

274
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I didn't forget the promise.

275
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
When I avenge my parents,

276
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
you can take Long Zhu away.

277
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
No need.

278
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's no use.

279
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's been more than twenty years.

280
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
My brother is probably

281
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
already reincarnated.

282
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You just live.

283
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I can wait for you to die.

284
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Really?

285
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Then why don't you leave me?

286
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Tell me about your story.

287
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You want to hear it?

288
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
After all, it's a fairy's story.

289
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Actually, there's nothing to say.

290
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But you still love your brother.

291
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
My brother is another sad story.

292
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
His mother is a human.

293
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The first time he met my father,

294
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
he gave birth to a child

295
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
who was half-naked and half-human.

296
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
He suffered from white eyes and lung cancer.

297
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
When he brought him to Long Zhu,

298
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
he was already in a high state of illness.

299
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
My father refused to see him.

300
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Not long after,

301
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
he committed suicide in the East Sea.

302
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I promised him

303
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
to take good care of him.

304
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But not long after,

305
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
my brother was ill.

306
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I stole Long Zhu

307
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
to save him.

308
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
But...

309
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I didn't have the courage

310
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
to protect my brother before.

311
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Now I don't have the courage to say goodbye to you.

312
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You're not asleep?

313
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Then what I just said...

314
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Long'er, you're great.

315
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I like you too.

316
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I like you too.

317
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'll never forget you.

318
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'll never forget you.

319
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'll never forget you.

320
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Mo Yuhan,

321
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I promised you

322
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
to take care of your family.

323
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You can't leave Mo City during this time.

324
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You can do whatever you want.

325
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I know.

326
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Thank you for your concern.

327
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm not fooled by you.

328
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Take good care of your sister.

329
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Brother Chongming,

330
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
thank you for these two days.

331
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's my duty.

332
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Go and eat something.

333
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
What?

334
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'll take you to eat something.

335
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
There's no one at home these days.

336
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It's hard for me to cook.

337
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Go.

338
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Okay.

339
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Long'er, you're so tired.

340
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
If others see us,

341
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
who will believe you?

342
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Come here.

343
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm so tired.

344
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm so tired.

345
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm so tired.

346
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Stand still.

347
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Don't move.
