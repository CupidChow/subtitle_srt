1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,100
I Believe in Myself

2
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,160
treatment table

3
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,220
Episode 15

4
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,120
It's I who sent people to kill you JENNY

5
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,620
It's me who used the den to storage

6
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,960
Javelin to steal control of Dong Sheng

7
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,080
It was I

8
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,580
who poisoned the seems when Mr. Tang is drinking

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The case is over.

10
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,080
What does this have to do with the equity?

11
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,640
Let's continue listening.

12
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,160
Don't think that you can fight against Mo Shen Han

13
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,920
after you become the chairman of Dongsheng.

14
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,240
Mo Shen Han was 20 years ago.

15
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,240
Mo Yuhan.

16
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,280
Go and reunite with your sister.

17
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,680
I'm relieved that

18
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,080
your sister can keep the Mo family's shares.

19
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,040
I'm not going to let you go.

20
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,120
I'm not going to let you go.

21
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,120
I'm not going to let you go.

22
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,120
I'm sure of it.

23
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,240
Shen...

24
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,600
Sister.

25
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,760
After all these years,

26
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,680
thanks to Uncle Mo Shen Han's care,

27
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,320
he's brought me up.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,200
Do you know

29
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,920
who is the enemy of the Mo family?

30
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,120
I know.

31
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,880
Then you still want to help him.

32
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,840
Don't you know that?

33
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,840
The Hu family was also one of the enemies of the Mo family.

34
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,040
Didn't you help them?

35
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,200
It was you that night.

36
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,200
Yes.

37
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,960
Are you feeling better?

38
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,000
My injury is not a problem.

39
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,080
It's my sister's problem.

40
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,840
Don't make it hard for me.

41
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,200
You can handle

42
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,280
the shares yourself.

43
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,920
The meeting of sisters

44
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,600
always surprises me.

45
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,800
It's about

46
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,280
whether Aunt Zeng and Steward Zhao are legal.

47
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,520
Our police station

48
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,840
will continue to investigate.

49
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,520
That's all

50
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,400
for today.

51
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,840
We won't bother the chairman.

52
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,400
It's time to open the business.

53
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,240
I'll go back and watch him with you.

54
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,920
Go.

55
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,560
I'm not a good person,

56
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,200
but you let them go just like that?

57
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,760
The recording is so short.

58
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,320
It's enough to scare Mo Shen Han.

59
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,320
It's easy to get him to be greedy.

60
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,920
You have to be prepared

61
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,320
and be quick-witted.

62
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,880
Everything today

63
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,360
is too sudden.

64
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,000
What if Mo Shen Han is deliberately lying to you?

65
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,000
What if he deliberately takes your sister to get you?

66
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,320
I was too impulsive just now.

67
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,000
Is that girl your sister?

68
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,920
Do you need to find out more?

69
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,920
I'm not a girl.

70
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,480
I need to prove it to others.

71
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,240
She's like my mother.

72
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,360
She must be my sister.

73
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,080
I don't know

74
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,600
the details.

75
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,880
I can't make it up.

76
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,840
Ming Kai,

77
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,880
thank you for today.

78
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,920
You have to be careful when you go back.

79
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,920
The director will definitely find you trouble again.

80
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,120
If you have any difficulties,

81
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,120
come to me.

82
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,640
Don't worry, sister.

83
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,720
I have my own way.

84
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,760
By the way, sister,

85
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,400
if possible,

86
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,960
I can live in your house.

87
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,000
Shengming, what are you doing?

88
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,000
Why don't you let me finish?

89
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,840
Are you a dog?

90
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,240
Where did you get Ming Kai?

91
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,520
I was afraid that he would be blocked on the way.

92
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,600
So I sent him home.

93
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,760
He can't come back.

94
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,320
You'd better be...

95
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,080
Ming Kai is my brother from now on.

96
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,680
You can't treat him like this.

97
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,720
And,

98
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,680
you can't use your power

99
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,440
without my permission.

100
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,760
You have so many brothers and sisters.

101
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,320
President,

102
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,200
this...

103
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,400
This is totally my fault.

104
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,200
It's really your fault.

105
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,960
Why didn't I expect Mo Yuzi

106
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,840
to be the Shanyun Tree?

107
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,520
Don't interfere

108
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,480
with the business of the dock.

109
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,720
You just need to be in charge of the tobacco store.

110
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,560
Now the situation

111
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,320
is not as simple as it was in the winter.

112
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,680
It's not a business competition anymore.

113
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,560
It's a grudge between the two worlds.

114
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,200
Yes.

115
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,720
I'm so blind.

116
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,880
In this way,

117
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,400
you two really look alike.

118
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,680
You found your own sister

119
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,400
and became a lady.

120
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,120
You should be happy.

121
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,440
I didn't.

122
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,880
You failed to assassinate the Shanyun Tree several times.

123
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,120
You should have known

124
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,480
that you two were together to fight me.

125
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,160
Master,

126
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,280
I really don't know that the Shanyun Tree is my sister.

127
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,200
And she's very good at it.

128
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,880
And I really can't do it

129
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,240
with two bodyguards.

130
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,280
But I've never betrayed you.

131
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,960
You raised me.

132
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,280
I won't forget it.

133
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,440
She is your sister.

134
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,840
The one who left me and ran away

135
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,000
is not my sister.

136
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,880
Don't worry, master.

137
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,880
I'll help you get it back.

138
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,000
Han,

139
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,800
you're the best assassin I've ever trained.

140
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,600
I trust you.

141
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,920
Now your sister is going to kill me.

142
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,400
It's time for you to repay me.

143
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,280
Put down your sword.

144
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,640
You been tracking the assassin for half the night?

145
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:48,960
What are you doing?

146
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,760
Why don't we have a cup of tea?

147
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,520
How have you been these years?

148
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:54,760
I'm fine.

149
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,400
I've been looking for you

150
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,360
since the accident happened.

151
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,000
But I didn't find you.

152
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,440
I didn't expect you to be so far away

153
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,840
and so close to me.

154
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,960
Have you ever come to me?

155
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,080
I haven't.

156
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,320
But I've killed you.

157
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,240
You're not angry?

158
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,800
What's there to be angry about?

159
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,040
You're under the control of Mo Shanhai.

160
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,320
You're living a life of evil.

161
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,080
I didn't find you in time.

162
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,240
It's my fault.

163
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,880
What do you want from me?

164
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,760
I want you to come to me

165
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,840
or leave Mo Shanhai.

166
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,800
It's not good to be with him.

167
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,680
What's wrong with that?

168
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,320
It's been so many years.

169
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,440
We've known each other.

170
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,520
Mo Shanhai won't believe you anymore.

171
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,240
I'm afraid he'll do you harm.

172
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,680
You're afraid he'll threaten you with me, right?

173
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,320
Yes.

174
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,320
Because you're my sister.

175
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,400
I love you.

176
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,400
I care about you.

177
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,680
After I defeat Mo Shanhai,

178
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,920
I'll give you all the shares of the Mo family.

179
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,960
Don't be a killer anymore.

180
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,440
Live a good life.

181
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,200
Your parents know it.

182
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,360
You'll be at ease.

183
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,960
Mo Shanhai is nice to me.

184
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,800
But he's our enemy after all.

185
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,800
Isn't the Hu family also our enemy?

186
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,200
Aren't you doing well?

187
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,440
The incident happened because of the incident.

188
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,320
The Hu family also paid a price.

189
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,040
If it weren't for Brother Zhenxuan,

190
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
I would have died long ago.

191
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,720
If it weren't for Mo Shanhai,

192
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,200
I would have died long ago.

193
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,040
I'm so tired.

194
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,800
Do you want to move back and live with me?

195
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm fine by myself.

196
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,400
Then,

197
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,240
do you have any other things to ask me?

198
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,280
You buried the electric bird there.

199
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,960
I want to see it.

200
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,280
You haven't gone back yet?

201
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,640
Zhuo Mingfei said he was worried that you wouldn't leave.

202
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,880
He even tried to stop me.

203
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,600
How is it?

204
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,640
He still hates me.

205
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:00,880
Don't worry.

206
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,840
It's the best thing to find your sister now.

207
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,920
As for other misunderstandings,

208
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,840
solve them slowly.

209
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,200
The days are still long.

210
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,640
I'm afraid that

211
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,880
I can't let go of Mo Shanhai's kindness to him.

212
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,080
What I'm afraid of is

213
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,200
Mo Shanhai will use him to deal with me.

214
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,720
If Yu Han doesn't want to,

215
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,160
it will be bad for him.

216
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,120
If you don't want to,

217
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,320
I'll bring your sister back before I go home.

218
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,160
No.

219
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,160
This will only make your sister and Madam more rational.

220
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,760
If they hurt each other,

221
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,360
how can we let the weak be in the hands of the enemy?

222
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,760
The most important thing now

223
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,400
is to ensure your sister's safety.

224
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,480
I think

225
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,040
Mo Shanhai won't hurt my sister for now.

226
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,920
It's a pity that he doesn't use such a good sword

227
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,200
to deal with me.

228
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,760
And I believe Yu Han

229
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,160
will not really hurt me.

230
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,200
I believe he will understand you.

231
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,920
I believe he will understand you.

232
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,120
He understands you and understands you.

233
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,680
I don't understand him.

234
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,800
A'Jue.

235
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,240
Let him decide for himself.

236
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,520
When did you care so much about Madam?

237
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,800
I don't care.

238
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,480
I've been looking for my sister for so long.

239
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,520
I've got a lot of brothers and sisters.

240
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,640
If I were your sister,

241
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,640
I wouldn't want to come back.

242
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,680
Besides,

243
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,560
I've been looking for her for so long.

244
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,560
I'm afraid she'll be angry.

245
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,000
If she's not obedient,

246
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,480
I'll be a dead man.

247
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,240
A'Jue, shut up.

248
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,320
You can think about it.

249
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,880
You'll know I'm right sooner or later.

250
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,880
Chongming.

251
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,320
Maybe A'Jue is right.

252
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,480
I've thought too much.

253
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,560
Some things are not that complicated.

254
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,400
Life is so complicated.

255
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,880
If it could be simpler,

256
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,280
there wouldn't be so much trouble.

257
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,960
Are there troubles with the immortals and demons?

258
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,160
Of course.

259
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,840
For example?

260
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,120
I envy you have a family.

261
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,880
But I don't.

262
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,800
You don't have a family?

263
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,200
In the long years,

264
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,800
my family was restricted to death by fate.

265
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,080
I've lived alone for hundreds of years.

266
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,680
You never thought of getting married?

267
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:23,960
No.

268
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,160
I've been practicing hard.

269
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,040
Maybe

270
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,920
I've never met anyone I love.

271
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,400
Or maybe

272
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,600
I lost my love after I got it.

273
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,120
No one can be with us forever.

274
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,000
The precious love in our life will leave.

275
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,040
Maybe

276
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,560
what we cherish is our life.

277
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,840
Or we can't live for long.

278
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,600
Brother,

279
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,160
what did I do wrong?

280
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,400
Or what did I say wrong?

281
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,440
You took me to Dragon King Temple

282
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,560
and walked 50 miles from here.

283
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,960
I only walked for a day.

284
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,280
I'm so thirsty that I can't even eat.

285
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,440
You must explain it to me today.

286
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,680
Say it again.

287
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,120
Do you believe I'll take you to the East Sea?

288
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,040
I...

289
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,680
Don't worry, dad.

290
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,800
He doesn't have the power to

291
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,560
kill you.

292
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,240
He doesn't need the power.

293
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,040
Without your permission,

294
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,160
he can't kill anyone.

295
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,480
I...

296
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,280
This is anintrodu enthalpy.

297
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,040
I'm sorry.

298
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,280
Why are you all looking at me?

299
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,440
Is it weird?

300
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,120
Who are you looking at in this?

301
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,960
Look at yourself.

302
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,400
It's not necessarily for others.

303
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,480
Understand?

304
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,160
Sister, you...

305
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,920
You're so beautiful.

306
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,520
You're the best at talking.

307
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,840
You're so funny.

308
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,760
Madam,

309
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,800
you're in a good mood today.

310
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,360
Today is the happiest day of my life.

311
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,240
Because I finally found my sister.

312
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,360
It's true.

313
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,320
The wish of the reporter of Man's World

314
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,280
will be lost if the power of Qi is weakened.

315
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,400
So,

316
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,680
the next step is to solve Mosheng Sea.

317
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,680
No hurry.

318
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,400
His death is not the purpose.

319
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,000
The purpose is to clear up our family.

320
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,960
Let's go eat first.

321
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,560
I don't want to eat the food he cooked.

322
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,040
You have the guts to say it again.

323
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,080
It's your honor to eat the food I cooked.

324
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:36,800
You...

325
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,520
All right, stop arguing.

326
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,760
I'm in a good mood today.

327
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,800
I'm in a good mood today.

328
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,000
I'll cook for you.

329
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,600
Kai, can you cook?

330
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,440
Of course.

331
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,720
All these years,

332
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,000
I've been living on my own hands.

333
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,240
What do you want to eat?

334
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,480
Lan Yuan Dumplings and Li's Noodles.

335
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,760
Let's eat dumplings today.

336
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,320
Okay.

337
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,960
I'm going to the hospital.

338
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,400
I'll be there in a minute.

339
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,480
I'll be there in a minute.

340
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,440
I'll be there in a minute.

341
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,600
I'll be there in a minute.

342
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,600
I'll be there in a minute.

343
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,760
I'll be there in a minute.

344
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,920
I'll be there in a minute.

345
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,080
I'll be there in a minute.

346
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,240
I'll be there in a minute.

347
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,400
I'll be there in a minute.

348
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,560
I'll be there in a minute.

349
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,720
I'll be there in a minute.

350
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,880
I'll be there in a minute.

351
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,040
I'll be there in a minute.

352
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
I'll be there in a minute.

353
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,360
I'll be there in a minute.

354
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,520
I'll be there in a minute.

355
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,680
I'll be there in a minute.

356
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,840
I'll be there in a minute.

357
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'll be there in a minute.

358
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,160
I'll be there in a minute.
