00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
My Little Princess

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Episode 18

3
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,400
What are you doing?

4
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,040
Sister Li Li brought me into the illusion.

5
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,400
I saw some scenes from the past.

6
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,560
I can't tell if it's a dream or real.

7
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,640
That must be a special yin-yang tree from the Fox Clan.

8
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,160
I don't think so.

9
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,120
What did you see?

10
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,960
You, Chong Ming,

11
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,880
and the Black Robe Man

12
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,960
did things behind my back.

13
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,440
And...

14
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:13,880
Ming Kai.

15
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,120
Anyway, I didn't do anything to you.

16
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,680
You did a lot.

17
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,080
I didn't?

18
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,960
You were the one who took the initiative every time.

19
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,560
What did I take the initiative for?

20
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,960
You were the one who took the initiative.

21
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,680
I saved you when you were injured.

22
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,960
I saved you with all my heart.

23
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,480
I didn't take advantage of you.

24
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,520
You just don't like me.

25
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,560
I'm a gentleman and a talent.

26
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,360
If I were someone else, I would have been a Buddha.

27
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
But I'm not a good person.

28
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,200
I don't dislike you.

29
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,560
Thank you

30
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,800
for saving me over and over again.

31
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,800
Thank you for liking me.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,320
Thank you for being with me,

33
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,400
Ouyang.

34
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,120
Are you poisoned or being poisoned?

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I don't have any power now.

36
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,120
I can't stand this anymore.

37
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,920
Come on.

38
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,520
You gave me a kiss

39
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,000
in the same atmosphere last time.

40
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm a little scared now.

41
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,600
I'm a little excited.

42
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,800
I want to have a dream.

43
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:45,920
It hurts.

44
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,600
It's not a dream.

45
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,000
The hatred between us

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,400
illuminates the night.

47
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,600
I want to be in your eyes.

48
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,400
Because after the night...

49
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,160
Sister.

50
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,160
Sister.

51
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,800
What's wrong?

52
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,120
Captain Wu is dead.

53
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,640
The body is in the yard.

54
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,720
The reporter is on his way.

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,680
He's dead.

56
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,800
He's so small.

57
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,600
He's not dead.

58
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
It's not a big deal.

59
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,400
It's not a big deal.

60
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,600
He's out.

61
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,200
Hurry up.

62
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,200
He's out.

63
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
President Shan Yushu.

64
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,200
Why did the body of

65
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,800
Director Wu appear at your door?

66
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,200
I don't know.

67
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,600
Director Wu just sealed the trade

68
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,000
and investigated the smuggling case.

69
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,200
Do you think

70
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,000
Director Wu's death

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,200
has anything to do with the previous case?

72
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:44,800
Sorry.

73
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,000
I don't know.

74
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,200
President Shan.

75
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,400
President Shan.

76
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,400
President Shan.

77
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,600
President Shan.

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,200
President Shan.

79
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,800
Please let me go.

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,400
Let the people of the police station

81
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,800
and the whole city go.

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,600
I...

83
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,400
I, Meng Shanhai,

84
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,400
bow to you.

85
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,800
I bow to you,

86
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,400
President Shan.

87
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,200
Meng Shanhai.

88
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,400
What are you doing?

89
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,200
How does Director Wu's death have anything to do with me?

90
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,000
I admit it.

91
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,400
I admit that I had a private talk with your father

92
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,200
about the Hu family.

93
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:10,600
I...

94
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,600
I did it for the sake of the economy of Mocheng.

95
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,600
And I got the approval of Director Wu.

96
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,000
But...

97
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,400
Your father didn't kill me.

98
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,000
The monster you killed...

99
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
No.

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,200
It's them.

101
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,600
Tell them

102
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,000
not to kill innocent people in the city.

103
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,800
Tell Mo Shanhai to die for his crime.

104
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,000
Shang Yun said there was a monster under his hand.

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,200
There's a monster under his hand?

106
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,000
Yes.

107
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,400
A monster.

108
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,200
Meng Shanhai.

109
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,600
Yes.

110
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,000
Stop talking nonsense here.

111
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,000
President Shan.

112
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,600
President Shan.

113
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,200
I, Mo Shanhai,

114
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,800
will die for my crime.

115
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
President Mo Shanhai.

116
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Don't do anything stupid.

117
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,800
Let me die.

118
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,800
Let me die.

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,400
Let me live in peace.

120
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,400
Let me die.

121
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,800
Put the knife down.

122
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,000
Good revenge is good.

123
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Evil is evil.

124
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
According to my observation,

125
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
President Shan has been killed by the monster.

126
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,800
Let me help President Shan

127
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,400
get out of the sea.

128
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,400
Help.

129
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,600
Help.

130
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,800
Help.

131
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,800
Help.

132
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,800
Help.

133
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,000
Mo Shanhai, what do you want?

134
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,000
He knows he can't take us down.

135
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,400
He wants to get out of the sea

136
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,800
and win the war.

137
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
Then,

138
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,800
what should we do?

139
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,000
The situation is not bad enough.

140
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm afraid Mo Shanhai will have a backup plan.

141
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
The civil war.

142
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,200
What?

143
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,600
Mo Shanhai killed people in the middle of the war.

144
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
No one can save him.

145
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,200
I think it's the same now.

146
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,800
We don't have much power.

147
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
If so,

148
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
it's very unfavorable for us.

149
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,200
Then,

150
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,000
we can only hide

151
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,600
and find another chance to clear it.

152
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,200
No.

153
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,400
Once we hide,

154
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,400
Mo Shanhai will be more fearless.

155
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,600
Then,

156
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,200
we can't make it clear how many mouths are there.

157
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,600
What should we do?

158
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,000
We can only use poison to poison.

159
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,200
We can only use lies to make medicine.

160
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,200
Help.

161
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,000
Help.

162
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,200
Help.

163
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
Help.

164
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,800
Let's go.

165
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
He killed people.

166
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,800
Let's go.

167
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
Be careful.

168
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,000
Be careful.

169
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Help.

170
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,000
No.

171
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
Don't go.

172
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Help.

173
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
The man in black is my brother, Yao Feng.

174
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,400
Do you want to know my story?

175
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,400
He is a poor man.

176
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,600
He made too many mistakes.

177
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,800
It's said

178
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,000
you used magic to control innocent people

179
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,200
and let them hurt each other.

180
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,800
It should be the Crescent Thread.

181
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,600
Yao Feng poisoned them for the dragon pearl.

182
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,400
The same as my poison?

183
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,600
This poison

184
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,600
is really incurable.

185
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,200
Not yet.

186
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,200
Once poisoned,

187
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,200
the Crescent Thread will be in the body and blood for a long time.

188
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,000
It can't be like the fox

189
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,800
that can suppress it temporarily.

190
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,200
I've tried my best to save people.

191
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,000
But my magic power is running out.

192
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,400
Too many people.

193
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,800
I'm afraid

194
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
this is the trap of Mo Shenhai and Yao Feng.

195
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,600
Let them save people,

196
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
use their magic power

197
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
and then deal with them.

198
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,400
Why are you afraid of them?

199
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,200
I'll drink your blood

200
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,200
and kill them.

201
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,200
Then you can find a way to lock me up.

202
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,600
Then we can find the fox to find a way.

203
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,000
What method does Sister Li Li use?

204
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,800
She uses her own demon aura

205
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,200
to enter your body

206
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,200
and suppress the poison of Crescent Thread

207
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,200
with the power of the dragon pearl.

208
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,800
The main reason is that Hu Li Li is not here.

209
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Where can we find her?

210
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,600
It's useless to find Hu Li Li now.

211
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,600
There is only one dragon pearl

212
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,400
in Madam's body.

213
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,800
It can't save others.

214
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I shouldn't have

215
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,600
told Mo Shenhai about the dragon pearl

216
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,200
and made her so crazy.

217
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,200
You can't tell her.

218
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,200
She will know.

219
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,600
She is just a pawn of Yao Feng.

220
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Those who are poisoned

221
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,600
are like the wind of the world.

222
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,400
My men are hurt and confused.

223
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,600
If this continues,

224
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,400
not only will the people be badly injured,

225
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,400
Sister, even if you jump into the Yellow River,

226
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,200
you can't get up.

227
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
I'm not afraid of you.

228
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,400
I'm just worried about you.

229
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
I'm afraid of you.

230
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm afraid of you.

231
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
I'm afraid of you.

232
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,800
I'm afraid of you.

233
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
I'm afraid of you.

234
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,800
I'm afraid of you.

235
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,600
So we can't wait any longer.

236
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What are you going to do?

237
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,400
I want you to trust me completely

238
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
and cooperate with me.

239
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,200
Shao Yingshu, come out with me.

240
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,600
What the hell did you do?

241
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,000
Give me back my life.

242
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,200
Come out.

243
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm sorry.

244
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,400
We are not allowed to stay here.

245
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
If you order us,

246
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,600
we will be punished.

247
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:39,600
Come out.

248
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,800
Come out.

249
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,400
Listen to me, everyone.

250
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,200
Come out.

251
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Listen to me, everyone.

252
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
I, Mo Shenghai,

253
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,000
know I'm not a selfless and great man.

254
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,800
But I and the Chamber of Commerce

255
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,200
have been taken back by Mo Cheng.

256
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,400
He, Shao Yingshu,

257
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,600
colluded with demons for personal gain

258
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,800
and messed up Mo Cheng.

259
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,600
Today,

260
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
even if I die,

261
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
I will get justice for the people.

262
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,600
Good.

263
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,400
If he is not willing to come out,

264
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,400
we will burn him down.

265
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:30,200
Burn him down.

266
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,400
Mo Shenghai,

267
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,400
you are so crazy to get the dragon pearl.

268
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,200
You even poisoned it.

269
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,200
You are talking nonsense.

270
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
You killed people.

271
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,200
Many of the villagers saw it with their own eyes.

272
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You still want to lie?

273
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,200
Yes.

274
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,400
They are going to save you.

275
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,400
Otherwise, your family would have died.

276
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Shao Yingshu,

277
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
I advise you to

278
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,200
hurry up and cast the spell.

279
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,000
Otherwise,

280
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,400
we will be rude to you.

281
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,800
Fellow villagers,

282
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,400
I'm not a demon.

283
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,200
But I do have a way

284
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,400
to save everyone.

285
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,600
Please follow me.

286
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,600
Shao Yingshu,

287
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
what the hell are you doing?

288
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,200
If I'm playing a trick,

289
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,200
you can kill me or kill me.

290
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,200
Now,

291
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,000
please bring your family

292
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,800
to follow me.

293
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,200
Shao Yingshu,

294
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,200
what the hell are you doing?

295
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,200
Fellow villagers,

296
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,800
I, Shao Yingshu,

297
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,600
grew up in Mo City.

298
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,800
We all know

299
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,800
what kind of person I am.

300
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,600
This morning,

301
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,000
my two bodyguards

302
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,800
did show some special abilities.

303
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,600
But they are definitely not demons.

304
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,800
Shan,

305
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,600
don't make a big deal out of it.

306
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,400
Tell me,

307
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,600
can you cure this poison?

308
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,800
I can.

309
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,800
I can.

310
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,800
I can.

311
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,400
Tell me,

312
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,600
can you cure this poison?

313
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,600
You changed your words again.

314
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,400
How do you know

315
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,600
that you are poisoned?

316
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,400
Didn't you just say

317
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,800
I lost my magic?

318
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,800
Whether it's a poison or a magic,

319
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,600
you just said you can't cure it.

320
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,400
Fellow villagers,

321
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,800
you are poisoned

322
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
by a kind of poison called Cure-the-Curse.

323
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,000
I can't cure this poison.

324
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,360
But I can

325
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,400
suck it into my body.

326
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,200
Who will go first?

327
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,400
Please enter the town.

328
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,600
What if I can't?

329
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,000
My husband is their savior.

330
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,800
Really?

331
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,000
You can't trust them.

332
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,600
Yes.

333
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,400
Yes.

334
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,000
How can I trust them?

335
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,800
They are the reason.

336
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,400
Your family is already like this.

337
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,000
What else is worse?

338
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,200
I was the bodyguard of my wife's subordinate

339
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,400
who saved my husband's life.

340
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
I believe you.

341
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,200
Thank you.

342
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,200
What happened?

343
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,800
Honey.

344
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,800
My dear,

345
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,200
you finally woke up.

346
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,400
It's great.

347
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,600
Thank you for coming back.

348
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,600
What happened to him?

349
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,400
He is alive.

350
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,400
He is alive.

351
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,400
He is alive.

352
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
He is really alive.

353
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,400
Yes.

354
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,800
It's great.

355
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,800
He is alive.

356
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,800
He is alive.

357
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,800
He is alive.

358
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,800
Honey.

359
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,800
Don't be anxious.

360
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Come one by one.

361
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Okay.

362
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,600
Thank you, honey.

363
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,600
Thank you.

364
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,200
The villagers have left safely.

365
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,600
I've also solved the killer.

366
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,600
Search again.

367
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,800
Don't let anyone know.

368
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,400
Mo Shen Han.

369
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,400
Your conspiracy has been all solved by us.

370
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,400
I'm not afraid of you.

371
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
I'm not afraid of you.

372
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,400
I'm not afraid of you.

373
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,400
I'm not afraid of you.

374
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,800
Your conspiracy has been all solved by us.

375
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,200
You are now

376
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,200
hopeless.

377
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,400
Sha Yun Shu.

378
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,800
You are very powerful.

379
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200
I'm not afraid of death.

380
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,800
This is

381
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,200
very similar to your father.

382
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,000
You still dare to mention my father?

383
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,200
He is a successful businessman

384
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,000
and a great father.

385
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,400
But he is not a good person.

386
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,800
What are you talking about?

387
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,200
Do you know what your father

388
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:11,400
did before he became Mo Cheng's businessman?

389
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,400
A bandit.

390
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,800
He is a bandit outside Mo Cheng.

391
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,400
He specifically robbed women's money.

392
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,400
What do you mean?

393
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,800
When I was fifteen years old,

394
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,400
I followed my father to the capital

395
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,600
and passed by Mo Cheng.

396
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
Every bandit was robbed.

397
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,000
My father was not a bandit.

398
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,200
Your father was a bandit.

399
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,800
He was a businessman

400
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,600
on behalf of my father.

401
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
A bandit businessman.

402
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,200
He used the identity of our family,

403
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,200
the money and the connections of our family.

404
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
Impossible.

405
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
This is impossible.

406
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
And that guy named Hu.

407
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,000
He is not a good person.

408
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,600
Why did he pretend to be a kind person?

409
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,000
He is a fox with a human skin.

410
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
He knew your father's identity.

411
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,200
But he chose Chen Mo for the benefit.

412
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,600
Until I used more interests

413
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,400
to move him.

414
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,800
The desire of revenge.

415
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,800
Madam, sorry.

416
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,600
Is it strong?

417
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,400
In order to get your father's trust,

418
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,000
I secretly hid my name.

419
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,600
I started from the hard work of the dock

420
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,600
until I established Wanhuang Chamber of Commerce.

421
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,600
It's not my intention to steal the smuggling land and the opium.

422
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,400
That's your father's idea.

423
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,400
Because he wants to make more money

424
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,200
and take you away from Mo Cheng.

425
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,400
How is that possible?

426
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,600
If it were you,

427
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,600
would you let your enemy

428
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,000
leave so smoothly?

429
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
What's wrong?

430
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,000
The defense line in your heart

431
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,200
collapsed?

432
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,800
Sister.

433
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,000
Don't be fooled by him.

434
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,800
But

435
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,800
I didn't see you two

436
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,400
fight against each other.

437
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,600
Your conspiracy with the black-clad man

438
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,600
is a lie.

439
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,400
You won't succeed.

440
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
Do you really think

441
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,200
the reason why Ao Feng poisoned you

442
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,200
is to consume

443
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,400
your two bodyguards' powers?

444
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,600
You're wrong.

445
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
He calculated that you would

446
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,800
leave in peace.

447
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,800
When the dragon pearl

448
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,400
comes out to save people,

449
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,600
it's the weakest time

450
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,200
for the dragon to die.

451
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,400
Sister, be careful.

452
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,800
Look.

453
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,200
I'm sorry.

454
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,400
I'm sorry.

455
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,600
I'm sorry.

456
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm sorry.

457
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,200
I'm sorry.

458
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,600
I'm sorry.

459
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm sorry.

460
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,200
I'm sorry.

461
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,600
I'm sorry.

462
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,000
I'm sorry.

463
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,400
I'm sorry.

464
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,800
I'm sorry.

465
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,200
I'm sorry.

466
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,800
I'm sorry.

467
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,200
I'm sorry.

468
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,600
I'm sorry.

469
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,200
I'm sorry.

470
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,800
I'm sorry.

471
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,200
I'm sorry.

472
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,800
I'm sorry.

473
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,200
I'm sorry.

474
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,400
I'm sorry.

475
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,800
I'm sorry.

476
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,200
I'm sorry.

477
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,800
I'm sorry.

478
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,200
I'm sorry.

479
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,800
I'm sorry.

480
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,400
I'm sorry.

481
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,800
I'm sorry.

482
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,200
I'm sorry.

483
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,600
I'm sorry.

484
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm sorry.

485
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,400
I'm sorry.

486
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,800
I'm sorry.

487
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,400
I'm sorry.

488
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,800
I'm sorry.

489
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,400
I'm sorry.

490
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm sorry.

491
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,600
I'm sorry.

492
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,200
I'm sorry.

493
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,800
I'm sorry.
