00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
My Dear Brothers

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You remember it now?

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Zhang Mingkai, what magic did you use again?

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This is not a magic.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What you see in the Longzhi Qi is real.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What are you doing all this for?

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I don't know why either.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
At first, I thought you were like me when I was young.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I felt sorry for you.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Then I was too lonely.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I wanted to turn you into another me.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
To see if you could take revenge.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
After that, I found that

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I cared more about you than the Longzhu.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I liked you.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But my poison was hard to control.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
In order not to hurt you,

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I chose to leave you.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yurou,

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
can we forget everything and be together forever?

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I really like you.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Give me a chance.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This is the first time I want to be with someone like this.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What about the Longzhu?

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Don't you want it?

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I could have taken it out after you were dead.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But then,

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Ao Jun and Chongming appeared again.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
They ruined your plan.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yes.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What are you laughing at?

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I laugh at you are pitiful,

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
pitiful,

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
and ridiculous.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I didn't have the right to blame you.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Because we are the same.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You are a human being.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
In order to take revenge, you sacrificed everything.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You didn't do it by yourself.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But you neglected what you really had.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You were pitiful.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Your mother was hurt.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Now you have to sacrifice your only beloved brother.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's sad.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You are so precious.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You can't love anyone,

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
but you can't let go of your desire.

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's pitiful.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You have been with me for a long time.

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You have done so much.

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But I don't love you.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's pitiful.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You see.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Stop it.

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's not too late.

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Enough.

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You are the same as them.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But I can't wait any longer.

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Sister Yuzi.

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I can't get it.

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
No one else wants to get it.

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Let me go.

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Let me go.

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Let me go.

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Let me go.

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Zhao Mingkai.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Come out.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Let my sister go.

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Hao Feng.

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Come out and pick a fight if you can.

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What's the skill to kidnap a woman?

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You dare to come again?

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Who died today is not sure.

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The last one was so stubborn.

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
He has been locked up by my relationship.

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Come.

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Stop him.

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Let's split up.

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You go find your sister.

81
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'll hold Zhao Mingkai.

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
OK.

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Be careful.

84
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You go find your sister.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yuan Shu.

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yuan Shu.

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Our love is over.

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Goodbye.

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Master.

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Goodbye.

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Mingkai.

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Haojun.

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Hurry.

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Hurry.

95
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Haojun.

96
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Haojun.

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Haojun.

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Haojun, are you OK?

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Wake up.

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Haojun.

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
How is he?

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
No heartbeat.

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Then feed him with blood.

104
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
No.

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I have a death in my blood.

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
When?

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's better than dying.

108
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'll find a fox to find a way.

109
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Haojun.

110
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm so tired.

111
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Are you crazy?

112
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
When did you pretend to be dead?

113
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Who?

114
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
That guy Oufeng tortured me to death.

115
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I almost died.

116
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I almost died.

117
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I almost died.

118
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I almost died.

119
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I almost died.

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I almost died.

121
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I almost died.

122
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I almost died.

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I almost died.

124
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I almost died.

125
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I almost died.

126
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I almost died.

127
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Right.

128
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Where is Oufeng?

129
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Did you let him run away?

130
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He's dead.

131
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I killed him.

132
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Don't think too much.

133
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
He deserves it.

134
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Let's go.

135
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Haojun.

136
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Are you sure you won't come personally?

137
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Do you hate him?

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's not about hating him.

139
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What about you?

140
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I raised Oufeng with my own hands.

141
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's a pity that I didn't give him enough love

142
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
to ease his hatred.

143
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm ashamed.

144
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I don't hate him.

145
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I don't hate him.

146
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I don't hate him.

147
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I don't hate him.

148
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I don't hate him.

149
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
What's your plan?

150
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I don't know.

151
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Mo Shan died.

152
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
My parents are all dead.

153
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Zhenxuan can die.

154
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I feel confused.

155
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm here.

156
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
What are you thinking about?

157
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,840
I'm sorry.

158
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,480
Can we really be together?

159
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,680
If you're worried about the poison,

160
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,440
I'll ask Fox Li for help.

161
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,680
A'quan,

162
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,600
you have to know

163
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,560
I'll die,

164
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,720
but you won't.

165
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,520
I've always had a little brother

166
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,760
to be your wife, okay?

167
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,520
And,

168
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,200
Yingshu,

169
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,120
I'll change.

170
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,440
Cherish the present

171
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,120
and be happy.

172
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,060
A'quan.

173
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,200
You guys go first.

174
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,480
I think I'll stay here alone.

175
00:09:46,000 --> 00:10:03,060
The

176
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,160
Brother Chongming,

177
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,640
Which one is the best today?

178
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:09,920
Both are good.

179
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:10,920
No.

180
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,840
You have to choose the best.

181
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,000
Good.

182
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,980
So,

183
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,680
My sister is so good.

184
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,200
She doesn't need my help.

185
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,520
Besides, I'm not good at it.

186
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,000
I just want to live a good life with you.

187
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,000
We'll open a shop.

188
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,280
We'll do what we want.

189
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,600
What do you think?

190
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,520
You don't like me, right?

191
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,520
No.

192
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,480
I like you.

193
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,200
What's your reason?

194
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,840
What's wrong?

195
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,800
I'm afraid I'm running out of time.

196
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,960
I can't stay with you every day.

197
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,600
What do you mean?

198
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,320
Make it clear.

199
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,120
You've been alive for hundreds of years.

200
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,320
We can live for hundreds of years.

201
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,280
But it's not infinite life.

202
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,200
I took the Dragon Bead

203
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,520
to become a dragon

204
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,320
and avoid the limit of life.

205
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,120
But I was sealed by the Dragon Bead

206
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,000
and avoided the Heaven's End.

207
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,080
Now the Dragon Qi is released.

208
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,560
I've already felt my life is running out.

209
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,720
I'm afraid it won't be long.

210
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,320
But I'm happy every moment

211
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,480
with you.

212
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,720
I'm satisfied with the present.

213
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,120
You'll find a way.

214
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,000
Look here.

215
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,480
Goku.

216
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,840
Don't be upset.

217
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,480
Let's go on.

218
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,200
We can win.

219
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,440
If you credit me with your life

220
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,080
before the Antesdes humanity comes back,

221
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,120
you'd be better off

222
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,360
being hit by thunder, right?

223
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,920
I'm sorry.

224
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,600
Brother,

225
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,040
are you going to break the contract?

226
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,760
We've made a promise.

227
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,480
I promised you to give up the Dragon Bead

228
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,960
and not hurt Shan Yushu.

229
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,440
But you

230
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,440
dare to use Qu Di to return it?

231
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,240
Ao Feng,

232
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,920
the blood is not fresh.

233
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,160
It means you don't want to keep your promise.

234
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,360
I'll trap you

235
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,880
in my body forever.

236
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,040
Brother,

237
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,160
your primordial spirit will be swallowed by me soon.

238
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,000
It won't take long.

239
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,760
Shan Yushu is mine.

240
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,040
The Dragon Bead is also mine.

241
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,880
Thank you.

242
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,480
It's late.

243
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,400
What are you doing here?

244
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,760
Can you let me in?

245
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,760
It's cold outside.

246
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,200
Who told you to wear so little?

247
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,240
Come in.

248
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,160
Come in.

249
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,320
Why are you here so late?

250
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,640
What do you think?

251
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,680
Don't come to disturb me.

252
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,360
Be careful of the hair loss.

253
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,840
You'll be in trouble.

254
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,160
Don't you have a saying?

255
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,080
It's called to die under the flower.

256
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,160
It's so weird.

257
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,800
Can you stop saying that?

258
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,920
We just escaped from the sword.

259
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,040
I just want to live well now.

260
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:16,920
Okay.

261
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,160
Do you want to kill me again?

262
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,400
No.

263
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,840
What are you laughing at?

264
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,800
We are both poisoned.

265
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,840
Love will die.

266
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,160
I'm not as good as dead.

267
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,520
Long'er,

268
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,160
you are not right.

269
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,400
Why are you so rude?

270
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,040
You should say

271
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,520
I love you because of your luck.

272
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,040
It's the virtue of the Mo family.

273
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,600
In this world,

274
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,760
only you can kill me.

275
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,520
I'm happy to die in your arms.

276
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,280
Are you hiding something from me?

277
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,800
technology

278
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,320
function

279
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,520
protection

280
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,400
radio

281
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,640
Look at this.

282
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,240
Legend.

283
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,760
Long'er,

284
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,160
I haven't got ready.

285
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,680
All good things and

286
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,080
when you were sick,

287
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,880
I waited for you.

288
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,800
Yu Zirou.

289
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,720
You're not Ao Jue.

290
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,120
Qianqian, what's going on?

291
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,760
Ao Jue, there's something wrong.

292
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,720
Ao Jue, what's wrong with you?

293
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,840
How did you find out?

294
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,760
Ao Jue never taught me that.

295
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,800
He was afraid that I would remember the past

296
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,560
and be sad.

297
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,440
You really don't have a chance,

298
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,640
Yu Zirou?

299
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Zhang Mingkai.

300
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,720
The Dragon Lord is mine.

301
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,000
It seems that you're about to die.

302
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,280
Your life and magic power are both on the line.

303
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,440
So,

304
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,560
you deliberately set up a trap to kill you

305
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,200
and help you complete your life.

306
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,800
Lord Chengming is smart.

307
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,200
But he's a bit slow.

308
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,680
What did you do?

309
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,560
My good brother

310
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,720
was still so hard-working back then.

311
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,200
He was not like the other masters.

312
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,800
He was so ruthless.

313
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,040
I only used a little of his guilt.

314
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,520
But he gave in to your love.

315
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,200
Mingkai, wake up.

316
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,440
Your brother is the only one who loves you.

317
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,360
Are you going to kill him too?

318
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,120
I want to be one with my brother.

319
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,320
We won't be separated anymore.

320
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,720
The Dragon Lord is mine.

321
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,280
You're mine too.

322
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,680
Look at this.

323
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,040
I'll revenge for those bad things

324
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,280
when I return to Shanghai.

325
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,320
Dare not enjoy a chance to win My Holy Sepulchre?

326
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:58,120
The Demon Woman heights that barricade my experience.

327
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:04,580
Because the

328
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,620
love you want to cross the

329
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,380
river with you

330
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,220
I don't want to end the

331
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,500
because the

332
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,820
love you want to cross the

333
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,180
river with you

334
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:25,900
I don't want to end the

335
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,760
because the

336
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:33,360
love you want to cross the

337
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,200
river with you

338
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,480
After a thousand years

339
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,840
love you cross the river with you

340
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,500
I don't want to end the

341
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,500
because the

342
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,700
love you want to cross the

343
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,980
river with you

344
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:10,940
After a thousand years

345
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,740
I won't end the

346
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,640
because the

347
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,680
love you want to cross the
