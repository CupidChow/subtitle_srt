You know how it is.

78

I feel uneasy staying home by myself.

82
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,583
Plus, Arman's getting busier at work.

83
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,583
You left your job way too quickly.

84
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,750
It was his idea.

85
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:55,500
He didn't want me to feel tired
or come home late.

86
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,791
After all, I'm pregnant.

00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:56,791
Did you just come in?

184
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,333
Yeah.

185
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,916
- [gasping]
- What's the matter?

186
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:05,291
Let's pray together.
I don't want it to happen again.

187
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,708
What are you talking about?

188
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,541
Nothing's ever happened in here.

[ominous music]

190
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,625
Just in case, dear.

191
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:15,875
Okay?

192
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:20,583

What's wrong?

215
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,458
- Calm down.

00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,375
Dear.

223
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:11,041
Uncle said he wants to help
with our four-month pregnancy prayer.

224
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,000
Oh?

225
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:13,750
That's great.

226
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,000
What do you think, Mom?

227
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,791
Do we have to invite all the neighbors?

228
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,416
I hardly know any of them.

229
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,250
[Arman] That's the point.

230
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,083
It's so everyone gets to know…

231
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,250
Salma,

232
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,541
and your first grandchild.

233
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:36,625
Right?

[slow instrumental piano]

235
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,750

[Kyai] In the name of God.

237
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:49,416
Peace be upon you,
and God's mercy and blessings.

[crowd] And upon you peace,
and God's mercy and blessings.

On this day, we come together
in this house, blessed by God,

240
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:03,500
to offer prayers and gratitude…

241
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,250
It's surprising that Mrs. Lastri
is hosting a prayer session.

242
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,000
- Maybe she's repented.
- Hush!

243
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,333
…Salma's four-month pregnancy.

244
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:15,083
May she be granted health, strength,

245
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:18,458
and give birth to pious children.

246
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,208
[crowd] Amen.

247
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,666
And for that, let's…

248
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:25,541
Mrs. Lastri's not feeling well.
I must tend to her.

249
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,375
Okay, then.

250
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,333
Thank you.

251
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:34,708

Are you going back to the boarding school?

267
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,750
Yes, I'm going back.

268
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,458
Next time you come over, bring Arman too.

269
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:10,916
Okay, Arman?

270
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,416
God willing, Kyai.

271
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,000
Of course, Kyai.

272
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,916
- Please pray for us.
- Yes.

273
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,208
[Arman] I'll go help my mom out.

274
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,208
[Salma] Okay.

275
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:24,833
Salma.

Welcome to our community.

00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,625
Thank you.

You are…?

279
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,458
Call me Diah.

280
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,125
Okay.

281
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,000
Diah.

282
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,708
Thanks for coming.

283
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,666
You're welcome. Be careful here, okay?

284
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,583
Take good care of your baby,
don't tire yourself out,

285
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,250
and ease your mind.

286
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:49,625
God willing.

287
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,708
Is your mother okay?

288
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,500
The rain got to her stuff.

289
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,333
It's okay.

290
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:01,541
It's been taken care of.

291
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,125
[Lastri] Don't bother arranging
a gathering next time.

292
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,208
My furniture got spoiled.

[unsettling music]

294
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,416
Told you so.

295
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,458
That's just how the elderly are.

296
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,541
I'm going back, Salma.

297
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,541
- Okay.
- All right.

298
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,000
- See you.
- Bye.

299
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,083
Is that for Arman?

300
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:39,208
Yes, Mom.

301
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,833
That's strange.
He likes boiled dishes now?

302
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:46,333
I thought he preferred rawon
or chicken feet soup?

303
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,916
He does, but he needs to cut back on it.

304
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,416
I have to watch his cholesterol level.

305
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,125
[Lastri] So controlling for a newlywed.

306
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,000
Even I never did that.

307
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:02,916
Excuse me?

308
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,708
Why did Sumi buy wilted petai?

309
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,166
Wasn't there anything fresher?

310
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,083
Oh.

311
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,875
What do you want to make? I can help.

312
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:16,250
Braised chili petai
with liver and gizzard.

313
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,291
Arman would love it.

314
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,875
Yes, you're right.

315
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,458
Let me help you.

316
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:32,333
But why bother cooking
if you're not letting him have offal?

317
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,291
- [woman] Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

318
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,875
- Hello, Mrs. Salma.
- Hello.

319
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,333
- Hello.
- Hello.

320
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,291
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

321
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:55,875
[exhales]

322
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:00,875
- [woman chuckles] Okay, bye, babe.
- [Arman] Bye.

323
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:05,833
[unsettling music]

324
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:29,041
[Arman] With such a revision,
I must reevaluate the design

325
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,041
since it involves the structure.

326
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,541
Even the smallest error

327
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,541
could pose risks to potential users.

328
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,708
How about this?

329
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:41,958
What if I start with a few
3D renderings first?

330
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,291
We could always have
another meeting later to discuss…

331
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:48,625
He's a nutjob.

332
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,875
I'll set up a meeting
with the engineering team.

333
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,625
- Please do.
- Okay.

334
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:54,875
Salma.

335
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,333
[whispering] We'll catch up later.

336
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,041
Arman.

337
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,500
- Dear.
- Hi.

338
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,000
[hums]

339
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:10,416
Why did you bring the food yourself?

340
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,666
You could've just dropped it off
or had it sent over.

341
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:16,291
You'd rather meet a courier than me?

342
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:18,500
It depends.

343
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:20,250
Only if you're the courier.

344
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:21,666
- [chuckles]
- As if!

345
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,083
- Here.
- What is it?

346
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,791
[exclaims softly] Can I open it?

347
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:28,916
[Salma] Mm-hmm.

348
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:32,666
[chuckles]

349
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,083
Wait.

350
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:41,125
It seems a little self-contradicting.

351
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:43,208
Yeah.

352
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:44,875
Your mom made it.

353
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:47,083
I didn't want to waste it.

354
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:50,041
If we'd waited for you,
it would have gotten cold.

355
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:55,500
I already know which dish
I'll finish first.

356
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:56,458
Which is?

357
00:22:57,291 --> 00:23:00,375
Obviously, the dish with no salt and oil.

358
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:01,625
[scoffs]

359
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:02,541
[laughs]

360
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:04,500
Just kidding!

361
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,375
Don't worry, I'll finish it all.

362
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:10,666
Especially since I have a meeting tonight.

363
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:13,583
Salma.

364
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:15,791
Thanks, Indri.

365
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,166
You're welcome.

366
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,541
How's living with your in-laws?
You like it there?

367
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:24,541
There are no major problems so far.

368
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:26,291
But…?

369
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,750
But…

370
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,708
You know what, Indri?

371
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,875
I feel like Arman's mom

372
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:37,458
is keeping a secret.

373
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,125
Other than her hoarding habit?

374
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:40,083
[laughs]

375
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:41,375
Come on.

376
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:44,333
But seriously, she's got so much stuff.

377
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:45,458
- I guess so.
- What happened?

378
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:48,416
Well…

379
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,458
I just don't want any misunderstandings.

380
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:53,958
Maybe Arman's mom
was trying to say something,

381
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:56,916
but I took it differently.

382
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,291
A misunderstanding?

383
00:23:58,375 --> 00:23:59,583
Yeah.

384
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:02,291
I want to avoid any conflict,

385
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:04,083
especially over something trivial.

386
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:06,458
Don't overthink it, Salma.

387
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:09,291
You don't mean any harm, moving there.

388
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,500
Just be patient.

389
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:14,750
Once the baby is born,

390
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:17,583
you'll move to the house
Arman is building.

391
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,750
Right, Indri.

392
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:23,916
I hope everything goes smoothly
from now on.

393
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,833
I don't want to add to Arman's worries.

394
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:30,958
After all, we moved so that he
didn't have to worry about me being alone.

395
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:32,958
I'm also trying to calm Arman down.

396
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:38,791
He's been getting upset because so many
clients want to change concepts.

397
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:41,250
Indri.

398
00:24:42,458 --> 00:24:45,208
I'm sorry you have to deal with this.

399
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:47,916
It's okay.

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,958

[ominous music]

404
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:34,083
Aunty Sumi.

413

Mom.

414
00:26:45,833 --> 00:26:47,375
I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to.

415
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,625
I saw something up there.

416
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:51,833
A rat?

417
00:26:51,916 --> 00:26:53,000
No.

418
00:26:57,708 --> 00:27:00,083
I'll ask Arman to check.

419

422
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:13,250
Sorry, Mom.

423
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:18,916
Hello? You're outside?

424
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:20,916
Okay, wait.

425
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:25,833
It's fine, go ahead.

426
00:27:25,916 --> 00:27:27,750
Mom, I'll clean this up later.

427
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:28,833
Okay.

428
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,250
Gosh, Dika.

429
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:37,208
Salma.

430
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:39,875
You're here? You could've sent it by mail.

431
00:27:40,666 --> 00:27:43,083
Don't sweat it. It's near my shop.

432
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:44,583
Plus, I have some free time.

433
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:49,041
It's heavy. I'll do it.
Where should I put it?

434
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:51,125
Okay, wait.

435
00:27:52,458 --> 00:27:54,166
Aunty Sumi, I need a hand.

436
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,250
Yes, miss.

437
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:57,416
Help me, please.

438
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,166
Please take this to my office.

439
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,416
Okay.

440
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,958
Aunty, it's heavy. I can do it.

441
00:28:03,041 --> 00:28:04,958
It's okay. I'm strong, you know.

442
00:28:07,041 --> 00:28:08,166
What about this?

443
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,333
I can do it.

444
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:10,416
All right.

445
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,458
Thank you.

446
00:28:11,541 --> 00:28:13,041
- Thank you. Careful.
- Got it.

447
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,666
[clears throat]

448
00:28:17,541 --> 00:28:19,333
Salma, what happened there?

449
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:26,041
Wait. I might have something.

450
00:28:32,833 --> 00:28:33,916
Allow me.

451
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:38,791
You should be more careful.

452
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:41,416
What happened?

453
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:45,875
Just now, in my office…

454
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:47,791
Mmm?

455
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:48,791
Something…

[car horn honks]

457
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,625
It's Arman.

458
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,291
Arman, sorry my car is in the way.

459
00:28:57,375 --> 00:28:58,791
Hey, it's okay.

460
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:01,291
You're here? Where's your delivery guy?

461
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:04,541
A courier will cost extra.

462
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:07,250
I should head back.

463
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:08,625
Bye, Salma.

464
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:11,416
- Thanks, Dika.
- Sure.

465
00:29:14,541 --> 00:29:16,208
- [car horn honks]
- Take care.

466
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:20,333
- Hi, dear.
- Dear.

467
00:29:23,541 --> 00:29:25,333
He seems to care a lot about you.

468
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:28,833
I don't need the sarcasm.

469
00:29:28,916 --> 00:29:31,125
He's always been kind to me,

470
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:32,833
just helping with my business.

471
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:51,291
[Salma] Dear?

472
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:52,708
Find anything?

473
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:53,875
[Arman] Just a moment.

Oh my God.

00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:46,041
Dear, please.

486
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,041
Seriously.

[grunts]

488
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:53,250
You're such a scaredy-cat.

489
00:30:53,958 --> 00:30:56,333
I'll get some rat poison tomorrow.

490
00:30:56,416 --> 00:30:57,416
Come on.

491
00:30:58,083 --> 00:30:59,625
There's nothing up there.

492
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:01,208
Let's go.

493
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,208
Dear, you're not eating breakfast?

494
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:06,583
No, I'm good.

495
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:08,666
Then I'll bring your lunch to your office.

496
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:10,291
It's fine, dear.

497
00:31:10,958 --> 00:31:12,750
I can order food.

498
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:14,166
I'm off. Peace be upon you.

Diah.

504

- Salma.
- Hello.

505
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:45,000
Salma, I got some food from my family,

506
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:48,958
but I can't finish it all by myself.

507
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:51,291
You can have it.

508
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:53,375
Gosh, you didn't have to.

509
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,583
Thank you.

510
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:56,875
Do you like spicy food?

511
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:58,416
Please, try some.

512
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:01,000
Okay.

513
00:32:02,416 --> 00:32:03,625
In the name of God.

514
00:32:05,416 --> 00:32:07,708
[hums] It's tasty.

515
00:32:07,791 --> 00:32:10,750
My husband and I love spicy food.

516
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:13,916
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

517
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,208
Come inside.

518
00:32:15,291 --> 00:32:17,875
I only dropped by to give this to you.

519
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,958
You should come over sometime.

520
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:22,166
Where's your house?

521
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,708
It's the one in the corner,
right by the big tree.

522
00:32:24,791 --> 00:32:26,041
Oh.

523
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:27,958
Okay, God willing.

524
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:29,041
Great.

525
00:32:30,541 --> 00:32:31,541
- Aunty.
- Hmm?

526
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:35,875
Let's have this. It's from a neighbor.

527
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:39,208
We can save the one Mom cooked
for tonight.

528
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,916
Okay, then.

529
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:51,333
- Aunty Sumi.
- Yes?

530
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:55,333
Have you noticed anything strange

531
00:32:55,416 --> 00:32:56,666
while living here?

532
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,791
What do you mean?

533
00:33:01,958 --> 00:33:05,500
It's common in early pregnancy
to feel this way.

534
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:08,916
Mrs. Lastri was the same
when she was pregnant with Arman.

535
00:33:09,541 --> 00:33:13,333
If you feel uneasy or uncomfortable here,

536
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:15,125
just pray and stay close to God.

537
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:17,625
God willing, nothing will disturb you.

538
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:23,375
Aunty, please prepare a lunch box.

539
00:33:23,458 --> 00:33:24,333
I want to bring some.

Who brought this food?

546
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:35,416
It's from Diah, Mom.

547
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:38,625
Who's Diah?

548
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:40,291
Any idea, Sumi?

549
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:44,083
Our neighbor. Her house is on the corner.

552

Mom, I'm off to the boarding school
to see my uncle.

553
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:57,125
I'm leaving a meal for Arman.

554
00:34:58,708 --> 00:35:01,208
- Peace be upon you.
- And upon you peace.

555

Peace be upon you, Kyai.

560
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:30,041
And upon you peace.

561
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:35,458
I came here because
I still feel a paranormal presence.

562
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:38,541
I'm not sure if it's because I'm pregnant,

563
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:41,583
the house, or something else.

564
00:35:41,666 --> 00:35:43,541
Have you spoken to Arman about it?

565
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:46,375
I don't want to burden him more.

566
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:48,875
He's already swamped at work.

567
00:35:48,958 --> 00:35:52,166
I don't want things to go sour
between Arman and me.

568
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:56,083
Not to mention, I have this baby.

569
00:35:56,625 --> 00:36:00,541
It's common to have challenges

570
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:03,458
early in marriage.

571
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:06,291
Arman is building his career,

572
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:09,291
and you're expecting your first baby.

573
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,416
I suggest that

574
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:15,958
you should tell Arman
what's happening with you.

575
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:18,458
I know, Kyai.

576
00:36:19,125 --> 00:36:21,791
I miss my mom and dad so much.

577
00:36:22,416 --> 00:36:25,875
Maybe I would feel stronger
if they were here.

578
00:36:25,958 --> 00:36:30,541
Offer your prayers
for your deceased parents

579
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:34,333
and ask for protection from Allah SWT.

580
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:39,708
I'll help with blessed water
and prayer for it.

581
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:41,958
Okay, Kyai.

582
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:43,708
Oh, I almost forgot.

583
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:44,750

584
00:36:45,791 --> 00:36:47,416

Someone must've swapped it.

600
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:31,791
I tasted it before and it was fine.

601
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,500
It couldn't have gone bad in half a day.

602
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:38,500
But I definitely didn't swap it.
Why would I?

603
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:41,208
And neither would Sumi.

604
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:45,125
I know, but it was fine
when Aunty Sumi prepared it. Right?

605
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:47,208
[Arman] Salma, that's enough.

606
00:37:47,291 --> 00:37:50,333
Besides, no one ate it, right?
Not even Kyai.

607
00:37:50,416 --> 00:37:53,000
Yes, but I feel ashamed!

608
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:54,833
How could I serve him spoiled food?

609
00:37:54,916 --> 00:37:57,500
I'm sure someone swapped it!

610
00:37:58,208 --> 00:37:59,166

00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,125

I did.

618

What's with Salma?

619
00:38:40,791 --> 00:38:43,333

734
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:41,208
Better than stressing over it.

735
00:49:52,333 --> 00:49:54,708
Did Salma call? What happened?

736
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,833
It's fine if you don't want to talk,

737
00:49:58,916 --> 00:50:00,833
but I'm here

738
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:02,666
if you need to.

739
00:50:03,916 --> 00:50:08,458
I don't know if this is something
that happens in every marriage.

740
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:13,416
What is it?

741
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,333
[shrill hissing]

742
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:26,125
[Dika] I can come back
before Arman gets home.

743
00:50:27,166 --> 00:50:28,958
I'm good, thank you.

744
00:50:38,208 --> 00:50:39,416
You sure you're okay?

745
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:41,750
Yeah, I'm okay.

746
00:50:48,208 --> 00:50:49,375
Diah?

747
00:50:50,583 --> 00:50:51,791
[Diah] Salma.

748
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:53,916
Arman isn't home yet?

749
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,833
[Salma] He's still at work.

750
00:50:55,916 --> 00:50:59,125
It's okay. Don't take it personally.

751
00:50:59,208 --> 00:51:02,000
Don't worry if your husband's
coming home late

752
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:05,541
or isn't as attentive as usual.

753
00:51:05,625 --> 00:51:07,083
You might feel

754
00:51:08,458 --> 00:51:12,333
like you're in the way.

755
00:51:13,333 --> 00:51:14,791
You're pregnant.

756
00:51:15,291 --> 00:51:19,500
Pregnancy can make you feel
more emotional. That's normal.

757
00:51:20,291 --> 00:51:21,500
Are you married, Diah?

758
00:51:22,541 --> 00:51:23,666
[Diah] Yes.

759
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,875
My husband used to be like that.

760
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:27,958
I thought I was the problem,

761
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:30,125
but there was another woman.

762
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:36,250
[Indri] <i>Yes, Salma?</i>

763
00:51:36,333 --> 00:51:37,250
Hello, Indri.

764
00:51:38,291 --> 00:51:42,500
Is Arman and his team
working late again today?

765
00:51:43,125 --> 00:51:44,125
<i>Yeah.</i>

766
00:51:44,208 --> 00:51:45,916
<i>They're almost done for the day,</i>

767
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,375
<i>but it looks like Arman</i>
<i>will stay here for a while.</i>

768
00:51:52,625 --> 00:51:53,666
By himself?

769
00:51:55,416 --> 00:51:58,250
<i>Well, some are staying with him.</i>

770
00:51:58,333 --> 00:51:59,541
<i>What's wrong?</i>

771
00:51:59,625 --> 00:52:00,833
Oh.

772
00:52:04,333 --> 00:52:05,416
Indri.

773
00:52:06,666 --> 00:52:13,208
Does the ambassador in the pamphlet
come by often?

774
00:52:13,291 --> 00:52:14,833
<i>She never comes here.</i>

775
00:52:16,916 --> 00:52:18,875
[ominous music]

776
00:52:20,333 --> 00:52:23,041
[footsteps]

777
00:52:30,708 --> 00:52:31,541
Miss.

778
00:52:33,208 --> 00:52:34,041
Miss!

779
00:53:05,291 --> 00:53:06,291
Miss!

780
00:53:07,125 --> 00:53:08,375
Miss, wait!

781
00:53:09,166 --> 00:53:10,000
Miss!

782
00:53:10,416 --> 00:53:11,583
Miss!

783
00:53:12,666 --> 00:53:13,750
[yelps]

784
00:53:19,541 --> 00:53:20,833
[Indri] Salma.

785
00:53:20,916 --> 00:53:21,875
Salma.

786
00:53:24,416 --> 00:53:25,375
Are you okay?

787
00:53:28,583 --> 00:53:30,208
Why are you here so late?

788
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:33,000
Why are you covering this up?

789
00:53:33,958 --> 00:53:34,791
What are you saying?

790
00:53:34,875 --> 00:53:36,375
That woman!

791
00:53:36,458 --> 00:53:38,291
Why hide it from me?

792
00:53:38,375 --> 00:53:39,958
Did Arman tell you to?

793
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:43,291
I thought we were friends.

794
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:53,208
Dear.

795
00:54:01,708 --> 00:54:02,416
Arman.

796
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,208
You didn't say anything about coming here.

797
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:06,958
Who's the woman in the red dress, Arman?

798
00:54:07,708 --> 00:54:08,583
What woman?

799
00:54:08,666 --> 00:54:10,416
The one who just left your room!

800
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:13,666
Arman!

801
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:17,125
Why did you never tell me
about that woman?

802
00:54:17,208 --> 00:54:18,333
She's the one, right?

803
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,083
[sighs]

804
00:54:23,166 --> 00:54:24,250
Salma.

805
00:54:24,333 --> 00:54:27,500
You're not making any sense.

806
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:29,666
You said the house collapsed.

807
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:31,875
You're not comfortable
after we moved to Mom's house.

808
00:54:32,958 --> 00:54:35,083
Renting a house was a mistake.
What do you want--

809
00:54:35,166 --> 00:54:36,875
Arman, that's enough!

810
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:39,041
Don't change the topic.

811
00:54:40,375 --> 00:54:43,583
She's the one you called last night,
isn't she?

812
00:54:43,666 --> 00:54:46,000
- I don't know what…
- I saw it myself!

813
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:50,333
Let's talk in the car.

814
00:54:56,375 --> 00:55:00,083
Do you want us to move,
or should I quit my job?

815
00:55:00,708 --> 00:55:01,708
No, Arman.

816
00:55:01,791 --> 00:55:02,916
So what do you want?

817
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,875
I want you to listen,

818
00:55:05,875 --> 00:55:07,000
and believe me.

819
00:55:07,083 --> 00:55:08,375
I'm listening right now!

820
00:55:09,291 --> 00:55:12,375
That's why I'm asking you
what I should do!

821
00:55:12,458 --> 00:55:14,583
I just want you to stick around,

822
00:55:14,666 --> 00:55:17,291
stop making excuses,
and not go after another woman--

823
00:55:17,375 --> 00:55:18,458
Who?

824
00:55:18,875 --> 00:55:19,875
What woman?

825
00:55:19,958 --> 00:55:21,666
I told you there's no one!

826
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:23,083
[car horn blaring]

827
00:55:23,916 --> 00:55:25,041
[gasps]

828
00:55:28,666 --> 00:55:29,666
[whimpers]

829
00:55:46,875 --> 00:55:49,833
[eerie whispering]

830
00:55:50,708 --> 00:55:53,291
[somber music]

831
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:56,916
[sniffling]

832
00:56:09,958 --> 00:56:11,958
[ominous music]

833
00:56:21,875 --> 00:56:23,750
[sobbing]

834
00:56:24,125 --> 00:56:25,000
[shrieks]

835
00:56:32,208 --> 00:56:33,333
[phone dings]

836
00:57:01,458 --> 00:57:02,375
Dear?

837
00:57:06,875 --> 00:57:07,708
Salma.

838
00:57:09,666 --> 00:57:10,541
Salma!

839
00:57:10,625 --> 00:57:11,541
[coughing] Sal--

840
00:57:12,125 --> 00:57:13,458
[coughing]

841
00:57:13,541 --> 00:57:15,083
[grave music]

842
00:57:15,166 --> 00:57:16,791
[coughing] Salma!

843
00:57:18,375 --> 00:57:19,500
Salma!

844
00:57:21,166 --> 00:57:22,375
[coughing]

845
00:57:27,583 --> 00:57:29,500
[panting]

846
00:57:37,041 --> 00:57:38,958
[ominous music]

847
00:58:17,625 --> 00:58:18,791
[Diah] Looking for someone?

848
00:58:52,083 --> 00:58:53,750
I seek forgiveness from God!

849
00:59:06,333 --> 00:59:07,875
Is Arman sleeping outside?

850
00:59:09,166 --> 00:59:10,541
Did you have another fight?

851
00:59:12,333 --> 00:59:16,416
You should talk things out
when there's a problem.

852
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,666
It's Arman who's not listening.

853
00:59:19,166 --> 00:59:21,125
Arman is just tired.

854
00:59:21,208 --> 00:59:22,791
You know about his project, right?

855
00:59:22,875 --> 00:59:25,541
Yeah, he's tired from having an affair.

856
00:59:25,625 --> 00:59:27,083
What are you saying?

857
00:59:27,166 --> 00:59:29,166
Whatever, forget it.

858
00:59:29,958 --> 00:59:33,291
You'd take Arman's side over mine,
your daughter-in-law.

859
00:59:34,041 --> 00:59:35,541
That's not true.

860
00:59:35,625 --> 00:59:36,583
Salma.

861
00:59:40,041 --> 00:59:41,583
[knocking on door]

862
00:59:41,666 --> 00:59:43,666
Oh, I'll get it.

863
00:59:48,833 --> 00:59:54,833
Ma'am, I checked out the house
at the corner, Mrs. Diah's place,

864
00:59:54,916 --> 00:59:56,083
but it's abandoned.

865
00:59:56,541 --> 00:59:59,791
- What?
- The house is empty.

866
01:00:00,541 --> 01:00:01,833
[creaking]

867
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:05,750
Diah, what do you need?

868
01:00:05,833 --> 01:00:08,000
I just want to chat with you.

869
01:00:08,083 --> 01:00:11,583
I asked the security and the neighbors.

870
01:00:11,666 --> 01:00:13,583
Nobody knows anyone named Diah.

871
01:00:13,666 --> 01:00:15,833
[heavy breathing]

872
01:00:15,916 --> 01:00:18,291
We must tell Salma.

873
01:00:19,625 --> 01:00:20,875
- Aunty.
- Huh?

874
01:00:20,958 --> 01:00:22,083
Could you prepare a drink?

875
01:00:23,166 --> 01:00:25,000
We have a guest. Diah.

876
01:00:25,083 --> 01:00:26,375
- [ominous music]
- Thank you.

877
01:00:30,416 --> 01:00:32,375
[heavy breathing]

878
01:00:35,083 --> 01:00:35,833
Make the tea.

879
01:00:43,958 --> 01:00:46,083
[Salma] What brings you here so early?

880
01:00:46,625 --> 01:00:48,916
[ominous music]

881
01:00:58,916 --> 01:01:01,666
What do you think I should do?

882
01:01:07,708 --> 01:01:08,875
[Diah] Stay out of it.

883
01:01:08,958 --> 01:01:09,958
[gasps]

884
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:12,125
Oh my God!

885
01:01:12,208 --> 01:01:13,875
Excuse me, Mrs. Lastri.

886
01:01:16,416 --> 01:01:17,500
Sumi.

887
01:01:18,125 --> 01:01:21,541
Go check the water Salma put
in the other rooms.

888
01:01:21,625 --> 01:01:22,541
Okay.

889
01:01:22,625 --> 01:01:23,625
Please.

890
01:01:24,125 --> 01:01:25,083
Got it.

891
01:01:28,416 --> 01:01:29,958
[Salma] Thank you, Diah.

892
01:01:32,625 --> 01:01:33,541
Salma.

893
01:01:53,208 --> 01:01:54,083
Salma?

894
01:01:58,875 --> 01:02:00,083
[screaming]

895
01:02:02,875 --> 01:02:04,750
[groaning in pain]

896
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:08,416
Sumi!

897
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:11,208
Ouch!

898
01:02:11,291 --> 01:02:13,666
- Oh my God! Mrs. Lastri!
- Sumi!

899
01:02:14,916 --> 01:02:17,375
- What happened?
- It hurts.

900
01:02:17,458 --> 01:02:19,750
- It hurts.
- What happened, Mrs. Lastri?

901
01:02:19,833 --> 01:02:21,333
It's burning.

902
01:02:21,416 --> 01:02:23,541
- [sobbing in pain]
- It hurts…

903
01:02:23,625 --> 01:02:25,875
Mom! Oh my God!

904
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:28,208
Aunty, please get the first aid kit!

905
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:29,875
- Okay.
- Hurry!

906
01:02:29,958 --> 01:02:32,416
What happened, Mom?

907
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:33,541
Oh my God.

908
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:37,041
Aunty Sumi, hurry!

909
01:02:38,125 --> 01:02:39,500
Oh my God, Mom.

910
01:02:40,291 --> 01:02:41,541
I can't believe this.

911
01:02:42,166 --> 01:02:44,208
How could you leave the stove on?

912
01:02:44,291 --> 01:02:46,291
Where were Salma and Sumi?

913
01:02:46,375 --> 01:02:49,000
I shouldn't have to leave work
just for this.

914
01:02:49,083 --> 01:02:51,125
I was with a guest.

915
01:02:54,875 --> 01:02:55,708
Who?

916
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:58,875
Dika was dropping something off?

917
01:03:00,291 --> 01:03:01,583
What's going on between you and Dika?

918
01:03:02,875 --> 01:03:05,166
What do you mean by that?

919
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:07,416
Dika's just the supplier
for my dollhouse materials!

920
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,083
Suppliers work at the store.

921
01:03:09,583 --> 01:03:11,541
If he came here,
he must've had other intentions.

922
01:03:11,625 --> 01:03:13,958
Arman, stop.

923
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:16,250
I never asked him to come.

924
01:03:16,333 --> 01:03:17,708
You never told him not to either.

925
01:03:17,791 --> 01:03:19,541
Please stop, Arman.

926
01:03:19,625 --> 01:03:22,750
[sobbing] It was my fault. I'm sorry.

927
01:03:23,708 --> 01:03:28,083
[Lastri] It wasn't anyone's fault.
It was just an accident.

928
01:03:28,166 --> 01:03:30,416
I'm fine, and that's what matters.

929
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:33,375
[Sumi] I'm responsible for the kitchen.

930
01:03:33,458 --> 01:03:37,208
I was careless, and you got hurt.

931
01:03:37,291 --> 01:03:39,125
[Sumi sobbing] I'm sorry.

932
01:03:58,083 --> 01:04:00,791
I talked to Salma's uncle on the phone.

933
01:04:02,208 --> 01:04:05,750
He can't come because he's busy
at the boarding school,

934
01:04:07,291 --> 01:04:13,250
but he'll give us blessed water
for our protection.

935
01:04:13,333 --> 01:04:15,041
Please pick it up, Sumi.

936
01:04:18,125 --> 01:04:20,041
Here's the address

937
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:23,208
and the money.

938
01:04:24,291 --> 01:04:27,041
Let me know when you get there.

- Careful, Mom.
- [sobbing] Sumi.

957
01:08:03,583 --> 01:08:05,500
Sumi.

958
01:08:05,583 --> 01:08:09,833
It's all because of me.

959
01:08:09,916 --> 01:08:14,750
Don't blame yourself, Mom.
This has nothing to do with you.

960
01:08:14,833 --> 01:08:18,791
What happened to Sumi was God's will.

961
01:08:18,875 --> 01:08:23,875
But I'm the one who told her
to go see Salma's uncle at the school.

962
01:08:23,958 --> 01:08:25,583
That was on me.

963
01:08:25,666 --> 01:08:27,125
Easy, Mom.

964
01:08:31,791 --> 01:08:33,666
Listen to me, Arman.

965
01:08:35,125 --> 01:08:37,083
Please listen to me.

966
01:08:39,291 --> 01:08:43,791
I didn't believe it at first,
but you need to believe me.

967
01:08:44,333 --> 01:08:46,875
I'm afraid that Sumi's death

968
01:08:48,125 --> 01:08:50,625
and the strange things
Salma experiences at home

969
01:08:50,708 --> 01:08:54,291
might be related
to that neighbor she regularly sees.

970
01:08:54,375 --> 01:08:55,625
Mom.

971
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:58,666
Just hear me out.

972

I'm sorry.

976
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:31,500
I believe everything you heard
and went through is real.

977
01:09:35,625 --> 01:09:39,666
But I also need to talk to you
about your friend, Diah.

978
01:09:41,708 --> 01:09:46,375
I told Sumi to go to her house,
but it was abandoned.

979
01:09:46,458 --> 01:09:47,333
Mom.

980
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:50,083
Why are you bringing up Diah?

981
01:09:51,083 --> 01:09:54,291
Just… hear me out.

982
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:59,250
Every time you say Diah comes over,

983
01:10:01,125 --> 01:10:04,500
I just see you talking to yourself.

- Salma.

What are you saying?

986
01:10:09,041 --> 01:10:10,791
Are you saying I'm crazy?

987
01:10:10,875 --> 01:10:11,708
No.

988
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:13,958
Please listen to me.

989
01:10:14,041 --> 01:10:17,500
- I'm not making things up. Listen…
- Mom, that's enough.

990
01:10:17,583 --> 01:10:18,500
Enough.

991
01:10:20,791 --> 01:10:21,708

992

1000
01:11:50,125 --> 01:11:52,291

I told you so.

1007
01:12:27,875 --> 01:12:29,791
They don't need you.

1008
01:12:31,208 --> 01:12:33,666

01:21:49,625 --> 01:21:52,375
I saw everything!
The evidence is right here!

1101
01:21:52,458 --> 01:21:55,250
You think I'm that naïve? I'm not a fool!

1102
01:21:55,333 --> 01:21:56,166
Salma!

1103
01:21:56,958 --> 01:22:00,000
Listen to me! You're not a fool!

1104
01:22:00,083 --> 01:22:01,875
You're just not being fair to Arman!

1105
01:22:01,958 --> 01:22:04,166
He's done everything you asked!

1106
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:07,750
Moving out, getting your own place,
resigning, starting a business…

1107
01:22:07,833 --> 01:22:11,083
Do you realize how hard
he's worked for that?

1108
01:22:11,166 --> 01:22:12,791
Don't repay him like this,

1109
01:22:12,875 --> 01:22:15,333
doubting Arman non-stop

1110
01:22:15,416 --> 01:22:17,000
when you should be grateful!

1111
01:22:17,083 --> 01:22:19,708
Not everything is about you, Salma!

1112
01:22:19,791 --> 01:22:20,833
Salma!

Do you trust me?

1116
01:22:26,750 --> 01:22:29,125
If I'm really that selfish…

1117
01:22:32,083 --> 01:22:33,416
then divorce me.

1118
01:22:34,166 --> 01:22:35,458
I want a divorce.

1119
01:22:35,541 --> 01:22:36,625
Salma.

1120
01:22:36,708 --> 01:22:37,791

01:22:54,291 --> 01:22:55,500
Salma!

1127
01:22:56,250 --> 01:22:58,541
- Salma!
- Sir, let's go now.

1128
01:22:58,625 --> 01:23:00,375
- Go, go!
- Salma!

1129
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:03,416

01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:27,916
[Kyai] <i>Salma.</i>

1135
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,500
<i>There's something trying to destroy</i>
<i>your marriage with Arman.</i>

1136
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:35,708
It's a djinn that can wreck your marriage

1137
01:23:35,791 --> 01:23:38,375
and ruin your relationships.

1138
01:23:40,458 --> 01:23:42,000
The djinn's name is Dasim.

1139
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,375
Why would it do that?

1140
01:23:45,458 --> 01:23:49,208
[Kyai] <i>They will receive a fate</i>

Salma, is your mother okay?

01:24:01,625 --> 01:24:03,291
The rain got to her stuff.

1145
01:24:09,291 --> 01:24:10,791
[Salma] Are you married, Diah?

1146
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:15,583
Djinns can instigate, slander,

1147
01:24:15,666 --> 01:24:21,041
<i>and pit people against each other.</i>

1148
01:24:21,125 --> 01:24:24,666
This book, <i>Shams al-Ma'arif,</i>

1149
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:29,458
was sealed to protect it from misuse.

1150
01:24:29,541 --> 01:24:32,291
But it's been stolen.

1151
01:24:32,375 --> 01:24:37,500
<i>Whoever took it is using the djinn Dasim</i>

1152
01:24:38,208 --> 01:24:43,708

on how to maintain a healthy marriage.

1265
01:33:06,625 --> 01:33:09,791
A successful marriage
depends on both partners.

1266
01:33:10,333 --> 01:33:12,541
Husband and wife.

1267
01:33:13,125 --> 01:33:18,250
If one is not interested,
it will not last.

1268
01:33:18,833 --> 01:33:22,916
Because marriage comes with trials
and temptations.

1269
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,000
How do we maintain our commitment?

1270
01:33:26,083 --> 01:33:30,583
We must remind each other

1271
01:33:30,666 --> 01:33:35,375
to stay connected to Allah SWT

1272
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:42,166
by praying together.

1273
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:46,916
Upon you peace
and God's mercy and blessings.

1274
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:52,208
[crowd] And upon you peace
and God's mercy and blessings.

1275
01:33:52,291 --> 01:33:57,625
Let's recite Surah Al-Fatihah together.

1276
01:33:58,166 --> 01:34:02,666
<i>Audhubillah min al shaitan nirajeem.</i>

1277
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:05,000
- In the name of God…
- Salma.

1278
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,916
I think I just got my period.
Do you have a pad?

1279
01:34:10,041 --> 01:34:13,875
You can grab it from the bathroom
in my room, upstairs.

1280
01:34:13,958 --> 01:34:16,250
- Upstairs? Thanks.
- Yeah.

1281
01:34:16,333 --> 01:34:20,041
[crowd in Arabic]
…Master of the Day of Judgment.

1282
01:34:20,125 --> 01:34:25,916
It is You we worship,
and You we ask for help.

1283
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:30,458
Guide us on the straight path.

1284
01:34:55,083 --> 01:34:57,625
[ominous music]

1285
01:35:18,625 --> 01:35:22,458
[Kyai] <i>I've been looking for your friend</i>
<i>who's often with you.</i>

1286
01:35:22,541 --> 01:35:23,291
<i>What's her name again?</i>

1287
01:35:23,375 --> 01:35:24,958
- Indri?
- Yeah, her.

1288
01:35:25,041 --> 01:35:27,000
Is she not here? You didn't invite her?

1289
01:35:27,083 --> 01:35:28,666
[Salma]<i> I invited her.</i>

1290
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:30,125
<i>She couldn't make it.</i>

1291
01:35:30,208 --> 01:35:31,541
<i>She's not feeling well.</i>

1292
01:35:31,625 --> 01:35:35,666
[Kyai]<i> Indri promised me</i>
<i>she'd visit the school sometime,</i>

1293
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:38,041
<i>but I haven't heard from her yet.</i>

1294
01:35:38,125 --> 01:35:40,166
[Indri] <i>It's fine</i>
<i>if you don't want to talk,</i>

1295
01:35:40,833 --> 01:35:44,666
<i>but I'm here if you need to.</i>

1296
01:35:44,750 --> 01:35:48,541
Don't skip your meals.
What if you get sick?

1297
01:35:48,625 --> 01:35:51,125
Don't let Salma's packed lunch
go to waste.

1298
01:35:53,791 --> 01:35:55,000
Excuse me.

1299
01:35:55,083 --> 01:35:57,166
Sorry for interrupting.

1300
01:35:57,250 --> 01:35:58,750
Your mom invited us for dinner.

1301
01:36:13,791 --> 01:36:16,333
[ominous music intensifies]

1302
01:36:31,166 --> 01:36:35,000
[eerie whispering]
<i>I will destroy your family.</i>

1303
01:36:36,208 --> 01:36:39,416
[ominous music playing]

1304
01:38:29,083 --> 01:38:32,416
[unsettling music playing]
