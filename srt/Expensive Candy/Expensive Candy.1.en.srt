1
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,078
When talking about our ancestors,

2
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:41,458
what sort of images comes to mind?

3
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:46,796
I'm sure you're thinking
of people half-naked.

4
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:54,345
Or tools made of wood or leaves…

5
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,515
Simplefolk with no material wealth.

6
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:03,313
But did you know that when Western
invaders first set foot in Mindanao

7
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,482
during Magellan's expedition--

8
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,110
According to Pigafetta,

9
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:15,992
back then they didn't need to dig
too deep to find gold as big as an egg.

10
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,453
Every one of the Rajas'

11
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,038
possessions were made of gold--

12
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,540
Their dinner plates and earrings were made of gold…

13
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,584
they even had gold in their teeth!

14
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:27,921
A far cry from our usual image

15
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,089
of the first Filipinos--

16
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,549
What's that?

17
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,762
Give it to me.

18
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:43,311
Everyone has a story about
their first sexual encounter.

19
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,730
Thank you.
You may sit down.

20
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,650
Mine is pretty special since

21
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,986
I'm already past 30
and I still haven't done it.

22
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,030
Note: Is Sir Camaya still a virgin?

23
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,539
Whose idea was this?

24
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,418
I'm not going to get angry,
I just want to talk.

25
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:14,217
If no one comes forward,
we're having a quiz.

26
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,224
I knew it!

27
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,518
I could tell it's Gopez
just from the handwriting.

28
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:29,274
Gopez, do you have a problem with virgins?

29
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,234
[clears throat]

30
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:33,945
Nothing, sir.

31
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,281
Well, obviously, you care enough about it

32
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,616
that you had to do a survey.

33
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,743
It's just for fun, sir.

34
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,329
Well, let's discuss it.

35
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:46,374
I don't really care about your little survey,

36
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,042
I just want to know

37
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,253
what's running through your mind.

38
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:53,631
Well, sir, see,
if you're no longer a virgin,

39
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,218
it's proof that someone likes you!

40
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,597
But when you're getting old
and you're still a virgin,

41
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,390
that must mean nobody's interested.

42
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,233
Did you know that when the Spaniards arrived

43
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:15,987
they were so surprised at the sexual
freedom women enjoyed?

44
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,573
So you're still a virgin?

45
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:24,078
Get one-fourth sheet of paper.
We're having a quiz.

46
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:30,752
Number one, what date did Magellan
land on Homonhon Island?

47
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,839
Ohh, someone's getting paid today!

48
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,215
Aren't you going to treat us?

49
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:38,509
Come on, Toto.
How about beef with fried rice?

50
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:39,969
Or what about Halo-halo?

51
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,472
We're all getting paid today,
why would I treat you?

52
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,265
You're so stingy!

53
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,475
Let's just go!

54
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,477
But just like love,
- Renato, ma'am.

55
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:50,146
I'm not thinking about it constantly.
- Renato Camaya.

56
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,231
I guess I just don't like the idea of

57
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:58,196
putting so much effort into romance.

58
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,198
Not to mention all the expenses.

59
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,951
The vendors of Angeles City confirmed

60
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,787
the steady increase in the cost of commodities

61
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:09,082
such as fruits, vegetables, meat, and fish.

62
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,543
A kilo of tilapia that used
to be at 115 pesos

63
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:15,171
is now at 128 pesos.

64
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,422
Son of a bitch.

65
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,216
Prices just keep going up.

66
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,384
So listen up, Letlet!

67
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,427
Quit fooling around with boys!

68
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,222
If you get knocked up early,
you're dead!

69
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,765
These costs will kill you!

70
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,225
This again, mother?

71
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,185
Mother, here's my pay.

72
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,021
You got what you needed?

73
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:33,189
- Mm-hm.

74
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,529
You know, if a fire started,

75
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,948
your room would be the first to burn down.

76
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,119
Mother, this is my only joy in life.

77
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,371
Look at this one.
It's Maria Clara.

78
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,539
Son,

79
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,417
don't take this the wrong way, but--

80
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,877
I'm getting worried.

81
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,839
You're past 30 and not once
did you bring a girl--

82
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,924
- That's just how it is, mother.

83
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,343
Life is hard, isn't that what you said?

84
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,013
That lecture was for your sister!

85
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,431
Because she's too young.

86
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,020
Here, take this.

87
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,939
I won it at the lottery today.

88
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,191
Go out and eat.

89
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,028
Ask out one of your female friends
so you can develop feelings for each other.

90
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:20,778
Go on.

91
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:23,948
Then, when you don't get the girl…

92
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,992
that's a hit on your pride!

93
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,369
Don't you really have anyone to ask, bro?

94
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,413
Not even your co-teachers?

95
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:31,664
- Nope.

96
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,002
You're lucky that mother keeps
pushing you to have a girlfriend.

97
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,046
When it comes to me and Wiggie,

98
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,922
she's way too strict!

99
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,382
You know how mother is,

100
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:42,967
books before boys.

101
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,344
Wiggie and I are more responsible
than you think!

102
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,346
Believe what you want!

103
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,682
Where are we eating?

104
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,684
Let's have sisig by the rail road!

105
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,561
Not bad for your 500 pesos.

106
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,772
We already had dinner back home.

107
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,148
Why would we waste the cash?

108
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,733
Learn to save where you can.

109
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,277
Mother said we should eat out!

110
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:05,364
Mother said I should eat out
with a female friend,

111
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:06,240
not with my sister.

112
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,493
Then why'd you ask me?

113
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:10,495
No reason.

114
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,872
You're crazy!

115
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,375
At least give me money for the trike fare!

116
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,918
I'll just go home!

117
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,045
Just walk. It's not that far.

118
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,755
You're the worst!

119
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,342
But what if there was a place

120
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,011
where you can easily find a partner?

121
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,722
And for cheap, too!

122
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:36,771
Area, sir?

123
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:40,191
Are you looking for the Area?

124
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,400
What 'Area'?

125
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,944
Women, sir.

126
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,490
Is this Area?

127
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,075
Yeah, boss. This way.

128
00:07:15,434 --> 00:07:17,228
Bro, come on!

129
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,356
Just take your pick, man.

130
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,733
See if you like any of the girls inside.

131
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,705
300 pesos, bro.

132
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,000
There's more over there.

133
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:47,967
You into that?

134
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,927
They'll finish soon.

135
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,096
No, no!

136
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,727
Bro, we're giving it for 250.

137
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,897
How about 200?

138
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,276
Is this your first time?

139
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,861
I'm not looking to fuck!

140
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,654
I'm a decent man!

141
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,947
So why did you take a look?

142
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,407
I was just curious!

143
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:15,203
I can tell you stories
about this place if you want.

144
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:23,294
Hey!

145
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,171
Candy!

146
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,380
Where the hell have you been?

147
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,882
We've been looking for you!

148
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,884
I was just with a friend.

149
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,262
That one's 700 pesos.

150
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,723
He said 250 pesos.

151
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,813
Candy's different.

152
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:44,982
She's special.

153
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,861
If you're not interested, can I get by?

154
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,947
I need to--
-I only have 500 on me.

155
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,074
Are you fucking kidding me?

156
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,160
Look at what you're gonna rail, man!

157
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:59,330
Does that look like your average meat?

158
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,624
It's expensive...

159
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:03,834
It's alright, TJ.

160
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,378
Business is slow anyway.

161
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:08,881
Fine, fine--

162
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,299
Nevermind!

163
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,551
I'm saving up.

164
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,095
Sorry.

165
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,018
Well?

166
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:23,020
Are you guys ready to get
your cherries popped?

167
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,397
Hell yeah, man!

168
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,065
I've been ready since last week!

169
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,192
I didn't jack off for a week for this!

170
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,111
Whip out your cocks

171
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,030
coz we're not coming outta here as virgins!

172
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,964
What do you want us to do?

173
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,051
You said you would tell me stories.

174
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,886
You thought I was serious?

175
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,014
No, it's just…

176
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,181
I'm a teacher.

177
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,350
History teacher.

178
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,395
What's the history of this place?

179
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,731
Hell if I know?

180
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:10,151
All that matters is what it is right now.

181
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,778
A hotspot for broke-ass bums

182
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,072
looking for a cheap…

183
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,868
Hey, I'm not a bum.

184
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,287
Then you should have gone to Fields!

185
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,831
That's where people with money go.

186
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:24,832
- Fields?

187
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,876
Let's just get this over with.

188
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,295
Hey!

189
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,464
What are you doing?

190
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,174
Stop squirming!

191
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,301
It's like giving a dog a bath!

192
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,606
Your first time, huh?

193
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,149
- Mm-hm.

194
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,944
Leave it to me, then.

195
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,414
Ever been kissed on the lips?

196
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,848
I love you!

197
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,106
What the fuck?

198
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,482
What was that?

199
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:32,775
What?

200
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,903
I love you' for a stupid kiss?

201
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,743
Let's finish your initiation.

202
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,457
Boss!

203
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,834
Pay up!

204
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,214
How was it?

205
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,592
Perfect score!

206
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,594
10/10!

207
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,513
With honors!

208
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,852
I guess that's how it feels, huh?

209
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,604
Simultaneously awkward and exciting.

210
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:15,067
Funny how the things  we otherwise find disgusting,

211
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,195
like spit, and sweat, our private parts--

212
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:23,075
During sex, they become delicious.

213
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:27,163
Especially if you're doing it with a professional.

214
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,623
Toto, you're gonna be late!
-Pass your papers forward!

215
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:30,750
Right minus wrong!

216
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,501
Hey! Wake up!

217
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,627
What the hell?

218
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:34,670
You're late!

219
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:37,965
Morning!

220
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,425
How odd!

221
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,719
Sir Camaya is tardy!

222
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:45,639
Did a new documentary keep
you up last night, Toto?

223
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,641
No, it's just insomnia.

224
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,226
It's Madam Principal!

225
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,270
Good morning, ma'am!

226
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,106
Mr. Camaya!

227
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,192
Are the rumors true?

228
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,696
Students from Section B
were questioning your virginity?

229
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:04,783
I'm sorry?

230
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,911
Just confirm if it's true.

231
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:07,995
Because if it is,

232
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,206
I'll send them to the guidance office.

233
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,458
No need for that, ma'am!

234
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,251
I gave them what they deserved:

235
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,879
a surprise quiz!

236
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:20,674
Besides, none of it's true.

237
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:22,927
What do you mean?

238
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,347
That I'm still a virgin.

239
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,766
Please, ma'am, at my age?

240
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,310
Let's not make it into an issue.

241
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,395
Do not bring us to the test,

242
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,397
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

243
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,358
In the name of the Father, the Son,

244
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,193
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

245
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:40,694
Good morning, class.

246
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:43,155
- Good morning, Mr. Camaya!

247
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,492
Read chapters 12 -15 in the textbook.

248
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,828
We'll have a graded recitation in 40 minutes!

249
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,331
Eat, work, sleep...

250
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,333
Mostly, work--

251
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,919
That's where my life used
to revolved around in.

252
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:00,214
But eversince I experienced Candy,

253
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:03,300
I want to break free from the mundane.

254
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:07,596
There's a part of me
that thinks this is wrong

255
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,682
But it just feels so good!

256
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,767
Can't I give myself a break for once?

257
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,146
Just from time to time.

258
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,691
And it's not like I'll be doing this forever.

259
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,359
Right?

260
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,902
Yes, of course.

261
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,737
This will pass.

262
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,155
I promise.

263
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:25,990
Ma!

264
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,283
Can I borrow 500 pesos?

265
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:27,866
Why?

266
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:29,618
Didn’t I give you last night?

267
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,831
Didn't you say I should go out

268
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:37,459
with a female friend so we can
develop some feelings?

269
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,045
And? Did you find someone?

270
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,716
Letlet told me you didn't spend the 500 pesos.

271
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:46,552
Ma…

272
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,472
The truth is…

273
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,809
I asked Stephanie out.

274
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:55,936
Huh?

275
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:57,855
That young lady from grade school

276
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,149
who won Mr &amp; Ms U.N. with you?!

277
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,026
- Yes- Yes, mother--

278
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,863
Goodness! You're a perfect match!

279
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,990
She's so smart!

280
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,868
But don't you think you're spending a bit much?

281
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,537
500 pesos every night?

282
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:18,000
Can you keep up with that kind of expense?

283
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,670
Come on, Ma…

284
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,008
This is the last, Renato.

285
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,927
If you want money to spend on your honey,

286
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:31,263
you've got to do it with your own money.

287
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:35,059
I already give you most of my pay.

288
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,686
I dare you to try and live off your own,

289
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:41,023
paying for food and utilities!

290
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,233
Let's see how long you'll last
on that salary of yours!

291
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,402
Just kidding!

292
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,321
Thank you, Ma!

293
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,493
The one with the huge titties!

294
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,661
- Hey

295
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:55,663
What are you doing here?

296
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,122
And in your uniform, too!

297
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:57,623
Nothing, sir!

298
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,707
Just walking around!

299
00:15:58,957 --> 00:15:59,917
This is our usual route.

300
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:00,876
I'm warning you, Gopez!

301
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,461
I know what you're here for!

302
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:06,840
Sir…

303
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,801
It's Labot's birthday today.

304
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,178
It'd be a sick present
to have his first time here.

305
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,888
We all chipped in for it!

306
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,014
Sir!

307
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:15,724
There's a girl in there…

308
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:16,934
She's so pretty!

309
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,644
So pearly and supple!

310
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,521
My birthday wish

311
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,189
is to be devirginized by her.

312
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,482
That's our plan, sir.

313
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:25,859
If you little runts don't go home,

314
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,319
I'll tell the principal!

315
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,488
Don't be a killjoy, sir.

316
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,740
We're all men here!

317
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,368
Why would you spend money

318
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,536
just to get fucked?

319
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,581
Can't score with any of the girls
in your class, huh?

320
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,917
That's because you're all ugly!

321
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:42,710
Go home!

322
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,171
Go home!

323
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:49,591
That's messed up, sir.

324
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,551
- Let's just go.

325
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,054
Sorry 'bout that, bud.

326
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,723
Happy birthday!

327
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,685
Is this all of it, Auntie Mariel?

328
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:01,520
For the whole month?

329
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,522
Well, yeah!

330
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,648
Business is slow!

331
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,003
Good evening.

332
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,091
You know,

333
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:35,053
in my two years of working here,

334
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,765
not a single customer has greeted me.

335
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,224
Most of the time,

336
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,517
as soon as they enter,

337
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,728
it's straight to fucking.

338
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:43,896
Is that how it works?

339
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,397
Can I strip now?

340
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,692
Can you do it by yourself?

341
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,360
Of course!

342
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,832
Well, aren't you excited.

343
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,044
Sorry!

344
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,630
No, that's not it.

345
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,883
I meant, two days in a row?

346
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,927
You're something else.

347
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,764
I really like you, Candy.

348
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:25,103
If only I could be with you outside…

349
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,148
in a different context.

350
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,400
"Context"?

351
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,652
Is that how you talk

352
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,695
even when you're not in class?

353
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,157
I'm telling you the truth!

354
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,995
You just met me last night.

355
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,664
You probably just like me

356
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,958
because I was your first time.

357
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,380
You have a point.

358
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,926
But…

359
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,553
we could try.

360
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,264
Try what?

361
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,600
To meet in a different context.

362
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:08,981
Get dressed, hurry!

363
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,443
We'll pretend like we're done.

364
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,904
Meet me at the Tapsilog* place by the train tracks.
(FN: fried rice with beef and fried egg)

365
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,155
You know the place?

366
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:17,990
At Isabel's?

367
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,490
- Yeah.

368
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,033
Let's meet there at 10:00 PM.

369
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,326
Aren't we going to--

370
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:25,372
I thought you wanted
to be with me outside?

371
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,624
I already gave TJ my money…

372
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,084
What do we do for cash?

373
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,837
Where do you really want
to spend time with me?

374
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,380
Out there or in here?

375
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:39,094
In 1986, Vivian Del Rosario opened
an eatery in Quezon City.

376
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,763
It was for people with a small budget

377
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:46,727
like truck drivers, jeep drivers,
and tricycle drivers.

378
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,938
She would sell beef shank soup and tapsilog.

379
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:50,981
Bam!

380
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,190
It was a hit!

381
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:56,069
Did you know she also
coined the term 'Tapsilog'?

382
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,905
Because back then they used
to say it separately:

383
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,907
tapa (cured, fried beef), sinangag
(fried rice) and itlog (egg).

384
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:00,574
Sir.

385
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:01,950
Are you going to order anything?

386
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,328
That's your fourth glass of water.

387
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,709
Sorry, I'm still waiting for--

388
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:14,504
Miss, two orders of Tapsilog
and fresh coconut juice.

389
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:15,505
- Okay, ma'am.

390
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,591
Sorry I'm a little late;

391
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,509
I had to take a shower.

392
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,850
You eat here often?

393
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,394
Yeah, if I have extra cash.

394
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,521
I like these kinds of food.

395
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,522
What about you?

396
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,399
What's your favorite?

397
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:35,859
Sorry?

398
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:39,988
My all-time favorite is Tapsilog.

399
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:43,700
But I also really like Bangsilog (milkfish, fried rice, egg)

400
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,160
and Sisigsilog!

401
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,495
What's yours?

402
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,247
Me?

403
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:52,376
My favorite is Cornsilog
(corned beef, fried rice, egg)

404
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,835
and Hotsilog (hotdog, fried rice, egg).

405
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,212
What about Pepsilog?

406
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,713
You don't like that?

407
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,759
What's that?

408
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:01,885
Pepe (Vagina),

409
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,470
Sinangag (fried rice),

410
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,764
Itlog (egg)!

411
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:12,729
What's your story?

412
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:13,814
Where are you from?

413
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,065
The Area.

414
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,525
No, before that.

415
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,610
Ah, here and there.
Near the farms.

416
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,071
Where are your parents now?

417
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:24,241
What is this, a job interview?

418
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,952
This is just who I am:

419
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,246
alone in life, getting by…

420
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,331
I don't need to cling on to anyone for help.

421
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,333
Not even my parents.

422
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,252
Why did you ask me out here

423
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,295
if you could just go alone?

424
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:41,258
I didn't ask you out here for company.

425
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:44,594
I asked you out here because I'm bored.

426
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,515
So I'm just a way to kill time.

427
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,809
Like you don't just use me to get off?

428
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,436
But I'm paying, you're not.

429
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,062
This is my treat!

430
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,482
I'm worth more than what you ordered!

431
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,861
And I'm worth more than your 500 pesos!

432
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:02,612
Don't worry.

433
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:03,655
When I get back to the Area

434
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,365
I'm bringing 1000 pesos.

435
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,662
Whatever, finish your food.

436
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,955
We're going somewhere.

437
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,206
Hurry up.

438
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,651
Fun, huh?

439
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,237
Everything's bright and loud!

440
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,114
I wish the whole world was like this!

441
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,324
I don't know about that.

442
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,492
Follow me.

443
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,163
Come on, come on!

444
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,623
Watch your step!

445
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,128
Look at this!

446
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,215
Look at them!

447
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:22,025
Woohoo! Yes!

448
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:25,529
This is so wrong, Candy!

449
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:29,825
What? Look how much fun they're having!

450
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,499
Go, number one!

451
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:39,501
Yes, Six! Go!

452
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,879
Oh my gosh, look at these dollar bills!

453
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,341
Hurry!

454
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,262
All this just for a dollar!

455
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,055
How much is a dollar in peso?

456
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,975
About 48 to 50 pesos.

457
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,687
Imagine if those were thousand-peso bills!

458
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,564
There'd be a riot.

459
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:03,859
I'm sure none of them want to cause trouble.

460
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,945
They're fine with chump change,
it's better than nothing.

461
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,281
That's not how the world works, Toto.

462
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,241
The more expensive something is,

463
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,201
the more people go after it.

464
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:15,036
You guys got a table?

465
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,330
No, we were just leaving.

466
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,915
Tell Boss Darwin I said hi!

467
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:19,749
Tell him Candy dropped by!

468
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,001
Thank you!

469
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,670
I met Boss Darwin last month.

470
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,131
He bumped into me at the supermarket.

471
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,049
I was drinking milk tea at the time,

472
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,676
and it spilled on me.

473
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,303
He kept saying sorry.

474
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,180
He invited me to his bar and said

475
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,681
if I ever decided to hang out,

476
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:37,058
three buckets of beer's on him.

477
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,351
Did you go?

478
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,227
Nope.

479
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:42,063
I'm shooting for a different favor.

480
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,316
Hey, aren't you a teacher?

481
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,483
History? - Mhm.

482
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,110
Why History?

483
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,362
Don't your students get bored with you?

484
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:52,782
It's important to know your past
and where you came from.

485
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,368
Isn't the present more important?

486
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,162
I thought the same thing too, at first,

487
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,247
when my parents were still together.

488
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,790
Which one do you think I'd choose?

489
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,667
The past, when my family was intact

490
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,378
or now that we're not?

491
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,055
You look fine to me.

492
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,515
Even if I don't know about your past,

493
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:21,102
and you think it's better
than how things are going,

494
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,188
you're okay in my book.

495
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:24,773
Really?

496
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:28,151
- Mm-hm. Unless you used to be a billionaire.

497
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,738
Well, then, thanks for your time!

498
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,865
Hey, can I see with you again?

499
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,993
You know where to find me!

500
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,912
And my rate!

501
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,258
What are you looking for?

502
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,592
Side hustle?

503
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,721
A person can't live off one source of income.

504
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:04,062
Toto, maybe you want to try multi-level marketing!

505
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:07,023
Money rolls in quickly if you're hardworking.

506
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:09,526
You just need 7,000 pesos to start.

507
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,528
I don't have 7,000.

508
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,154
Can't you borrow from anyone?

509
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:14,948
You gotta make some sacrifices at the start!

510
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,366
You need to swallow your pride!

511
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,660
Eventually, you'll have got it made!

512
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:21,955
Have you guys got it made?

513
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,248
Not yet!

514
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,250
But soon, that's for sure!

515
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:29,713
Yeah, one day you'll be surprised,
we'll roll up to school in an SUV!

516
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,881
If I get rich,
I wouldn't be teaching anymore.

517
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:32,841
Come on!

518
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,551
Come on! It's just 7,000 pesos!

519
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,845
Then we'll recruit students!

520
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,180
Come on, Toto,
it's just 7,000 pesos!

521
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,974
Hurry up!

522
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,020
I've got an idea.

523
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,521
Ice candy!

524
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,274
Ice candy!

525
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:54,738
Sir!

526
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:57,198
Ice candy, ice candy!

527
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:02,495
Sir!

528
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,456
Give us three.

529
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,541
Five pesos each. Come and get 'em.

530
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,876
- Okay, sir.

531
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,005
Sir!

532
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,424
We saw you last night.

533
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,593
Obviously. We bumped
into each other, remember?

534
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:20,847
You were with that pretty girl
who works at the Area.

535
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,477
We'll rat you out to the principal.

536
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:32,817
Fine, fine… what do you want?

537
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,444
Okay, you can have those for free--

538
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:37,155
and get more. Two for each.

539
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:40,992
Thanks, sir.

540
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:44,454
So we're good, yes?

541
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,081
Scram.

542
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:47,207
Sir!

543
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:52,879
Ice candy isn't enough.

544
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,756
We want something else.

545
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:00,220
What do you want?

546
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,264
We want you to shut up about us going to Area.

547
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,224
Deal! Is that all?

548
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,434
Easy peasy.

549
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:07,560
That was easy!

550
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,146
We'll go back to the Area tonight, Sir-

551
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,689
-to finish the 'initiation'!

552
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:14,067
With that girl you were with last night.

553
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,944
The mestiza!

554
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,321
I knew you liked fair girls!

555
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,032
You know what I like.

556
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,158
You know it!

557
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:24,828
You know what, there are other
girls you can get for cheap.

558
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,329
You should go for them.

559
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:27,497
No way, sir.

560
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,125
I've got my eye on that chick.

561
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,501
She's making my mouth water!

562
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:32,627
She's my pick, too!

563
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,087
I can't keep my eyes off of her.

564
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,171
Right?!

565
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,135
Hey! Hey!

566
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,220
That girl's is my cousin!

567
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:47,434
If I hear about you going back
to the Area, you're dead!

568
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,645
Shit, they're cousins.

569
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,524
You thought you could blackmail me?

570
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,735
Buy all of this.

571
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,283
Son,

572
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,494
you won't get rich from selling ice candy.

573
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,664
Mother, I don't need to get rich.

574
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,125
I just need to earn some extra cash

575
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:15,336
to buy some stuff.

576
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,921
Like?

577
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:19,716
Candy.

578
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,551
Candy?

579
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,720
Here, caramels!

580
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:28,892
Are you saving money for Stephanie?

581
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:30,977
Secret!

582
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,857
But seriously, son.

583
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:39,194
Ice candy won't be enough.

584
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:42,989
You're smart.
Think of something!

585
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,367
Hey! Watch it!

586
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,077
What are you doing?

587
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,996
Get it right!

588
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,249
Sir.

589
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:55,084
- Sir.

590
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,339
Teacher Nagit.

591
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:05,553
Maybe you could require your students
to buy my ice candy.

592
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,765
Sounds like a headache, sir Camaya.

593
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:13,102
They might think we're trying
to shake them down.

594
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,313
Right…

595
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,860
How about this, sir.

596
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:28,493
Just tire them out so they'll be
more keen to buy my ice candy.

597
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:32,288
Then I should probably get a cut.

598
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:33,081
How much is one?

599
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,499
Five pesos.

600
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:44,300
Alright, I get one peso
from each piece you sell.

601
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,343
- What?

602
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,220
I'm just kidding!

603
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,513
How about this--

604
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,266
I'll let them know that you're selling ice candy,

605
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,852
but it's their choice if they wanna buy.

606
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:56,688
Ice that alright?

607
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,230
Do you get it?

608
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,231
I said ice, because…

609
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,274
ice candy--

610
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:01,234
Okay, sir, thanks.

611
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,193
Gimme one, alright?

612
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,069
What?

613
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:04,612
Gimme one!

614
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,663
Bro! I haven't seen you around lately.

615
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:15,498
Yeah, two weeks. I was saving up for Candy.

616
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:16,207
Bro TJ!

617
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,584
I'll take Candy.

618
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:21,004
Oh, man, Candy's gone.

619
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,463
What do you mean she's gone?

620
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,841
She doesn't work here anymore.

621
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:27,302
She moved to a bar in Fields.

622
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,179
She said she deserves better
than this shithole.

623
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,932
Her beauty's not for cheap scrubs.

624
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:36,811
Candy?

625
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:37,770
Hey!

626
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,063
Candy!

627
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,440
Hey, she's not there!

628
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,567
Hey! Hey!

629
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:43,151
Bro!

630
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:44,819
Candy!

631
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,113
She's not here!

632
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:47,864
That's not her!
- Candy!

633
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:48,740
- Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

634
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,616
I said she's not here!

635
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:50,742
- Stop bothering us!

636
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,077
Boss, sorry about that!

637
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:57,332
Maybe you haven't been paying her right!

638
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:00,293
Her patrons couldn't afford her!

639
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,587
You couldn't even pay her regular rate!

640
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,671
I can pay now!

641
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,090
You should have been
coming here every night

642
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,800
so she wouldn't get bored!

643
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,552
Then she wouldn't have left!

644
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,634
Candy!

645
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,980
I want Number 5!

646
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,022
You want Number 5?

647
00:33:45,022 --> 00:33:45,523
- Yes!

648
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,315
Don't worry, sir!

649
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:47,734
In a few minutes,

650
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,360
I will bring her here!

651
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,869
Ma'am!

652
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:00,913
Can I get Number 9?

653
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,708
Do you have a table?

654
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,255
Here she is!

655
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,885
Hi!

656
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,636
How are you?

657
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,223
How did you find me?

658
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,059
Just a hunch.

659
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,814
Is the work you're doing here

660
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,817
the favor you wanted from Boss Darwin

661
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,778
instead of the free beer?

662
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,821
You've got a sharp memory.

663
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:38,743
Place an order for us.

664
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:41,662
What do you want?

665
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,207
Margarita.

666
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,043
Fuck.

667
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:47,752
Why?

668
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,800
It's nothing.
Sure, let's order!

669
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,176
One margarita.

670
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,344
What do you mean one?

671
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,387
We're both having drinks!

672
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:00,640
MJ!

673
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,849
Two margaritas!

674
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:02,725
Two!

675
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,200
What are you doing?

676
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,494
My job.

677
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:23,871
You're a customer.

678
00:35:24,121 --> 00:35:25,373
I'm at your table.

679
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,083
This is what you get.

680
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,469
Why is your heartbeat so fast?

681
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,847
What are you so nervous about?

682
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:41,848
Drink.

683
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,641
To calm you down.

684
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,986
Are you in a hurry?

685
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,405
You said I should drink!

686
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,157
Order another one!

687
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:01,450
Do you want some food?

688
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,411
Try their steak.

689
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:04,954
[clears throat]

690
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,497
Well?

691
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:12,420
The money I brought was just
enough for the two margaritas.

692
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,937
Next time, bring more money

693
00:36:30,187 --> 00:36:32,565
so we can talk longer.

694
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,483
Wait, wait!

695
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,570
Can I see you after your shift?

696
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,488
What for?

697
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:41,032
I don't know--

698
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,492
Eat at Isabel's?

699
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,954
I thought you said you're out of cash.

700
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,665
Oh, right…

701
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,959
Just walk around?
Tell stories?

702
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:59,258
I get off at 3 a.m.

703
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,848
I understand how this world works.

704
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:09,143
The one with the money gets the prize.
- Hi! So this is your request!

705
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:12,438
If both parties can afford it,

706
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:16,400
the one with the higher bid wins.

707
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:21,030
In that case,
what on earth am I doing here?

708
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:26,077
Why do I keep playing when
the odds are against me?

709
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:28,788
Handsome!

710
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:30,414
Want some nuts?

711
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,124
There's lots of garlic!

712
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,626
You sell candy?

713
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,794
No, sorry.

714
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:35,920
What time is it?

715
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,756
11:00 p.m., ma'am.

716
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,133
It's still early.  I'll get back to work.

717
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,551
Nuts!

718
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,637
Sir, you want some nuts?

719
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,017
Handsome!

720
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,812
It's almost midnight!

721
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,480
I'm going home!

722
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:57,066
Watch yourself, yeah?

723
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,275
There are pickpockets here!

724
00:37:58,275 --> 00:37:59,360
Thank you, ma'am.

725
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,487
How much for a pack?

726
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,405
Ten pesos.

727
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:06,617
Auntie! Can customers
take the girls home?

728
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,035
- Of course!

729
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,662
I know there's a price for that!

730
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:10,705
I love this hotel.

731
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,331
We're going to have such a good time.

732
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:14,208
Candy!

733
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,587
Are we still down for later?

734
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:21,799
Not any more, Toto.
Someone's taking me home.

735
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,050
Maybe next time.

736
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,135
Is this guy bothering you?

737
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:25,636
No! No!

738
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,389
He's my cousin! Jojo.

739
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:30,850
Oh, man, I'm sorry!

740
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,560
Nice to meet you, Jojo!

741
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:34,228
Listen, Jojo.

742
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,731
Your cousin's hot as fuck!

743
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,236
Please take care of my cousin.

744
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:46,073
I don’t want anything
bad happening to her.

745
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,993
I've loved her since the day we met.

746
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:50,953
Don’t worry,

747
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:52,913
I'll take good care of her!

748
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:54,999
Come on, baby!

749
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,715
Well, here we are!

750
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,675
Wow!

751
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:11,348
This place is so whimsical!

752
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,476
"Whimsical?"

753
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,644
Where'd you learn that word?

754
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,772
From my customer.

755
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,066
He's a writer in Germany.

756
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,776
In all my years going to Fields,

757
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,195
I've never met a girl like you before.

758
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,364
I can tell you're smarter
than the rest of them.

759
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:29,909
Cause I am!

760
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,578
It's actually a turn-off for most guys.

761
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:35,289
They just want their ladies fun and submissive.

762
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,292
You do know what "submissive" means, right?

763
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,587
So, why did you take me out?

764
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:46,258
I like the challenge of taming
a headstrong woman.

765
00:39:47,384 --> 00:39:48,803
Go for it.

766
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,240
You can leave if you want.

767
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,993
Can I shower first?

768
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,643
Has Father come home?

769
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:41,897
[Rej] No. I think he lives at  the pastor's compound now

770
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:44,358
along with the other members of their group.

771
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:48,028
Rumors say they're a cult.

772
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:52,700
Hang on, if he goes home,
will you come home, too?

773
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,952
- I don’t know.

774
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:59,456
You always said you'd never forgive him,

775
00:40:59,456 --> 00:41:03,043
why do you keep checking up on him?

776
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:05,296
Just curious.

777
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,393
What's happening?

778
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:21,937
Why are you burning your dolls?

779
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:27,693
Will I get rich from making those?

780
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:29,278
Sir, can I buy some?

781
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:29,987
Me, too!

782
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,947
Me, too, sir!

783
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:33,324
It's ten pesos each!

784
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,950
Sir, weren't you selling these for five pesos?

785
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,911
I put different ingredients this time.
Imported!

786
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,537
It's too much.
- Okay…

787
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:48,380
Tomorrow, I'm telling the principal
you were at the Area.

788
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:54,887
Along with all your other violations!

789
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:56,805
Like what, sir?

790
00:41:57,097 --> 00:42:00,309
This one plagiarized his essay!

791
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,977
You brought playing cards!

792
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:04,939
And you used a cheat sheet the other day!

793
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:06,941
Sorry, sir.

794
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:19,411
But I can cut you a deal.

795
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:30,339
Give me 2,000 pesos each
before the weekend

796
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,049
and I'll keep my mouth shut.

797
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,550
Sir, that's extortion!

798
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:34,343
That's right!

799
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:35,052
You know what, sir?

800
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,637
What if we tell on you instead?

801
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,013
We’re calling our parents!

802
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:39,890
You're about to take money from us!

803
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:40,849
Go on, call him!

804
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,351
Wait, who are you going to call?

805
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,269
My dad, sir!

806
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,854
Go on, bring out your phones!
- Just wait!

807
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,859
I'm sorry, ok?

808
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,821
The truth is…

809
00:42:55,572 --> 00:43:00,452
the girl you saw with me the other night
isn't really my cousin.

810
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,207
I knew it!

811
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:07,293
You bang whores.

812
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:08,961
Hey,

813
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,381
you better watch your mouth.

814
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:15,884
I love her.

815
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,480
Sir.

816
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,734
Can I ask you something?

817
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,654
Why'd you try to extort us?

818
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:39,992
It's payment for the bar fine

819
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,785
so I can take her out.

820
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,996
She's working at a bar now.

821
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,374
Level up!

822
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:48,917
Sir, one more thing.

823
00:43:49,626 --> 00:43:52,254
Isn't your pay enough as a teacher?

824
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:55,132
I give most of it to my mother.

825
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:03,015
Okay sir, here's what we'll do.

826
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,975
We'll help you.

827
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,935
Of course we'll help you.

828
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:11,273
We'll give you 5,000 pesos.

829
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:15,152
but we want a passing grade in return.

830
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:17,905
Everything, including exams and quizzes,

831
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,365
and no recitations.

832
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,033
Right!

833
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:24,078
We don't need high grades.

834
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:25,954
We just need to pass.

835
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:29,875
We'll keep it discreet.

836
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,210
12,000 pesos.

837
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:32,711
8,000 pesos.

838
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:33,837
10,000 pesos.

839
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,506
Are you good with 10,000 pesos?

840
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,132
You good?

841
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:43,972
Hey, Let!

842
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:48,685
Maybe you and your classmates
want me to do your homework?

843
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:49,895
For free?

844
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:51,105
Of course not!

845
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:52,481
It depends on the difficulty.

846
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:55,484
Should be between 300 to 500 pesos.

847
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:58,070
They can't afford your prices.

848
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,863
What about the guy courting you?

849
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:01,949
Isn't he in college?

850
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:05,160
Maybe you could convince him
to avail of my services.

851
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:07,621
Wiggie doesn't need that.

852
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:10,582
He's smart and responsible.

853
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,001
But I'm sure

854
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,546
he wants to impress you.

855
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:19,174
He would want to be close
to your one and only brother!

856
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:20,843
And me?

857
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,886
What am I getting out of this?

858
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:30,227
I'll cook up an alibi to cover for you

859
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:33,230
so you can go out
and spend time with Wiggie.

860
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:34,398
Deal!

861
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,774
I'll call him.

862
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:48,912
You're back.

863
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,582
I missed you.

864
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,625
Order something.

865
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,421
I only have enough for a beer.

866
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,339
That's not going to fly in here.

867
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,508
I know, I just need to tell you something,

868
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:03,552
Three minutes max then I'll leave.

869
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,721
Sorry, I don't know when I'll be available.

870
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,264
Nevermind that.

871
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,307
At the end of the month,

872
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:10,058
I'll be back here and take you out.

873
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:11,685
I'll pay for the bar fine,

874
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:14,521
and we'll enjoy ourselves
from night until morning!

875
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:16,148
The bar fine's expensive.

876
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:18,567
I know.

877
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,319
Leave it to me.

878
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:25,282
Which hotel are you bringing me to?

879
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,036
Hotel?

880
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:31,872
Yeah, you said 'till morning.'

881
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,665
Where are we going to spend the night?

882
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:38,921
Shit.

883
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:41,381
Don't worry, I'll plan for it.

884
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:43,759
Promise.

885
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,427
At the end of the month.

886
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:03,946
Three flavors, five pesos each.

887
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:08,700
We have three flavors.

888
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,369
Alright, thanks very much!

889
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:13,080
See you guys again later, ok?

890
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:35,060
That includes the ones
for Wiggie's frat brothers.

891
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:42,025
Hello, Pa?

892
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:44,820
Son! Why are you calling?

893
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,155
Does your mother know?

894
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:51,076
No, can we keep it a secret?

895
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:54,288
Why, something wrong?

896
00:47:57,082 --> 00:48:01,211
You know how mother is.
She's a little shy and prideful,

897
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:06,758
but we're struggling a bit with expenses here.

898
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:11,597
You think you can send some money,

899
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:13,890
How much do you need?

900
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,187
10,000 pesos?

901
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,124
Here's your money, baby!

902
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:01,188
One, two, seven, out.

903
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:11,156
Hey, Candy!

904
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:12,699
Come here.

905
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:17,954
Who's it from?

906
00:49:17,954 --> 00:49:19,206
From Justinian?

907
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,124
No.

908
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,085
Take it.

909
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,383
I couldn't wait for the end of the month.

910
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:43,814
Toto?

911
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:48,360
Good evening.

912
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:03,458
What do you want to drink?

913
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:05,252
Margarita?

914
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,380
Sure.

915
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:13,260
Two margaritas.

916
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,178
- Okay, sir.

917
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:17,013
Got your paycheck?

918
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:20,517
Who do I need to talk to

919
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,769
so I can take you out?

920
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:25,188
Where are we going?

921
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:27,691
We'll eat,

922
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:29,860
go bar hopping,

923
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:31,778
and then the hotel.

924
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,490
Someone's all loaded up.

925
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,660
Are you sure you're spending it wisely?

926
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,006
Very wisely.

927
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:58,805
Auntie Ritz.

928
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,390
What?

929
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:04,019
Sir wants to take me out.

930
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:09,107
5,000 pesos until 4:00 a.m.

931
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,698
And until 8:00 a.m?

932
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:23,079
You're so handsome.

933
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:25,248
Why?

934
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,044
Because I can afford you now?

935
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:30,712
Dummy.

936
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:33,548
You look good in those clothes.

937
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:34,966
It suits you.

938
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,094
Thank you.

939
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,430
I'm starving!

940
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:41,973
Let's eat.

941
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:43,391
What's your budget for dinner?

942
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:45,936
It's alright.
Order whatever you want.

943
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:48,271
No, really?

944
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:51,358
Don't think about it.
Get what you like.

945
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:58,573
Yes, ma'am?

946
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,243
Angus tenderloin steak,

947
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,702
clubhouse sandwich,

948
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:03,995
Panizza Royale.

949
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:10,460
Chicken ceasar salad,

950
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,503
pasta bolognese,

951
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,255
and one sparkling water.

952
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:14,798
What's your order?

953
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,939
Actually, I'm still full.
I'd like an extra rice,

954
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:32,899
I'll just get from what she ordered.

955
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:34,484
Drinks, sir?

956
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:36,611
Sparkling water for him, too.

957
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:38,280
Right?

958
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:41,658
Yeah, I love sparkling water.

959
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,285
Go ahead.
- Okay, sir.

960
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:46,872
So, if you didn't become a teacher,

961
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,832
what would you job be right now?

962
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,125
Maybe…

963
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,543
I'd be just like my dad:

964
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:53,086
a fortune teller.

965
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:54,004
For real?

966
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:55,171
- Yeah!

967
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,799
People would go to him
to have their future told.

968
00:52:57,799 --> 00:53:00,385
Sometimes he would use cards…

969
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,012
sometimes he would read their palm.

970
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,139
Like an actual psychic or is he a fraud?

971
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:05,307
Who knows!

972
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:08,602
But there was this woman,

973
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:11,104
and he told her she would get pregnant.

974
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,356
Eventually she did get pregnant…

975
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:14,983
...thanks to him.

976
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:18,194
He's an asshole, my father.

977
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:23,658
What about you?
If you didn't end up... like that,

978
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:25,660
what would you have been?

979
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:28,288
I dunno, dead?

980
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:29,873
What?

981
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,920
This is the only thing
I want to do in life.

982
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,504
Everything I want,

983
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:38,423
I can get from this job.

984
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:41,843
More importantly,

985
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,432
this is what I'm good at.

986
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:49,726
Don't you agree?

987
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:55,941
Unless somebody comes
and takes me away from this life.

988
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:00,153
I got us this room.

989
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:11,748
Let's have another drink?

990
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,927
Is there a problem?

991
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:26,346
No!

992
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:27,555
There's no problem!

993
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,225
Let's go for a dip.

994
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,117
You're so beautiful.

995
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:50,286
I know.

996
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:53,581
Where am I prettier?

997
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,375
At the Area,

998
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,210
or here?

999
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,797
You could be sprawled out on a haystack

1000
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:03,383
and you'd still be lovely.

1001
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:05,468
Join me.

1002
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,682
I don't have clothes for that.

1003
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:14,728
You don't need to wear anything.

1004
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,230
I've seen everything.

1005
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,376
Is this mine?
- Mm-hm.

1006
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,010
What a dream, huh?

1007
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:55,685
We still have a lot of time.

1008
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:58,646
I'm counting the hours
I have left with you

1009
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:03,485
so I can manage my time better.

1010
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:26,174
You can do whatever
you want with me now,

1011
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:29,094
so make the most of it.

1012
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:39,395
I would only want it

1013
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:41,648
if you want it, too.

1014
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,068
I do want it.

1015
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:49,322
Even without money involved?

1016
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:28,486
Hey... what's wrong?

1017
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,738
Don't you want this?

1018
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,073
I do.

1019
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:34,159
I want this so much.

1020
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:41,416
I'm just sad because I know
I'll never get to have this again.

1021
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:45,211
I've used up all my savings for this night.

1022
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:49,132
Why the hell wasn't I born rich?

1023
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,885
Hey!

1024
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:55,555
You can leave even if it's not yet 8 a.m.

1025
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:59,142
I'll just go to sleep.

1026
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,108
You're still here?

1027
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:51,903
I took another client.

1028
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:54,405
Someone booked me after I left you.

1029
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:56,741
He's staying in the same hotel.

1030
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:00,703
Really?

1031
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:03,539
You're so hardworking.

1032
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:05,875
Have you had any sleep?

1033
00:59:06,542 --> 00:59:08,711
Where's your customer?

1034
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:11,256
You might get sick or something.

1035
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:13,466
You didn't sleep--have you eaten?

1036
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:14,634
I was just kidding!

1037
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:17,595
Why would I leave when
I still have an hour with you?

1038
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:18,888
Come on,

1039
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:20,348
let's swim!

1040
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,520
Is there an extra charge for that?

1041
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:27,981
This is your first time at a hotel, huh?

1042
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:30,191
If you're a guest here,

1043
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:32,318
you can use the pool for free.

1044
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:33,695
Get in!

1045
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:39,117
I don't want to.

1046
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,785
It's too cold!

1047
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:43,579
You're so lame.

1048
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:46,207
Look at what I'm wearing!

1049
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,793
Those are your regular clothes!

1050
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:50,795
Suit yourself.

1051
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:54,799
If you woke up

1052
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:56,843
and I was actually gone,

1053
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,679
what would you be doing in the hotel?

1054
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:01,347
I'd check out.

1055
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:03,683
What a waste of money.

1056
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,769
Check-out is at noon.

1057
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,564
I only booked a room for you.

1058
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:12,275
You can't enjoy a hotel room
on your own?

1059
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:13,985
Is that it?

1060
01:00:14,235 --> 01:00:16,237
It's better if you're with someone.

1061
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:18,364
You could savor the queen-sized bed

1062
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:20,408
or the fast speed WiFi.

1063
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:30,960
I got you breakfast for your room.

1064
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,300
That's 800 pesos?

1065
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,177
What about that?
How much for that one?

1066
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:41,262
275 pesos.

1067
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:44,015
These prices are unbelievable.

1068
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:46,434
Well, go ahead and eat.

1069
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:47,602
I'm still good.

1070
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:50,188
Let me have a sip first.

1071
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:25,056
Want me to stay with you
until check out?

1072
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:27,767
I can extend for a few more hours.

1073
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:30,478
I can't pay you anymore.

1074
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,689
I wasn't gonna charge you for the extra.

1075
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:41,948
Won't Auntie Ritz get mad?

1076
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,199
Why?

1077
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:44,742
She doesn't need to know.

1078
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:47,620
Besides, it's my personal choice.

1079
01:01:48,162 --> 01:01:49,914
So it's none of her business.

1080
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:02,844
I wanted to get a massage with you

1081
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:06,180
but I'm dead broke.

1082
01:02:06,347 --> 01:02:08,891
Why don't you just come with me outside?

1083
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:11,227
We won't need to spend any more.

1084
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:14,313
Aside from the jeepney and tricycle fare.

1085
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:25,199
So refreshing…

1086
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:31,247
It's been a while since my feet
actually touched the ground.

1087
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:32,832
What about you?

1088
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:35,251
Ah, but you're a city boy!

1089
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:37,378
Never been to places like this, have you?

1090
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:40,882
Aren't there snakes in there?

1091
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:42,884
You're so fussy.

1092
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:46,721
You're good at History, right?

1093
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:49,682
Do you know the history of this place?

1094
01:02:51,642 --> 01:02:53,102
What town is this?

1095
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:56,731
No, I meant this exact place
where we are.

1096
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,152
Sorry, I don't know anything about it.

1097
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:06,240
I do.

1098
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:13,581
When I was younger,

1099
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:17,835
my parents would always bring me here.

1100
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:22,507
Instead of having lunch at home,

1101
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:25,343
this is where we would go

1102
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:27,762
to eat and spend time together.

1103
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:31,557
We didn't have much back then.

1104
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:34,685
We couldn't afford to eat
at the mall or at a restaurant.

1105
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:37,730
We didn't even own a television.

1106
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,983
But that's okay.

1107
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:43,611
We had fun.

1108
01:03:45,112 --> 01:03:49,158
Father had a favorite passage from the Bible.

1109
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:53,037
"Blessed are the poor in spirit,

1110
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:55,373
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."

1111
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:59,252
He said we should be content
with a simple life

1112
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:04,215
because the Lord would reward
the poor in the end.

1113
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:08,219
I really held on to that when I was younger.

1114
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:12,557
What about you?
Do you believe in that?

1115
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,940
But when mother fell ill,

1116
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:24,485
that's when my views changed.

1117
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:30,199
I witnessed how hard it was
to be poor in this world.

1118
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:34,370
When you don't have enough to buy medicine,

1119
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,414
for the hospital bills, or the doctor's fees.

1120
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:43,838
Did your father change his views?

1121
01:04:45,339 --> 01:04:46,215
No.

1122
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,385
He kept praying.

1123
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:53,764
He said to offer everything
up to the Lord.

1124
01:04:54,807 --> 01:04:58,019
But the truth is,
he just didn't want to find a way.

1125
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:00,146
He's lazy.

1126
01:05:00,771 --> 01:05:02,690
He was just using the Bible

1127
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:04,734
so he doesn't have to face his reality.

1128
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:10,489
If you don't have money,

1129
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:12,325
you have no value.

1130
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:18,497
When mother died,
I left home immediately.

1131
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,334
I told myself,

1132
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:26,047
I would never end up like my parents.

1133
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:31,510
I'm not going to settle for scraps.

1134
01:05:31,969 --> 01:05:34,305
I will do anything, use everything--

1135
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:36,265
even my own body

1136
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:39,477
to not have to live like we used to.

1137
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:44,023
That is my history, Toto.

1138
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:49,028
Would you blame me if I didn't
want to remember the past?

1139
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:51,030
So why did we come here?

1140
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:55,951
If it just reminds you of the bad memories?

1141
01:05:57,745 --> 01:06:00,498
I just wanted you to know my history.

1142
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:05,086
I know you've been wondering
why I ended up like this.

1143
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:07,505
You know,

1144
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,173
not once--

1145
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:12,009
not even in passing,

1146
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:16,931
even if I don't really understand
your line of work,

1147
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:21,018
I never once judged you.

1148
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,482
- Thank you.

1149
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:33,698
That's why you should do your best, Toto.

1150
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:38,452
Become as wealthy as you can
until you can buy everything you want.

1151
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:46,001
What if this is all I'll ever be?

1152
01:06:49,213 --> 01:06:53,008
What if I'm fated to be ordinary?

1153
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:07,481
What if you're wrong?

1154
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:26,417
What time is it-- It's 12:00 PM!
I need to check out!

1155
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:27,585
Let's go!

1156
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:35,718
Sir?

1157
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:38,304
Where can I get a good massage?

1158
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:40,723
It's real boring here.

1159
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:44,560
There's a good place beside here--

1160
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,437
Not just massage--
- Candy, Candy--

1161
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:48,606
Hi guys! Excuse me.

1162
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:50,483
Can I borrow Candy for a while?
Just for a while.

1163
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:51,942
Just for a few minutes.

1164
01:07:52,067 --> 01:07:53,944
- Okay.
- Okay, no problem!

1165
01:07:53,944 --> 01:07:54,737
Thank you!

1166
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:56,739
What is it?

1167
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:57,823
You have a gig!

1168
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:00,993
This is big money.
Justinian wants to take you out!

1169
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:03,788
What about my customers tonight?

1170
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:05,790
It's not tonight,
it's for next week!

1171
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,833
Wow, he reserved early.

1172
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,210
For how many hours?

1173
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:10,711
One week.

1174
01:08:10,711 --> 01:08:12,880
Out of the country!

1175
01:08:14,298 --> 01:08:15,090
How much did you charge him?

1176
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:16,258
25,000 pesos!

1177
01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:18,719
That seems a little low.

1178
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:21,180
At least you get a free vacation!

1179
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:23,974
Free fare, free food,
what more could you ask for?

1180
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:26,018
You better take it!

1181
01:08:28,145 --> 01:08:30,064
So where are you planning to take me?

1182
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:31,857
- Away from here.

1183
01:08:32,858 --> 01:08:34,735
What's the purpose of your trip?

1184
01:08:35,110 --> 01:08:36,487
- Business.

1185
01:08:37,154 --> 01:08:38,864
But aside from that,

1186
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:42,243
I also think I'm in love with you.

1187
01:08:42,993 --> 01:08:44,954
And I want to spend time with you there…

1188
01:08:45,412 --> 01:08:47,289
away from this environment.

1189
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:50,584
Like a...

1190
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:53,796
A girlfriend?

1191
01:08:55,756 --> 01:08:57,216
Like a wife.

1192
01:08:57,675 --> 01:08:58,884
If we get along,

1193
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:01,303
I'm going to take you away from this life…

1194
01:09:02,179 --> 01:09:03,305
I promise.

1195
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:06,475
And I'm going to give you
the life of a princess.

1196
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:08,894
I don't care if I have to pay
Ritz everything I own.

1197
01:09:09,061 --> 01:09:10,104
I will.

1198
01:09:11,897 --> 01:09:13,399
But why me?

1199
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,026
I told you before.

1200
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:18,362
You're not like the rest.

1201
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:20,531
You're special.

1202
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:24,159
Sir!

1203
01:09:24,159 --> 01:09:24,827
Take care!

1204
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:25,703
Sir!

1205
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:27,121
You guys take care!

1206
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:37,256
Sir!

1207
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:38,299
Sir!

1208
01:09:38,757 --> 01:09:40,175
Good afternoon.

1209
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:44,305
Do I know you?

1210
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:47,182
Can I treat you to dinner?

1211
01:09:48,225 --> 01:09:49,435
Is this about Letlet?

1212
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:50,519
No, sir.

1213
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,982
Some of my brothers are starting
their theses this sem.

1214
01:09:55,399 --> 01:09:58,736
But a few of them are busy
with other things.

1215
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:00,946
Such as?

1216
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:02,364
Businesses…

1217
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:03,782
Vlogs?

1218
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:06,201
And their girlfriends.

1219
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:09,747
They're asking me to do it,

1220
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:10,998
but I can't focus on it

1221
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:12,958
because I'm busy with my own thesis,

1222
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:14,168
as well as my internship.

1223
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:16,670
Just cut to the chase.

1224
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:19,381
How much would it cost for you to do it?

1225
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:22,801
Are we aiming for 'Best Thesis'
or just passable?

1226
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:25,763
Passable sounds fair.

1227
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:30,517
P25,000 each.

1228
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:33,228
P15,000.

1229
01:10:33,354 --> 01:10:34,146
P22,000.

1230
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:35,356
P18,000.

1231
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:37,900
You know what,

1232
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:39,902
I take it back.

1233
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:42,237
I just want a clean way of making a living.

1234
01:10:42,237 --> 01:10:43,572
We might get caught.

1235
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:44,990
Are you sure, sir?

1236
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:46,367
It would be a waste!

1237
01:10:46,784 --> 01:10:47,701
Why?

1238
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:49,787
You want a cut, don't you?

1239
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:51,622
Yeah, hopefully.

1240
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:54,416
I just feel bad for Let-let.

1241
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:56,460
I can't afford to get her anything.

1242
01:10:58,379 --> 01:11:00,297
Then find another side hustle.

1243
01:11:01,173 --> 01:11:02,800
Don't settle for chasing cuts.

1244
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,551
That's lazy work.

1245
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:07,638
Don't you mean 'working smart'?

1246
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:10,182
Besides, my sister--

1247
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,352
She doesn't want fancy things.

1248
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:17,273
She's not going to dump you
just coz you don't give her gifts.

1249
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:21,610
By the way,

1250
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:26,782
here's the payment for the reaction
paper you wrote for me.

1251
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:29,451
This might be the last for now.

1252
01:11:30,577 --> 01:11:32,413
Yes, that's the way.

1253
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:34,289
Let's keep things clean.

1254
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:36,834
This'll be my last job from you, too.

1255
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:16,081
Excuse me for a while.

1256
01:12:18,917 --> 01:12:19,877
Aren't you Toto--

1257
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:21,920
You're Toto, right?
- Yes, ma'am.

1258
01:12:22,379 --> 01:12:25,466
Auntie Ritz, where's Candy?

1259
01:12:27,718 --> 01:12:29,261
Candy resigned…

1260
01:12:29,261 --> 01:12:32,139
Right after she came back from abroad.

1261
01:12:32,347 --> 01:12:35,893
The foreigner she escorted got her pregnant.

1262
01:12:36,143 --> 01:12:38,937
We can't even get a hold of the guy.

1263
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:43,442
He just vanished when he
found out Candy's pregnant.

1264
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:49,198
But she left a message.

1265
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:54,411
She told me to give you
her address when I see you.

1266
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:59,792
I just don't understand why it took you
three months to check up on her!

1267
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:04,088
As I understand it,
you two were very close.

1268
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:32,199
Candy?

1269
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:41,834
I've tried everything to get the stain off,

1270
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:43,585
but it just won't budge.

1271
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:47,673
What do you think I should do?

1272
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:51,051
I don't know anything about that.

1273
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:53,762
And there's no internet here, too.

1274
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:56,056
Forget it.

1275
01:13:58,684 --> 01:14:00,561
Where did the stain come from?

1276
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:03,564
I got a miscarriage.

1277
01:14:10,028 --> 01:14:11,488
Are you alright?

1278
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:14,992
Aside from the fact that
my saving's drying up

1279
01:14:14,992 --> 01:14:17,035
and I’m out of a job?

1280
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:19,329
Yeah.

1281
01:14:21,498 --> 01:14:23,625
Pack your things.
You're coming with me.

1282
01:14:25,043 --> 01:14:28,088
I told you to find a woman
to be your girlfriend!

1283
01:14:28,088 --> 01:14:30,257
Not to get some girl pregnant!

1284
01:14:30,841 --> 01:14:33,051
What are you going to feed
your child with Stephanie?

1285
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:35,137
Can you pay for the kid's education?

1286
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:36,763
And you, woman!

1287
01:14:37,264 --> 01:14:39,516
Where are your parents?

1288
01:14:44,271 --> 01:14:45,814
I'm an orphan.

1289
01:14:47,482 --> 01:14:49,359
And I'm not Stephanie.

1290
01:14:49,693 --> 01:14:50,944
My name is Candy.

1291
01:14:54,364 --> 01:14:56,825
Why couldn't you be more careful?

1292
01:15:00,245 --> 01:15:01,914
I had a miscarriage.

1293
01:15:02,372 --> 01:15:04,833
You have nothing to worry about.

1294
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:11,089
Letlet, give me that.

1295
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:15,427
You son of a bitch.

1296
01:15:15,427 --> 01:15:16,929
You knock someone up,

1297
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:20,098
she miscarries,
and you don't even tell me!

1298
01:15:20,098 --> 01:15:23,435
I didn't tell you because
I knew you'd react this way!

1299
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:27,689
Calm down, Ma.

1300
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:31,235
Why did you bring her here, then?

1301
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:32,903
What's your plan?

1302
01:15:33,403 --> 01:15:35,113
Candy will live here with us.

1303
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:39,076
You shouldn't have fought
with your mother.

1304
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:42,246
If I was her,

1305
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:45,749
I wouldn't want my son
to marry a whore, either.

1306
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:48,835
Why did you have to tell her that?

1307
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:51,004
It's better that she knows the truth,

1308
01:15:51,004 --> 01:15:52,965
so we don’t have to keep
looking over our shoulder.

1309
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:54,549
That was your past, Candy.

1310
01:15:54,549 --> 01:15:56,969
We should focus on who you are now!

1311
01:15:57,511 --> 01:15:59,137
This is my choice.

1312
01:15:59,137 --> 01:16:00,931
There's no turning back now.

1313
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:03,892
Where are we staying?

1314
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:19,283
See?

1315
01:16:20,951 --> 01:16:22,661
- Thank you.

1316
01:16:25,163 --> 01:16:27,958
It's still adjusting that's why it's flickering.

1317
01:16:32,504 --> 01:16:34,589
Looks like it.

1318
01:16:59,406 --> 01:17:02,326
I'm never leaving your side.

1319
01:17:03,535 --> 01:17:05,329
Me too.

1320
01:17:06,913 --> 01:17:09,583
For richer or for poorer.

1321
01:17:19,509 --> 01:17:21,678
Do you even know how to do that?

1322
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:25,557
I saw it on TV but it's the
first time I'm trying it!

1323
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:31,104
Here, let me.

1324
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:44,284
See, there are some weevils left!

1325
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:45,285
What?

1326
01:17:45,285 --> 01:17:46,203
Rice weevils.

1327
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:48,246
See? There's a lot!

1328
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:55,379
Go on, finish sweeping.

1329
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:56,588
I'll take care of this!

1330
01:17:56,588 --> 01:17:58,298
I'll sweep.

1331
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:32,582
Want to take turns fanning?

1332
01:18:32,582 --> 01:18:34,793
No, just to go sleep, love.

1333
01:18:36,753 --> 01:18:39,423
I'll take care of us.

1334
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:43,593
I'll take care of you.

1335
01:18:48,348 --> 01:18:51,560
They say you were accepting bribes in
exchange for passing grades?

1336
01:18:54,438 --> 01:18:55,772
Who told you this?

1337
01:18:59,693 --> 01:19:01,737
They were the ones who offered it!

1338
01:19:04,906 --> 01:19:06,616
And you took the bait!

1339
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:08,702
You are the teacher!

1340
01:19:09,536 --> 01:19:12,497
You should have known better!

1341
01:19:16,751 --> 01:19:17,919
Ma'am,

1342
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:21,339
Ma'am I'm sorry, ma'am!

1343
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:26,553
I was desperate at the time!

1344
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:29,681
I really needed the money then.

1345
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:32,517
Ma'am, please don't fire me.

1346
01:19:32,517 --> 01:19:37,147
They told me they also
saw you with a prostitute!

1347
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:41,401
They were there, too!

1348
01:19:41,693 --> 01:19:43,904
I saw them at Area.

1349
01:19:43,904 --> 01:19:46,114
In their uniforms!

1350
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:48,450
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

1351
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:50,202
I'm so sorry!

1352
01:20:16,937 --> 01:20:18,939
Why are you home early?

1353
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:33,703
Is it because of me?

1354
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:36,623
No.

1355
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:42,546
They found out I was taking
money from students

1356
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:45,048
in exchange for a passing grade.

1357
01:20:45,799 --> 01:20:47,050
That was a long time ago.

1358
01:20:47,717 --> 01:20:49,094
You were extorting money?

1359
01:20:49,344 --> 01:20:50,512
For what?

1360
01:20:50,845 --> 01:20:52,681
So I could be with you.

1361
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:54,975
Take you out of the bar,
pay for the hotel--

1362
01:20:54,975 --> 01:20:56,393
- So it is because of me!

1363
01:20:56,393 --> 01:20:57,811
No!

1364
01:21:02,941 --> 01:21:04,776
What's your plan, then?

1365
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:08,405
I'll think of something.

1366
01:21:10,323 --> 01:21:12,284
I'll find another job.

1367
01:21:15,328 --> 01:21:19,791
How's your job application
at the Tourism office?

1368
01:21:20,667 --> 01:21:22,294
It's been three weeks.

1369
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:24,254
They haven't gotten back to you?

1370
01:21:24,921 --> 01:21:26,214
They said there's no vacancy.

1371
01:21:26,214 --> 01:21:28,633
I said they could take
me on as a tour guide,

1372
01:21:28,633 --> 01:21:32,596
or if they have seminars on history--

1373
01:21:33,597 --> 01:21:34,598
Give me that.

1374
01:21:35,765 --> 01:21:36,766
Yes, what is it?

1375
01:21:36,766 --> 01:21:40,437
I'd like two hotdogs.

1376
01:21:40,937 --> 01:21:44,107
And six chicken feet.

1377
01:21:44,107 --> 01:21:45,358
- Okay, miss.

1378
01:21:49,904 --> 01:21:52,407
Your lipstick looks good, miss.

1379
01:21:56,494 --> 01:21:57,537
Here.

1380
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:08,173
Love, please find some change.

1381
01:24:02,495 --> 01:24:04,456
Let's eat!

1382
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:07,959
Where'd this come from?

1383
01:24:07,959 --> 01:24:10,336
I used the money we earned yesterday.

1384
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:17,844
My love, I was thinking
of trying out as a rider.

1385
01:24:17,844 --> 01:24:19,679
Those guys that deliver food?

1386
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:22,307
I'll just borrow my friend's bicycle.

1387
01:24:23,224 --> 01:24:25,393
You think that's a good plan?

1388
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:29,147
Yeah! It's up to you,
if that's what you want.

1389
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:33,568
Can you manage the grill stand by yourself?

1390
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:35,320
- Of course.

1391
01:24:36,362 --> 01:24:37,864
Dig in.

1392
01:24:39,032 --> 01:24:40,784
What time are you coming home?

1393
01:24:40,784 --> 01:24:43,161
Around 11:00 p.m. or by midnight.

1394
01:24:43,161 --> 01:24:44,120
Okay, love.

1395
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:45,371
Take care, alright?

1396
01:24:45,371 --> 01:24:46,664
Love you.

1397
01:24:48,708 --> 01:24:50,085
I promise, love,

1398
01:24:50,835 --> 01:24:52,337
I'll be successful soon.

1399
01:24:53,004 --> 01:24:53,630
Bye!

1400
01:24:53,838 --> 01:24:54,547
Bye!

1401
01:24:54,714 --> 01:24:55,799
Take care!

1402
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:21,074
Love? I'm home.

1403
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:27,288
Love?

1404
01:25:29,165 --> 01:25:30,166
Are you going to take a bath first,

1405
01:25:30,166 --> 01:25:32,377
or are we going to eat?

1406
01:25:33,127 --> 01:25:36,005
Love, what's with all this new stuff?

1407
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:38,675
Aren't we supposed to be saving?

1408
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:43,263
We might not have enough
to pay for electricity and water.

1409
01:25:44,347 --> 01:25:46,599
I've already set aside money for that.

1410
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,519
What do you want to eat?

1411
01:25:52,021 --> 01:25:54,774
I'll just have spicy sardines.

1412
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:05,702
Pick one.

1413
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:10,832
Where did this come from?

1414
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:12,917
I bought it earlier.

1415
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:15,003
Which one do you want?

1416
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:18,047
I'll just have the wings.

1417
01:26:18,047 --> 01:26:20,592
Let me just heat it up, okay?
I'll be right back.

1418
01:26:35,899 --> 01:26:37,442
Even when I was younger,

1419
01:26:37,442 --> 01:26:40,862
I wasn't the type to question
why we didn't have much

1420
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:43,197
Or why we didn't have this or that--

1421
01:26:43,197 --> 01:26:46,159
I just accepted that we need to
work hard to improve our lot in life.

1422
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:47,911
That's great, bro. You're the man.

1423
01:26:47,911 --> 01:26:49,954
Things will get better for all of us.

1424
01:26:49,954 --> 01:26:51,039
We just gotta have faith.

1425
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:52,749
Isn't that right, man?

1426
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:59,047
Dude, my cousin is a prostitute.

1427
01:27:00,298 --> 01:27:02,508
How can I make her stop working?

1428
01:27:13,186 --> 01:27:15,438
Eat up, love.

1429
01:28:10,827 --> 01:28:15,498
Do you have a job interview lined up?

1430
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:23,047
Love?

1431
01:28:24,424 --> 01:28:26,551
Goddamnit Candy, what is this?

1432
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:28,011
Where did those come from?

1433
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:31,597
What's your problem?

1434
01:28:31,597 --> 01:28:33,766
I brought those from my old rental.

1435
01:28:33,766 --> 01:28:36,227
Am I supposed to just throw them away?

1436
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:38,062
Liar!

1437
01:28:38,396 --> 01:28:40,440
What, you think I don't know?

1438
01:28:41,816 --> 01:28:43,568
Is this what I think it is?

1439
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:55,121
So what if it is?

1440
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:16,100
You said--

1441
01:29:16,434 --> 01:29:19,020
For richer or for poorer.

1442
01:29:33,576 --> 01:29:36,746
I was like this when you met me.

1443
01:29:40,124 --> 01:29:43,252
You loved me in spite of that.

1444
01:29:46,798 --> 01:29:50,593
Why do you seem so disgusted now?

1445
01:29:52,595 --> 01:29:55,932
Because I thought you changed.

1446
01:30:08,444 --> 01:30:10,738
Look at these stuff I bought.

1447
01:30:12,657 --> 01:30:14,117
All for you.

1448
01:30:14,909 --> 01:30:17,036
Use it for your job interview!

1449
01:30:17,036 --> 01:30:18,788
Or to those side hustles
from those stupid seminars

1450
01:30:18,788 --> 01:30:20,373
you kept going on about

1451
01:30:20,373 --> 01:30:22,250
that till now are nothing but talk!

1452
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:24,085
You're proud of these?

1453
01:30:24,544 --> 01:30:25,336
These things?

1454
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:27,797
I don't want any of these shit

1455
01:30:27,797 --> 01:30:31,134
if the cost is you whoring out your body!

1456
01:30:31,509 --> 01:30:32,760
I don't want any of it!

1457
01:30:51,445 --> 01:30:54,824
What else do I have to do
to keep you to myself?

1458
01:30:57,660 --> 01:30:59,162
Nothing!

1459
01:31:02,748 --> 01:31:05,293
Nothing, because I'm already yours, Toto.

1460
01:31:05,626 --> 01:31:07,712
It's you I come home to.

1461
01:31:10,882 --> 01:31:12,925
Fuck, you're the only man

1462
01:31:13,217 --> 01:31:17,096
who gets to lay with me for free.

1463
01:31:22,643 --> 01:31:24,604
You are special.

1464
01:31:32,195 --> 01:31:34,447
Well, fuck me sideways.

1465
01:31:38,534 --> 01:31:42,163
I never really stood a chance, did I?

1466
01:31:45,208 --> 01:31:47,585
I had the nerve to walk out of our house,

1467
01:31:47,585 --> 01:31:49,712
and drag you with me,

1468
01:31:53,799 --> 01:31:56,677
but it's all too much for me anyway.

1469
01:32:02,391 --> 01:32:05,144
Is that the reason for all this?

1470
01:32:07,396 --> 01:32:10,191
You wanted to prove something?

1471
01:32:20,910 --> 01:32:22,370
Love…

1472
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,373
Love…

1473
01:32:25,665 --> 01:32:27,959
Please give me some time.

1474
01:32:28,334 --> 01:32:31,087
I can provide for us.

1475
01:32:35,091 --> 01:32:37,009
I can, too.

1476
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:51,816
Let me do what I do best.

1477
01:32:53,317 --> 01:32:56,654
Can't you try something else?

1478
01:32:57,780 --> 01:33:00,116
Something that won't hurt me?

1479
01:33:02,118 --> 01:33:04,870
This is what I'm good at, Toto.

1480
01:33:08,291 --> 01:33:10,918
This is the only thing I'm good at.

1481
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:16,465
Don't deny me the chance
to benefit from it.

1482
01:33:22,972 --> 01:33:26,851
If I did the same thing,
how would you feel?

1483
01:33:55,004 --> 01:33:56,922
Would you like to try?

1484
01:33:57,631 --> 01:34:00,343
I know some people.

1485
01:34:02,011 --> 01:34:05,389
Let's work together for our future.

1486
01:34:08,809 --> 01:34:12,688
Keeping you with me is costing me so much.

1487
01:34:18,069 --> 01:34:20,071
I can't afford to love you.

1488
01:34:23,991 --> 01:34:27,161
Don't love me if that's the case, Toto.

1489
01:34:28,287 --> 01:34:31,457
Quit hoping you'll ever own me.

1490
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,670
You're not the one who
can save me from this.

1491
01:34:38,589 --> 01:34:41,675
I was fated to be like this.

1492
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:47,515
What if you're wrong?

1493
01:35:31,809 --> 01:35:33,102
Toto.

1494
01:35:43,112 --> 01:35:46,240
Candy and I broke up, mother.

1495
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:50,077
That's good.

1496
01:35:57,960 --> 01:36:00,379
Mother, forgive me.

1497
01:36:05,593 --> 01:36:08,220
Damn it, I've lived this long

1498
01:36:09,638 --> 01:36:12,975
and I still don't have anything
to show for it.

1499
01:36:13,350 --> 01:36:17,605
It's starting to feel like our
dreams are never going to happen.

1500
01:36:18,022 --> 01:36:20,524
A large house…

1501
01:36:22,735 --> 01:36:25,112
with a swimming pool

1502
01:36:25,738 --> 01:36:28,199
and a wide garden…

1503
01:36:28,365 --> 01:36:29,366
Son,

1504
01:36:32,328 --> 01:36:35,080
those are just wishes.

1505
01:36:35,831 --> 01:36:39,835
All wishes are likely to not be granted.

1506
01:36:40,169 --> 01:36:43,756
Besides, I never wanted
those things for myself

1507
01:36:44,089 --> 01:36:46,300
but for you and Letlet…

1508
01:36:46,634 --> 01:36:49,053
and your future children.

1509
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:54,558
But if you can't grant that,

1510
01:36:55,267 --> 01:36:58,854
that doesn't mean I'll think less of you.

1511
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:01,440
Sometimes luck has a lot to do with it.

1512
01:37:02,024 --> 01:37:04,151
If we get lucky, then,
praise the Lord!

1513
01:37:04,151 --> 01:37:07,696
But if not, then that's that.

1514
01:37:09,156 --> 01:37:13,202
I will provide for you until
my dying breath.

1515
01:37:15,204 --> 01:37:19,083
But-- Son,

1516
01:37:20,709 --> 01:37:22,962
it's not too late!

1517
01:37:23,212 --> 01:37:25,881
You're still young!

1518
01:37:25,881 --> 01:37:28,551
We all have our time.

1519
01:37:30,386 --> 01:37:35,391
Alright, you don't need to
hand over your wages anymore.

1520
01:37:35,391 --> 01:37:38,477
You'll just have to pay the--

1521
01:37:38,477 --> 01:37:42,064
water, electricity, and internet, okay?

1522
01:37:42,815 --> 01:37:46,360
Then everything else is all yours, son.

1523
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:48,946
Save as much as you can,

1524
01:37:48,946 --> 01:37:51,782
until you can stand on your own.

1525
01:37:51,782 --> 01:37:52,908
Okay?

1526
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:57,705
Thanks, mother.

1527
01:38:00,791 --> 01:38:03,377
But I got fired from teaching.

1528
01:38:03,919 --> 01:38:05,921
It's a long story.

1529
01:38:07,590 --> 01:38:10,217
Well, forget about that, son.

1530
01:38:10,217 --> 01:38:13,262
You'll find another job, okay?

1531
01:38:13,262 --> 01:38:15,598
All right, enough moping around.

1532
01:38:15,598 --> 01:38:19,101
Help me mix this.

1533
01:38:52,718 --> 01:38:54,261
Hi.

1534
01:38:54,762 --> 01:38:55,429
How's it going?

1535
01:38:55,429 --> 01:38:56,680
- Good. I'm Candy.

1536
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:57,931
You want to hang out with me?

1537
01:38:57,931 --> 01:38:59,308
- Sure.

1538
01:39:50,818 --> 01:39:54,321
The more expensive something is,
the more that people scramble for it.

1539
01:39:54,321 --> 01:39:57,116
But I'm tired of bidding and playing "pick me."

1540
01:39:57,491 --> 01:40:03,288
We have to accept that there
are things beyond our budget.

1541
01:40:03,288 --> 01:40:07,835
We need to rid ourselves of that temptation.

1542
01:40:08,085 --> 01:40:12,047
Yes, we need to erase them from our minds.

1543
01:40:12,464 --> 01:40:14,550
No matter the cost.

1544
01:40:15,050 --> 01:40:17,886
No matter how much you love them.

1545
01:40:20,556 --> 01:40:24,727
But I'm grateful to have met you,
and for the experience of you.

1546
01:40:24,727 --> 01:40:27,312
I will keep improving myself

1547
01:40:27,312 --> 01:40:29,732
not so that I could make you mine,

1548
01:40:29,732 --> 01:40:32,651
but to add value to myself.

1549
01:40:42,411 --> 01:40:45,622
It's not your role to save me from this.

1550
01:40:46,248 --> 01:40:48,208
This is my fate.

1551
01:41:08,812 --> 01:41:10,856
What if you're wrong?

1552
01:41:19,948 --> 01:41:21,742
What's wrong?

1553
01:41:21,742 --> 01:41:23,535
Are you okay?

1554
01:41:26,163 --> 01:41:30,083
Nothing, maybe-- Maybe it's just the alcohol.

1555
01:41:31,126 --> 01:41:33,712
Let's go take a shower together.

1556
01:41:33,712 --> 01:41:35,964
You've got to pay me
more if you want more.

1557
01:41:35,964 --> 01:41:37,341
Oh yeah?

1558
01:41:37,341 --> 01:41:38,550
Why?

1559
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:50,187
Cause I'm special.
