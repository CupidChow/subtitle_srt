21
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,220
(Lu Li, Programmer, Love Fighter)

22
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,080
What are you doing?

23
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,839
You don't have to cut your hair
just because you passed the first test!

24
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,320
There are no female programmers
at Enchant Technology.

25
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,479
Goodness. What year are we in?

26
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,839
Are they still
discriminating against women?

27
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,320
We can file a complaint, you know?

28
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,080
They do have female employees.

29
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,240
But I looked up the employment record
for the programmers in the past years.

30
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:38,679
The passing rate
for female programmers is close to zero.

31
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:41,520
I don't want to take any more risks.

32
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:43,240
I can grow my hair back.

33
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:46,039
But I only have one chance.

34
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:47,440
Li.

35
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:50,960
You don't have to cut off your hair
to dress up like a guy.

36
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:52,479
Leave it to me.

37
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,080
Keep cutting.

38
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,919
That much?

39
00:03:02,119 --> 00:03:02,759
The shorter, the better.

40
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,080
After this, we'll dye it.

41
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,479
After dying it, we'll give it a perm.

42
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,839
Must we?

43
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,679
Yes. The uglier, the better.

44
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,520
If I knew about this,
I wouldn't have cut off my hair.

45
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,559
Don't you know there's such a thing

46
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:22,080
as a wig in this world?

47
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:24,800
Then what am I going to do
with the hair I cut off?

48
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:25,880
Hide it in the back.

49
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,399
Right. No one will be able to tell.

50
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,720
You can still dress like a girl
when you're not at work.

51
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,020
(Jiang Yicheng, CEO of Enchant)

52
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Rebar, cement, and iron panels.

53
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:02,160
The three are intertwined in an X-shape.

54
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,039
It's the collision
of the primitive and the modern.

55
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,160
It is the cry of an imprisoned life.

56
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:10,039
It's the accusation
of an environment that has been ravaged.

57
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:13,880
It is the struggle
between iteration and immortality.

58
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,079
Is that what you thought
I would say, Miss Qin?

59
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,839
Then what is your opinion, Mr. Jiang?

60
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,760
Don't you think it looks familiar?

61
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:31,839
In mathematics,
it is the multiplication sign.

62
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,839
In the computer programming language,

63
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:35,640
it is a pointer declarator.

64
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,959
And through web filtering,

65
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,160
it is considered a sensitive word.

66
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,799
Sexy.

67
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:46,160
It seems that art

68
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,440
has no value in Mr. Jiang's heart.

69
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,279
The value of art lies
in the emotional connotations

70
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:53,640
given to it by different people.

71
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,720
Emotions do not exist
in the world of programming.

72
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,959
Your attire matches

73
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,079
the exhibition hall well.

74
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,239
It's just a coincidence.

75
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,359
It means

76
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,519
that I have a heart
that wishes to become one with art.

77
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,160
Over there is a birthday gift
I designed for myself.

78
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,040
What do you think of it, Mr. Jiang?

79
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,239
Do you like it?

80
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,279
You have a unique preference.

81
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,679
This is my lucky item.

82
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:40,920
My Chinese zodiac is the rooster.

83
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,600
What is your Chinese zodiac, Mr. Jiang?

84
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,480
The weasel.

85
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,040
This is so uncomfortable.

86
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,959
Suck it in.

87
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,679
Hurry up.

88
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:00,640
Almost there.

89
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,839
It's too tight. I can't take it anymore.

90
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,000
No. I can't stand it anymore!

91
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,359
Get back here.

92
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,079
Let him have the menu.

93
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:37,079
Sir, would you like to order now?

94
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:43,679
An iced Americano

95
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:44,480
and a milkshake.

96
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:45,799
All right.

97
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,320
We did it!

98
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:53,160
You look good.

99
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,079
Take another look in the mirror.

100
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,119
Do you believe in love at first sight?

101
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:01,920
Love at first sight only happens
at the age of 15 or 16.

102
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:03,279
And now...

103
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,880
Well, you checked out my education,
appearance, and family background

104
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,559
before coming here, didn't you?

105
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:09,959
Didn't you do the same, Mr. Jiang?

106
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,959
No. I was forced to come.

107
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,040
Everything looks good.

108
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,640
Fix this spot here.

109
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,279
One minute and twenty-five seconds.

110
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:22,239
Mr. Jiang?

111
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,119
Miss Xu. Please have a seat.

112
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,839
Is he meeting two girls at once?

113
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,320
Jerk.

114
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:34,119
What is the meaning of this?

115
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:38,040
These are some of the laws I summed up

116
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:39,279
from my experience
of arranged blind dates.

117
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,440
Blind dates are just like interviews.

118
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:45,720
Only the more
qualified candidate will be accepted.

119
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,600
Competition will also allow
both parties to know their shortcomings

120
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:50,359
and allow them to improve
for their next blind date.

121
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,959
It saves both of our time.

122
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,679
What is with that attitude?

123
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,359
Do you think I had to see you?

124
00:07:58,559 --> 00:08:00,079
Mr. Jiang, your actions

125
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,000
are incredibly rude.

126
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:04,720
Would you like
to know the conclusions I've made?

127
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,839
Miss Qin is like the Linux system.

128
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,160
Good statistics, but hard to operate.

129
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,359
And Miss Xu is like the Windows system.

130
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,239
Easy to operate but hangs easily.

131
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,600
What do you guys think?

132
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:17,880
- Jerk.
- Jerk.

133
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,600
Lu Li. Look!

134
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,400
Hey! You should apologize
for spilling on someone!

135
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,200
You...

136
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,799
System crashes can be fixed.

137
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,440
Should I contact someone for you?

138
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,719
Got rid of another two.

139
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,520
They spilled the water.

140
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,559
If you want compensation,

141
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:00,799
I can give you their contacts.

142
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,719
I'm a victim too. See.

143
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,559
You shameless jerk!

144
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:11,599
Go for it, Lu Li!

145
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:31,520
Your hair is wet.

146
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,919
But it's not?

147
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,039
I don't need any compensation.

148
00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:43,599
Wait. What do you mean you don't...

149
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,320
Come on. Let's go.

150
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:44,919
That jerk...

151
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,919
- Let's go.
- But...

152
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,359
They spilled water on you!

153
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,080
That guy is way too girly.

154
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,599
Hold on. I'm telling you. These jerks
think they can do anything they want

155
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,400
just because they have the looks.

156
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,080
I should've spilled
another glass of water on him!

157
00:09:58,119 --> 00:09:59,280
It's not like he did it on purpose.

158
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:01,880
Just take it as a waterproof test
for the wig.

159
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:02,840
I think it worked well.

160
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:03,760
What's good about that?

161
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,919
Just wait and see.

162
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,039
Professor Li.

163
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,020
(Post to Weibo)
I'm free in the afternoon.

164
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,640
All right. Please send me the address.

165
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,880
I think

166
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,479
you're better off

167
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,280
going on further study
than getting a job.

168
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,880
After that, you can join
the academic department and do research.

169
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:07,919
Or teach in a university.

170
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,760
Professor, I know you're only thinking
of what's best for me.

171
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,599
But I have my own plans.

172
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,119
Your parents wanted you
to become a civil servant, didn't they?

173
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,039
Why didn't you take the exam?

174
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,239
Professor,

175
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,440
can't we talk about something easier?

176
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,159
You always bring that up
when I come here.

177
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,000
These flowers look nice.

178
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:31,679
All right. As long as you know
what you want.

179
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:33,640
I called you here today to introduce you

180
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,239
to a senior of yours
from the same field.

181
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,440
Senior?

182
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,200
Yes. His name is Jiang Yicheng.

183
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:43,359
He should be here soon.

184
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,520
Yicheng, you're here.

185
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,479
You always arrive before me.

186
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:00,960
That makes me look bad.

187
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,799
Cheeky kid.

188
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,559
Sit.

189
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,180
(Made by Tunxi Hukai Ink Factory)

190
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,039
By the way,

191
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:28,280
did you say

192
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,440
you wanted to introduce someone to me?

193
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:30,359
Yes.

194
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,840
Lu.

195
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,640
Your senior is here.

196
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:36,599
Come out and greet him.

197
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:38,000
Coming.

198
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,679
Have some tea.

199
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,620
(Hello, Senior)

200
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,420
(Hello, Senior)

201
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,039
(Hello, Senior)
Is this some kind of welcome ceremony?

202
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,039
Hello, senior.

203
00:12:58,719 --> 00:12:59,239
Hello.

204
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,679
Professor. Senior.
I have something to do.

205
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,559
I'll take my leave first.

206
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:05,799
Stop.

207
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,080
Why are you wearing that?

208
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:18,599
I'm ugly.

209
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:22,719
Well, I want to see
just how ugly you are.

210
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,559
Lu, what happened to your face?

211
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,359
Professor, I got ink on my face.

212
00:13:35,719 --> 00:13:37,119
You guys carry on.

213
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:37,840
Bye!

214
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,640
I...

215
00:13:58,119 --> 00:14:00,000
Is that the excellent talent
you wanted to introduce to me?

216
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,280
No. She's not usually like that.

217
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,000
I was going to recommend her
to join your company

218
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,239
and have you guide her.

219
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,320
But she...

220
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,919
I'm afraid I'll have to let you down.

221
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:11,679
I don't accept
female apprentices anymore.

222
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,000
Yicheng, are you still bothered

223
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,039
by that incident?

224
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,119
Thank you for the tea.

225
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,159
Come to my place next time.

226
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,039
I'll treat you to tea.

227
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,460
(Mose Time)

228
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:02,000
(Next, let's invite
our outstanding graduate)

229
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,559
(and guest of honor,)

230
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,479
(Jiang Yicheng,
CEO of Enchant Technology,)

231
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:09,400
(to present the award to the recipient.)

232
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,320
Congratulations.

233
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,119
Thank you.

234
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,479
Quick. Help me fix it.

235
00:15:13,599 --> 00:15:14,239
Is my hair messy?

236
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,479
No. It's fine.

237
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:16,559
It's time for the picture.

238
00:15:16,719 --> 00:15:17,520
I'll stand next to you.

239
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:18,239
Okay.

240
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,020
(Yiming)

241
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:32,799
Yiming.

242
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,320
You're famous.

243
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,479
For what?

244
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:39,760
My outstanding skills
of attracting investment?

245
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:42,000
I sent it to you.
Take a look at it yourself.

246
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,679
He sent it to me.

247
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,960
(We shouldn't just let jerks
do whatever they want.)

248
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,000
(We need to speak up)

249
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:55,760
(and let everyone
see how horrible he is.)

250
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,679
Blind dates are just like interviews.

251
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,280
Only the more qualified candidate

252
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,520
will be accepted.

253
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,960
Jerk!

254
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,000
They spilled the water.

255
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,280
If you need compensation,

256
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,439
I can give you their contacts.

257
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,640
I don't need any compensation.

258
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:19,280
That two-faced guy.

259
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,680
(Your actions have violated my privacy.)

260
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,640
(I demand you delete
that video immediately.)

261
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,653
(little Qi)

262
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:29,760
(No.)

263
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,160
No?

264
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,560
All right.

265
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,420
(Enchant)

266
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,719
I don't know
how they ran the tests for it.

267
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,760
I tried it out, and I think
there's something wrong with the design.

268
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:00,760
Same here.

269
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Hurry up. We're late.

270
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,439
Um, I need to use the washroom.

271
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:29,319
If they call my name,

272
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,359
please let them know.

273
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,239
Thanks.

274
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:32,280
Okay.

275
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,400
I...

276
00:18:51,479 --> 00:18:52,000
Somebody!

277
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:52,560
I'm not.

278
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,199
A peeping tom!

279
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:54,439
A peeping tom!

280
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,079
I didn't!

281
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:56,199
Catch him! Don't run!

282
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:56,959
Please let me explain!

283
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,319
Catch him!

284
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,040
What's going on?

285
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:58,400
Don't run!

286
00:18:58,479 --> 00:18:58,800
I'm not!

287
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,599
You peeping tom!

288
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,280
I'm not!

289
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:00,839
Catch him!

290
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,719
I'm really not!

291
00:19:01,719 --> 00:19:02,239
Don't run!

292
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,359
Catch him!

293
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,479
I'm not a peeping tom!

294
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,359
I'm really not!

295
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,227
(Resume)

296
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,000
I didn't look!

297
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:12,680
I mean it!

298
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,400
I'm not a peeping tom!

299
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,119
Don't touch my hair!

300
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,199
I'm not from your company.

301
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,359
If you're not, then why are you here?

302
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,199
That's right. Why?

303
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:21,920
How did you get in here?

304
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,119
He is a kid who came for an interview.

305
00:19:26,439 --> 00:19:28,239
Mr. Chen, he tried to go inside
the women's washroom to peep

306
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:29,640
in broad daylight.

307
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,560
I didn't!

308
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,520
What do you mean you didn't?

309
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,880
Mr. Chen, you must speak up for us.

310
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,520
I heard everything.

311
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:37,880
He was probably too nervous
and got to the wrong washroom.

312
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,959
I apologize on his behalf.

313
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,239
Fine. You got lucky today.

314
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:46,400
You ran into our nicest director.

315
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,959
Don't get to the wrong washroom anymore.

316
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,479
He got off easy.

317
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,599
- Let's go.
- Right.

318
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:51,640
You got lucky this time.

319
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,300
(Chen Yiming, Research and Development,
Technical Director)

320
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,319
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

321
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:13,319
Hello, Mr. Chen.

322
00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:16,199
Your resume is impressive.

323
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,359
Don't be so nervous
during the interview.

324
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,439
Goodbye, Mr. Chen.

325
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,719
(What a kind person.)

326
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,239
Good morning, Mr. Jiang.

327
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:03,040
Good morning, Mr. Jiang.

328
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:06,599
Good morning, Mr. Jiang.

329
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,160
Good morning, Mr. Jiang.

330
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,079
Thank you.

331
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:17,959
I'll take my leave now. Goodbye.

332
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:24,599
I'm here for the interview.

333
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,239
Where's your resume?

334
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,560
I want to see
the director of legal affairs.

335
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,479
He wouldn't pick up my calls.

336
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:31,199
No one wants to answer their boss's call

337
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,319
on their holiday.

338
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:33,119
What do you need from him?

339
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:34,239
I want a lawyer's letter.

340
00:21:35,239 --> 00:21:36,119
Wait for me
to finish the interviews first.

341
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,740
(Resume, Lu Li
Siping District, Xinhai)

342
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:46,560
I don't need any compensation.

343
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,119
(He fell right into my hands.)

344
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:52,400
You did well on the written test.

345
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:54,839
Let's move onto some lighter questions.

346
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:56,000
Please.

347
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,520
What advantages
do you think you have over others?

348
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,839
I...

349
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,599
I was first in exams

350
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:08,719
and overall evaluation of my major

351
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:09,920
during my school years.

352
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:13,839
I have also participated in many
national and international competitions.

353
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:16,239
For example, ACM, TCO,

354
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:17,439
Hacker Cup, and others.

355
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:20,040
I also won a lot of medals.

356
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:22,280
I got decent rankings as well.

357
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,239
It's the first time I've seen someone

358
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,000
with a resume almost identical to yours.

359
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,599
There are a lot of people
who are book-smart.

360
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,520
Good grades don't guarantee
that you can perform well.

361
00:22:41,719 --> 00:22:43,800
Lu Li, can you tell us

362
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,400
why you want to become a programmer?

363
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,959
Because...

364
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:53,319
Because I think

365
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,719
my life is like a program.

366
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:57,079
Before writing a code,

367
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,000
I would always write out the flow
in a clear and logical manner.

368
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:03,400
Just as I like to plan my life.

369
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,000
I know what I want to do,

370
00:23:08,439 --> 00:23:10,119
and I know who I like.

371
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:13,520
In pursuit of my dreams and love,

372
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,000
I keep optimizing my own algorithm
to add more functions.

373
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,880
Although there are times
when I run into errors,

374
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,760
as long as the system doesn't crash,

375
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,760
I'll try to find all the vulnerabilities

376
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,680
and work on it
until it's a program I'm content with.

377
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:30,839
I hope my life

378
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,079
will run as smoothly as the program.

379
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,959
Good. Don't be too nervous.

380
00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:48,239
We meet again.

381
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:52,599
Do you remember me?

382
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,400
You must've been mad that
you got water spilled on you, right?

383
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,959
I wasn't. It was just an accident.

384
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,359
Why do you look like a girl?

385
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,359
I...

386
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,599
I'm just shorter and smaller.

387
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,800
But my skills are good.

388
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:21,359
Besides, I don't think Enchant
is a company

389
00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:23,520
that judges people
by their appearance, right?

390
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,599
Of course not.

391
00:24:25,719 --> 00:24:26,880
But do you want
to know your interview results?

392
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,079
I can tell you that right now.

393
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,439
You've been eliminated.

394
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,000
I want to know the reason.

395
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,000
Because I hate being lied to.

396
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:50,439
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have...

397
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,719
You're the one who said
you didn't need any compensation,

398
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:52,719
but you're also the one
who took the video.

399
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,160
Don't you think
it's a little late for that now?

400
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:55,920
What video?

401
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,439
I hate liars

402
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,599
who are two-faced.

403
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,000
Delete the video immediately.

404
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:14,280
Otherwise, you'll be getting
a letter from my lawyer.

405
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,680
Tell the director of legal affairs
to answer my call.

406
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:25,000
Sorry.

407
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:34,239
Was that jerk Jiang Yicheng?

408
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:38,000
Today's interview

409
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,599
was a real-life disaster drill.

410
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:43,040
It's dangerous

411
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,280
without backup.

412
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,119
It's my fault.

413
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:48,719
I should have annoyed anyone but him.

414
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:52,800
Li, you may not like to hear this,

415
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,280
but I know you want to join Enchant
Technology because of Jiang Yicheng.

416
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,000
But do you really know him?

417
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,839
You heard what he said that day.

418
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,800
Everything he said is exactly like
those quotes from scums on the internet.

419
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,800
He's not scum.

420
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:11,239
And there is a logical explanation
for his actions that day.

421
00:26:12,479 --> 00:26:15,280
I think he didn't want
to go on that blind date.

422
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,199
And he didn't

423
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,920
want any of those girls
to have feelings for him.

424
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,119
That's why he said those mean things.

425
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:22,359
You're blinded
from your tinted view of him.

426
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,439
With my years of experience in dating,

427
00:26:24,719 --> 00:26:25,839
guys like him

428
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,560
who have looks and money

429
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,359
only think of love as a game.

430
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:31,719
Experience in dating?

431
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,000
Where are all the guys you dated?

432
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:34,319
How come I've never seen any of them?

433
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,599
Feelings come and go.

434
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:38,640
It was over before you got to meet them.

435
00:26:39,479 --> 00:26:40,239
Either way,

436
00:26:40,439 --> 00:26:41,880
hurry up and delete that video.

437
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:44,040
Fine. I'll delete it right now.

438
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,040
(Please accept my apology, Mr. Jiang.)

439
00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:10,239
(It was my ignorance)

440
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:12,479
(that caused an innocent man
like you to be cyber bullied.)

441
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,199
(I don't dare ask for your forgiveness,)

442
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,239
(but please don't blame Lu Li.)

443
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:18,239
(He didn't know anything about this.)

444
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,839
(Please give him another chance.)

445
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,040
(No.)

446
00:28:10,719 --> 00:28:11,400
Nice.

447
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:17,079
Did you see
the list of successful candidates?

448
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,280
I'm not interested in newbies.

449
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,239
Are you sure

450
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:22,359
you won't consider Lu Li?

451
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:24,199
With how frail he looks,

452
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:25,319
if I have him work overtime
for a couple of days,

453
00:28:25,439 --> 00:28:26,920
I'm sure he'll already
be threatening to quit.

454
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:28,719
Besides, he's way too girly.

455
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,119
I just think

456
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:32,520
it's not often that I meet someone
with a resume almost like yours.

457
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,040
It's a shame if we don't nurture it.

458
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,040
If you're so kind and generous,

459
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:37,760
you should go and guide
that Jiang Zitong.

460
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,560
Never mind then.

461
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,680
I just thought it would be interesting
to see you guys work together.

462
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,959
Work is dull, after all.

463
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,280
There were two other female programmers

464
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,680
that had pretty good qualifications.

465
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:49,560
Won't you consider it?

466
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,160
I'm hungry.
You're treating me to supper.

467
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,239
You always change the topic
when I bring that subject up.

468
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,640
Why is it my treat again? What gives?

469
00:28:58,199 --> 00:29:00,560
Because I spent
all my money on the project.

470
00:29:00,959 --> 00:29:02,959
So my money is for you to spend,
isn't it?

471
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,839
Remember to pick up my phone too.

472
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:33,319
I'm sorry. This seat is taken.

473
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,520
Sorry.

474
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:37,959
Coming.

475
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,119
What took you so long? You're late.

476
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,520
I was stuck in traffic.

477
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:47,640
Hurry up and sit down.

478
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:51,280
You got so many, Mom.

479
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,520
I got all the most expensive

480
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,560
and delicious things for you.

481
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:56,839
Now, eat.

482
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,479
Mom, I can't eat that much.

483
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,400
Eat.

484
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,160
Look.

485
00:30:04,239 --> 00:30:05,959
I bought a bouquet of flowers

486
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,520
for my friend's hotel opening.

487
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,400
It cost me a lot of money.

488
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,119
You better make sure
to eat my money's worth.

489
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:12,040
Do you understand?

490
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,239
Listen.

491
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:16,319
Be good today.

492
00:30:16,479 --> 00:30:17,599
Don't make your mother angry.

493
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,760
You know my temper.

494
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,119
If I get angry,

495
00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:22,959
the entire dining hall

496
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:24,199
will know your name is Lu Li.

497
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,040
I'm telling you.

498
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:28,000
I brought you here today

499
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:29,560
to take a good look at the other girls.

500
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,000
Look at those girls.

501
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,239
They learn to paint
and play instruments.

502
00:30:36,199 --> 00:30:37,079
Look at that one.

503
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,920
Look at how nice she looks
in an evening gown and high heels.

504
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,359
But you're always just messing around
with your computers.

505
00:30:44,239 --> 00:30:45,760
I shouldn't have
let you study computer science.

506
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,680
Oh, you're here. It's been a while.

507
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:54,760
Thank you.

508
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,800
Why is she here?

509
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,880
Who?

510
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,079
Is my lipstick still there?

511
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,319
Is my makeup all right?

512
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:01,400
It looks fine.

513
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,359
Do I still have time to touch up?

514
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,599
Why did she come here as well?

515
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:06,959
Huang Caixia.

516
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,719
Oh, it's you.

517
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:14,520
I thought you wouldn't come

518
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:15,640
to such a small event.

519
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,599
You're as fast with your words

520
00:31:18,719 --> 00:31:20,800
as you were back in high school.

521
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,359
You haven't changed as well.

522
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,920
You still talk as slow as ever.

523
00:31:24,479 --> 00:31:25,680
I almost dozed off.

524
00:31:26,239 --> 00:31:28,520
Did you eat too much
that you became sleepy?

525
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,719
Oh, we haven't finished yet.

526
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,400
Mom.

527
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:33,400
Mom.

528
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:36,560
Son.

529
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,079
Why are you here?

530
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,359
Dad asked me to pick you up.

531
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,760
Mom, is my makeup all right?

532
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:44,199
Do I have time to touch up?

533
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:47,760
Caixia, this is my son.

534
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,959
This is my deskmate in high school.
You can call her Auntie Huang.

535
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:51,680
Hello, Auntie Huang.

536
00:31:52,719 --> 00:31:53,719
Hello.

537
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,359
Let me introduce to you as well.

538
00:31:55,479 --> 00:31:56,560
This is my daughter.

539
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,439
Get up and greet them.

540
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,719
Hello.
I'm just going to touch up my makeup.

541
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,839
I... Where are you going?

542
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:12,000
What's wrong with her?

543
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:14,199
She's just like you, isn't she?

544
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:15,760
Clumsy.

545
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,239
Didn't you look where you were going?

546
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,040
You even fell into the pool.

547
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,800
Mom, why haven't I ever heard you

548
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,920
mention that auntie from earlier?

549
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,040
We're not close.
Why would I mention her?

550
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:06,199
I think she has

551
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,120
a gentle voice.

552
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,280
And her son looked nice.

553
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,239
Yes, everyone is gentle and nice.
Except for your mother, right?

554
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,520
No.

555
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,600
Dry your hair yourself.

556
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:36,479
Hello.
I'm just going to touch up my makeup.

557
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,879
Weird woman.

558
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,399
I got you some milk.

559
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,560
Here. Finish it.

560
00:34:50,959 --> 00:34:54,159
Mom, the doctor says I need rest.
I shouldn't see other people.

561
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:58,000
Oh, did I arrange
too many blind dates for you

562
00:34:58,239 --> 00:34:59,399
that you didn't get enough rest?

563
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,959
As long as you get what I mean.

564
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:04,280
If you found someone you like,

565
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,760
I wouldn't have to arrange
so many blind dates for you.

566
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:09,000
If you ask me, I think Miss Xu

567
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,040
and Miss Qin were nice.

568
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:13,399
Did you not like either of them?

569
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,879
Mom. Our preferences are different.

570
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,280
Don't bother anymore.

571
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:20,159
You can tell me your preference.

572
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:23,399
I can find someone for you
based on your preferences.

573
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,199
This.

574
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,399
This is your type?

575
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,199
It's my first time
meeting that girl too.

576
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:44,479
But if you like her,

577
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:46,760
I can always ask for you.

578
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:50,800
But the girl's mother isn't someone

579
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:52,840
easy to get along with.

580
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,159
Why would I like such a weird woman?

581
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,280
Son, you aren't still thinking

582
00:36:04,479 --> 00:36:06,560
about that girl before, right?

583
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,239
I'm asleep.

584
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:22,080
Strange woman.

585
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,520
Mr. Jiang, have you had breakfast?

586
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,479
You have one minute. Talk.

587
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,639
About the video,

588
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:49,320
I thought I should apologize in person.

589
00:36:49,439 --> 00:36:50,760
It was wrong of us to record you

590
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,679
without your consent.

591
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,080
But we've deleted the video.

592
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:53,959
And I've messaged

593
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,199
all the people who commented
and shared the video

594
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:56,280
to explain

595
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,320
in hopes that it would clear up
some of their misunderstanding of you.

596
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,239
I said what I said and did what I did.

597
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,239
There's nothing to misunderstand.

598
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,080
But I know you did that on purpose.

599
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:04,560
How would you know
that wasn't my true intention?

600
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,639
Because you're not that kind of person.

601
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:06,959
Would you believe someone you met twice?

602
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,520
Are you naive or dumb?

603
00:37:08,879 --> 00:37:11,120
An explanation doesn't always
mean you'll be understood.

604
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:12,919
But sometimes, you can understand
someone even without an explanation.

605
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,000
Your one minute is up.
You can leave now.

606
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,679
Can you please stop following me?

607
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,439
Lu Li, was it?

608
00:37:35,439 --> 00:37:36,560
I accept your apology.

609
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,360
Now stop following me, okay?

610
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:57,639
We meet again, Mr. Jiang.

611
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,760
Do you like to run outdoors?

612
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,919
I've said what I have to say.

613
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:00,879
We've settled our personal matters.

614
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,120
Now, we can talk about official matters.

615
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,479
These are some of the projects
I was involved in

616
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,719
and some of the programs I designed.

617
00:38:04,879 --> 00:38:05,600
I hope you can take a look
at them when you're free.

618
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:06,639
Do I look that free to you?

619
00:38:07,879 --> 00:38:09,280
You can take a look at it
when you have time!

620
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:13,919
Mr. Jiang.

621
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,639
(Project Proposal)

622
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:22,040
Mr. Jiang, have you seen
the documents I gave you?

623
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:23,320
Are you finished?

624
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,199
If I meet the hiring criteria,

625
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:26,679
can you give me another chance?

626
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,040
There's no use for you
to keep hovering around me.

627
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,800
You should use the time
to apply for other companies.

628
00:38:29,879 --> 00:38:31,679
I don't have
an off-site disaster backup plan.

629
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,800
Enchant Technology is my only option.

630
00:38:33,959 --> 00:38:35,199
We've filled up all the positions.

631
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:41,679
Filled up?

632
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:54,080
Mr. Jiang.

633
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:03,760
Come over here.

634
00:39:06,439 --> 00:39:07,159
Come on.

635
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:16,000
Why are you here, Old Jiang?

636
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,679
Mr. Jiang,
we shouldn't do this at the company.

637
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,199
I made sure the place is empty.

638
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,080
Why didn't you think about that

639
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:28,000
when you made
your mother angry last night?

640
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,000
Well, it gave you a chance

641
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,639
to prove your love, didn't it?

642
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,959
I slept on the couch last night.

643
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,560
Well, your wife
made you sleep on the couch.

644
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:37,479
Not me.

645
00:39:37,544 --> 00:39:38,744
If you make her mad again,

646
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,080
I'll make sure not
to leave you a single cent.

647
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:41,239
Will you give everything to Jiang Zitong?

648
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,919
She'll fritter it all away.

649
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,479
Mr. Jiang, your water.

650
00:39:46,479 --> 00:39:49,000
Dad, you look good in this suit.

651
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:50,560
It's new.

652
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,120
It's good.
It has a nice finish around the waist.

653
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,893
(Rock climbing,
life goes on, sport goes on)

654
00:40:08,959 --> 00:40:10,840
Give this card to your boss, Mr. Jiang.

655
00:40:10,959 --> 00:40:12,800
Tell him that if he doesn't cooperate

656
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,199
at 12 noon today,

657
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,919
I'll reclaim all the floors

658
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,479
of your company.

659
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,879
You'll be out of a job then.

660
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:22,639
Dad, I know you're being forced too.

661
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,679
Let's work together!

662
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,840
Not scheming against my wife

663
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:26,360
is the best cooperation.

664
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,800
Mr. Jiang.

665
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:36,600
Why are you laughing?
His wife is my mom.

666
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,040
What is he acting
all high and mighty about?

667
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,320
Give me the water.

668
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,000
Go get busy.

669
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,719
Okay.

670
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:00,399
Mr. Jiang.

671
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:03,399
Did Old Jiang send you too?

672
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:04,360
Is there a virus in your brain?

673
00:41:04,439 --> 00:41:05,439
Do I need to fix it for you?

674
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,919
This is my analysis report.

675
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,919
The object of analysis is me.

676
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,199
And the reference objects
are the other applicants you hired.

677
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,479
According to the data,

678
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,760
my performance in all aspects

679
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,159
is superior to theirs.

680
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,919
And I had the highest ranking
in the competition

681
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,520
we participated in together.

682
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,199
So?

683
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,719
So I don't understand

684
00:41:33,879 --> 00:41:35,479
why they were hired, and I wasn't.

685
00:41:36,479 --> 00:41:37,840
Can't you hear
the underlying message in my words?

686
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,080
Don't you understand
that I used the excuse

687
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:40,520
that the positions
were filled to reject you?

688
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,439
Even if you reject me,

689
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:44,760
you should tell me what the problem is.

690
00:41:44,879 --> 00:41:47,120
I'll find a solution
and tackle the problem.

691
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,580
(Rock climbing,
life goes on, sport goes on)

692
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,879
Can you solve

693
00:42:00,439 --> 00:42:01,360
anything?

694
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,560
Yes.

695
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:04,840
Come with me.

696
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,000
Slowly now.

697
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:19,000
Do you not like places like these?

698
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,439
I don't like anything
that's troublesome,

699
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,080
energy-consuming, and dangerous.

700
00:42:27,399 --> 00:42:29,959
Mr. Jiang. This is...

701
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:31,360
Lu.

702
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,280
It's still early.

703
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:36,879
Why don't we go for a round

704
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,320
before we go for dinner?

705
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,040
(If he doesn't cooperate,)

706
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,320
(I'll reclaim all the floors)

707
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:43,320
(of your company.)

708
00:42:43,919 --> 00:42:44,840
No problem.

709
00:42:44,959 --> 00:42:46,399
I'll wait for you guys over there.

710
00:42:46,919 --> 00:42:47,919
I'll go and get changed.

711
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,639
Mr. Jiang, I'll cheer for you down here.

712
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,320
Don't forget what you came for.

713
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,360
You are here to help me
solve my problem with her.

714
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,520
I'm afraid of heights.

715
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,080
Pity. Then you can leave now.

716
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,239
I gave you a chance.

717
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,479
But you didn't hold onto it.

718
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,239
I can give it a try.

719
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,280
You're not afraid of heights anymore?

720
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,080
More than heights,
I'm afraid of losing this opportunity.

721
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:29,639
Let's make a bet.

722
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,919
Winner gets a favor from the loser.

723
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,040
It's his first time here.

724
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,159
You don't mind
if we play as a team, do you?

725
00:43:36,439 --> 00:43:37,600
Of course.

726
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:38,800
Let's do it.

727
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:40,320
Hey.

728
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:41,800
Don't fail.

729
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,600
(I fought so hard for this chance.)

730
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:04,520
(I can't lose to her.)

731
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:05,560
Get ready.

732
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,360
Start.

733
00:44:10,959 --> 00:44:14,199
(Having a crush on someone
is like a program waiting to be tested.)

734
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,560
(You can't be sure of the run results)

735
00:44:16,879 --> 00:44:18,560
(or the run time.)

736
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:20,159
(But as long as the requirements
remain the same,)

737
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,080
(you have to keep improving it)

738
00:44:22,479 --> 00:44:25,040
(until it runs successfully.)
