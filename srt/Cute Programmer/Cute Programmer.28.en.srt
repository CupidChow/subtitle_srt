Are you okay?

22
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,680
I lost.

23
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,800
When you were young,

24
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,800
you couldn't win against me.

25
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,960
Now that I'm old, I can't defeat you.

26
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,559
In the past, I didn't know
how to analyse strategies.

27
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,360
I didn't know how to
defend and retaliate.

28
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,520
Now, I know how to do it.

29
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:22,679
I just need to be patient
and wait for your mistakes.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,279
That's right.

31
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,000
So, if you wish to win,

32
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:28,759
you need to understand
your opponent first.

33
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:32,479
Do you think you
understand that Lu fellow?

34
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,679
What do you think about his personality?

35
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:37,880
What about his work status,
friend status, and family background?

36
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,679
Do you know all of them?

37
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:43,479
Why should I know about them?

38
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,240
You don't even know
the basic conditions of your love rival.

39
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:49,960
How could you hand over
your wife to him just like this?

40
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:52,160
Why do I have a son like you?

41
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,520
Lu Li fell for him.

42
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,080
Back then, your mother
fell for that Zhao fellow as well.

43
00:02:58,279 --> 00:02:59,440
Listen,

44
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,360
if I didn't strike first

45
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:03,800
and show your mother

46
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,440
the true nature of that playboy, Zhao,

47
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:08,720
you and Tong wouldn't
have been born in the first place.

48
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,639
Listen,

49
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:10,679
back then, I've spent a lot of effort

50
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,520
to court your mother.

51
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,600
That's how she fell for me in the end.

52
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,919
But look at you.
The divorce isn't even over.

53
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:19,479
Yet you're already retreating.

54
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,720
Listen,

55
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,320
you're being an embarrassment.

56
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,520
It's no wonder Lu Li doesn't wish
to return with you.

57
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,440
Oh yeah,

58
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,559
we haven't gone through our divorce yet.

59
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,399
Listen,

60
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,160
you always had the right to act.

61
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,639
If you're my son,

62
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,759
you should never cower.

63
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,679
Stop retreating and hesitating.

64
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,919
Get Lu Li back,

65
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,360
all right?

66
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:42,919
But what if this Lu Jingwen

67
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,559
is someone worth handing her over to?

68
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,080
You don't need to figure that out.

69
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,679
At least, you should do it first.

70
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,199
Am I right?

71
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:52,119
Even if you lose, at least
you gave it a try before.

72
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,360
Let's go.

73
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,839
Let's go for another round.

74
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,639
I don't believe that I can't win you
in the next round.

75
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,240
Brat.

76
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,800
(Listen,)

77
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,320
(you're being an embarrassment.)

78
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,320
(It's no wonder Lu Li doesn't wish
to return with you.)

79
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,640
(At least, you should do it first,)

80
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,239
(am I right?)

81
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,000
(Even if you lose, at least
you gave it a try before.)

82
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,760
(I know what I want.)

83
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,320
(I know who I like.)

84
00:04:32,679 --> 00:04:36,480
I wish my life would be
just like programming.

85
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:38,239
I wish it can proceed smoothly.

86
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,920
Forget it. You don't need to jump.

87
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,640
Just go.

88
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,239
(Our relationship wasn't harmonious
when we first got married.)

89
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,519
(I thought I could
shorten the distance between us)

90
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:56,600
(by making your favourite dishes.)

91
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,119
(Dumb koala,)

92
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:07,399
(this time, I won't back down again.)

93
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:11,679
(I'm willing to do anything as long as
it's for your happiness.)

94
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,720
(Because,)

95
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:16,600
(I love you.)

96
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,640
It's me.

97
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,239
Investigate someone for me.

98
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,000
This is all the intel I have
regarding Lu Jingwen.

99
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,239
Is he engaged?

100
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,279
Are you sure?

101
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:43,959
Yes.

102
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,000
There's a picture down below.

103
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,200
His fiancee posted it online

104
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:47,959
after their engagement banquet.

105
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,600
Understood.

106
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:58,440
Are you leaving again?

107
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
I'm done with the documents. We can
talk about other things when I return.

108
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,200
Where are you going?

109
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,160
I'm going to Chongqing.

110
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,000
Brother,

111
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,799
I wish you success.

112
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,200
Jiang Yicheng,

113
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,359
you did come back.

114
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:35,279
Let's talk this over.

115
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,519
You're already engaged.

116
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,239
How did you know?

117
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,720
Don't!

118
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,720
My parents arranged that engagement
for me. I didn't even agree to it.

119
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,119
Does Lu Li know about that?

120
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,239
I think I forgot to tell her.

121
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:45,959
But

122
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,959
I...

123
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,079
Why do both your sister and you
love to hit people in the face?

124
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,399
Can't you let me finish my words?

125
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,839
I thought you left.

126
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,559
I did.

127
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:44,040
But I couldn't let go of you.

128
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:47,359
But why?

129
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:49,440
You know why.

130
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:01,600
You can't entrust your future
to Lu Jingwen.

131
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,799
Why are you saying that?

132
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:10,079
Although this may make me
a despicable person,

133
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,320
I still need to tell you.

134
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,000
He has a fiancee.

135
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,440
What?

136
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,000
Calm down for now.

137
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,320
If you still wish
to be together with him,

138
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:24,119
I know how to make him
cancel his engagement.

139
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:26,359
Why are you doing this?

140
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,279
My father told me that
if I love someone,

141
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,440
I need to do everything I can
to steal her back.

142
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,039
That's what I thought at first.

143
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:37,440
But you made me understand something.

144
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,159
If you love someone, it doesn't mean
you have to possess that person.

145
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,760
You should give that person your love
without expecting anything in return.

146
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,440
If your happiness

147
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,119
can only be supplied by Lu Jingwen,

148
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:53,119
I'm willing to let go of you
and help you fulfil your wish.

149
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:58,799
This is between me and Lu Jingwen.

150
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,119
There's no need to trouble yourself.

151
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:02,200
I will resolve this issue myself.

152
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,960
What do you plan to do?

153
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:07,080
I will break up with him.

154
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,359
If you already have an answer to that,

155
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:13,200
that means I'll never let go of you.

156
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
Lu Li,

157
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,159
give me another chance.

158
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,919
Let us start anew, all right?

159
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,400
Are you sure?

160
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,799
But I...

161
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,119
If you're talking about the child,

162
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:31,440
you can rest at ease.

163
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,880
I will treat him as my own child.

164
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,840
I will raise him together with you.

165
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:46,039
Are you sure you aren't
doing it out of impulse?

166
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:50,479
I know what I'm doing.

167
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,599
Rest early.

168
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,239
Good night.

169
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,359
I'll take a closer look when I return.

170
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:02,080
You guys should do the same.

171
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:03,880
We'll discuss it next time.

172
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,880
All right?

173
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,159
Mr. Lu, we've gone through everything.

174
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:10,280
Why don't we hear about
Lu Li's thoughts first?

175
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,239
She understands the game the best.

176
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:14,400
All right.

177
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,840
Tell us your thoughts.

178
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,559
I'm not really familiar with
how film adaptation works.

179
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,760
But Boss is relatable as
it is built upon

180
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,719
the conflicting relationship

181
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,559
between bosses and employees.

182
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,280
That's why gamers get a kick out of it

183
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:32,000
when they find interesting ways
to beat the bosses.

184
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,719
If the film adaptation doesn't follow
the core concept,

185
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,400
it'll be meaningless to develop this IP.

186
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:40,840
Great words.

187
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:41,719
Mr. Lu,

188
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,080
I beg to differ.

189
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:44,400
Let's not talk about

190
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:47,400
the fact that there aren't any
relationships or plots within the game.

191
00:11:47,719 --> 00:11:49,320
There's no way for us
to create something like

192
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,559
100 ways to die in films.

193
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,799
If we don't alter the concept greatly,

194
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,080
I'm afraid it won't even
pass the first evaluation.

195
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,280
I think you have a point as well.

196
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:01,960
So, everyone should consider
what they've said

197
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,400
and think about what to do.

198
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:04,840
Let's discuss this next time, all right?

199
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,200
Meeting dismissed.

200
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:08,080
Lu Li, stay here.

201
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:09,200
Mr. Lu,

202
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,559
what happened to your nose?

203
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:13,000
I went for a Guasha treatment
as I felt heaty.

204
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,479
You guys can resume your work.

205
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:16,239
Close the door as well.

206
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,760
What's with you acting mysteriously?

207
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:26,200
How dare you still laugh?

208
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,320
I was hurt because I wanted

209
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,679
to test Jiang Yicheng for you.

210
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:31,880
Did Jiang Yicheng beat you up?

211
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,400
We fought each other.

212
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,239
But I don't think he was injured
when I saw him last night.

213
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:40,559
It's because I let him win on purpose.

214
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,719
Did he tell you about my fiancee?

215
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,479
Look at how despicable he is.

216
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,679
He couldn't deal with you.

217
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:49,599
That's why he investigated me
and reported me to you.

218
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,119
So,

219
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,400
for your safety,

220
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:54,479
you should abandon me

221
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:56,000
and choose your fiancee.

222
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,679
Did you two reconcile with each other?

223
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,559
Does he know about the child?

224
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,640
I haven't thought of a way
to break it to him yet.

225
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,359
You see, if a man still doesn't give up

226
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,880
even if you had a child
with someone else,

227
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,960
it's either he's silly or
he's truly in love with you.

228
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,119
Anyway, to me, he's a pass.

229
00:13:17,359 --> 00:13:18,960
I think you shouldn't

230
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,039
be too hard on yourself.

231
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:26,080
Actually, I'm afraid.

232
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,679
In the past, he was something
unobtainable to me.

233
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:31,559
But now, he's right in front of me.

234
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:33,520
I feel surreal.

235
00:13:33,719 --> 00:13:34,960
If so, you should take the chance

236
00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:36,880
and enjoy his courting.

237
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,599
Men might deceive people
with their mouths,

238
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,799
but they won't deceive people
with their actions.

239
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:42,440
Let me give you a piece of advice.

240
00:13:42,719 --> 00:13:46,559
The best way to treat a man is to
be gentle with a hint of deviousness.

241
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,960
Senior,

242
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:52,640
thank you for teaching me so much.

243
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,200
Are you just thanking me with your words?

244
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,400
I didn't betray you
even when I was hurt.

245
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,320
Don't you think you should
do something in exchange?

246
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:02,119
You can continue to sponge off me.

247
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,159
Great.

248
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,520
But you need to make something
that can improve blood circulation.

249
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,799
No problem.

250
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:18,880
Hello,

251
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,719
are you Lu Li?

252
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,159
Hello.

253
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:20,840
I am Lu Li.

254
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,320
These are your parcels.

255
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,039
I didn't buy all these things.

256
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,320
Did you send them to the wrong person?

257
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,880
No.

258
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:29,880
Please sign here if there's no problem.

259
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,039
But these aren't mine.

260
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,119
They're mine.

261
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:32,880
All right.

262
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:33,799
Please sign here.

263
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:34,919
Over here.

264
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,520
Thanks.

265
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:37,239
No problem.

266
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,200
I'll leave first.

267
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,280
Wait,

268
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,359
I remembered I brought that as well.

269
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:44,280
Why did you send all these things to me?

270
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,760
From today onwards,
I'll stay together with you.

271
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,760
Why didn't you discuss it with me first?

272
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:51,359
We're still legally married.

273
00:14:51,479 --> 00:14:52,840
So, what's mine is yours
and what's yours is mine.

274
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,840
You're not allowed to say no.

275
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,960
Can you be reasonable for once?

276
00:14:56,119 --> 00:14:57,559
We're living separately.

277
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,159
Right now, I don't want to be reasonable.

278
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,559
Are you opening the door or not?

279
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:05,039
My house is too small for you.

280
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:10,080
I can sleep on the sofa.

281
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:36,080
(Where is he?)

282
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,719
(Wasn't he cooking?)

283
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:03,159
(I thought he was cooking.)

284
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:04,959
(Why is he taking a bath?)

285
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,040
Lu Li,

286
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:11,640
bring my stuff for me.

287
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,800
What stuff?

288
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,760
Bring me my pyjamas from the luggage.

289
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:16,599
Take it yourself.

290
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,839
I'll take it myself then.

291
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,640
I'll bring it over here for you.

292
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,040
And bring my underpants as well.

293
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,319
You better don't be too much.

294
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,400
I mean, I can choose not to wear it.

295
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,119
I'm just afraid you might not
get used to it.

296
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,239
Thanks.

297
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,319
By the way,

298
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,680
do you have any clean towels?

299
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:41,199
There's a new towel under the sink.

300
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:44,199
I need two of them. One for my face.
Another for my feet.

301
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,640
Both of them are parts of your body.

302
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,040
Why are you being picky about them?

303
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,319
I'll use yours then.

304
00:17:50,439 --> 00:17:51,400
Jiang Yicheng!

305
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:52,800
You're not allowed to use mine!

306
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,839
I!

307
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:55,719
I use that to wipe my feet!

308
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:56,959
It's fine.

309
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,400
I don't mind.

310
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:16,199
Jiang Yicheng!

311
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:17,280
What's wrong?

312
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,560
Did something happen?

313
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,359
Are you here to create a mess?

314
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,160
I...

315
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:22,680
I just wanted to learn how to make soup.

316
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,160
I...

317
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:23,880
It's hot!

318
00:18:39,239 --> 00:18:42,719
Did you go through the same thing
when you learned how to cook?

319
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:46,839
I'm way better. You can't
do two things at once.

320
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,880
I'm just inexperienced.

321
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:52,839
I won't repeat the same mistake next time.

322
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:02,760
I was not referring to it.

323
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,920
I was referring to you.

324
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,439
Actually, you don't need to
force yourself to do this.

325
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,640
I'm not forcing myself. I'm doing it
of my own accord.

326
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,199
I'll order some deliveries.

327
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,599
You haven't turned off the tap yet.

328
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,140
(Today, I've finally gotten
one step closer to you.)

Why are you here?

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,199
Lu Li is still asleep.

363
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,560
This house belongs to my wife.

364
00:21:49,719 --> 00:21:50,760
Why can't I be here?

365
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:54,280
You sneaky thug.

366
00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:55,760
Go away.

367
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:56,599
I'm looking for my junior.

368
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,599
I warn you.

369
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,160
You better stay away from Lu Li.

370
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:01,719
I will take care of her and her child.

371
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,680
So, are you biting the hand
that feeds you?

372
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:06,400
Jiang Yicheng,

373
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,640
you'll regret it.

374
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,199
Who was that just now?

375
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:25,319
Someone from the
property management team.

376
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,000
By the way,

377
00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:28,319
today's your rest day, right?

378
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:29,760
What do you plan to do?

379
00:22:30,199 --> 00:22:31,560
I plan to go out.

380
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,959
Let's have a meal before we go out then.

381
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,319
You brought so many things here.

382
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,880
Are you not planning to return home?

383
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,640
My home

384
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,160
is the place with you around.

385
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:48,400
Did I say something wrong?

386
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,160
Why did you take so many of them?

387
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:20,160
You have such long hair.

388
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,479
I'm sure you'll finish it
in a blink of an eye.

389
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:22,959
I'm buying more just in case.

390
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:25,640
You can buy one for testing purpose.

391
00:23:26,199 --> 00:23:28,040
And I plan to cut my hair short.

392
00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:29,680
That way, it'll be easier for me
to manage my hair.

393
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,839
I think you'll look great
in short hair as well.

394
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:43,599
Why didn't you tell me that before?

395
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,119
Of course I was afraid that
you might laugh at me.

396
00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:48,640
Now that I think about it,

397
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:50,520
I guess I fell for you

398
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,599
before we got married.

399
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,839
Let's go.

400
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,680
It's fine even if

401
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:01,800
you don't want to cut your hair short.

402
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,760
I'll wash your hair for you
in the future.

403
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:06,839
Let's go.

404
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:16,239
Lu Li,

405
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,160
why haven't I seen you wear any of these

406
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,520
radiation-proof pregnancy suits before?

407
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,199
It's inconvenient for me
to wear them at work.

408
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:23,560
I'll just be more careful.

409
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:25,959
Your work is to interact with computers.

410
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,520
Of course you must be cautious.

411
00:24:28,439 --> 00:24:31,160
Senior has found someone else
to share my burden with me.

412
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,680
Now, I deal with projects. I don't need
to deal with computers for a long time.

413
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,760
If he really cared about you,

414
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,400
he wouldn't have let you
continue your work.

415
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,920
If I'm not mistaken,

416
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,599
I think you assigned me to the project.

417
00:24:42,719 --> 00:24:43,680
I...

418
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,520
Are you two looking for
radiation-proof pregnancy suits?

419
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,359
Do you need any recommendations?

420
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:48,680
- Yes.
- No.

421
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:51,800
You see,

422
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,119
it's common for people to use
electronic devices nowadays.

423
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,359
So, experts have suggested

424
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,359
that pregnant mothers should wear
radiation-proof pregnancy suits

425
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,079
when they're zero
to four months pregnant.

426
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,079
I think you're less than
four months pregnant, right?

427
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,040
So, do you have any recommendations?

428
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,479
What about this?

429
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,199
For this type, the lower skirt is longer.

430
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,199
It's better when it can
cover a larger area.

431
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,079
So, is there anything
we should take note of?

432
00:25:19,199 --> 00:25:20,680
I don't suggest wearing it outdoors.

433
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:22,560
If you wear it outdoors,

434
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,560
it'll affect her from
absorbing sunlight.

435
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,560
Mister,

436
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,359
I'm sure you're a new father, right?

437
00:25:29,479 --> 00:25:30,680
Father?

438
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,760
Lu Li.

439
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,079
Darling!

440
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:44,680
I like you.

441
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,640
I know that.

442
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:53,520
Can you stop shouting?

443
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,640
What did you know?

444
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,079
I know you like...

445
00:26:09,719 --> 00:26:14,400
What I meant was,
the counter is over there.

446
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,239
It's a misunderstanding.

447
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:22,199
It's a misunderstanding.

448
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:23,479
It's over there.

449
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:24,479
Where?

450
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,479
Jiang Yicheng.

451
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,839
What's the matter?

452
00:26:54,439 --> 00:26:57,880
Are you sure that you don't mind
about my pregnancy?

453
00:26:59,239 --> 00:27:01,760
I would be lying
if I said I didn't mind it at all.

454
00:27:02,439 --> 00:27:03,920
But you're the one I care about.

455
00:27:04,199 --> 00:27:06,199
The child is a part of you as well.

456
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,040
That's why I can accept it.

457
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,079
What about the company?

458
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:13,400
What will you do with your company?

459
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:15,400
I don't need to be
in my company every day.

460
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:17,000
But it's different for you.

461
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:19,920
I wish to stay by your side
during such a special period.

462
00:27:22,199 --> 00:27:23,359
Let's go home.

463
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,800
We still have time.

464
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,359
Let's go to the market.

465
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:28,599
I'll cook dinner for you tonight.

466
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:32,599
Are you sure you're not trying
to burn down my house?

467
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,040
Last night, I was just testing
a new program.

468
00:27:36,199 --> 00:27:38,239
Today, I'll use the updated version.

469
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,359
Let's go.

470
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,079
Come.

471
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:00,800
I can't believe that
you made all of these.

472
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,199
In the past, I thought
cooking was troublesome.

473
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,839
That's why I didn't
give it everything I got.

474
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:06,760
Excluding last night's experiment,

475
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,280
I guess you can say that
this is my first time cooking.

476
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,680
You're the first person
to try my cooking.

477
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:16,000
What about the time
you cooked for my parents?

478
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:20,079
That doesn't count.

479
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:25,439
Congratulations on unlocking
a new skill then.

480
00:29:28,479 --> 00:29:29,319
Here you go.

481
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,400
How's the taste?

482
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,719
It tastes bland.
Did you forget to put salt?

483
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,640
You're pregnant.

484
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:55,239
You can't eat anything too salty.

485
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:56,680
If you consume too much salt,

486
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,520
you'll experience high blood pressure
during your gestation period.

487
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,880
Freckles will grow on your face.

488
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:00,479
And

489
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,199
it'll affect the baby's
hair growth as well.

490
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:03,280
So,

491
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,880
the salty food you used to love,

492
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,560
you need to consume
less of them in the future.

493
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,079
How did you know that much?

494
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:12,560
I told you before.

495
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,199
I will take good care of
you and the baby.

496
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,319
By the way,

497
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,719
you're allergic to seafood.

498
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,160
So, when you consume other food,

499
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,319
you need to consume something
that's high in protein

500
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:25,079
and calcium.

501
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,520
Seafood allergy isn't hereditary, right?

502
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,280
You can eat first.

503
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,880
I'll check.

504
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:39,239
Is seafood allergy hereditary?

505
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,839
Since you made the dishes today,
let me wash them.

506
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,680
There's no need for us
to assign the chores equally.

507
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,199
I'll do all of these in the future.

508
00:30:58,359 --> 00:30:59,599
Will you be okay with them?

509
00:31:00,479 --> 00:31:02,040
Do you not believe me?

510
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,160
I just felt that your change
was too sudden for me.

511
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,040
I haven't got used to it yet.

512
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,760
You need to get used to it eventually,

513
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,599
since we're still in the first flush
of our marriage.

514
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,680
Let's wash them together.
It'll be faster that way.

515
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,959
Reverse.

516
00:31:26,479 --> 00:31:27,439
Sit down.

517
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,280
Staying by my side
is the greatest help you can offer.

518
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:05,160
This unit

519
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,880
is through from North to South,
and it has especially great lighting.

520
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,119
The subway station is just downstairs.

521
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:11,560
Its price and location are great.

522
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,479
Please.

523
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:14,560
Is this a work building?

524
00:32:14,959 --> 00:32:16,040
I think you should

525
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,719
take a look at residential units
instead of this.

526
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,400
Who said I'm going to stay here myself?

527
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:21,479
What do you plan to use it for?

528
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,239
I'm planning to open a training course.

529
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,119
Are you renting it for me?

530
00:32:31,439 --> 00:32:33,119
This unit is near to your house.

531
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:34,800
You can reach here
in ten minutes by walking.

532
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,239
It'll only take one stop

533
00:32:36,439 --> 00:32:38,319
for you to reach your company
using public transport.

534
00:32:38,479 --> 00:32:40,520
And there are plenty of
tables and chairs here.

535
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,760
The space is just enough.

536
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,560
Because I don't want you
to overexert yourself.

537
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,359
If there are too many students,

538
00:32:45,479 --> 00:32:46,640
your body won't be able to take it.

539
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,160
What do you think?

540
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,239
Are you upset?

541
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,520
I just wanted to give you a surprise.

542
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,079
We can take a look at other units
if you don't like it here.

543
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,640
Thank you,

544
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,000
Jiang Yicheng.

545
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,839
There are many ways for you
to express your gratitude.

546
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:27,000
Which one will you choose?

547
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,479
I won't choose any of them,

548
00:33:30,959 --> 00:33:33,839
because I'm rejecting your kindness.

549
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,560
But why?

550
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:38,199
If I open a training course right now,

551
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,599
I won't be able

552
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,479
to teach my students
after a few months.

553
00:33:46,439 --> 00:33:48,359
Actually, I don't want you
to tire yourself out either.

554
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:53,599
But I'll support you as long as
you want to do it.

555
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,719
Actually, I did it because Zhong Yao
was interested in programming.

556
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:02,640
I just wanted to help her out.

557
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,520
But after that, I realised that
many people,

558
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,560
including their parents, think

559
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,879
that it isn't suitable for a woman
to be a programmer.

560
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,479
And many people don't know
what they truly like

561
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,600
when they're selecting their majors
before entering university.

562
00:34:20,439 --> 00:34:22,719
Not everyone is as lucky as me.

563
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,040
I had someone to guide me

564
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:27,560
to my true answer

565
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,479
when I was making my life decisions.

566
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,760
Now,

567
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,719
do you still think

568
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:36,159
that it's fortunate for you to meet me?

569
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,080
That's right.

570
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,760
Back then, you were the one

571
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,679
who opened the door to programming for me.

572
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,479
Now, I wish to become

573
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,000
the person who can guide
all those girls out there.

574
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,840
So, you wish

575
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,800
to promote a programming course
that targets women?

576
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:58,159
That's right.

577
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,639
Not only do I hope that this course
can help them to understand programming,

578
00:35:04,399 --> 00:35:06,560
but I also hope that people
in the society

579
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:08,439
may eliminate their prejudices
against female programmers.

580
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,560
Programming isn't only meant for men.

581
00:35:11,919 --> 00:35:13,800
Women have the right
to learn it as well.

582
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,360
And female programmers are just
as good as their male counterparts.

583
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,080
But this is much harder than
opening a training course.

584
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:24,919
It'll be a long journey,
and it'll take a long time.

585
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,919
Maybe, you won't achieve anything
noteworthy during this time.

586
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,199
Yeah.

587
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,399
I've thought about that as well.

588
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:34,439
Although I may be an ant
trying to shake a huge tree,

589
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,399
I still wish to do something about it.

590
00:35:37,919 --> 00:35:39,760
One day, I hope I can break through

591
00:35:39,919 --> 00:35:42,280
the gender barrier embedded within
the computer science industry.

592
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,919
You're not an ant.

593
00:35:46,399 --> 00:35:49,959
You're a tree-climbing koala.

594
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:54,719
Remember to bring me with you
when you climb the tree.

595
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:01,320
At first, I thought you would
analyse the pros and cons

596
00:36:01,479 --> 00:36:02,959
and reject my idea.

597
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,679
That was the past me.

598
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:11,040
Now, I plan to go with the flow
and support my dear wife.

599
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:38,840
Come.

600
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,600
Have some fruits.

601
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,719
It's getting late. I need to rest.

602
00:36:49,879 --> 00:36:51,000
Let's talk a little longer.

603
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:53,199
There's nothing to talk about.

604
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,159
Tell me about your work.

605
00:36:55,399 --> 00:36:56,840
I can give you some suggestions.

606
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,439
Actually, I haven't come up
with a complete concept yet.

607
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:16,159
But I hope more people

608
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,120
can understand what
I'm trying to do here.

609
00:37:18,919 --> 00:37:20,479
I hope those people who are interested

610
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:22,120
can contact me themselves.

611
00:37:22,479 --> 00:37:24,760
First, I think I need
to promote the idea.

612
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,320
That's a great idea.

613
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,439
But how do you plan to achieve that?

614
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,919
It isn't realistic for me to buy my spot
into Weibo's hot search.

615
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:36,080
And it doesn't last long.

616
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,439
What do you think about posting
programming videos

617
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,520
on short video platforms?

618
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,239
If I do so,

619
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:44,879
maybe I need to wait for a longer time.

620
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,320
But once I have enough people
following my account,

621
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,080
it'll be useful for future promotions.

622
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:51,360
What you need now

623
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:54,760
is a way for you to use the least amount
of time, money, and human labour

624
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,679
to achieve the best promotional effect.

625
00:37:59,959 --> 00:38:01,159
Does such a way exist?

626
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,439
I do.

627
00:38:02,959 --> 00:38:06,199
But tell me
how you plan to thank me first.

628
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,840
Tell me about the idea first.

629
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,679
As for time, I only need three days.

630
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,959
As for money, I only need printing fee.

631
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,560
As for human labour,
I only need you and me.

632
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:26,199
Are you telling me that we're going to
give out pamphlets?

633
00:38:26,399 --> 00:38:29,239
Giving out pamphlets is only
the first step in my promotion strategy.

634
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,399
The second step is
the most important step.

635
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:34,520
We can contact free venues

636
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:36,800
and hold a salon event that revolves
around the theme of programming.

637
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,040
People who will participate in the event

638
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,159
are the target audience that
we give our pamphlets to.

639
00:38:41,439 --> 00:38:42,159
That way,

640
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,760
we can promote programming itself

641
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,239
while interacting with people
who are interested in it face to face.

642
00:38:47,399 --> 00:38:48,879
What do you think about my plan?

643
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:55,080
I think it's pretty good.

644
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,080
Why haven't I thought about that before?

645
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,600
The plans I had were too complicated.

646
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:01,360
I think a simple
and direct plan like this

647
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,919
is the most realistic plan for us.

648
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:07,959
So, how do you plan to thank me?

649
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:12,840
Do you think I'm going to kiss you?

650
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,080
I didn't say yes.

651
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:29,959
When do you plan to say yes then?

652
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,840
Why didn't I realise that you were this
thick-skinned in the past?

653
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,080
My father told me before.

654
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,919
If I'm a man, I should never cower.

655
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,479
I should stop retreating and hesitating.

656
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:43,439
Don't you want to talk about work?

657
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,199
I won't talk to you.

658
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,360
You're only good at being a thug.

659
00:39:45,439 --> 00:39:47,320
That's right. I'm a thug.

660
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,159
Boss?

661
00:40:25,479 --> 00:40:26,520
Why haven't you completed
the new function

662
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:27,840
that the Planning Department asked for?

663
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,000
I'll add it in once I finish
the anti-plugin.

664
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:33,000
Why is it so noisy over there?

665
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,080
Boss,

666
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,840
I'm playing video games in a cybercafe.

667
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:38,000
Do you still have time
to play video games?

668
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,320
You have two days to complete your task.

669
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:46,560
Brother,

670
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:47,520
I have to go.

671
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,239
Brother,

672
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,199
you want to leave right after winning?

673
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,280
Don't you think it's unsuitable?

674
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,919
Let's play a few rounds.

675
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,439
It's meaningless when you're this bad.

676
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,879
You should brush up on your skills.

677
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,679
What do you mean by that?

678
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,199
Are you trying to disrespect me?

679
00:41:04,479 --> 00:41:05,280
Let go of me.

680
00:41:06,479 --> 00:41:07,800
You have a short temper, huh?

681
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:09,439
Do you dare to
play another round with me?

682
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,679
If I lose,

683
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,040
I'll agree to your every condition.

684
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,159
I have no interest in that.

685
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:18,520
Someone fainted!

686
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,120
Call the ambulance!

687
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:19,760
Hurry!

688
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,600
Call the ambulance!

689
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,520
Hurry!

690
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,159
Call the ambulance!

691
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:24,760
Yeah!

692
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,439
Are you okay?

693
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,159
Don't leave.

694
00:41:26,439 --> 00:41:26,879
Don't let him leave.

695
00:41:26,879 --> 00:41:27,479
Call the cops!

696
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,959
- Why?
- Calm down.

697
00:41:35,439 --> 00:41:38,520
Why did he beat him up?

698
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,199
I'm going to sue him!

699
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:41,040
What gives him the right to do so?

700
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,239
What kind of person is he?

701
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,879
Lin Shutian?

702
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:06,360
Do you know me?

703
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:10,280
The person inside is my employee.

704
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:12,560
This is my name card.

705
00:42:12,589 --> 00:42:15,199
(Xu Yuanzhi, Chairman)
I may be able to help you.

706
00:42:15,919 --> 00:42:16,879
Basically,

707
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,760
people with great business ideas

708
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,520
love to gather at our place.

709
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:22,679
So, I will provide a place

710
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,439
for them to gather around,

711
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:28,040
interact with each other,
and find capital to do their business.

712
00:42:28,439 --> 00:42:29,719
So, you plan to transform this cafe

713
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,520
into an incubator meant for attracting
potential investors and entrepreneurs?

714
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:33,800
That's right.

715
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,600
But we're still in the early stage.

716
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,520
- This way.
- So, most of the time,

717
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:39,159
we need people to organise home parties

718
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,600
and salon events
to cover our daily expenses.

719
00:42:43,959 --> 00:42:47,199
So, do you have any requests for us
if we are to hold a salon event here?

720
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,520
You can hold it here.

721
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,439
What kind of content
do you plan to make?

722
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,879
I plan to introduce
and promote female programmers.

723
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,360
Many people came here

724
00:42:56,439 --> 00:42:57,959
to promote online businesses and so on.

725
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:01,520
But you're the first person to talk
about things like female programmers.

726
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,639
Don't you think
your theme is a bit niche?

727
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,360
That's precisely
why we need to promote it.

728
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,159
We've viewed a lot of venues.

729
00:43:09,399 --> 00:43:11,399
We think your venue
is the most suitable for our event.

730
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:13,000
You have great taste.

731
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:15,600
First, let me thank you two
for your support.

732
00:43:16,399 --> 00:43:16,919
Let me ask this first.

733
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,600
When do you plan to hold your event?

734
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,159
And how many participants
will be coming?

735
00:43:20,879 --> 00:43:23,760
I plan to hold it during the afternoon
the day after tomorrow.

736
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:25,840
As for the number of participants...

737
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:30,199
We can't confirm that for now.

738
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:33,399
Is that so? You see,

739
00:43:33,399 --> 00:43:35,600
our venue is free.

740
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,080
We can only cover our daily expenses
by selling coffee,

741
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:39,679
snacks, and Western food
to the participants.

742
00:43:39,919 --> 00:43:42,320
So, we do have certain demands
over the number of participants.

743
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,040
So, how many participants do we need?

744
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,760
At least two hundred participants.

745
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,879
According to the past salon events
that had been held,

746
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,479
less than one-third of the expected
participants will turn up for the event.

747
00:43:54,959 --> 00:43:57,360
Moreover, your theme is quite niche.

748
00:43:57,919 --> 00:44:00,439
I'm afraid the number of
participants will be fewer.

749
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,919
You guys can take your time.

750
00:44:07,719 --> 00:44:09,479
All right then. Two hundred participants it is.

751
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:11,280
All right.

752
00:44:11,439 --> 00:44:12,479
It's decided then.

753
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,239
