Really?

23
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:03,000
I...

24
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,800
This doesn't count.

25
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:05,120
Let's start another round.

26
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:07,800
The winner has been decided.

27
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:08,919
No need to do that.

28
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,399
I agree.

29
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,520
I don't want to kiss a man

30
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:13,720
to win too.

31
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,160
Forget about it.

32
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:17,919
I'll do the dishes.

33
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,279
Let me do it.

34
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,080
It's fine. I lost the game anyway.

35
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,520
I'll tie the apron for you.

36
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:45,960
No, thanks.

37
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,399
You surrendered just now
because you were nervous. Am I right?

38
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:59,199
I just think why we continue games

39
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,919
when we can use the time
to do the dishes.

40
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,839
Is there anything else?

41
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,320
As for your programming class,
I've done some research.

42
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,720
You need to have a permit first.

43
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,720
The application process is very strict.

44
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,440
Since you don't know anyone here,

45
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,839
it will be hard to get one.

46
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,639
Lu Jingwen can help me.

47
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:21,240
What about your fund?

48
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,000
The location? The equipment?

49
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:24,720
Advertisement?

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,919
You need money for all of them.

51
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,839
Do you want to spend Lu Jingwen's money?

52
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,080
If you open the class in Xinhai,

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,399
I'll handle everything for you.

54
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:42,160
I'll find the location and the equipment

55
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,919
with the best price for you.

56
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,800
I can ask my parents to help you

57
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,559
obtain the permit.

58
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:52,360
What's wrong?

59
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,800
I'm fine.

60
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,919
Maybe I caught a cold.

61
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,399
My stomach is not feeling well.

62
00:03:56,839 --> 00:03:57,759
I'll buy some medicine for you.

63
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:58,839
It's fine.

64
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,160
I have medicine with me.

65
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,960
I'll do the dishes for you then.

66
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,479
You should rest.

67
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,079
Okay.

68
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,959
(Behave, okay?)

69
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,679
(Or else, everyone will know.)

70
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,200
(I'm waiting for you in the garden.)

71
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,720
(I won't leave until I see you.)

72
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,679
Lady Jiang.

73
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,399
I know I'm beautiful

74
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,600
but you don't need to be this desperate.

75
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,959
Okay.

76
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,200
Should we have a night walk?

77
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,480
Not interested in dark
and secluded areas.

78
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,839
Then I'll find my junior.

79
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,920
I'm warning you.

80
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,839
Do not be the homewrecker
between my brother and my sister-in-law.

81
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,359
Fine.

82
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:44,679
But you have to find me

83
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,160
a new girlfriend.

84
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:49,640
What's your type?

85
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:52,359
Someone like you.

86
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,440
Thank you.

87
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,079
I learned Muay Thai for a year.
How is my punch?

88
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:16,839
Can't we talk properly?

89
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:20,480
I just want you
to find me a new girlfriend.

90
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,720
What did I do?

91
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,880
I didn't do anything.

92
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,320
How's your stomach?

93
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,119
Much better.

94
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,279
Why did you ask me to come here?

95
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:04,600
I didn't want to say it this early

96
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:07,399
but I can't wait any longer.

97
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,880
What do you want to say?

98
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,480
I love you.

99
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,119
I was too oblivious back then.

100
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,880
I couldn't notice my feelings
towards you earlier

101
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,040
and that's why there are
many misunderstandings between us.

102
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:29,720
But now, I know my feelings.

103
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,119
I promise

104
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,440
to never hurt you anymore.

105
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,200
I'll protect you
for the rest of your life.

106
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,599
So

107
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:51,479
is this not just a compensation?

108
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,960
I'm not forcing myself nor
trying to make up to you.

109
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:59,200
I finally realized that

110
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,239
love

111
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:06,880
is like the sun shower just now.

112
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,440
It's unexpected and unavoidable.

113
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,919
Lu Li.

114
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,599
Come back to me.

115
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm sorry.

116
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,239
I was stupid.

117
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,799
I hurt you.

118
00:10:09,719 --> 00:10:10,200
Especially

119
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,559
what I did that night
when I got drunk...

120
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,479
I'm a jerk.

121
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:23,000
So you remember everything.

122
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:26,200
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

123
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,679
If I tell you earlier,

124
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:31,719
will you be with me earlier?

125
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,760
Of course.

126
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,719
If you told me earlier,

127
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:39,679
then none of those would happen.

00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:03,840
Have a seat.

172
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:04,679
Sit.

173
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:14,280
Did Jiang Yicheng confess to you?

174
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:17,080
How do you know?

175
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:20,679
I heard Jiang Yicheng borrowed lights

176
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,479
from the staff to decorate the place.

177
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,200
Did you say yes?

178
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,119
I was almost convinced

179
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,880
until I realized that

180
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,919
he just wanted to
take up his responsibility.

181
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,359
Marriage is a kind of responsibility.

182
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,039
But I want this marital duty

183
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,960
to be born from love

184
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,719
not for the sake of fulfilling a duty.

185
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,479
Ultimately,

186
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,400
he didn't give you a sense of security

187
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:54,320
so you refuse to believe that

188
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,080
he confessed to you

189
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,599
out of pure love.

190
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:04,239
Perhaps.

191
00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:08,559
It's like when I first wrote a code.

192
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,400
I wanted to test it

193
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:12,719
but I was afraid
that it wouldn't run smoothly.

194
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,159
Back then, I could just
uninstall the program and walk away.

195
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:18,159
But this time,

196
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:20,679
if we're still proven
to be incompatible,

197
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,799
I worry that the system
will crash straight away.

198
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,359
I don't know much about coding

199
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,280
but when it comes to love,

200
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,479
follow your heart.

201
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:37,359
All right.

202
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,679
Let me deal with this.

203
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,479
I'll find a perfect opportunity

204
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:42,719
to test Jiang Yicheng for you.

205
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,440
It will reassure you.

206
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:49,159
There, there.

207
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:50,119
Stop sulking.

208
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:51,719
We finally get to travel for once.

209
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:52,719
Cheer up.

210
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,599
Don't frown anymore.

211
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,719
Does your nose still hurt?

212
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,039
It doesn't hurt.

213
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:07,840
Trust me.

214
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,280
I'm fine.

215
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:09,520
This is fine.

216
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,919
Sister-in-law?

217
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:31,559
I'll get in the car first.

218
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:32,559
I'll get in the car first.

219
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:37,119
Where were you
during the blackout yesterday?

220
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,640
I knocked on your door
but you weren't there.

221
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,239
She was with me.

222
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:48,000
Do you really not want to
come back with us?

223
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,760
My mom misses you a lot.

224
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,960
I will visit her when I'm free.

225
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,039
All right then.

226
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,919
Did you confess?

227
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,080
I failed.

228
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,640
Lu Li has a rational approach
towards trouble.

229
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,359
Once she analyzes it thoroughly,

230
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,440
she'll formulate her response.

231
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,119
The process might take some time.

232
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,559
It's okay.

233
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,840
I'll wait for her.

234
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,039
But don't be like me.

235
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,159
Appreciate someone before you lose them.

236
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,760
Yiming.

237
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,559
Let's go.

238
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:35,719
Lu Li.

239
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,080
Everyone misses you dearly.

240
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,479
Come back soon.

241
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,760
Drive safe.

242
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,960
Goodbye.

243
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,159
Junior.

244
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,159
Hop in.

245
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,479
My car isn't here.

246
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,160
Guess I'll hitchhike.

247
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,439
Sure.

248
00:18:02,199 --> 00:18:04,719
I treat you last time.
It's your turn now.

249
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,800
You turn.

250
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:06,920
Of course.

251
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,719
Miss Yezi.

252
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:15,959
Da Huang.

253
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:17,719
Is Miss Yezi in love?

254
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,839
I don't know.

255
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,599
She feels different.

256
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:24,199
Really?

257
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,239
You go first.

258
00:18:27,479 --> 00:18:28,359
I forgot about my phone.

259
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:29,520
Queue up first.

260
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:30,599
Go, go.

261
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,119
Hurry.

262
00:18:31,239 --> 00:18:31,880
Come back quickly.

263
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:33,319
Just take the number first.

264
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,160
Okay.

265
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,040
Don't dally.

266
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:35,599
You...

267
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:36,160
Hurry!

268
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,760
I'll be back in a jiffy.

269
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,599
Come here!

270
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,079
Huang Huang.

271
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:46,439
I've missed you so much!

272
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,680
Why can't we tell everyone?

273
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:51,760
It's because we got together suddenly.

274
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,199
Others might not be able to accept it.

275
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,160
Even I am reeling from it.

276
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,680
How long do we have to wait?

277
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57,760
One month.

278
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,560
After one month, okay?

279
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,359
Fine, two weeks.

280
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:08,439
Miss Yezi.

281
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,000
Xiaoqi, what brought you here?

282
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:12,560
Let me brew you a cup of coffee.

283
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:13,599
Wait!

284
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:14,800
Who is that man?

285
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,400
He doesn't look like Gu Mo.

286
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,560
Amazing.

287
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:19,479
Miss Yezi.

288
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,959
You're an amazing two-timer.

289
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,359
No.

290
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,400
It's just a colleague.

291
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,959
A colleague?

292
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,079
Then why are you panicking
and acting suspiciously?

293
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:32,239
Who is he? From what department?
What's his name?

294
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,479
You don't know him.

295
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,319
Gu Mo is so blinded by love.

296
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,439
He didn't even notice this even though
it was right under his nose.

297
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,000
Is your second boyfriend waiting
to be introduced to everyone?

298
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:44,359
I'll tell him about Gu Mo.

299
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,560
Xiaoqi.

300
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:55,520
Director Gu and I are just acting.

301
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,040
Thank you.

302
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,880
Let's go.

303
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,239
Jiang Yicheng.

304
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,280
Don't you need a ride anymore?

305
00:20:41,479 --> 00:20:43,160
The hotel is quite far from here.

306
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:43,920
It's okay.

307
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,680
I'll see Lu Li back home
then I'll head back.

308
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,640
You're wearing a raincoat to shower.

309
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,959
Totally unnecessary.

310
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,479
Let's go.

311
00:20:54,239 --> 00:20:54,560
Bye.

312
00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:57,839
Stop pulling me.

313
00:20:58,319 --> 00:20:58,520
Come.

314
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,040
Let's speak outside.

315
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,319
Sir, Madam,

316
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:02,680
the tenant is not at home.

317
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,640
If you cause a ruckus,

318
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,160
it will disturb other neighbors.

319
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,000
Call her then.

320
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,880
Tell her that

321
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:09,400
we're waiting for her here.

322
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,640
I...

323
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,119
Miss Lu.

324
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:13,280
They are here for you.

325
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:13,640
Come.

326
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,079
Are you Lu Li?

327
00:21:18,199 --> 00:21:19,319
Stay civilized, please.

328
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:20,439
What happened?

329
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:22,119
Let's communicate properly.

330
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,839
I'll take my leave now.

331
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,439
Let's go.

332
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,959
How can I help you?

333
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,479
Did you

334
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:33,680
open a programming class
to swindle money?

335
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:35,880
I am teaching programming

336
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,839
but I did not ask for any fee.

337
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,479
Really?

338
00:21:39,719 --> 00:21:42,680
My daughter already spent the money
from her red envelopes for you.

339
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:44,239
You...

340
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:46,000
Do you even have a teaching permit?

341
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:47,640
If not, I'll sue you!

342
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:48,439
Madam,

343
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,319
we have laws and regulations now.

344
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,000
If you want to sue us,
do you have any proof?

345
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,640
My daughter is
in the final year of high school.

346
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,400
But you encourage her
to play computer games.

347
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,119
You're ruining her future.

348
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,920
I don't need any proof.

349
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,439
Madam,

350
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:06,359
programming is within the curriculum
of computer science.

351
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,199
It's not a computer game.

352
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:10,520
But what good does it do?

353
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,640
You mean my daughter

354
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,760
is supposed to be a programmer?

355
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,239
Why can't she?

356
00:22:16,439 --> 00:22:18,079
Are you asking for a fight now?

357
00:22:18,239 --> 00:22:20,520
A girl shouldn't be a programmer.

358
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:24,000
The first programmer
in the world is a woman.

359
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,199
Ada Lovelace.
The advanced programming language, Ada,

360
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:28,920
is named after her.

361
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:31,119
Grace Hopper,
also known as the founder of COBOL.

362
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:32,719
The human computer of Harvard,

363
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,520
Henrietta Swan Leavitt.

364
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,239
They are all women.

365
00:22:36,719 --> 00:22:38,959
If you think they are
far too accomplished,

366
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:40,599
then sitting in front of you

367
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,520
is an excellent programmer, Lu Li.

368
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:47,400
Whatever.

369
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,640
I won't let my daughter
study computer science.

370
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,119
Dad, mom.

371
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,680
Hui, why are you here?

372
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:59,239
I should ask you that question.

373
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:01,479
Why are you here to trouble Miss Lu?

374
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:04,400
As I said, she's not a scammer.

375
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,760
I used the money from my red envelopes
to buy a new computer

376
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,359
because I like programming.

377
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:12,680
You're still young.

378
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,839
You don't know what you like.

379
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:17,040
I'm 18 already.

380
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:20,239
I can choose what I want to major in.

381
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:23,359
I want to study computer science.

382
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,599
No. End of discussion.

383
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,680
A girl shouldn't learn computer science.

384
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,040
It won't feed you for long enough
and it is radioactive.

385
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,199
Listen to us.

386
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,359
Study business administration.

387
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:35,000
You can find a job easily that way.

388
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:36,439
Exactly.

389
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,920
Mom.

390
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:40,920
I don't want to spend my life
doing something I don't like.

391
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:42,760
Sir, Madam.

392
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:45,400
Hui is gifted in programming.

393
00:23:45,719 --> 00:23:47,000
She is logical

394
00:23:47,199 --> 00:23:49,359
and creative.

395
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,920
I hope you can respect her decision.

396
00:23:53,239 --> 00:23:54,359
We'll talk later.

397
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,880
We'll talk later.

398
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:57,280
I'm sorry, Miss Lu.

399
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:58,319
We'll talk later.

400
00:23:58,959 --> 00:23:59,439
Sir, Madam.

401
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,479
Have a safe trip.

402
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,199
Mom.

403
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:02,319
Just let me be.

404
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,479
Thank you for just now.

405
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,959
Junior.

406
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,280
Thank you too.

407
00:24:18,479 --> 00:24:20,160
What year are we in again?

408
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,640
I can't believe
some people still think that way.

409
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,079
It's just computer science.

410
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:24,800
Not the end of the world.

411
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,239
It's still common now.

412
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,040
Many people think that

413
00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:30,880
women cannot be a programmer.

414
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:39,359
You guys should head back.

415
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,599
I'll go back now.

416
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:47,040
Wait.

417
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,760
I live on the floor above her.

418
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,359
This is my home.

419
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,439
You should head back earlier.

420
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,839
(Are you asking for a fight now?)

421
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:14,439
(A girl shouldn't be a programmer.)

422
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:16,599
(It's still common now.)

423
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,280
(Many people think that)

424
00:25:18,479 --> 00:25:20,000
(women cannot be a programmer.)

425
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:27,000
(Mom.)

426
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,719
(Why did you and dad)

427
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,000
(agree to let me
study computer science?)

428
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:40,839
What happened?

429
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,959
What a jerk.

430
00:25:42,199 --> 00:25:43,439
Liar!

431
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,520
Did he upset you again?

432
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,959
You have no idea.

433
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:49,520
He takes me for a fool.

434
00:25:50,439 --> 00:25:51,640
How so?

435
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,640
Remember when I told you

436
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,400
that he was in a relationship
with Miss Yezi?

437
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,959
It's fake.

438
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:57,880
It's all an act to fool me.

439
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,920
Why are you not surprised?

440
00:26:02,239 --> 00:26:03,920
Because I already guessed so.

441
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:06,319
But how?

442
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,760
Let me ask you this.

443
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,280
Why did Gu Mo want to lie to you?

444
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,199
Because he's crazy.

445
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,719
Gu Xiaoqi.

446
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:15,000
Stop this

447
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,839
hide and seek game.

448
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,680
You have to be honest,

449
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,800
okay?

450
00:26:19,199 --> 00:26:20,119
What do you mean?

451
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,880
Gu Mo likes you.

452
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:24,199
And based on what I've seen so far,

453
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,359
you like him too.

454
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:27,400
So you two can...

455
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:36,760
Did I really...?

456
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:42,719
Da Huang.

457
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,239
I need a favor from you.

458
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:51,640
We wanted to say no at first.

459
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,119
You don't know how many times

460
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,280
your father and I argued for this.

461
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,040
I have never heard

462
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:59,319
of a girl who majors in computer science.

463
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,640
But back then, you're so into it.

464
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,880
I thought you would give up
upon hitting a wall

465
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:06,479
so I just let you be.

466
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,199
But in the end, you didn't quit

467
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,479
and went to become a programmer.

468
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:14,520
What have I brought upon myself?

469
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:22,319
Mom.

470
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,359
Love you.

471
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,880
Master!

472
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,880
Hui told me about yesterday.

473
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,239
Are you okay?

474
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,239
It's okay. I understand.

475
00:27:49,439 --> 00:27:51,199
Her parents are just worried about her.

476
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:55,520
What's the matter?

477
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,839
Master,

478
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,719
I'm resigning.

479
00:27:59,239 --> 00:28:02,280
I might not attend
the programming class anymore.

480
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,599
Aren't you new here?

481
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,160
Why are you quitting this job?

482
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:09,719
My parents found me a job
in social service.

483
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,400
They think that job is easier
and more stable.

484
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,479
I was like Hui too
when I was sitting for NCEE.

485
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,439
I didn't know what I liked

486
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:19,359
so my parents picked my major for me.

487
00:28:19,719 --> 00:28:21,359
Lately, I've been thinking

488
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,680
how great it'd be
if we could meet earlier.

489
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:27,680
But you can still come to my classes.

490
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,079
It's no use.

491
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:31,319
My parents won't let me change my job.

492
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,680
And they also think that

493
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,560
playing computer games is not good.

494
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:35,800
Master.

495
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:37,479
Keep doing what you're doing.

496
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,920
Give those who love programming

497
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,680
a chance to embrace their true self

498
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,839
so that they won't be like me,

499
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,439
regretting when it's too late.

500
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:16,119
Sit down.

501
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:17,319
Don't just stand there.

502
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:27,040
You are...

503
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:29,079
I forgot to tell you.

504
00:29:29,239 --> 00:29:31,839
Da Huang and I are together now.

505
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,040
Together?

506
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,959
Yes.

507
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,520
I might as well use this double date

508
00:29:37,719 --> 00:29:39,359
to officially introduce him to you two.

509
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,359
Double date?

510
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,359
You mean they are...

511
00:29:44,439 --> 00:29:47,400
Miss Yezi and my brother are together,
don't you know?

512
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:54,520
But I remember you two
haven't talked for a long time.

513
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:57,119
Thanks to a certain someone,

514
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:59,479
we couldn't talk for a very long time.

515
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,400
However, my dearest here made up his mind

516
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,160
and decided

517
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,160
to fight for his love.

518
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:07,520
Because no one
should give up on true love.

519
00:30:15,239 --> 00:30:16,079
True love?

520
00:30:16,199 --> 00:30:17,160
Yes.

521
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:20,719
Also, thanks to the intervention
of that certain someone,

522
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,119
we came to understand
each other's feelings better.

523
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:24,000
Am I right,

524
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,280
darling?

525
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,640
You canceled our date
to play games in the internet cafe.

526
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,839
Is she your game then?

527
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:41,000
You said you're going to
a beauty center with your bestie.

528
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:42,520
Is Mr. Gu your bestie then?

529
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,760
Mr. Gu and I are just acting.

530
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,160
But this break-up is real.

531
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,079
Yezi. Yezi!

532
00:30:48,199 --> 00:30:49,280
Goodbye!

533
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:50,239
Yezi!

534
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,319
We're acting too.

535
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:53,400
I'm very confused.

536
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:57,880
Yezi,

537
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,040
let me explain, please.

538
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,680
It's not what you think it is.

539
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,400
Xiaoqi and I are just friends.

540
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,479
Listen to me.

541
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,119
How was my acting?

542
00:31:05,719 --> 00:31:06,959
What?

543
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,599
You're so dumb!

544
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,839
Can't you tell that Gu Mo
and Gu Xiaoqi are a couple?

545
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,479
I don't know.

546
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,760
I just know that you're scaring me.

547
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,319
So is the break-up part of the act?

548
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:15,719
Yes, I was just joking.

549
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:16,839
Let's grab something to eat.

550
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,359
Let's go.

551
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,439
A break-up is a serious matter!

552
00:31:23,719 --> 00:31:24,920
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

553
00:31:26,439 --> 00:31:27,760
So did you.

554
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,640
Then do you know why I did that?

555
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,760
I don't and I'm not interested.

556
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:31,119
You...

557
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:31,760
I just know that

558
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,839
you're the reason why I'm single now.

559
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:35,680
If only you hadn't meddled so much...

560
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:38,000
I'll find a boyfriend real soon!

561
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:39,079
How dare you?

562
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,880
Just so you know, Gu Xiaoqi.

563
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:43,040
I'll ruin all your boyfriends,
as many as you can find.

564
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,319
Why are you doing this?

565
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:52,800
I'll leave then.

566
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,319
Actually,

567
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,079
then "tian" in Tianqi

568
00:32:15,713 --> 00:32:16,713
(Sweet)
[*Same pronunciation as "tian" in Chinese]

569
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,040
is spelled like this.

570
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,880
What do you mean?

571
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,079
Xiaoqi.

572
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:29,719
I've liked you for a long time.

573
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,880
I only started to like you recently.

574
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,800
Gu Mo!

575
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:07,599
I realize something weird.

576
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,280
W...

577
00:33:08,439 --> 00:33:09,319
What?

578
00:33:09,479 --> 00:33:10,479
Do you know that

579
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,560
the distance between
your left shoulder to your neck

580
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:16,199
and the distance between
your right shoulder to your neck

581
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:18,520
are the same?

582
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:21,199
You scared me.

583
00:33:36,479 --> 00:33:37,439
Mr. Jiang.

584
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,760
Where's Lu Li?

585
00:33:38,959 --> 00:33:39,599
Lu Li?

586
00:33:39,719 --> 00:33:41,719
She took leave and went to the hospital.

587
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,560
And now, no one can fix
my broken computer.

588
00:33:43,719 --> 00:33:44,719
Which hospital?

589
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:47,319
Must be the one nearest to here,
the First Hospital.

590
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:51,199
Mr. Jiang, why are you leaving?

591
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,040
She's accompanied by Mr. Lu.

592
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,319
Men are so blind.

593
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,479
How are you?

594
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,239
What did the doctor say?

595
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,959
The doctor said everything was normal.

596
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,959
Thank you for accompanying me
to my check-up.

597
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:15,520
No need to thank me.

598
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,719
Show me the ultrasound of your baby.

599
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,040
I haven't seen it before.

600
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,159
Your baby looks like a pear.

601
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,000
He's clenching his fist.

602
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,959
The doctor told me just now that
he started to grow nails

603
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,000
and now, he can even burp.

604
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,639
That's unbelievable.

605
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,520
But you don't look like

606
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,560
an expectant woman.

607
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:45,479
Maybe because I wear baggy clothes.

608
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,800
Look at this.

609
00:34:49,439 --> 00:34:50,679
(Gynecology Diagnosis Room)
This part of the pear

610
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,919
should be his leg.

611
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,760
Head circumference, 121.

612
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:58,360
Are you pregnant?

613
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,280
Yes.

614
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,719

615
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,479
It's mine.

616
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,919
What?

617
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,399
Didn't you catch it?

618
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,639
As I said, it's mine.

619
00:35:35,879 --> 00:35:36,760
Impossible.

620
00:35:36,919 --> 00:35:38,120
What do you mean?

621
00:35:38,399 --> 00:35:40,719
Don't you know we already live together?

622
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,439
We finally get to travel for once.

623
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:53,399
Cheer up.

624
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,239
Don't frown anymore.

625
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,000

It doesn't hurt.

Oh,

do you remember the safety trinket
you gave us last time?

629

I'll take that as a gift for my baby.

690

is kind

702

You came back all of a sudden.

703
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,439
I bought something and planned to

704
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,520
ask you to bring them to Chongqing.

705
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,840
Let me know earlier
when you come back next time

706
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,320
so that I can buy her more.

708
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,679
I won't go to Chongqing anymore.

709
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:16,439

710
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,320
It's okay.

711
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,679
I'll ask Yiming to send them.

Mom.

713
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:21,600

Tong

716
00:40:25,879 --> 00:40:27,239
already told me

717
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,959
that they didn't look like
a couple at all.

718
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:34,679
They must be acting in front of you.

719
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,159
It's not an act. It's real.

720
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,719
She already moved on.

721
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,520
I shouldn't bother her anymore.

722
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,639
I'm sorry, mom.

Darling,

729
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,439
I think I have

730
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:12,159
a stiff neck again.

731
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,639
It hurts too much.
Can you massage my neck?

732
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:16,959
Darling,

733
00:41:22,399 --> 00:41:23,719
what's the matter?

734
00:41:24,879 --> 00:41:26,080
Tell me.

735
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:27,919
Darling,

736
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,439

738
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:35,879
Okay. Okay.

739
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,239
Calm down.

740
00:41:38,399 --> 00:41:40,600
Tell me what happened slowly.

741
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:41,639
I'm here.

742
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:42,840
I'll figure out a way.

743
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:43,840
Darling,

744
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,959
please give me back my daughter-in-law.

745
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:47,439
All right.

746
00:41:47,439 --> 00:41:47,760
All right.

747
00:41:47,879 --> 00:41:48,479
Calm down.

748
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,919
Oh no.

749
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:52,080
Lu Li won't come back anymore.

750
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,000
That ingrate.

751
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:01,919
Mom.

752
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:03,000
Don't cry.

753
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,040
Don't cry.

754
00:42:09,719 --> 00:42:10,120
Here.

755
00:42:10,439 --> 00:42:11,360

756
00:42:11,479 --> 00:42:12,199
All right.

757
00:42:18,879 --> 00:42:20,679
Jiang Yicheng
didn't come to the office today.

758
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,199
I think he went back to Xinhai.

759
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,399
Okay.

760
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,239
He might need some time.

761
00:42:29,399 --> 00:42:30,959
After all, it's quite

762
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,600
a shocking news.

763
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,159
I'm fine.

764
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,840
If he gives up,

765
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,159
it means my hypothesis is right.

766
00:42:45,879 --> 00:42:49,280
Worst comes to worst,
I'll be back to square one.

767
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,239
That'll be bad.

768
00:42:52,439 --> 00:42:54,320
That means my kind intention
made things worse.

769
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,520
I'll feel guilty
for the rest of my life.

770
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,080
Don't be.

771
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,520
This is between him and I.

772
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,040
Whether it's a happy or bad ending,
I'll accept it.

773
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:10,840
I hope Jiang Yicheng won't let me down.
