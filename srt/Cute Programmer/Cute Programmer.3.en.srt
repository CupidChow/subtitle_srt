21

All done.

22
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,559
Yueru, you did so well.

23
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,519
I struggled so much,

24
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:03,720
and I still couldn't make
it look decent.

25
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:08,279
When we are arranging flowers,
we prefer them sparse than abundant.

26
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,039
It'd be better
if you take away these two.

27
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,039
We prefer them oblique than upright.

28
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,479
You only have to angle it more.

29
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:17,000
It looks way nicer
now that you've fixed it.

30
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,679
You are so talented.

31
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,520
That's too flattering.

32
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,520
We're just arranging flowers.

33
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,839
This doesn't require much talent.

34
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:26,759
Practice makes perfect.

35
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,199
Where's Yicheng?
Why haven't we seen him yet?

36
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,360
Is he dating anyone?

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,039
Yicheng...

38
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:35,240
He's been busy with work lately.

39
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:36,399
Here.

40
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,440
Yicheng is 28 years old
this year, right?

41
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,479
My son had his first child
when he was this age.

42
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,880
Do you know any nice girls?

43
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,199
Introduce some of them to me.

44
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,759
I know some nice girls.

45
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,800
But it won't be nice

46
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,080
to drag them into this.

47
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,119
What are you trying to say?

48
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:58,559
Yueru, there's no need
to lie to us anymore.

49
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,199
The news has spread widely.

50
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,320
What happened?

51
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,559
Can you pay a visit
to your brother's company?

52
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:17,240
No. I have just gained one pound.

53
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,600
I can't meet Yiming today.

54
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,880
Mom, can you calm down

55
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:26,919
and stop crying?

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,720
If dad finds out about this,

57
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,240
I won't be able to get
my allowance this month.

58
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,039
So, are you going there?

59
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:32,600
Yes, I'll be right there.

60
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,440
But why do you want me to go there?

61
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,000
Someone told me that

62
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:38,639
your brother has been bringing along
a guy to his blind dates.

63
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,520
I worry...

64
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,919
Are you suspecting that the guy is...

65
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,919
Yiming.

66
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,600
Lu Li.

67
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,920
Director Gu, are you looking for me?

68
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:18,760
What is your relation
with Jiang Yicheng?

69
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,679
He is my superior, and I'm his staff.

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,839
You knew him
before you joined the company, right?

71
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:29,480
We were barely acquainted.

72
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,640
Barely acquainted?

73
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,799
Then, what is this?

74
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:37,880
No, I...

75
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:38,760
This...

76
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:39,119
I...

77
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:41,679
I accidentally probed
into your private life.

78
00:04:41,799 --> 00:04:42,519
It doesn't mean

79
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,519
that I'm concerned
about your relationship.

80
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:49,160
Then, what do you want?

81
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,880
Break up with Xiaoqi immediately.

82
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,239
Otherwise, I'll do everything I can

83
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:55,279
to remove you from the company.

84
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,440
Sure. I'll give you my words.

85
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,320
But she's not in Xinhai these few days.

86
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,160
I can only break up with her
after she's back.

87
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,119
You gave me your words so quickly.

88
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,920
Indeed, you are never serious
about the relationship.

89
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,640
I'm warning you to stay away from her.

90
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,880
Otherwise, I'll make sure to teach you
a lesson about regret.

91
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:13,559
Besides,

92
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,959
find a suitable breakup excuse
as soon as possible.

93
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,679
Don't let her find anything suspicious.

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,040
Then, the photo...

95
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,040
Don't worry about that.

96
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:23,760
When your breakup is confirmed,

97
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,040
I will delete it.

98
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,440
But before that,

99
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,559
I'll keep an eye on you.

100
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,680
(You don't know what he's like.)

101
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,920
(He loves to put his nose
into other people's businesses.)

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,200
(And he's full of bad ideas.)

103
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,079
(If he knew about our relationship,)

104
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,079
(he would definitely bully you.)

105
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,440
Darn.

106
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,079
It's over.

107
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,000
Hurry up and save it.

108
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,519
She's here.

109
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,279
Who?

110
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:09,160
Witch Jiang.

111
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,480
Mr. Jiang installed
a facial recognition system

112
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:12,160
just to stop her
from entering the office.

113
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,200
Close the door and summon Mr. Chen.

114
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,500
(Let the shoes fly)

115
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:36,559
It's an emergency.

116
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,880
How can you do this to me?

117
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:38,839
Good luck, Mr. Chen.

118
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,440
Let's go.

119
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:44,119
Hurry up.

120
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,880
Hurry up.

121
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,279
Zitong.

122
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,559
Open the door.

123
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,480
Why are you here?

124
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,600
Were you the guy?

125
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,559
What did I do?

126
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,320
Have you fallen for my brother?

127
00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:15,200
In a way,

128
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,799
I do find him quite attractive.

129
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,040
No wonder.

130
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:22,600
No wonder you won't date me

131
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:24,600
even after so many years.

132
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,160
Zitong, I take you as my younger sister.

133
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,600
Sister my foot!

134
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,399
Tell me the truth.

135
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,320
Have you been staying single
all this while

136
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:35,000
because of my brother?

137
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,160
What are you saying?

138
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,559
I'm single

139
00:07:38,679 --> 00:07:40,359
because I haven't met someone I like.

140
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,119
It has nothing to do with your brother.

141
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,359
Is it not because of him?

142
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,440
He's a man.
Why would I stay single for him?

143
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:51,959
So, you weren't the one
who ruined his blind date.

144
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,359
Blind date?

145
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,399
Yiming,

146
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,959
come shopping with me.

147
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,399
Aren't you here for your brother?

148
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:05,160
Nothing else matters
as long as you aren't the one.

149
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:06,320
What others did have
nothing to do with me.

150
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,760
I haven't got off work yet.

151
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:09,679
Mr. Chen,

152
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,839
Mr. Jiang has given you a day off.

153
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,279
What?

154
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,160
This.

155
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,320
Mr. Chen.

156
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,119
Your wallet is here.

157
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,359
You are off work. Let's go.

158
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,279
You...

159
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,559
Bye.

160
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,679
Yiming,

161
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,000
come here.

162
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,320
I...

163
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,000
The door is broken.
It needs to be repaired.

164
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:34,320
I can't get out of here.

165
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,880
What door is this?

166
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,280
The quality is terrible.

167
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,039
Don't bother repairing it.
Get a new door.

168
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,880
I...

169
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,479
Yiming, let's go.

170
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,679
Let's go!

171
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:38,479
Mr. Chen, thank you for your hard work.

172
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:40,320
Mr. Chen, take care.

173
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:42,159
Mr, Chen, you have suffered greatly.

174
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,000
Can Mr. Chen do it?

175
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,039
That really gave me a scare.

176
00:09:55,119 --> 00:09:57,479
We're lucky that we are fit and healthy.

177
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,440
My heart is beating fast.

178
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,320
What happened?

179
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,880
The alarm has been lifted.

180
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,359
A glass door was broken.

181
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,559
Is it that bad?

182
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,039
Oh, my God.

183
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:09,960
It was blown into pieces
and died a horrible death.

184
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,280
My advice to you.

185
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:12,280
When you see her again,

186
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,359
don't hesitate. Just run.

187
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,080
Yes.

188
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,039
Then, Mr. Chen...

189
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:16,799
You know what.

190
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,559
Humans are all selfish, so we had
no choice but to sacrifice him.

191
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,320
By the way,

192
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,559
we received a notice
from the administration department.

193
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:27,159
The company will hold
a team building tomorrow.

194
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,719
Where are we going?

195
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,919
A hot spring resort.

196
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,039
A hot spring resort!

197
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,119
Our dear Lu.

198
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,640
Lu, why are you wearing so much?

199
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,719
Lu.

200
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:44,599
Lu.

201
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,039
Can I take a day off?

202
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,599
Why?

203
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:52,520
Mr. Jiang has set a rule.
Everyone must attend the team building.

204
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:56,440
Moreover, it only happens once a year.
You joined us just in time.

205
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,280
Enjoy it.

206
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,599
We'll gather in front of the company
at 9 AM tomorrow.

207
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,400
Don't be late.

208
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:02,760
Sure.

209
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,359
Don't be late.

210
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,919
I'll be here at 8 AM.

211
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,960
Great.

212
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,760
Everyone has left.

213
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,559
Why are you still here?

214
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:09,679
Good morning, Mr. Jiang.

215
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,400
Don't you know that you're late?

216
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,559
We agreed to assemble at 9 AM.

217
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,760
It's 9.30 AM now.

218
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,559
I was stuck in a traffic jam,
and I was late.

219
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,760
You are really lucky.

220
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,840
I've just finished my work.

221
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,000
Let's go.

222
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:25,479
But we shouldn't be able to
catch up on the bus.

223
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:27,000
That's why I'm driving there.

224
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,080
Aren't you glad?

225
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,580
(Service Termination Alert)

226
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:50,200
Are you waiting for me
to open the door for you?

227
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:54,320
Mr. Jiang, I may not be able
to join you guys.

228
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,159
I just received a text from
the management.

229
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,799
There's a leak in my house.

230
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,719
What a coincidence.

231
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,479
Perhaps, the water pipes have aged.

232
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:04,320
I need to go check the leaking now.

233
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:05,440
If it floods the ground floor,

234
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:07,000
I'll suffer a great loss.

235
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,479
Mr. Jiang, this is such a pity.

236
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:12,159
I can't participate in
my first group activity.

237
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,640
But I'm sure
there will be another chance.

238
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,200
Goodbye, Mr. Jiang.

239
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,440
Lu Li? I'm still at the office.

240
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,760
Couldn't your call get through?

241
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:38,440
Mr. Jiang, why are you still here?

242
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,280
You said you received a text
from the management.

243
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:44,919
Yes...

244
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,039
Then, did you receive the text

245
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,239
I just sent to you?

246
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:53,640
There might be some delay.

247
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,200
Mr. Jiang, what's wrong?

248
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,840
Is it just a delay?
Or, has the service been terminated?

249
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,760
Show me the text
to prove that you're not lying.

250
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,320
Or, you can just come with me now.

251
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,960
You intend to skip your first
group activity in this company.

252
00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:07,840
Do you want to find yourself
a new company?

253
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:25,119
Seat belt.

254
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:26,719
Thanks.

255
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,679
Otherwise, I'll be the one
who gets my point deducted.

256
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:36,479
Has anyone told you before

257
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:37,640
that you resemble an animal?

258
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,559
What animal?

259
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,200
Koala. Slow to respond and act.

260
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:48,119
I'm cautious and
I go according to my own schedule.

261
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,919
I'm an honest and reliable person.

262
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:52,760
Koala is obviously the dumbest animal.

263
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,039
Mr. Jiang, do you want me to drive?

264
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,159
Do you know how to drive?

265
00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:46,359
Mr. Jiang, I haven't driven
this model before.

266
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,880
I heard that it's running on turbos,

267
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,159
and has strong power output.

268
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,119
Sit tight.

269
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:51,479
How fast can you...

270
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,479
Car... Car... Over there!

271
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,559
Watch out for the car!

272
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,239
Over there!

273
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,559
You can go really fast.

274
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,679
Mr. Jiang, are you feeling all right?

275
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,799
I swear this would be my last time
sitting in a car you drive.

276
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:52,520
Come on in.

277
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,760
Mr. Jiang, I'll leave your luggage here.

278
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,880
I'll go meet up with other colleagues.

279
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,959
We are sharing a room.

280
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,680
No.

281
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,000
You are my superior.

282
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,400
How can we share a room?

283
00:17:10,479 --> 00:17:12,359
I can just share a room
with other colleagues.

284
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,760
All the rooms have been assigned.

285
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,000
Are you going to sleep
in the corridor?

286
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,119
I'll book another room.

287
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,000
The hotel has been fully booked.

288
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,400
Do you think I like to
share a bed with you?

289
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:19,880
No. I snore in my sleep.

290
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,119
Then, you can sleep on the couch.

291
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,079
Why are you still standing there?

292
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:26,719
Are you going to take a shower?

293
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,119
No.

294
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:29,280
Then, I'll go ahead.

295
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,880
What should I do?

296
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:36,239
What should I do?

297
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,000
Three. Cheese!

298
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:31,040
What do you think about this?

299
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:31,800
Let's go.

300
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,520
Edit it.

301
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,520
I'll send it to you later.

302
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,880
Lu Li.

303
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:36,040
Where are you going?

304
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:36,800
We tried calling you

305
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:37,839
and sending you texts, but to no avail.

306
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:39,800
I was stuck in a traffic jam.

307
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,040
I guess you're heading
to the hot spring.

308
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:42,599
Let's go.

309
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,079
Let's go.

310
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,479
Yes.

311
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,199
I'll skip it.

312
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:44,880
You shall go ahead.

313
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:45,640
Why not?

314
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:46,479
Taking a bath in the hot spring

315
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:47,959
not only can reduce muscle soreness,

316
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,280
but also can promote blood circulation

317
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,439
and relieve fatigue. How nice is that!

318
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:50,920
Let's go.

319
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,560
Exactly.

320
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:52,359
If you don't take a bath
in the hot spring,

321
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,959
all the work you've done before
will go to waste.

322
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:54,680
No.

323
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,760
I visited the hot spring with
my girlfriend some time ago.

324
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,280
I'll skip it this time.

325
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:57,719
Carry on without me.

326
00:19:00,199 --> 00:19:00,680
You...

327
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,479
How dare you speak of your girlfriend

328
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,959
in front of a group of single men?

329
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,959
Are you trying to dig your own grave?

330
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,119
Is this appropriate?

331
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:07,000
I...

332
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:09,760
All of you...

333
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,719
Grab him.

334
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,479
Let's go.

335
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,839
We have to take a bath
in the hot spring.

336
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:17,880
We have to take a bath.

337
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,000
(Section four)

338
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,359
Why haven't you got changed?

339
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:26,520
My friend is looking for me urgently.

340
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:27,959
I have to reply to her text immediately.

341
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,079
I'll be right there.

342
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:29,920
Hurry up.

343
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,560
I'm warning you.

344
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,599
If you try to run away,

345
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,199
I'll catch you in your room.

346
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:34,920
Hurry up.

347
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,959
Wait for me.

348
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Hurry up.

349
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,640
(Warm Prompt)

350
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,180
(Section four)

351
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,640
Look. I'm floating.

352
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:58,560
It's really nice here.

353
00:19:59,079 --> 00:19:59,719
It's me again.

354
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,680
Scrub it.

355
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,839
Sure.

356
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:09,319
Lu Li.

357
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:11,439
Isn't it a bit too warm
to wear so much here?

358
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,520
I don't find it warm.

359
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,079
Lu. A real man only needs a bath towel.

360
00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:16,400
Join us.

361
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:17,479
Hurry up.

362
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:20,959
He wants to stand out,

363
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:22,920
so that he can attract
the girls' attention.

364
00:20:23,719 --> 00:20:24,800
You're right.

365
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,160
Ms. Yezi from
the administration department

366
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,359
asked us about you today.

367
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:30,959
Yes. She asked about you.

368
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,760
You're too cunning.

369
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,800
Brothers,

370
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:34,719
drag him in.

371
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,719
Get him.

372
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:37,560
Don't... Don't come near me.

373
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,000
I'll take it off myself.

374
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:38,839
I'll take it off myself, please.

375
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:39,560
I'll take it off myself.

376
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,160
Hurry up.

377
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,000
Take it off. We'll be watching you.

378
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,040
Wow.

379
00:20:59,119 --> 00:20:59,959
Terrific.

380
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,040
What a great idea.

381
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:02,959
You're not just cunning.

382
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:04,839
You're extremely cunning.

383
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:06,040
Send me the link later.

384
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:06,800
It'll be useful to all of us.

385
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,199
Just send it to the chatroom.

386
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:07,839
Sure.

387
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,319
Send it to the chatroom.

388
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,040
Sure.

389
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,599
Let's go.

390
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,239
It's nice over there.

391
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:12,000
Here.

392
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:13,599
I'm coming.

393
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,319
It's slippery over here.

394
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:17,520
Over here.

395
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,359
It has a nice temperature here.

396
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:21,719
It's quite comfortable.

397
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:23,520
I'm coming.

398
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:26,560
Is that Yezi?

399
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,359
I have no idea.

400
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:28,239
We can only find out
when she turns around.

401
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:28,839
Yes.

402
00:21:28,959 --> 00:21:29,520
It's definitely her.

403
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,800
I don't think you should do this.

404
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:33,680
I think I'm in love again.

405
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,000
You are always in love.

406
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,920
Retreat!

407
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:42,920
Old Ape.

408
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:43,880
What are you doing, Old Ape?

409
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:44,800
What's going on?

410
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,800
Who are the perverts?

411
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,800
What's going on?

412
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,520
What's wrong?

413
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,719
Why are we the perverts?

414
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,560
I was just taking a bath,
and I became a pervert.

415
00:21:50,719 --> 00:21:51,719
Pervert?

416
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:52,680
What went wrong?

417
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,239
Mr. Chen, did you see

418
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,479
a group of men running past?

419
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,640
They went that way.

420
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:10,400
Mr. Chen, come with us.

421
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:12,119
The perverts were spying on us
while we were taking a bath.

422
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,040
Hurry up.

423
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:37,280
Why are you here?

424
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:40,040
You...

425
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:10,359
Bad things happen
whenever I run into you.

426
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,599
Are you leaving?

427
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:20,400
I don't want to take a bath
in the water you used before.

428
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,079
Don't you feel embarrassed?

429
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:34,719
You're all grown men.
Yet you spied on girls in the bath.

430
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,760
Did I wrong you?

431
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:40,520
How dare you spy on your own colleagues?

432
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,560
We meet regularly.

433
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,680
Aren't you ashamed of what you did?

434
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,319
I won't let you go.

435
00:23:44,719 --> 00:23:45,479
What's going on?

436
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,560
Mr. Jiang, they spied on us in the bath.

437
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:50,359
These guys?

438
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:51,880
Anyone else?

439
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:54,839
I...

440
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,359
So, you were the guy
who ran away quietly.

441
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,560
Yes, but I...

442
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,439
How do you want them to be punished?

443
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:05,959
After we return to the office,

444
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,760
they will have to
work in women's clothes

445
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,760
for a day.

446
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:10,319
You disrespected women,

447
00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:11,479
and this is the consequence
you have to bear.

448
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:14,479
Do you have any objections?

449
00:24:14,479 --> 00:24:15,119
I...

450
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,959
I'm already letting you off lightly.

451
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:17,719
All right.

452
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:19,400
So, that's it.

453
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,520
Let's go.

454
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Let's go.

455
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:22,839
Why are you still squatting here?

456
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:23,640
Leave.

457
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,839
Hurry up.

458
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:31,719
Mr. Jiang, I didn't spy
on them in the bath.

459
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,319
I did try to remind them.

460
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:35,880
I didn't know you had such a fetish.

461
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,479
Excuse me.

462
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,359
Do you have any medicine
for neck soreness?

463
00:24:53,439 --> 00:24:55,079
Sorry. We don't have it here.

464
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,560
Thanks.

465
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:01,220
(Pharmacy)

466
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,000
Lu Li.

467
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,680
Mr. Chen, how can I help you?

468
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:06,520
Who are you sharing a room with?

469
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:08,719
Mr. Jiang.

470
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:10,680
Is that a room with a king-sized bed?

471
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:12,280
Will it be inconvenient for you?

472
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:13,520
Do you want me to get you another room?

473
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,119
The administration department
has inquired about it.

474
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:16,239
It's the peak season,

475
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:17,719
and there's no more vacant room.

476
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,680
Let me know

477
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,560
if you need anything.

478
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,800
Sure. Thanks, Mr. Chen.

479
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,800
I'm heading out.

480
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,560
You're going out alone late at night.

481
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,680
Do you need me to come along?

482
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,520
That's not necessary.
I can handle it myself.

483
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,680
Goodbye, Mr. Chen.

484
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,680
Take care.

485
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,640
Sure.

486
00:25:55,420 --> 00:26:01,440

(Zhong Tai Medicine,
pharmacy for good health)

491
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:19,280
It's basic etiquette
to inform your roommate

492
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:20,640
before you go anywhere.

493
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,560
Sorry. I'll not repeat it.

494
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:26,199
Where did you go late at night?

495
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,119
I bought some relieving patches for you.

496
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:30,400
I noticed that you are having pain
in your neck.

497
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,400
You went out late at night

498
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:34,400
just to buy me these?

499
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:37,160
The pharmacy is quite far away.

500
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,880
Therefore, I came back slightly later.

501
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:40,599
But I'll inform you beforehand
the next time I go out.

502
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:42,079
Let me put it on for you.

503
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,160
How did you know that
I'm suffering from neck pain?

504
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:09,280
I saw the massage device in your office.

505
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,239
You were massaging your neck
the whole time today.

506
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:15,199
The staff told me that
this product is very effective.

00:28:16,479 --> 00:28:17,479
Done.

508
00:28:18,719 --> 00:28:20,680
This contains ingredients
that can enhance your blood circulation.

509
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,479
It'll heat up soon.

510
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,319
Why?

511
00:28:30,719 --> 00:28:32,479
I wonder when it will start working.

512
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,680
Then, let me give you a massage.

513
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:35,959
Do you know how to give a massage?

514
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,959
Mr. Jiang, am I hurting you?

515
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:14,880
It's the heat.

516
00:29:16,199 --> 00:29:18,160
I guess the patch is finally working.

517
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:24,000
I'm thirsty.

518
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:25,760
Get me a drink from the fridge.

519
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:41,359
Mr. Jiang, they only provide beer.

520
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:44,359
Beer should be all right.

521
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,359
Bring it over.

522
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,160
Mr. Jiang, don't lift your chin.

523
00:30:01,239 --> 00:30:02,800
Drink it with a straw.

524
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,040
Mr. Jiang, are you drunk?

525
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:40,199
You only had two cans of beer.

526
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,439
Hug.

527
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:49,000
Hug.

528
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:50,880
Hug.

529
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,439
Mr. Jiang, wake up.

530
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,239
Hug.

531
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:03,040
Hug.

532
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,920
Hug.

533
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,199
Mr. Jiang,

534
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,119
don't sleep here.

535
00:31:10,199 --> 00:31:11,280
Sleep on the bed.

536
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:13,359
Should I help you to the bed?

537
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,719
Hug.

538
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,800
Here.

539
00:31:21,719 --> 00:31:22,760
Hug.

540
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,439
Don't... Stop...

541
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,640
Hug.

542
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:31,400
Dad, I'm back.

543
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:35,199
Keep your voice down.

544
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:37,520
I have just put my wife to sleep.

545
00:31:37,719 --> 00:31:38,719
What's wrong with mom?

546
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,400
It's all because of your brother.

547
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:47,560
Your mom sent you
to the company to inquire into it.

548
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,959
What have you discovered?

549
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:51,040
Don't worry. I've verified it.

550
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,479
It wasn't Yiming.

551
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,760
Then, who was that?

552
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,599
It doesn't matter
as long as it wasn't Yiming.

553
00:31:56,719 --> 00:31:57,839
Who cares who the guy is.

554
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:00,520
But your brother's blind date said

555
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:02,400
that he hugged the guy

556
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,319
publicly.

557
00:32:04,479 --> 00:32:05,319
Is that true?

558
00:32:06,765 --> 00:32:09,319
Perhaps, Jiang Yicheng did that

559
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,479
to avoid a blind date.

560
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,959
You know what he's like.

561
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,719
Keep your voice down.

562
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,680
You know what he's like.

563
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,839
He's always been a quick-witted guy.

564
00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:19,160
I can't be bothered.

565
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:22,920
Old Jiang, look at the bracelet
I just bought.

566
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,880
Isn't it nice?

567
00:32:28,439 --> 00:32:31,760
I heard that
you have your eyes on a car.

568
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,119
Old Jiang, don't worry.

569
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,839
I heard that

570
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:40,920
they are having a team building
at a hot spring hotel.

571
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:43,199
I'll immediately find out
who the guy is.

572
00:32:44,239 --> 00:32:45,119
It's late now.

573
00:32:45,199 --> 00:32:45,839
You shall wait till tomorrow.

574
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,520
No. My new car can't wait any longer.

575
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,839
I'll get back to you soon.

576
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,719
Let me go.

577
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,079
Let me go.

578
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:11,680
Why? Are you feeling sorry for him?

579
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,520
You're giving me a headache.

580
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:13,479
Why are you here?

581
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:15,319
How can I catch you red-handed
if I don't come here out of the blue?

582
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:21,800
Even if I can't get any evidence,

583
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,040
I can at least be the witness.

584
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,599
What is dad going to buy you this time?

585
00:33:25,719 --> 00:33:26,520
Car...

586
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:28,880
He's not buying me anything.

587
00:33:29,439 --> 00:33:30,839
Mom has been crying for the whole day.

588
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,760
Her tears are going to flood our house.

589
00:33:33,199 --> 00:33:34,760
I'm trying to share my mom's burdens.

590
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:36,680
No.

591
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:38,760
What are you doing?

592
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:41,119
Jiang Yicheng, I thought

593
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,920
that it was just you
trying to avoid a blind date.

594
00:33:43,199 --> 00:33:44,520
I didn't expect that...

595
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,119
Personally, I'm not against this.

596
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,359
But our parents won't be able
to accept this.

597
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:52,560
You should give him up

598
00:33:52,719 --> 00:33:54,199
for the sake of our family.

599
00:34:04,239 --> 00:34:06,640
Yicheng, if you keep doing this,

600
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,040
dad will kick you out.

601
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:13,679
Of course, I will be very happy

602
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,239
when I get all the inheritance,

603
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,320
but...

604
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:23,679
When I think about how much
you're going to suffer out there, I...

605
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:24,679
Bro.

606
00:34:25,479 --> 00:34:27,399
Bro, stop acting.

607
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,280
I used him as an excuse.

608
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,080
I knew it.

609
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,959
But why are you sharing a bed?

610
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,919
I was drunk.

611
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,360
Have you...

612
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,239
I'm beginning to feel sorry for him.

613
00:34:43,959 --> 00:34:45,280
Since you aren't a real couple,

614
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,919
then what about some hush money?

615
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,919
Family should always come before money.

616
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,639
Then, I'll have to
tell mom and dad about this.

617
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:52,840
Get ready

618
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:54,760
for another round of blind dates.

619
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,600
Don't you want to
join our company anymore?

620
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,479
I brought you something healthier.

621
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,560
I don't know if you'll like it.

622
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:16,639
Thanks, Mr. Chen.

623
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,679
Do you have milk only?

624
00:35:19,879 --> 00:35:21,239
That's enough for me.

625
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:25,639
Did anything happen
to you yesterday night?

626
00:35:26,879 --> 00:35:30,040
I ran quite fast and I didn't get hurt.

627
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,760
I'm not talking about
what happened at the hot spring.

628
00:35:32,959 --> 00:35:34,520
I knew it had nothing to do with you.

629
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,479
Why are you so sure about it?

630
00:35:37,959 --> 00:35:41,439
That's because...
I found out something accidentally.

631
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,639
What?

632
00:35:42,959 --> 00:35:43,959
Yiming...

633
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:45,919
Why did you come here by yourself?

634
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,080
You didn't even wait for me.

635
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,239
I'm hungry.

636
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:50,679
Can you get me some food?

637
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:51,879
Sure.

638
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,719
What do you want?

639
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,360
Anything.

640
00:35:53,479 --> 00:35:54,879
I will enjoy whatever food you bring.

641
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:57,320
Lu Li.

642
00:35:57,879 --> 00:35:59,120
What else do you want?
I'll get it for you too.

643
00:35:59,199 --> 00:35:59,919
That's not necessary.

644
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,439
He's a fit man.

645
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,479
Why do you care about him?

646
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,639
Aren't you fit too?

647
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,239
You...

648
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,080
Lu Li.

649
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,439
Go get food.

650
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,360
Sure.

651
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,800
During our previous meal,

652
00:36:39,919 --> 00:36:41,000
I noticed that you enjoyed
eating shrimp.

653
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,120
Therefore, I ordered
seafood congee for you.

654
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,199
You know me so well.

655
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,520
I only eat salad in the morning.

656
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:49,840
Really?

657
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,639
Lu Li.

658
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:53,439
I got you a glass of juice.

659
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,840
I happen to be thirsty.

660
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:07,919
Should I get you another glass?

661
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,439
It's okay. I'm not thirsty.

662
00:37:10,399 --> 00:37:11,760
He's a man.

663
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,439
Why are you always looking after him?

664
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,520
Yiming.

665
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:18,040
I heard there is a stable riding
right next to us.

666
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:19,360
After breakfast,

667
00:37:19,399 --> 00:37:20,639
let's go horse riding.

668
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,040
Horse riding?

669
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:22,840
Yicheng.

670
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,199
Do you want to come with us?

671
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:28,719
Sure.

672
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,520
This fits you quite well.

673
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,760
Really?

674
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,120
This is my first time riding a horse.

675
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,520
I'm feeling a little nervous.

676
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,479
Don't worry.

677
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,639
The horses here are well trained.

678
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,320
As long as you follow
the coach's instructions,

679
00:38:08,439 --> 00:38:09,639
you'll be safe.

680
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,959
Thanks, Mr. Chen.

681
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:12,879
Gloves.

682
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:14,800
Thanks, Mr. Jiang.

683
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:18,320
I'll go ahead.

684
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,100
(Stable)

685
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:34,919
Don't come near me.

686
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,040
What's wrong?

687
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,360
Yiming.

688
00:38:39,479 --> 00:38:40,879
It keeps staring at me.

689
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,280
I'm scared.

690
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,840
Can you lead the horse for me?

691
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:47,600
I'll help you.

692
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:27,959
By the way, Yiming,

693
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,199
I forgot to tell you that,

694
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,639
from today on,

695
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,719
I will become your colleague officially.

696
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,919
Has your brother agreed to recruit you?

697
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,000
Of course.

698
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,439
In the future,

699
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,320
I'll be able to see you at work.

700
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:44,560
Then, we can start

701
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:47,439
a passionate office romance.

702
00:39:49,879 --> 00:39:51,639
Do you not have any other interests?

703
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,360
No.

704
00:39:52,479 --> 00:39:53,800
I'm only interested in you.

705
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,679
Stop.

706
00:40:11,439 --> 00:40:12,360
Hold the reins.

707
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,040
Don't let go.

708
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:15,479
Hold the reins.

709
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,520
Don't let go.

710
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:17,959
Hang in there.

711
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:18,760
Lu Li.

712
00:41:18,879 --> 00:41:19,639
Are you all right?

713
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,479
I'm okay

714
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,919
thanks to Mr. Jiang.

715
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,560
Do you want me to help you down?

716
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,399
There's no need for that.

717
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,000
I want to keep riding for a while.

718
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:27,360
You're so courageous.

719
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:29,639
Then, I'll teach you how.

720
00:41:31,479 --> 00:41:33,159
I can learn it from the coach.

721
00:41:33,439 --> 00:41:34,320
All members of our family

722
00:41:34,399 --> 00:41:35,719
had undergone equestrian training
when we were little.

723
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,159
We are more than qualified to teach you.

724
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,600
If coding is the language

725
00:41:55,919 --> 00:41:57,600
humans use to communicate with computers,

726
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:58,919
then your body

727
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,120
is the best language you can use
to communicate with the horse.

728
00:42:02,959 --> 00:42:03,679
Relax.

729
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:05,239
Don't fret.

730
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,239
Move along with it.

731
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,399
Feel it.

732
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,879
I think I got the gist.

733
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:22,919
By the way,

734
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,159
did anything happen yesterday night?

735
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,199
Can't you remember anything?

736
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:32,479
After I finished the beer,
I blacked out.

737
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,239
You have a really low
tolerance for alcohol.

738
00:42:37,479 --> 00:42:39,360
I hope I didn't do anything weird.

739
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,600
No.

740
00:42:41,879 --> 00:42:44,520
You fell asleep right after that.

741
00:42:56,479 --> 00:42:58,600
(When you are with your crush,)

742
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,639
(remember to apply
the arbitrary-precision arithmetic.)

743
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,560
(Then, he won't be able to discover)

744
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,879
(the feelings you have for him.)
