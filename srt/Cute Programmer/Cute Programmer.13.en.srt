20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,599
Zitong, you're here.

21
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,720
I'll give you 10 minutes.

22
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,940
What do you want to say? Say it now.

23
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:00,760
Do you want any drinks?

24
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,680
Nine more minutes.

25
00:02:04,839 --> 00:02:06,000
Is this how...

26
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:09,220
we're going to talk to each other
in the future?

27
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:12,319
Why?

28
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,720
Are you upset?

29
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:15,119
If you feel upset,

30
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,520
you shouldn't have done
what you did three years ago.

31
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:20,360
To be honest,
I didn't plan to meet you today.

32
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:23,641
But I heard you've been bothering everyone
for the past few days.

33
00:02:23,721 --> 00:02:25,241
You asked my brother
and my sister-in-law out.

34
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,475
Oh, yes.

35
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:30,240
I guess you've already found out
about my brother's marriage.

36
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,679
Yes, I have.

37
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:35,960
I asked them out...

38
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,759
for a catch-up.

39
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,319
A catch-up?

40
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,039
It seems like you disregarded what I said.

41
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,919
Fine. I'll remind you once again.

42
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:51,679
Don't even think about plotting anything.

43
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:54,199
If you dare break up their marriage,

44
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:55,960
I won't show you any mercy.

45
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:59,639
Back then, we were good friends.

46
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,800
How did it turn out like this?

47
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,199
That was in the past.

48
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,160
How did it turn out like this?

49
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,160
Don't you know the answer yourself?

50
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,000
Zitong,

51
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:19,119
do you still remember...

52
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,440
our first meeting?

53
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,520
During our first meeting,
you made fun of my unfashionable outfit.

54
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:30,479
Because of that,
I cried in secret after I got home.

55
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,360
I thought you looked down on me.

56
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,560
But what I didn't expect was that...

57
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,160
on my birthday,
you bought me a very expensive dress.

58
00:03:40,399 --> 00:03:41,239
Do you know...

59
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,000
that it was my first time ever...

60
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,679
wearing such an expensive dress?

61
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,559
That was why I cherished it a lot.

62
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:56,759
I only wore it
when I went on dates with your brother.

63
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,440
Do you still remember this dress?

64
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,501
You should throw out your old clothes.

65
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:08,400
Don't you know that you
should cut off meaningless things in life?

66
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:14,160
Yes.

67
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,320
I am now capable of buying dresses
more expensive than this.

68
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:21,160
But I will always...

69
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,640
keep this dress in my closet.

70
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,320
Because you gave it to me.

71
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:31,600
If you had known it would come to this,
you shouldn't have acted that way.

72
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,720
What happened back then was my fault.

73
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:43,640
I apologize to you.

74
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,040
For the past three years,

75
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:49,799
I've been living in guilt.

76
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,080
You should apologize to my brother.

77
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,676
You hurt him.

78
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,920
No. Don't go near him.

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,320
If you have anything to say,
just say it to me.

80
00:04:59,119 --> 00:05:00,239
I invited you here...

81
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,200
to tell you that...

82
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,399
I've decided to get over Yicheng.

83
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,040
Really?

84
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:13,840
You have to keep your words.

85
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,040
I'll keep my words.

86
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:28,160
You told me that Yicheng and Miss Lu
haven't been dating for long.

87
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,880
I genuinely had no idea
that they got married.

88
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,640
It did catch us off guard.

89
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:37,200
But nothing can stop true love.

90
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,319
I guess Miss Lu came
from a wealthy family.

91
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,239
Who told you that?

92
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,319
Lu Li came from a middle-class family.

93
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,720
Despite that, my mom likes her a lot.

94
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,960
Because she's an innocent,
kind and genuine girl.

95
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,160
How is that possible?

96
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:58,680
Why would aunt approve of someone
who came from a middle-class family?

97
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,319
Why not?

98
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,920
If my mom cared
about her family background,

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,760
would she have agreed
to let my brother date you?

100
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,400
Tell you what.

101
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,599
My mom handpicked lu Li.

102
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:10,599
Otherwise, they wouldn't
have gotten married in haste.

103
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:12,719
Then, what about Yicheng?

104
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,919
Did he agree to the marriage?

105
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,800
If he dares say no,
my dad will close down his company.

106
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:23,640
So did uncle threaten to disinvest
if he refused to get married?

107
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,120
What... disinvestment?

108
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,119
That was just an analogy.

109
00:06:32,999 --> 00:06:35,520
Their cakes are quite delicious.

110
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,039
Do you want me to recommend some to you?

111
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:40,159
It's okay. I'll pick it myself.

112
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,800
Amy.

113
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,280
You don't have
to book an air ticket anymore.

114
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,080
There are some changes.

115
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,360
Stupid Koala.

116
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,440
I asked you to race against time.

117
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,280
I didn't tell you to stay up all night.

118
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,060
(Data Driver, Game Operation)

119
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,360
-Lu Li, let's go for lunch.
-Let's go for lunch.

120
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,160
I'm not going with you.
Can you bring some food for me?

121
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,080
Anything will do.

122
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:40,240
You're getting too obsessed.

123
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,880
-Let's go.
-We'll go without you.

124
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,480
I'm finally done.

125
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,560
Lu, have you been under too much pressure
as of late?

126
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,120
Do you want me
to introduce my psychiatrist to you?

127
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,680
Lu, drink this.

128
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,359
Try this.

129
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,040
I won't lie to you.

130
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,956
Drink it.

131
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,880
A big gulp.

132
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,679
Don't spit it out. Swallow it.

133
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,400
That's right.

134
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:39,600
What is this?

135
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,680
This is the good stuff.

136
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,119
This can make you wiser, relieve fatigue,
and boost your immunity.

137
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:45,279
My wife bought it.

138
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,680
I'm worried you're overworking your brain
and might suffer from hair loss.

139
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,075
Thanks.

140
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:52,400
Old Ape, this is a supplement for seniors.

141
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,840
It's not suitable
for young people like us.

142
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,040
What do you know?

143
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:56,599
You've finished the book.

144
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,920
So have you had any idea?

145
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,119
Lu, this...

146
00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:05,319
Ideas come from experience.

147
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,519
You have read so many books.

148
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:07,759
They will certainly be helpful.

149
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,220
Don't push yourself too hard.

150
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,640
Let's go.

151
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,520
-Old man.
-You're the old man.

152
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,480
You are the only old man here.

153
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:29,060
(Fasten your seat belts
for your own safety)

154
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,140
Can you keep the volume down?

155
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,760
What?

156
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,880
I told you to keep the volume down.
I'm trying to put together a proposal.

157
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:49,639
So have you gotten any idea?

158
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,199
Not yet.

159
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,240
You've been keeping yourself
inside the room.

160
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,759
The ideas can't find you.

161
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,639
You were the one who said
that we must race against time.

162
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,000
I wanted you to stay focus.

163
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,236
I never said to lock yourself in the room
and study endlessly.

164
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,599
What a stupid Koala.

165
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,759
Anyway, you're always right.

166
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,040
Do you want to take a break
and play a game with me?

167
00:12:19,599 --> 00:12:20,716
What game?

168
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,755
Sit here.

169
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:22,800
Wait for me.

170
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:39,279
We will both
write down our respective terms.

171
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,199
But we can't reveal it to the other party.

172
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:42,960
Then, we will ask each other
five questions...

173
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,360
which can be only answered
with yes or no.

174
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,400
Whoever guesses the term first
will be the winner.

175
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,159
The loser will receive a forfeit.

176
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:51,039
All right.

177
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,520
Write it down.

178
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,195
Are you done?

179
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,119
Yes.

180
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,599
You can go first.

181
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:15,279
Is this a person's name?

182
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:16,919
No.

183
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:18,720
Is it an item?

184
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,716
No.

185
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,675
What about mine?

186
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:21,599
No, it isn't.

187
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,799
-Is it alive?
-Yes.

188
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,555
Is it a human?

189
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,479
No.

190
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,440
Is it an animal I fear?

191
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,000
Is it a bird?

192
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,940
(Bird)

193
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,060
(Koala)

194
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,040
It's a koala.

195
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:46,880
Just admit defeat.

196
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,599
Koala Lu.

197
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,959
Fine. What's the forfeit?

198
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,479
A forehead flick.

199
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,639
Be gentle.

200
00:14:01,719 --> 00:14:03,000
It won't be a forfeit if I do it gently.

201
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:15,559
Is that all?

202
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:18,519
If you think it's too gentle,

203
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:19,440
I can do it again.

204
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,879
That's enough.

205
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:22,880
Next game.

206
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,320
Do you still want to play
even if you lost?

207
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,519
After playing the game with you,

208
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:30,560
I feel much more relaxed.

209
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,599
I was really troubled just now.

210
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:36,279
It felt as if the time had slowed down.

211
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,519
Do you know what this is called?
The Theory of Relativity.

212
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:42,040
It means that
when you're working alone in the room,

213
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,160
time stays still.

214
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,801
But when you're playing a game
with someone else,

215
00:14:44,881 --> 00:14:46,319
time slips away quickly.

216
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,399
It went by just like that.
You'll never be able to catch up with it.

217
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,400
This is mine.

218
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:01,519
I got it!

219
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,960
What is it?

220
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:05,879
Nowadays, many games

221
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:07,719
allow players to team up and
interact with others.

222
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:11,279
But why do they find it difficult

223
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,880
to make friends in real life?

224
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,880
Because they only interact
with each other online.

225
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,399
They hardly meet each other in real life.

226
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:18,799
Exactly.

227
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,560
If we get to play the game in real life,

228
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,719
not only can we get feedback
right on the spot,

229
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,959
but we can also befriend each other
more easily.

230
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,560
So what's your idea?

231
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,839
If we can develop a game

232
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,719
that doesn't only allow them to make
friends and raise virtual pets online,

233
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,360
but also enables them
to play together in real life,

234
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,115
isn't that a good idea?

235
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:41,039
And then?

236
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,199
I haven't figured out the details yet.

237
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,199
I didn't know a koala could think.

238
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,520
Interesting.

239
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,719
Koala.

240
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:56,920
Don't you like your nickname?

241
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,400
It's too late now.

242
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,559
I gave you the nickname Koala

243
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,479
simply because I thought

244
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,560
you resembled this animal a lot.

245
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:09,999
I have an idea.

246
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,399
I know how to carry this out.

247
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,320
What is it?

248
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,820
I need to write it down immediately.

249
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,440
Did you stay up all night yesterday?

250
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,440
This is the finalized proposal.

251
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,360
I'll check it out later.

252
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,519
Go sleep now.

253
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,639
I'm going to work later.

254
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,916
I'm your boss.

255
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,840
I'm giving you a day off.

256
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,596
That...

257
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,279
Let me know if there's an issue.

258
00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:10,155
No.

259
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:11,880
Whatever issue there is,
let's talk only after you wake up.

260
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,440
Go to sleep.

261
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:28,920
Go to sleep.

262
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,380
(Xuan Zhong Ji, Proposal)

263
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,140
(Game Overview)

264
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:07,999
Mr. Liu.

265
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,879
We have some ideas for the new game.

266
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,040
When will you be free?

267
00:18:15,504 --> 00:18:16,365
If I'm to use a phrase...

268
00:18:16,445 --> 00:18:17,799
to introduce this game,
(New Product Introduction)

269
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:18,960
it'd be "breaking circles."
(Breaking Circles)

270
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:20,600
It can break the circle of co-workers,

271
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,679
circle of acquaintances,
and circle of friends.

272
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:24,359
For players who work in big cities,

273
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,640
and have no time to make friends,

274
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,679
they can make more friends...

275
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:29,399
through this game...
(Features, Theme, Style)

276
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:32,120
and will no longer feel lonely.

277
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,279
This is the true meaning
behind the game "Xuan Zhong Ji."

278
00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:36,960
So how can we achieve this?

279
00:18:37,479 --> 00:18:39,120
It has easy and relaxing gameplay...

280
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,519
that allows the players
to be themselves online.

281
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:45,120
If they run into a friend
they want to get to know better,

282
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,239
they can meet up in real life.

283
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,880
With AR technology,

284
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,199
they can raise their pets together
in real life,

285
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:51,399
and better their friendship.

286
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,840
We encourage our players
to meet up in real life,

287
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,800
and with the help of the game,
expand their social circles.

288
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,260
This is what motivates us
to develop this game.

289
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,480
Most of the mythical animals...
(MMO game of pet capturing)

290
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,120
in the game originated
from "Shan Hai Jing."

291
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,080
Tentatively, we will name it
"Xuan Zhong Ji."

292
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,120
Mr. Liu, what do you think?

293
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,399
Do you like the idea?

294
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:12,479
Mr. Jiang,
I didn't expect you to be able...

295
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,560
to come up
with such a novel core mechanic.

296
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:17,479
I'm very happy with the proposal.

297
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,799
(Xuan Zhong Ji)

298
00:19:27,879 --> 00:19:28,999
Mr. Jiang, stop here.

299
00:19:29,479 --> 00:19:31,279
When can I get a definite answer
from your side?

300
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:33,480
I'll report it to my superior
once I get back.

301
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,639
It will take at most half a month.

302
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:36,279
There shouldn't be any problem.

303
00:19:36,879 --> 00:19:38,119
Thanks for your trust.

304
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,840
Our headquarter indeed was very unhappy
with Mr. Jiang's attitude.

305
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:43,560
However, Miss Li spoke highly of you,

306
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,680
and our headquarter decided
to reconsider our collaboration.

307
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,159
Are you saying that Li Man
is still in charge of this project?

308
00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:52,560
Miss Li has left me fully in charge
of liaison with your company.

309
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,920
However, she is still the person
in charge of the project.

310
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:02,119
Where is she now?

311
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,275
What are you doing? What are you doing?

312
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:06,199

known across the company.

Thanks, guys.

319
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,560
But you should thank Mr. Jiang instead.

Stop showing off your relationship
in the company.

You said you had no money.

332
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,959
Do you think I won't hit you?
Stop right there.

333
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,640
It's you.

334
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,920
Yicheng.

335
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,200
What happened three years ago
had nothing to do with me.

336
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:18,519
You got the money.
Why are you still here?

337
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:20,719
Yicheng.

(Somerset Yuanrong Plaza

339
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,876
There are surveillance cameras here.
You should call the police.

340
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,075
Never mind.

341
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:28,799
He is a robber.
You have to call the police.

342
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:29,719
He's my dad.

343
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,159
-What?
-He is my gambler of a father...

344
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:35,239
who has been abusing me
since I was little.

345
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,159
How did you find out I live here?

346
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:44,839
Mr. Liu told me.

347
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,960
Can I help you?

348
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,159
I heard that you are involved
in our company's investment report.

349
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,160
Yes.

350
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:56,999
But someone else
is now in charge of the liaison.

351
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:59,440
You don't have to worry about it.

352
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:02,560
Li Man, what do you want?

353
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,840
I only want to make it up for you.

354
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:08,720
I want to pay back what I owed you
in the past few years.

355
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,319
Do you want to make it up for me? Sorry.

356
00:22:11,399 --> 00:22:12,239
I won't accept it.

357
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:14,920
I'm here to make things clear.

358
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:18,479
From now on, we'll never have anything
to do with each other.

359
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:23,200
It won't happen again.

360
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:26,319
When our company finalizes
the investment plan,

361
00:22:26,399 --> 00:22:27,239
I'll leave.

362
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:29,680
I know you hate me.

363
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:31,599
Don't worry.

364
00:22:32,239 --> 00:22:34,639
I won't show up in front of you anymore.

365
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,759
I hope you can keep your words.

366
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,279
For what happened three years ago,
I owe you an apology.

367
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,800
I'm sorry.

369

I'm taking this.

370
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,012
Even this?

371
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,375
Look at yourself.

372

What's wrong?

377
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:39,159
Did you ask me for money
so that you could gamble?

378
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,131
So many years have passed,

379
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,159
and you haven't changed at all.

380
00:23:45,879 --> 00:23:48,080
It seems like you're in no place
to rebuke me.

381
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:50,559
You've given me the money.

382
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:52,131
It's none of your business
how I spend the money.

383
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:54,800
You are here right in time.
I just lost a game.

384
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:56,639
Give me some more.

385
00:23:58,879 --> 00:23:59,719
Fine.

386
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,600
I can give you the money.

387
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,662
But I need something of similar value
in return.

388
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,120
Tong, why didn't you go to work today?

389
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,239
I have lessons to attend to.

390
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,840
Didn't I tell you to find out...

391
00:24:23,399 --> 00:24:25,348
if your brother goes home
to have dinner with Lu Li?

392
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:28,640
Besides monitoring their married life,

393
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,920
don't I have anything else to do?

394
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,799
Besides spending money
and courting Chen Yiming,

395
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:33,919
what else do you do?

396
00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:34,839
Mom.

397
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:36,399
I don't care.

398
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:38,240
It's Lu Li's birthday in two days.

399
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,759
You need to figure something out
to make them celebrate it at home.

400
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,680
They are busy.

401
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,240
Lu Li has successfully designed
a new game.

402
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,679
It has just passed EG's inspection.

403
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:49,120
What is EG?

404
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,279
What company is it? Is it a big company?

405
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,720
I guess it's pretty good.

406
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,720
Judging from how extravagantly
Li Man dresses now.

407
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,159
Li Man?

408
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,240

tell me everything honestly
and immediately.

412

What's going on?

413
00:25:17,639 --> 00:25:19,520
What happened three years ago
had nothing to do with me.

414
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,200
You got the money. Why are you still here?

415
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,720
-Hello.
-Hello.

416
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,432
Do you have time to spare?
I need your help to investigate a person.

The doctor advised you
to eat something light and healthy.

00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,920
He should be home soon.

Mom, why are you here?

429
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,080
I'm waiting for you.

Need anything? Let's talk upstairs.

It's okay. We'll just talk here.

What's wrong?

433
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,040
Is Li Man back?

434
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,200
Did Jiang Zitong tell you this?

435
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,040
I heard that you quarreled with Li...

436
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,920
because of this woman.

437
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,720
Son, you're such a fool.

438
00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:19,040
Have you forgotten
what she did to you three years ago?

439
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,079
Mom, don't worry.

440
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:24,360
I know what to do.

441
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,840
If you know what to do,
you should stay away from that woman.

442
00:27:27,639 --> 00:27:30,399
Don't let her ruin your relationship
with Li.

443
00:27:30,479 --> 00:27:32,079
-Otherwise...
-What?

444
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,974
Will you do what you did before?

445
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,240
You colluded with Lu Li to get me drunk,

446
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,399
then told dad to threaten me
with the company.

447
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:40,880
Mom, I've already married
under your coercion.

448
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,960
What else do you want?

449
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,399
I was the one who got you drunk.
It had nothing to do with Li.

450
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,519
Son, you can't accuse her.

451
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,279
Anyway, I gave in and got married.

452
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:51,840
But it doesn't mean
that I'll always be under your control.

453
00:27:52,479 --> 00:27:54,519
Fine. You're a grown-up
and no longer under my control.

454
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:59,399
But, son, you have finally moved on
from what happened three years ago.

455
00:27:59,479 --> 00:28:02,919
I don't want to see you
repeating the same mistake,

456
00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:05,479
much less hurting Li's feelings.

457
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,399
Mom, don't worry.

458
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,680
I'll send you home.

459
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,519
There's no need for that.
The driver is waiting for me out there.

460
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,560
There's something else.

461
00:28:15,999 --> 00:28:17,200
The day after tomorrow is Li's...

462
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,440
Li.

463
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,680
Mom.

464
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:25,759
How long have you been here?

465
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:29,920
I've been here for quite some time.

466
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,040
You shouldn't believe Yicheng's words.

467
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,879
He was just arguing with me.

468
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,320
I know.

469
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,239
But what he said is the truth.

470
00:28:45,479 --> 00:28:48,079
-Li...
-Mom, it's late now.

471
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,320
You should go home and rest early.

472
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:51,960
But...

473
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,600
We are fine.
We're doing good. Don't worry.

474
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,520
Just now...

475
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:27,760
I didn't know
that you agreed to the marriage...

476
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,492
because they threatened you
with the company.

477
00:29:30,879 --> 00:29:32,391
What could you have done
even if you knew about it?

478
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:34,240
If I knew you were this reluctant,

479
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,040
I wouldn't have agreed to this.

480
00:29:36,879 --> 00:29:37,760
Sorry.

481
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,680
You...

482
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,319
This has nothing to do with you.

483
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:42,479
You shouldn't be apologizing.

484
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,200
My mom wants me to get married.

485
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,159
Even if it wasn't you,
there would have been someone else too.

486
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:51,999
If you want a divorce now,
I can talk to mom...

487
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,080
I mean aunt.

488
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,079
Our agreement has a one-year term.
It hasn't been a year yet.

489

I saw the ointment you bought me.

494
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:37,759
Thanks.

495
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:39,440
Have you eaten your dinner?

496
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,072
When will you come home?

497
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,720
Mom, what are you doing?
You're frightening me.

498
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:25,120
Mom has a difficult task for you.

499
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,599
No. Sleep now.

500
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,200
One Chanel handbag
from the fall-winter collection.

501
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,119
Deal.

502
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:41,840
One more thing.

503
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,399
Sleep now.

504
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:47,919
Can you make an announcement at home...

505
00:31:47,999 --> 00:31:49,836
and tell everyone Jiang Yicheng
was adopted?

506
00:31:49,916 --> 00:31:51,079
All of you were adopted.

507
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,080
Let's sleep.

508
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:15,079
Who's there?

509
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,520
It's me. Yiming.

510
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:19,239
Coming.

511
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,000
Yiming, it's urgent.

512
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,399
Please help me.

513
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:26,319
What happened?

514
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,680
It smells so good.

515
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,559
Are you making breakfast?

516
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:30,479
Let's talk as we eat.

517
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:41,680
What's wrong with him?

518
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:44,759
He was the one
who asked me out for a movie.

519
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,200
And I've agreed to it.

520
00:32:46,879 --> 00:32:48,119
But he canceled the date.

521
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:51,519
He said that he had something to do
and he would call me again.

522
00:32:52,239 --> 00:32:53,879
I sent him texts too.

523
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,639
But he replied
with very short and insincere answers.

524
00:32:57,359 --> 00:32:59,519
Sometimes, he even dismissed me
with some stickers.

525
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,319
That's really strange.

526
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,999
He was very friendly
the last time we went out for a meal.

527
00:33:06,239 --> 00:33:07,960
Why are all the programmers
so eccentric?

528
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,680
Li.

529
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:15,119
Li.

530
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:17,080
Are you listening to me?

531
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,720
What did you say?

532
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:20,600
I was talking about Huang Renxun.

533
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,680
What's wrong with Da Huang?

534
00:33:24,479 --> 00:33:25,319
Never mind.

535
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,279
What's wrong with you?

536
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,639
You seem distracted.

537
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:30,159
Did something happen?

538
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,480
Where did she go early in the morning?

539
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,479
I can't find her.

540
00:34:00,879 --> 00:34:02,239
Yiming, what's the matter?

541
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:08,400
So Li Man is his ex-girlfriend.

542
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,880
And she most probably ditched him
back then.

543
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:16,120
Although I have no idea
what happened between them,

544
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,159
I know that he hasn't gotten over Li Man.

545
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,800
He is cheating on you.

546
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,360
It was yesterday when I found out...

547
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,959
that he agreed to marry me...

548
00:34:30,759 --> 00:34:32,679
because his parents' disinvestment
coerced him.

549
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,680
Xiaoqi.

550
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,040
Do you think I've made the wrong decision?

551
00:34:42,279 --> 00:34:43,800
You shouldn't be thinking like that.

552
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,040
He was coerced by his parents.
It has nothing to do with you.

553
00:34:48,479 --> 00:34:49,600
That was what he said too.

554
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,880
At least he's a conscientious man.

555
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,439
Let's put this aside.

556
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,640
If I knew
that his ex-girlfriend would be back,

557
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,759
and he still had feelings for her,
I would never have agreed to marry him.

558
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,719
For him, it's nothing...

559
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,719
but a shackle of wedlock.

560
00:35:07,999 --> 00:35:10,159
Their breakup has nothing to do with you.

561
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:11,720
You don't have to feel bothered by that.

562
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,919
Moreover,
you are now married to Jiang Yicheng.

563
00:35:14,999 --> 00:35:16,480
If Li Man intends to do anything,

564
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,070
it will only make her the third party
in this relationship.

565
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:22,960
But...

566
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,800
But our marriage is bounded
by an agreement.

567
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,959
So what?

568
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,239
You're protected by the law.

569
00:35:30,439 --> 00:35:32,639
Li, what's wrong with you?

570
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:35,679
You look miserable the whole day,
and are not acting like yourself.

571
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,919
I thought, as long as we get
to spend some time together,

572
00:35:41,999 --> 00:35:43,560
he will surely develop feelings for me.

573
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,279
I didn't know
it was just my wishful thinking.

574
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:50,519
He's just fulfilling the agreement.

575
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,999
Trying to win a person's heart
resembles a marathon.

576
00:35:56,439 --> 00:35:58,280
Even if you can't see
the faraway finishing line,

577
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,520
you shouldn't panic,

578
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,599
let alone give up.

579
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:04,400
Because if you want to win the marathon,
you have to finish the course first.

580
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,119
Every time you make a turn,

581
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:09,160
there may be a chance of winning.

582
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:14,360
When have you become so philosophical?

583
00:36:14,999 --> 00:36:16,119
You caught me.

584
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:18,080
I watched many romantic movies recently.

585
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,402
I was really moved by them.

586
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:23,719
Didn't you tell me
not to take the initiative?

587
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,120
I studied dialectics before.

588
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,919
We should look at it
from a developmental perspective.

589
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:29,519
Let me give you an example.

590
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,040
Jiang Yicheng is an encrypted computer.

591
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,599
Li Man has missed the chance
to key in the passcode.

592
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:37,560
Now, you have that opportunity.

593
00:36:37,999 --> 00:36:39,160
Isn't that what you're best at?

594
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,880
But you don't need a passcode
to unlock an encrypted computer.

595
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,919
You only need to key in some codes.

596
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:48,599
It doesn't matter how you do it.

597
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:50,119
It has developed into what it is today.

598
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:51,365
You have to do it
even if you need to break it open.

599
00:36:51,449 --> 00:36:52,289
Do you get me?

600
00:36:59,439 --> 00:37:02,800
You certainly are Gu Mo's sister.

601
00:37:03,279 --> 00:37:04,119
What do you mean?

602
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,239
Both of you use a weirdly effective way
to encourage others.

603
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:09,160
I'm nothing like him.

604
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,959
He is a cunning,
wicked and two-faced man.

605
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,960
He only knows how to play dirty.

606
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,479
And I'm giving you my advice openly
and honestly.

607
00:37:18,759 --> 00:37:19,679
Fine.

608
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,039
You're the most upright.
All right.

609
00:37:22,759 --> 00:37:24,839
I am not a genius in love,

610
00:37:24,919 --> 00:37:27,120
but I can still be your amateur coach.

611
00:37:32,919 --> 00:37:33,679
Jiang Zitong.

612
00:37:33,759 --> 00:37:34,599
Answer it.

613
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,519
I'm at my best friend's place.

614
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:44,920
Now?

615
00:37:45,999 --> 00:37:47,080
I'm busy at the moment.

616
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,395
She hung up.

617
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:52,439
What did she say?

618
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:54,320
She said she wanted to bring me somewhere.

619
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,395
Go with her.

620
00:37:55,479 --> 00:37:56,480
What about you?

621
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,480
We're just going shopping.
We can do it any other day.

622
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,435
You know what?

623
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:01,639
You have to build a good rapport
with your sister-in-law.

624
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:03,000
Convince her to side with you.

625
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,439
Then, you will gain one more supporter.

626
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,639
-Thanks, Xiaoqi.
-There's no need for thanks.

627
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,279
A best friend
is the most important thing on earth.

628
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,320
You have to repay my kindness
in the future.

629
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,560
All right. Hurry up and return her call.
Tell her to come over.

630
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,940
(Jiang Zitong)

631
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,440
Get in the car.

632
00:38:26,999 --> 00:38:29,799
-I made you a glass of fruit juice.
-Thanks, Sister-in-law.

633
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,960
-Where are we going?
-Don't worry.

634
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,880
You can take a nap.
I'll wake you up when we arrive.

635
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,560
You drove for three hours
just to bring me here?

636
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,000
This place...

637
00:39:10,759 --> 00:39:12,498
looks like where couples usually hang out.

638
00:39:12,582 --> 00:39:13,582
Are you secretly in love with me?

639
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,040
Cut the nonsense. I'll park the car.

640
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,119
Wait for me here.

641
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:22,039
Hurry up.

642
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:33,071
Go straight. All right.

643
00:39:33,151 --> 00:39:34,639
(Lovers)

644
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:35,840
To the right.

645
00:39:36,279 --> 00:39:37,239
Okay.

646
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:39,519
Congratulations!

647
00:39:40,439 --> 00:39:42,280
-All right.
-Excuse me.

648
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,239
What are they doing?

649
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,800
Can you see the two rocks?

650
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,159
They call these the Lover's Rocks.

651
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:47,439
Starting from one of these rocks,

652
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:49,268
if you can reach
the second rock blindfolded,

653
00:39:49,352 --> 00:39:50,312
you will receive the deity's blessings.

654
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,276
Really?

655
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,600
It's up to you to believe it or not.

656
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,759
Sister-in-law,
you should queue up for it too.

657
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,720
The queue is too long.

658
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,716
Forget it.

659
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,875
It's free. Just give it a try.

660
00:40:04,959 --> 00:40:06,080
What if it really works?

661
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:08,640
Also, I'm going to buy some drinks.
Join the queue.

662
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:11,400
-I'll wait for you here.
-Sure.

663
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:15,719
If you fail, you can always try again.
There's still one more chance.

664
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:24,100
(Lu Li, There's No Update At The Moment)

665
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,320
Where did she go?

666
00:40:26,759 --> 00:40:27,959
She didn't even update her Moments.

667
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,220
(A new message from Chen Yiming)

668
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,980
(Location, Xinhai Ancient Town)

669
00:40:34,439 --> 00:40:35,279
He went in.

670
00:40:37,959 --> 00:40:39,519
Is he really going to confess to me?

671
00:40:44,479 --> 00:40:45,319
Is it going to work?

672
00:40:45,959 --> 00:40:46,880
Hopefully.

673
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:48,720
Lord, please hear my prayers.

674
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,655
I need them together
before I can get my luxurious handbag.

675
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,879
Yiming, Lu Li is my sister-in-law.

676
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:01,199
You can't have any feelings for her.

677
00:41:02,439 --> 00:41:03,360
What are you saying?

678
00:41:03,999 --> 00:41:05,320
Both her and Yicheng
are my good friends.

679
00:41:05,759 --> 00:41:07,439
I wish them happiness.

680
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,760
(Lovers)

681
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,900
(Jiang Yicheng)

682
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,200
He's here.

683
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:33,519
Let's go.

684
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,000
Move.

685
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:07,619
-What's going on?
-Are you even allowed to do this?

686
00:42:07,703 --> 00:42:09,143
Is this fate?

687
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:10,519
This must be fate.

688
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:13,719
Well...

689
00:42:15,919 --> 00:42:17,119
That's great.

690
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:18,759
Fate has brought you two together.

691
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:51,839
Congratulations!

692
00:42:51,919 --> 00:42:53,399
Nice.

693
00:42:53,479 --> 00:42:55,119
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

694
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,199
-They are embarrassed.
-Yeah.

695
00:42:58,279 --> 00:43:01,199
It seems like the Lover's Rocks
are working.

696
00:43:01,279 --> 00:43:03,360
Do you want to add each other on WeChat?

697
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:05,040
Do it.

698
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:05,960
It must be fate.

699
00:43:06,439 --> 00:43:07,400
We know each other.

700
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,200
Do you?

701
00:43:09,919 --> 00:43:11,439
It must be fate.

702
00:43:11,919 --> 00:43:13,240
You have to cherish the person before you.

703
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:16,839
Allow me to remind you
that we provide a Love Talisman too.

704
00:43:16,919 --> 00:43:18,239
Do you want one?

705
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,360
It's okay.

706
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,960
Let's go.

707
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,320
Let's go.

708
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,159
All right. Let's give applaud for them
as we send them off.

709
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:28,160
Thanks.

710
00:43:34,959 --> 00:43:36,720
Mission accomplished. Let's go back.

711
00:43:37,279 --> 00:43:38,435
Where to go?

712
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:40,719
From this moment, we are on a date.

713
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,000
Let's go.

714
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:48,100
(Lover's Stone)

715
00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:50,840
Love is like the relationship
between a programmer and the codes.

716
00:43:51,279 --> 00:43:52,879
When the codes are acting up,

717
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:55,080
they need instant maintenance,
optimization, and upgrades.

718
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:59,279
Only when two people work together
can the relationship last longer.
