You...

22

It's really late.

23
00:01:51,457 --> 00:01:53,273
Are you sure you don't want to head back?

24
00:01:54,055 --> 00:01:54,963
You...

25
00:01:55,043 --> 00:01:56,406
If you're tired, you can sleep first.

26
00:01:56,486 --> 00:01:57,718
Just ignore me.

27
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,106
Do you really want to stay here?

28
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,678
I need to talk to my brother.

29
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,289
Speaking of which, it's getting late.

30
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:11,370
Aren't you going to call him
and ask him to return?

31
00:02:12,378 --> 00:02:15,652
We promised not to
meddle with each other's affairs.

32
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,238
So do you truly trust him?

33
00:02:22,845 --> 00:02:24,680
Or, do you not care about him at all?

34
00:02:25,702 --> 00:02:27,008
I wish to trust him.

35
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:31,179
Fine. You can resume your game.

36
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:32,363
Let me clean up the room.

37
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,498
All right.

38
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:18,740
(Day Ward)

39
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,761
The patient's result is out.

40
00:03:25,141 --> 00:03:28,356
Around the corner of the gastric
antrum, there's a 2.5X2.0cm tumour.

41
00:03:28,698 --> 00:03:29,979
That's the result of the biopsy.

42
00:03:34,676 --> 00:03:36,066
You don't need to be too anxious.

43
00:03:36,146 --> 00:03:37,746
Currently, she has
mid-stage gastric cancer.

44
00:03:37,826 --> 00:03:40,699
She can become a healthy person again
if she seeks treatment early.

45
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,459
There are no obvious symptoms for
most patients during the early stage.

46
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:46,130
A few of them
will feel nauseous and throw up often.

47
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,406
But most of them think it's nothing.

48
00:03:48,486 --> 00:03:50,253
That's why most patients have
mid to late-stage cancer...

49
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,976
when they go for their check-ups.

50
00:03:52,603 --> 00:03:54,246
I suggest she to go for radical surgery.

51
00:03:54,326 --> 00:03:55,894
That is to remove
the tumour in her stomach...

52
00:03:55,974 --> 00:04:00,308
together with the surrounding nymph lodes
to cure the root of her problem.

53
00:04:00,388 --> 00:04:02,501
So she will recover fully
after the surgery, right?

54
00:04:02,581 --> 00:04:03,811
Will she suffer a relapse?

55
00:04:03,891 --> 00:04:05,247
No one can say for sure.

56
00:04:05,784 --> 00:04:08,576
It all depends on the chemotherapy
and radiotherapy after the surgery.

57
00:04:08,656 --> 00:04:10,296
It depends on the patient's body as well.

58
00:04:10,606 --> 00:04:12,134
Does she still need
to go for chemotherapy?

59
00:04:12,214 --> 00:04:13,270
That's right.

60
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,879
Usually, a cancer patient needs
to go through half a year of chemotherapy.

61
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,229
Both patient and her family
need to be prepared for this.

62
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:23,122
For the types of chemotherapeutic drugs,
it depends on the patient's condition.

63
00:04:23,202 --> 00:04:26,278
There are different costs
for different stages of the treatment.

64
00:04:26,358 --> 00:04:30,513
It costs at least 200,000 yuan,
including the surgery cost.

65
00:05:02,245 --> 00:05:04,323
Wan, you see,

66
00:05:04,403 --> 00:05:06,040
I need to ask you something.

67
00:05:06,444 --> 00:05:08,077
Do you have extra money on your hands?

68
00:05:08,157 --> 00:05:09,192
I think...

69
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:13,238
You bought stocks with it.

70
00:05:13,318 --> 00:05:14,524
It's fine.

71
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:16,291
Goodbye.

72
00:05:28,123 --> 00:05:30,891
Yu, it's me.

73
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,503
I need to ask you something.

74
00:05:45,156 --> 00:05:46,977
So you actually know your way home.

75
00:05:47,462 --> 00:05:48,747
Why are you here?

76
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,445
Your wife is sleeping.

77
00:06:03,732 --> 00:06:04,859
Why are you here?

78
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:08,078
I'm here to interrogate you.

79
00:06:08,573 --> 00:06:10,381
Interrogate me? What are you saying?

80
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:17,703
Were you together with Li Man today?

81
00:06:18,455 --> 00:06:19,635
How did you know?

82
00:06:21,762 --> 00:06:23,884
Lu Li and I went to the shopping mall
together today.

83
00:06:25,855 --> 00:06:27,939
-So did Lu Li...
-She didn't see you.

84
00:06:30,797 --> 00:06:33,404
What's wrong with you and Li Man?

85
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:36,630
Aren't you afraid she'll mess things up
for your company again?

86
00:06:37,121 --> 00:06:39,217
It wasn't her fault last time.

87
00:06:39,573 --> 00:06:40,680
Was it not her?

88
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,002
Whose fault was it then?

89
00:06:45,292 --> 00:06:46,508
It was her father's fault.

90
00:06:47,051 --> 00:06:50,016
Back then, to stop her father
from selling our codes,

91
00:06:50,096 --> 00:06:51,748
Li Man was detained for 15 days.

92
00:06:52,156 --> 00:06:53,427
When she came out of prison,

93
00:06:53,794 --> 00:06:55,539
everything was too late.

94
00:06:55,619 --> 00:06:58,339
She felt guilty for letting me down.
That's why she left the country.

95
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,467
So does that mean she didn't betray you?

96
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:07,099
I've misunderstood her all these years.

97
00:07:12,596 --> 00:07:15,982
So now, you have a new wife
and an old flame.

98
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:17,132
What do you plan to do?

99
00:07:17,577 --> 00:07:18,924
Don't create trouble for me.

100
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:20,318
You better keep your mouth shut.

101
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,255
Don't you plan to tell Lu Li about this?

102
00:07:22,857 --> 00:07:25,017
Don't tell me you want to cheat on her
behind her back?

103
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:28,006
You should return.
You knew I wouldn't do this.

104
00:07:28,086 --> 00:07:30,394
Brother, it's quite late now.

105
00:07:30,474 --> 00:07:33,053
Just let me stay in your guest room
for one night, all right?

106
00:07:34,493 --> 00:07:35,853
There's no guest room in my house.

107
00:07:36,196 --> 00:07:39,071
Are you even humane?
You would've been dead without me.

108
00:07:39,444 --> 00:07:40,561
Fine.

109
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,937
Tell me when you reach home then.

110
00:07:45,941 --> 00:07:47,599
Let me warn you.

111
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:49,911
If you dare to cheat on her,
Dad will break your legs.

112
00:07:49,991 --> 00:07:51,045
Go now.

113
00:07:51,837 --> 00:07:52,859
Goodbye.

As my friend, can you restore my post...

141
00:09:54,222 --> 00:09:56,316
as the company's
investment representative?

142
00:10:03,901 --> 00:10:06,431
Come to the company and sign
your contract tomorrow afternoon.

143
00:10:21,807 --> 00:10:23,011
Morning.

144
00:10:24,331 --> 00:10:26,915
You didn't sleep well last night.
Look at your dark circles.

145
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,610
Did you carry me to my room last night?

146
00:10:37,424 --> 00:10:40,879
You don't need to be too touched.
I was just doing a kind deed.

147
00:10:41,924 --> 00:10:43,324
Thanks.

148
00:10:43,404 --> 00:10:44,809
But you broke the rule.

149
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:46,515
The bedroom is my territory.

150
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:51,771
So it seems like the kind-hearted farmer
has been bitten by the heartless snake.

151
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,932
Since when did you stop being a koala?

152
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,719
These are two different matters.

153
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:57,548
You should be punished
for breaking the rules.

154
00:10:57,628 --> 00:11:00,439
If not, our contract would be invalid.

155
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:01,676
Fine.

156
00:11:01,756 --> 00:11:03,470
But last night,
you entered my room as well.

157
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,838
It's fine that you made a mess out of it.
But I didn't tell you to clean it up.

158
00:11:05,918 --> 00:11:07,028
I was just trying to protect our secret.

159
00:11:07,108 --> 00:11:08,647
I was fulfilling my duty
as stated within the contract.

160
00:11:08,727 --> 00:11:10,215
Do you have any other questions?

161
00:11:11,098 --> 00:11:12,725
So did you not sleep last night...

162
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:15,445
because you were trying to come up
with the best punishment for me?

163
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,820
Fine.

164
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,220
You win this time.

165
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,193
How would you like to punish me?

166
00:11:27,293 --> 00:11:28,885
Treat me to dinner tonight.

167
00:11:28,965 --> 00:11:32,150
Bring me to the Michelin-starred
restaurant we went to last time.

168
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,699
-That's it?
-That's it.

169
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:36,711
Next time,
you don't need to resort to this...

170
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,309
if you feel like eating something.

171
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:39,787
I'm not that petty.

172
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,605
You first.

173
00:11:45,046 --> 00:11:46,143
You first.

174
00:11:46,966 --> 00:11:48,170
I'll go ahead then.

175
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,234
(Orange of successful coding)

176
00:12:06,462 --> 00:12:07,510
Brother Lei,

177
00:12:08,349 --> 00:12:09,548
here you go.

178
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:10,651
Thanks.

179
00:12:11,491 --> 00:12:13,667
Is your anxiety getting better?

180
00:12:13,747 --> 00:12:15,805
I feel much better
after taking medication.

181
00:12:16,971 --> 00:12:19,207
Have you visited the psychiatrist again?

182
00:12:19,287 --> 00:12:21,578
I plan to visit him once per month.

183
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,693
If not, I'll get more anxious as
I need to pay around 400 yuan per visit.

184
00:12:27,145 --> 00:12:28,945
There are new mascots for us
to eat again.

185
00:12:29,489 --> 00:12:31,842
How dare you try to peel our mascot?

186
00:12:31,922 --> 00:12:33,222
Aren't you afraid it might
devour you instead?

187
00:12:33,302 --> 00:12:35,133
I guess you read too many fantasy novels.

188
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:38,114
So did Mr. Jiang tell you
where he went last night?

189
00:12:38,609 --> 00:12:40,994
I slept early last night.
I didn't ask him about it.

190
00:12:41,074 --> 00:12:42,931
You can't just keep quiet about this.

191
00:12:43,011 --> 00:12:45,256
-You see, when it comes to this...
-Enough. I know what I'm doing.

192
00:12:45,336 --> 00:12:46,498
Are you sure?

193
00:12:46,578 --> 00:12:47,727
Let's go.

194
00:12:48,691 --> 00:12:50,549
Old Ape, this is for you.

195
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:51,917
Thanks.

196
00:12:51,997 --> 00:12:53,300
Is your family doing okay?

197
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,856
Yeah, they're fine.

198
00:12:54,936 --> 00:12:56,115
That's great to hear.

199
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:17,893
Brother, I've invested all of my money
into Bitcoin.

200
00:13:18,404 --> 00:13:19,846
Now, I'm earning quite a lot.

201
00:13:19,926 --> 00:13:22,717
I don't think it's suitable for me
to sell them right now.

202
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:29,213
Bitcoin?

203
00:13:39,628 --> 00:13:40,642
Lu Li.

204
00:13:41,368 --> 00:13:42,361
Mr. Gu.

205
00:13:42,441 --> 00:13:43,525
Did you bring your phone?

206
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,553
Follow me.

207
00:14:00,813 --> 00:14:02,296
Miss Lu Li,

208
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,345
you just interrupted my encounter
with the handsome in my dream.

209
00:14:05,425 --> 00:14:07,009
Xiaoqi, it's me.

210
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:08,492
We need to talk.

211
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:11,526
Xiaoqi.

212
00:14:17,634 --> 00:14:18,610
Thanks.

213
00:14:20,298 --> 00:14:21,412
Did you two argue?

214
00:14:23,378 --> 00:14:25,534
She blocked all of my contacts.

215
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:29,838
It seems like you really made her angry.

216
00:14:29,918 --> 00:14:31,394
It's been three years...

217
00:14:31,474 --> 00:14:33,682
since she last contacted
the person she blocked.

218
00:14:33,762 --> 00:14:35,526
I just did what I needed to do.

219
00:14:35,606 --> 00:14:38,116
The people she fancied
were not good enough for her.

220
00:14:39,403 --> 00:14:41,898
So not only did you reject Da Huang
on her behalf,

221
00:14:41,978 --> 00:14:43,317
you rejected others as well.

222
00:14:44,028 --> 00:14:45,744
I was just keeping an eye out for her.

223
00:14:46,141 --> 00:14:49,000
I might understand your behaviour
if you were her biological brother.

224
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,475
But don't you think
you're meddling too much?

225
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,619
I watched Xiaoqi grew up since young.

226
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:55,225
I understand her better than her parents.

227
00:14:55,305 --> 00:14:58,479
That's why I know what kind of people
suits her best.

228
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,765
Tell me then.
What kind of people suits her best?

229
00:15:02,845 --> 00:15:04,397
First, he needs to
understand her personality.

230
00:15:04,477 --> 00:15:05,859
He must be able to tolerate
Xiaoqi's petty temper.

231
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:07,902
He must know how to take care of her.
She's beautiful.

232
00:15:07,982 --> 00:15:09,243
The guy must not be too hideous.

233
00:15:09,323 --> 00:15:11,003
He must be financially independent
as well.

234
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,803
Were you referring to yourself?

235
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:19,418
Her boyfriend
at least needs to be as good as me.

236
00:15:21,374 --> 00:15:26,323
It's no wonder someone said
we mustn't show mercy to our rivals.

237
00:15:27,456 --> 00:15:28,747
So do you like Xiaoqi?

238
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,768
Yes.

239
00:15:32,175 --> 00:15:33,351
I do like her.

240
00:15:34,306 --> 00:15:36,027
But she only treats me
as her elder brother.

241
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:39,120
Xiaoqi hates it when people
interfere with her life.

242
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,406
By doing this,
you'll only push her away from you.

243
00:15:45,777 --> 00:15:47,799
You can ponder about that.
I'll leave first.

244
00:16:06,076 --> 00:16:07,182
Mr. Jiang.

245
00:16:07,908 --> 00:16:09,333
Why are you out here alone?

246
00:16:09,413 --> 00:16:10,500
Where's Robot Gu?

247
00:16:11,501 --> 00:16:14,273
Mr. Gu needs to calm himself down.

248
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,813
What did you tell him?

249
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:18,334
How were you able to make him
experience a change in emotions?

250
00:16:18,607 --> 00:16:19,967
It was regarding his relationship.

251
00:16:20,632 --> 00:16:21,844
Tell me then.

252
00:16:21,924 --> 00:16:23,043
What did you tell him?

253
00:16:23,123 --> 00:16:26,204
This concerns his personal relationship.
It's not suitable for me to tell you.

254
00:16:26,424 --> 00:16:28,325
Say, is everyone from the Programming
Department as free as you?

255
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:30,062
You actually have time to be concerned
about the Arts Department's affair.

256
00:16:30,142 --> 00:16:31,919
I'm not free at all. I'm pretty busy.

257
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,215
I'll resume my work now.

258
00:16:35,565 --> 00:16:36,729
Here's a mascot for you.

259
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:38,583
Everyone in the office has one.

260
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,980
(Orange of successful coding)

261
00:16:52,995 --> 00:16:55,793
Miss Yezi,
you're wearing a formal dress today.

262
00:16:55,873 --> 00:16:57,673
Is Mr. Jiang expecting
an important client?

263
00:16:57,753 --> 00:16:59,498
The representative from EG is
going to sign a contract with us today.

264
00:16:59,578 --> 00:17:02,448
Lady boss, your net worth
is going to increase again.

265
00:17:02,528 --> 00:17:03,749
Stop joking around.

266
00:17:04,745 --> 00:17:05,849
Lu Li.

267
00:17:11,048 --> 00:17:12,200
We meet again.

268
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:14,803
Hello, Miss Li.

269
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,520
You don't need
to be that courteous with me.

270
00:17:17,952 --> 00:17:19,883
Didn't Yicheng tell you that
I was coming today?

271
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,055
We don't talk about work
when we're together.

272
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,965
Miss Yezi, give Miss Li a warm welcome.

273
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,200
Miss Li, Mr. Jiang is
waiting for you at his office.

274
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,004
-Please.
-All right. Thank you.

275
00:17:39,969 --> 00:17:41,137
This isn't right.

276
00:17:41,673 --> 00:17:42,811
This.

277
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:45,209
This is impossible.

278
00:17:45,552 --> 00:17:46,862
Create another one.

279
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:49,634
Check it again. This.

280
00:17:49,714 --> 00:17:51,166
Examine this.

281
00:17:52,513 --> 00:17:54,508
Listen, Miss Investor is here.

282
00:17:54,588 --> 00:17:56,407
Miss Investor from EG is here.

283
00:17:56,818 --> 00:17:57,953
Something's wrong.

284
00:17:58,033 --> 00:17:59,949
I thought Mr. Liu
was their representative?

285
00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:01,512
Isn't this strange?

286
00:18:01,592 --> 00:18:04,669
Last time, Mr. Jiang almost
chased her out of the office.

287
00:18:04,749 --> 00:18:06,241
Now, they're having
a pleasant conversation.

288
00:18:06,321 --> 00:18:08,508
He even brought her into his office.

289
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,060
Did EG increase its investment?

290
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,290
Is that why Mr. Jiang
has to bow down to her?

291
00:18:15,793 --> 00:18:18,593
Lu Li, do you know what's going on?

292
00:18:20,048 --> 00:18:23,587
Miss Li and Mr. Jiang
had a misunderstanding before this.

293
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,237
Misunderstanding?
How deep must the misunderstanding be...

294
00:18:26,317 --> 00:18:28,968
for him not to hire
any female programmers after that?

295
00:18:30,656 --> 00:18:31,741
Just keep quiet.

296
00:18:31,821 --> 00:18:35,489
You see, no matter what,
we still have Lu in our team, right?

297
00:18:35,569 --> 00:18:36,640
Yeah.

298
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,876
Lu is the only female programmer
in the company.

299
00:18:38,956 --> 00:18:40,770
No one will be able to take her spot.

300
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:41,914
Yeah.

301
00:18:57,967 --> 00:19:01,003
So I guess we're business partners
from today onwards.

302
00:19:01,364 --> 00:19:03,037
May we have a pleasant cooperation.

303
00:19:03,117 --> 00:19:04,947
We still have work to do.
So we won't see you guys off.

304
00:19:05,027 --> 00:19:06,161
All right.

305
00:19:07,765 --> 00:19:09,138
Senior Yiming,

306
00:19:09,218 --> 00:19:11,445
you didn't speak to me
for the entire day.

307
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,125
Do you still blame me for that incident?

308
00:19:13,576 --> 00:19:14,697
You're over-thinking it.

309
00:19:14,777 --> 00:19:16,326
Yicheng told me everything.

310
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:18,792
Since he doesn't blame you for it,
I don't have the right to do it.

311
00:19:18,872 --> 00:19:20,048
That's great to hear.

312
00:19:20,913 --> 00:19:22,560
You guys can resume your work.

313
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,011
Let's catch up with each other
when we're free.

314
00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:26,818
I'll see you off.

315
00:19:32,534 --> 00:19:34,401
-See you next time then.
-Goodbye.

316
00:19:35,638 --> 00:19:36,668
Have a seat.

317
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:43,205
So does that mean you've restored
your relationship with her?

318
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:45,004
Since the misunderstanding
has been resolved,

319
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:47,367
we should be impartial
and treat her as our business partner.

320
00:19:47,447 --> 00:19:48,994
Since she has joined our project,

321
00:19:49,074 --> 00:19:50,596
that means she'll be a permanent
employee of the company.

322
00:19:50,676 --> 00:19:52,879
Can you really treat her
as only your business partner?

323
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,867
Are you sure you don't have
any extra feelings for her?

324
00:19:54,947 --> 00:19:56,072
I do.

325
00:19:56,526 --> 00:19:57,852
Her father was the one
who committed the mistake,

326
00:19:57,932 --> 00:20:00,454
but she had to leave the country
and bear the blame on his behalf.

327
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:03,210
If I could find out
the truth three years ago,

328
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,127
maybe the incident
could've ended in a better way.

329
00:20:05,207 --> 00:20:08,100
Regarding that,
I do feel guilty towards her.

330
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,844
Don't tell me you're going
to compensate her by being her boyfriend?

331
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:14,264
I don't have that kind of habit.

332
00:20:14,344 --> 00:20:16,984
Moreover, it's been three years.
Our relationship has deteriorated.

333
00:20:17,305 --> 00:20:19,136
So aren't you worried that
she might take your guilt...

334
00:20:19,216 --> 00:20:21,168
as a sign of love?

335
00:20:21,248 --> 00:20:23,088
What if she still expects you
to return to her?

336
00:20:24,076 --> 00:20:25,962
I can be friends with her.

337
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:28,649
If she wants anything more than that,
I won't be able to oblige.

338
00:20:30,005 --> 00:20:31,518
Well, as long as you can figure it out.

339
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:32,880
But let me remind you.

340
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,148
People will surely gossip about both
of you since she was your ex-girlfriend.

341
00:20:36,228 --> 00:20:39,295
You better explain things to Lu Li
so that there's no misunderstanding.

342
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:44,373
Don't you think
you're being too concerned about Lu Li?

343
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:48,829
I'm concerned about both of you.

344
00:20:54,184 --> 00:20:55,282
I'll leave first.

345
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:03,780
(Cooperation Agreement)

346
00:21:04,503 --> 00:21:05,536
Miss Man,

347
00:21:05,616 --> 00:21:07,779
it seems like your relationship with
Mr. Jiang is progressing well.

348
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:09,729
Mind your behaviour.
We're still in his company.

349
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:11,304
I'm just happy for you.

350
00:21:11,384 --> 00:21:12,590
Miss Li.

351
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,656
Can I treat you to a cup of coffee?

352
00:21:16,351 --> 00:21:17,467
Sure.

353
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,993
(The Scientist Coffee)

354
00:21:27,073 --> 00:21:29,693
This coffee tastes ordinary.

355
00:21:30,311 --> 00:21:33,765
You may not know, but Yicheng and I
have similar tastes.

356
00:21:33,845 --> 00:21:35,405
We like coffee that is slightly acidic.

357
00:21:35,724 --> 00:21:38,353
Back then, to suit his taste,

358
00:21:38,433 --> 00:21:40,945
I went to learn how to make coffee
from a coffee expert.

359
00:21:41,025 --> 00:21:44,195
I trained for an entire month
before he was happy with the taste.

360
00:21:45,941 --> 00:21:48,876
Miss Li,
you don't need to beat around the bush.

361
00:21:48,956 --> 00:21:50,804
I know your relationship with him.

362
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:55,150
Miss Li, you're pretty direct.

363
00:21:56,528 --> 00:21:57,593
I'm not Miss Lu.

364
00:21:57,673 --> 00:21:58,852
I'm Mrs. Jiang.

365
00:22:07,255 --> 00:22:09,253
Do you feel proud by showing off...

366
00:22:09,881 --> 00:22:11,841
a title you got
by exchanging conditions with him?

367
00:22:16,951 --> 00:22:18,406
I'm not showing off.

368
00:22:18,486 --> 00:22:19,970
I'm just stating the fact.

369
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:26,060
Do you think Yicheng loves you...

370
00:22:26,684 --> 00:22:28,408
just because he agreed to marry you?

371
00:22:28,968 --> 00:22:30,486
Do you think you'll be here...

372
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,038
if I were able to return earlier?

373
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,502
Miss Li,

374
00:22:36,937 --> 00:22:39,214
don't you think you're being
a little narcissistic here?

375
00:22:39,703 --> 00:22:41,297
Since you know Yicheng that well,

376
00:22:41,377 --> 00:22:43,974
you should know
that even if I weren't here,

377
00:22:44,588 --> 00:22:46,189
it wouldn't be your turn to be his wife.

378
00:22:49,633 --> 00:22:51,329
You're naive indeed.

379
00:22:52,292 --> 00:22:55,962
Why do you think Yicheng said yes
to working together with EG again?

380
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:58,717
Why do you think I'm the one
who's here to sign the contract?

381
00:22:58,797 --> 00:23:01,249
It's because I have the capability
to give him what he wants.

382
00:23:01,329 --> 00:23:03,823
The person he needs right now is me.

383
00:23:10,439 --> 00:23:12,170
I admit, you're a talented lady.

384
00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:14,492
But we're legally married.

385
00:23:14,572 --> 00:23:15,773
Miss Li,

386
00:23:16,339 --> 00:23:19,125
I suppose you won't be
our third wheel, right?

387
00:23:20,296 --> 00:23:24,188
But when it comes to our relationship,
you're the third wheel here.

388
00:23:24,661 --> 00:23:27,825
I didn't even know about your existence
when I first got together with him.

389
00:23:27,905 --> 00:23:29,765
And you two have been
separated for three years.

390
00:23:29,845 --> 00:23:32,200
It's all in the past.
Just let bygones be bygones, all right?

391
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,217
Miss Li, you should look ahead.

392
00:23:35,297 --> 00:23:37,216
I'll tell you the same thing as well.

393
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:41,929
You know that Yicheng married you
because he had no choice, right?

394
00:23:42,494 --> 00:23:43,962
Now that I've returned,

395
00:23:44,498 --> 00:23:46,497
I believe that
he'll make the right choice.

396
00:23:48,483 --> 00:23:52,530
Miss Li, it seems like
you insist on ruining our marriage.

397
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:54,828
I need to give you a reminder.

398
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,665
You shouldn't be too much.

399
00:23:57,289 --> 00:24:00,176
If not, I will use legal procedures
to protect my marriage.

400
00:24:01,164 --> 00:24:02,800
I've paid for the coffee.

401
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,764
If you think it's not to your taste,
you can choose not to drink it.

402
00:24:06,707 --> 00:24:10,454
Yesterday, he left the meeting
suddenly, right?

403
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:12,079
And he went back home late.

404
00:24:12,691 --> 00:24:15,395
Don't you wish to know where he went?

405
00:24:22,296 --> 00:24:24,015
Seems like you knew what happened.

406
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:26,635
So do you believe...

407
00:24:27,449 --> 00:24:29,376
that if I call him right now,

408
00:24:29,989 --> 00:24:33,325
he'll come to me immediately,
just like what happened yesterday?

409
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:35,878
He promised to have dinner with me.

410
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:38,154
Miss Li, he won't go and find you.

411
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,246
Fine. Let's see...

412
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,538
who's more important in his heart then.

413
00:25:03,526 --> 00:25:08,096
Yicheng,
tonight, my father asked me to meet him.

414
00:25:09,273 --> 00:25:10,990
Can you accompany me?

415
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,081
All right.

416
00:25:17,044 --> 00:25:18,925
I'll send you the address right now.

417
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,740
(A new message from WeChat)

418
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:37,250
You should understand by now.

419
00:25:37,721 --> 00:25:39,680
It's impossible for you
to use your marriage as an excuse...

420
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,569
to keep Yicheng by your side.

421
00:25:41,649 --> 00:25:45,001
It's because you have no way
to replace my spot in his heart.

422
00:25:46,654 --> 00:25:48,110
If you surrender now,

423
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:50,110
you might not suffer
such a terrible defeat.

424
00:25:50,861 --> 00:25:52,254
Thanks for your coffee.

425
00:25:52,334 --> 00:25:54,625
You should stop drinking it
if it tastes bad.

426
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:23,533
I have an emergency to attend to.

427
00:26:23,613 --> 00:26:25,067
Let's postpone our dinner.

428
00:26:50,778 --> 00:26:52,061
We need to talk.

429
00:26:52,141 --> 00:26:53,953
I don't know who you are.
You better get out.

430
00:26:57,081 --> 00:26:58,586
I'll call the cops
if you stay here any longer.

431
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:00,637
Listen, you're trespassing.

432
00:27:02,137 --> 00:27:03,646
Are you eating junk food again?

433
00:27:03,726 --> 00:27:06,407
Didn't I tell you that they're not
nutritious and unhealthy for you?

434
00:27:07,112 --> 00:27:10,601
Since you're not listening to me,
don't blame me for showing you any mercy.

435
00:27:10,941 --> 00:27:12,198
I'll call the cops right now.

436
00:27:13,537 --> 00:27:15,204
Return my phone to me. You!

437
00:27:15,284 --> 00:27:16,451
Return it to me!

438
00:27:16,531 --> 00:27:17,879
Return it to me!

439
00:27:25,706 --> 00:27:27,031
Isn't it painful?

440
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,865
You've bitten me.

441
00:27:30,945 --> 00:27:32,346
I guess you're appeased now, right?

442
00:27:33,584 --> 00:27:34,895
I will never forgive you.

443
00:27:37,223 --> 00:27:38,620
Help!

444
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,549
A stranger has trespassed on my property!

445
00:27:40,629 --> 00:27:43,039
He's going to abduct me!
He's going to abduct me!

446
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,245
Gu Xiaoqi!

447
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:46,400
Are you done messing around?

448
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,636
Take a look at who
the strangers are here.

449
00:27:57,847 --> 00:27:58,906
I'll leave now.

450
00:28:00,935 --> 00:28:03,292
You're the stranger I was referring to.

451
00:28:03,372 --> 00:28:04,718
You're the stranger here!

452
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:07,526
What's wrong with having a spicy hot pot?
How is spicy hot pot junk food?

453
00:28:07,606 --> 00:28:09,285
Listen, spicy hot pot is great!

454
00:28:09,365 --> 00:28:11,806
The more you forbid me from eating it,
the more I'll eat them!

455
00:28:16,267 --> 00:28:18,817
I see, just a couple were quarreling.

456
00:28:27,964 --> 00:28:29,406
All of these are instant food.

457
00:28:29,486 --> 00:28:31,044
They're better than junk food.

458
00:28:36,305 --> 00:28:39,202
Don't think that I'll forgive you
just because you bought these for me.

459
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:51,175
I was looking for you.

460
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:53,063
Why did you bring him here?

461
00:28:53,407 --> 00:28:55,436
I'm here to prevent you
from abusing your daughter.

462
00:28:57,515 --> 00:28:58,671
Give me money.

463
00:28:59,174 --> 00:29:00,740
I don't have time to deal with you guys.

464
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,501
I need to play poker
with my friends later.

465
00:29:18,413 --> 00:29:20,936
There's 5,000 yuan in this card.

466
00:29:21,016 --> 00:29:21,998
How much?

467
00:29:22,477 --> 00:29:23,662
Five thousand yuan.

468
00:29:24,017 --> 00:29:25,817
Do you think I'm a beggar?

469
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:27,728
Are you asking for a beating?

470
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:31,923
-Are you even a human?
-You!

471
00:29:32,633 --> 00:29:34,304
What has this got to do with you?

472
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,032
This is the bank transfer record...

473
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,654
between you and Chendong three years ago.

474
00:29:41,734 --> 00:29:44,907
We also have proof
of your abuse towards Li Man.

475
00:29:45,729 --> 00:29:46,797
You!

476
00:29:47,268 --> 00:29:48,900
Why did you bring this out?

477
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,287
Didn't you say
you won't pursue this matter any longer?

478
00:29:51,367 --> 00:29:53,825
It all depends on your performance.

479
00:29:55,521 --> 00:29:56,592
In the future,

480
00:29:56,672 --> 00:29:59,536
Li Man will only transfer 5,000 yuan
to this card as your alimony.

481
00:29:59,616 --> 00:30:01,787
You won't get a single cent more.

482
00:30:02,338 --> 00:30:04,002
Man, you're something else now, huh?

483
00:30:04,316 --> 00:30:06,422
Do you think you can defy me
because you have his backing?

484
00:30:06,502 --> 00:30:09,710
Now, you're threatening your father
with an outsider.

485
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,300
If you continue to pester her,

486
00:30:11,848 --> 00:30:13,612
I will pursue legal responsibilities.

487
00:30:14,384 --> 00:30:16,444
You and I aren't related by any means.

488
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:18,408
I'm most willing to send you to prison.

489
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:22,100
What's the password?

490
00:30:23,971 --> 00:30:25,271
It's my mother's birthday.

491
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,430
You heartless wretch.

492
00:30:40,197 --> 00:30:41,397
Thanks.

493
00:30:45,747 --> 00:30:49,179
It's hard for me to deal with him
without your presence.

494
00:30:49,944 --> 00:30:51,827
He won't pester you for some time.

495
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:57,204
Thank you for dealing with him
on my behalf.

496
00:30:57,927 --> 00:31:00,701
You can treat this as my compensation
for misunderstanding you in the past.

497
00:31:00,781 --> 00:31:02,188
But this is all I can do.

498
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,818
No matter what,

499
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,544
I wish to thank you.

500
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,586
I know we can't be a couple anymore.

501
00:31:12,457 --> 00:31:16,185
But I'm content for us to be friends.

502
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:19,588
I have other things to attend to.
I'll leave first.

503
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:21,658
Keep this safe.

504
00:31:22,706 --> 00:31:24,800
You can go ahead.
I won't take up your time.

505
00:31:43,217 --> 00:31:45,452
So did he believe in you?

506
00:31:46,068 --> 00:31:48,955
That has nothing to do with you.

507
00:31:52,492 --> 00:31:55,586
Besides the money you gave me
before I went abroad,

508
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:57,740
I gave you an additional 100,000 yuan.

509
00:31:58,574 --> 00:32:01,300
You can treat it as the wage
for your performance.

510
00:32:06,244 --> 00:32:07,474
What's wrong?

511
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:09,310
It's nothing.

512
00:32:11,186 --> 00:32:12,782
I suddenly remember something.

513
00:32:12,862 --> 00:32:14,063
Last time,

514
00:32:14,143 --> 00:32:18,011
I saw a girl
together with Jiang Yicheng...

515
00:32:18,091 --> 00:32:19,450
when he went to your company.

516
00:32:19,794 --> 00:32:22,258
I think that girl is his girlfriend.

517
00:32:22,932 --> 00:32:26,254
You see, sow nothing, reap nothing.

518
00:32:26,334 --> 00:32:28,038
If you still like him,

519
00:32:29,435 --> 00:32:30,629
I can help you out.

520
00:32:30,709 --> 00:32:33,003
I don't need you
to meddle with my affair.

521
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:37,232
No matter what happens in the future,
please don't come and find me.

522
00:32:37,696 --> 00:32:40,066
You and I are unrelated now.

523
00:33:14,851 --> 00:33:16,740
Do you like Animal World so much?

524
00:33:19,068 --> 00:33:20,187
You're back.

525
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,955
I bought your favourite food for you.

526
00:33:26,624 --> 00:33:27,920
I just finished dinner.

527
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,199
Since you're not eating,

528
00:33:31,603 --> 00:33:34,233
it seems like
I can only enjoy it myself then.

529
00:33:43,418 --> 00:33:44,850
Haven't you had dinner yet?

530
00:33:45,488 --> 00:33:47,728
I told you I was busy.
I didn't have time to eat.

531
00:33:47,808 --> 00:33:49,433
I thought you were meeting Li Man...

532
00:33:55,022 --> 00:33:56,137
How did you know?

533
00:33:57,746 --> 00:34:00,641
I even knew that you were together
with her yesterday.

534
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,371
Did you install a camera on my clothes?

535
00:34:04,451 --> 00:34:05,522
No.

536
00:34:07,722 --> 00:34:11,007
It seems like a woman's sixth sense
is not to be underestimated.

537
00:34:12,485 --> 00:34:13,950
You became distracted...

538
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,941
ever since Li Man
appeared in front of you.

539
00:34:16,021 --> 00:34:17,729
Although you don't dare to admit it,

540
00:34:17,809 --> 00:34:20,161
I have a standard IQ and logical sense.

541
00:34:20,241 --> 00:34:22,448
I can guess the relationship
between you two.

542
00:34:23,613 --> 00:34:25,489
Since you're this amazing,

543
00:34:25,569 --> 00:34:28,437
I suppose you know that
I'm unrelated to her by now.

544
00:34:29,071 --> 00:34:31,804
Dare you say that even though
you left halfway through our meeting?

545
00:34:31,884 --> 00:34:34,650
Dare you say that
when you stood me up to see her?

546
00:34:36,129 --> 00:34:38,998
I went to see her because she
needed my help to solve her family affair.

547
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:40,207
Wait.

548
00:34:41,259 --> 00:34:44,116
Are you interrogating me right now?

549
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:50,715
I did stand you up,
but I did tell you about it, right?

550
00:34:50,795 --> 00:34:53,188
Moreover, we promised not...

551
00:34:53,268 --> 00:34:55,732
to meddle with
each other's personal affairs.

552
00:34:58,188 --> 00:35:00,904
We promised to hide our marriage
from others, right?

553
00:35:00,984 --> 00:35:04,427
But you still announced our relationship
to the public without my permission.

554
00:35:05,045 --> 00:35:07,125
Your tongue is getting sharper
and sharper.

555
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:08,835
Did you eat gunpowder for dinner?

556
00:35:09,449 --> 00:35:12,695
Anyway, everyone in the company
is gossiping about you and Li Man.

557
00:35:12,775 --> 00:35:13,805
Who spread the gossip?

558
00:35:13,885 --> 00:35:15,087
Give me their names.

559
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:17,632
You were the one
who provided them with a source.

560
00:35:17,712 --> 00:35:20,201
Now, everyone thinks that
you're cheating on me.

561
00:35:20,516 --> 00:35:21,875
Even if our relationship is fake,

562
00:35:21,955 --> 00:35:25,364
can you respect my status
as your girlfriend?

563
00:35:27,894 --> 00:35:29,076
I understand now.

564
00:35:30,491 --> 00:35:31,586
How about this?

565
00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:34,140
I'll explain the situation
to them tomorrow.

566
00:35:34,787 --> 00:35:36,030
Explain what?

567
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,400
I'll tell them...

568
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,606
that you weren't the victim
of a scandalous affair.

569
00:35:39,686 --> 00:35:41,326
I'll tell them that
I didn't cheat on you.

570
00:35:42,642 --> 00:35:43,748
You don't need to do that.

571
00:35:43,828 --> 00:35:45,185
I'll do that myself.

572
00:35:45,265 --> 00:35:46,730
What do you want me to do then?

573
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:53,654
I hope you will not meet Li Man
by yourself in the future.

574
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,259
She's the representative from EG.

575
00:35:57,833 --> 00:35:59,562
Fine, each of us should
take a step back then.

576
00:35:59,642 --> 00:36:02,232
In the future,
you need to bring me with you...

577
00:36:02,312 --> 00:36:03,865
if you're going to see her.

578
00:36:04,589 --> 00:36:05,598
Sure.

579
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,998
Promise?

580
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,891
Will you let me eat in peace if I say no?

581
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,269
The dishes are cold.
Let me heat them up for you.

582
00:36:25,579 --> 00:36:26,856
They taste good when they're cold.

583
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:28,177
You don't need to heat them up.

584
00:36:34,065 --> 00:36:35,088
You see,

585
00:36:35,538 --> 00:36:37,713
I wish to have some of them as well.

586
00:36:37,793 --> 00:36:38,801
No.

587
00:36:39,382 --> 00:36:40,725
You rejected me just now.

588
00:36:40,805 --> 00:36:44,718
So this, this, and this,
all of them belong to me.

589
00:36:47,477 --> 00:36:48,659
You're so petty.

590
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:07,395
She's a dumb koala indeed.

591
00:37:07,917 --> 00:37:09,343
She didn't even take the fork.

592
00:37:33,732 --> 00:37:35,150
Why didn't you stop just now?

593
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,335
I haven't exited the car.

594
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:37,993
I forgot about it.

595
00:37:38,073 --> 00:37:39,141
You better go back there.

596
00:37:39,221 --> 00:37:41,102
It'll be bad if our colleagues
see us like this.

597
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,955
Is it embarrassing for you
to come to work with me?

598
00:37:43,035 --> 00:37:46,233
Weren't you the one who was afraid that
our colleagues might see us like this?

599
00:37:46,685 --> 00:37:48,481
The past was in the past.

600
00:37:49,621 --> 00:37:50,741
Now,

601
00:37:51,132 --> 00:37:52,442
we've announced our relationship.

602
00:37:52,522 --> 00:37:53,988
There's no need for us
to be sneaky any longer.

603
00:37:54,068 --> 00:37:56,808
Does that mean I can come to work
with you in the future?

604
00:37:58,365 --> 00:38:00,465
I am just too lazy to stop my car.

605
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:02,015
Why are you so happy about that?

606
00:38:03,429 --> 00:38:05,542
That means I don't need to walk
to the company anymore.

607
00:38:05,622 --> 00:38:07,673
I have to walk quite a long distance.

608
00:38:08,306 --> 00:38:09,509
It's just a bridge.

609
00:38:09,589 --> 00:38:10,776
It isn't that far away.

610
00:38:30,021 --> 00:38:32,621
Yicheng, are you free this afternoon?

611
00:38:33,653 --> 00:38:34,943
Do you need anything?

612
00:38:35,023 --> 00:38:36,872
There's an industry summit
this afternoon.

613
00:38:36,952 --> 00:38:39,678
Many famous people
from our industry will be there.

614
00:38:39,758 --> 00:38:41,225
I wish to introduce them to you.

615
00:38:41,769 --> 00:38:42,629
Yicheng,

616
00:38:42,709 --> 00:38:44,640
your company is at
a high-development period.

617
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,411
You need to understand
that connections mean money to you.

618
00:38:47,779 --> 00:38:49,168
Thank you for your invitation.

619
00:38:49,248 --> 00:38:51,211
I am going to attend the summit anyway.

620
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:52,328
All right.

621
00:38:52,408 --> 00:38:53,575
Yicheng,

622
00:38:53,655 --> 00:38:56,967
do I look better in pink or blue?

623
00:38:57,047 --> 00:38:59,014
I don't know about that. Suit yourself.

624
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:03,688
Hypocrite.

625
00:39:03,768 --> 00:39:05,724
Back then, you said
I looked good in blue.

626
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,186
Lu Li, come out for a second.

627
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,860
They're showing off
their relationship again.

628
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,423
If they're showing off,
we should enjoy it then.

629
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:34,065
You're magnanimous indeed.

630
00:39:35,241 --> 00:39:38,233
Did Mum ask you to pass a message to me?

631
00:39:38,313 --> 00:39:39,528
Why are you saying that?

632
00:39:39,608 --> 00:39:42,535
If it's related to work,
there's no need for you to call me here.

633
00:39:42,615 --> 00:39:45,789
If you don't want them to see us,
that means it's a family affair.

634
00:39:45,869 --> 00:39:47,256
It isn't a family affair.

635
00:39:47,574 --> 00:39:49,138
You were the one who told me...

636
00:39:49,218 --> 00:39:51,782
to bring you along
when I'm seeing Li Man, right?

637
00:39:52,236 --> 00:39:54,537
This afternoon,
I need to attend an industry summit.

638
00:39:54,617 --> 00:39:55,759
Li Man will be there as well.

639
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:57,630
-As for you...
-I wish to go.

640
00:39:59,055 --> 00:40:00,668
But you need a formal dress.

641
00:40:00,748 --> 00:40:01,896
Do you have it?

642
00:40:01,976 --> 00:40:03,608
When does the summit start?

643
00:40:03,688 --> 00:40:04,820
Two o'clock.

644
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,660
Okay then.

645
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,770
Boss, can I apply for leave?

646
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:09,906
Permission granted.

647
00:40:09,986 --> 00:40:11,700
But you must not embarrass me.

648
00:40:14,875 --> 00:40:16,006
By the way,

649
00:40:16,809 --> 00:40:19,112
wear something blue if it's possible.

650
00:40:19,192 --> 00:40:20,234
But why?

651
00:40:20,314 --> 00:40:22,411
Because my tie is blue.

652
00:40:22,491 --> 00:40:24,987
And I like blue.

653
00:40:35,596 --> 00:40:38,139
He actually remembers what I said.

654
00:40:38,789 --> 00:40:40,961
Lu Li, you can do it.

655
00:40:44,201 --> 00:40:45,758
Xiaoqi, I need help.

656
00:40:46,996 --> 00:40:48,810
Are you at the anime convention?

657
00:40:49,298 --> 00:40:51,429
I need a set of blue formal wear.

658
00:40:51,902 --> 00:40:53,876
All right, I'll go to your house.

659
00:40:55,306 --> 00:40:56,830
Xiaoqi, I've arrived.

660
00:41:04,167 --> 00:41:05,887
Li, have you found it?

661
00:41:07,366 --> 00:41:10,548
Your wardrobe
is a door to a different dimension.

662
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,644
Are you sure you have blue formal wear?

663
00:41:13,724 --> 00:41:15,883
I'm sure. My parents bought it for me.

664
00:41:15,963 --> 00:41:17,265
They wanted me to wear it
for an interview.

665
00:41:17,345 --> 00:41:18,465
But I've never worn it before.

666
00:41:18,545 --> 00:41:19,828
Try and look for it.

667
00:41:29,869 --> 00:41:31,878
I don't think it's in your room.

668
00:41:31,958 --> 00:41:33,586
Maybe you should search around the bed.

669
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:36,305
It's possible
that I might have placed it there.

670
00:41:49,569 --> 00:41:50,609
I found it.

671
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:52,720
Baby, I'll hang up first.
They're calling for me.

672
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,486
I need to work now. Anyway,
search my room if you need anything.

673
00:41:55,566 --> 00:41:56,654
All right.

674
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:19,428
Lu Li.

675
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,823
I'm changing.

676
00:42:21,903 --> 00:42:23,316
I'll be done soon.

677
00:42:24,193 --> 00:42:26,352
You should finish changing first.
I'll go and change as well.

678
00:42:26,432 --> 00:42:27,867
We still have time for lunch.

679
00:42:28,227 --> 00:42:29,220
All right.

680
00:42:35,077 --> 00:42:36,783
Lu Li, are you done?

681
00:42:37,947 --> 00:42:39,251
Almost.

682
00:42:58,336 --> 00:42:59,621
Is this okay?

683
00:43:03,221 --> 00:43:04,438
Many times,

684
00:43:04,518 --> 00:43:06,827
even though we know the answer,

685
00:43:06,907 --> 00:43:08,748
we choose to keep quiet.

686
00:43:09,214 --> 00:43:12,013
Actually, it's because
we put our faith in luck...

687
00:43:12,093 --> 00:43:14,685
and hope that we might have a chance
to make a comeback.
