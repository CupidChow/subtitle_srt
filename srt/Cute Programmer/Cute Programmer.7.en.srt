Thanks for liking my videos
and following my account.

00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:04,319
I'll give you another one.

27
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,760
If you like this live streamer,
do follow her page.

28
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,360
Thanks for this sweetheart
who has a tryst at dusk.

29
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,440
What are you laughing at?

30
00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:23,759
Why don't you focus on work?

31
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:25,440
Be careful not to crash the system.

32
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:27,399
How did it go?

33
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,279
Did you make it?

34
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,839
What are you talking about?

35
00:02:30,119 --> 00:02:32,279
Didn't you ask for leave
so that you could attend an interview?

36
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:35,160
It's for something else.

37
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,440
I've got an idea.

38
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:40,199
If you can't find a suitable job,

39
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:42,639
you can become a gaming streamer.

40
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,199
With your looks
and your skills in games,

41
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,440
I'm sure you'll be a great hit online.

42
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:46,919
Then, I'll show you my support.

43
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:51,080
This...

44
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,679
I...

45
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,600
What do you mean?

46
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,679
I meant it.

47
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,639
Think about it.

48
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,600
(Sorry.)

49
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,160
(I've been a fan of yours
for a long time.)

50
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:03,000
(Can I add you on WeChat?)

51
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:13,559
What's bothering you?

52
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,679
You're all lost in thought.

53
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,199
Mr. Chen.

54
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,960
Aren't you supposed to be on leave?

55
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,240
Why are you here?

56
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:23,759
I'm done with my work

57
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,360
and I don't have much time left here.

58
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,600
I don't want to waste it.

59
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,720
Have you decided where to go next?

60
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,039
Don't worry.

61
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,759
I'll write you
a letter of recommendation.

62
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,160
With your expertise,

63
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:39,919
you can do just fine
no matter which company you go to.

64
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,559
But I don't want to leave Enchant.

65
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,160
If I am to join another company,

66
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:48,600
I might never see...

67
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,720
I might never see all of you again.

68
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:53,639
We live in the same city.

69
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:54,800
If you want to meet us,

70
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,199
we can always hang out.

71
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,320
Will Mr. Jiang change his mind?

72
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,080
Yicheng is a stubborn man.

73
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:10,320
Even after he realizes his own mistakes,

74
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:12,080
it's still hard to change his mind.

75
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:13,320
Unless...

76
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:15,440
What?

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,040
Unless you're better than him

78
00:04:18,119 --> 00:04:19,559
and he's left with no other choice.

79
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:22,119
How is that possible?

80
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:31,959
Mr. Chen.

81
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,720
Do you mean better than him
in coding or something else?

82
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,000
It's hard to tell.

83
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,640
What are you planning?

84
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:43,799
Thanks for the tip.

85
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:44,720
If I get to stay here,

86
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:46,160
I'll wash your cups every day.

87
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:49,559
All the best.

88
00:04:58,519 --> 00:04:59,160
Mr. Jiang.

89
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,720
All right.

90
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,600
What happened today
was just a misunderstanding.

91
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,519
I apologize to you.

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,200
But you should never revisit my place.

93
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:12,399
Apology accepted.

94
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:13,480
But

95
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,720
this is not why I'm here.

96
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,119
Then, why are you here?

97
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,359
I want to challenge you.

98
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,000
Do you want to challenge me?

99
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,160
You?

100
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:24,440
Yes, me.

101
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,079
If I win,

102
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,119
you have to allow me to stay.

103
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,040
Koala Lu.

104
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,640
Save it.

105
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,760
Leave the company when your time's up.

106
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,160
Why?

107
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,239
Are you afraid of losing?

108
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,040
Are you scared?

109
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,359
You are so bad at goading.

110
00:05:44,007 --> 00:05:45,526
But why am I upset?

111
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,320
How about this?

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'll give you a chance.

113
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,160
Programming.

114
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:51,000
Solving algorithm.

115
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,079
Comprehensive test.

116
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,079
Pick one.

117
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,160
We won't be using
our coding skills this time.

118
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,519
Then, what is the challenge about?

119
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:01,799
Mom, not only are you here personally,

120
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,679
but you have also brought her
so many gifts.

121
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,359
If you want to thank her for saving you,

122
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,200
why don't you just pay her?

123
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:10,079
Money is not everything.

124
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,760
But everything needs money.

125
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,679
When we're there,

126
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,559
you're not allowed to speak.

127
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,000
Then, why did you bring me here?

128
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,399
To carry all of these.

129
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,839
Dad always says that Jiang Yicheng
is not their biological son.

130
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,239
I guess I'm not their daughter too.

131
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,320
401.

132
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,519
Coming.

133
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,320
- Why are you here?
- Why are you here?

134
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,600
This...

135
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:10,119
Is this what you like?

136
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,920
Caixia.

137
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,959
It must be fate
that brought us together.

138
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,679
Do you think you have
superior driving skills

139
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:30,720
and can beat me in this?

140
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:33,559
Let's give it a try.

141
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,200
You...

142
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,359
You cheated.

143
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,640
There isn't a rule against cheating.

144
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:13,520
You lost.

145
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,479
Are you going to admit your defeat?

146
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,919
All right.

147
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,400
I lost the first round.

148
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,559
The first round?

149
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,400
We're playing three games.

150
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:22,000
You didn't say it before.

151
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,440
I didn't say you couldn't cheat either.

152
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,799
You are quick to apply what you learned.

153
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:29,400
Sure.

154
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:30,679
For the second round,

155
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:32,520
we will follow my rules.

156
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,080
Sure. That's fair.

157
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,679
Don't regret it later.

158
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,239
So, my daughter

159
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,559
is working in your son's company.

160
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,760
Yes.

161
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,799
I only just found out about this too.

162
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,520
My son

163
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:58,239
just recruited your daughter.

164
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,479
If not because of these two kids,

165
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,880
you and I

166
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,599
wouldn't have had a chance
to be here talking to each other.

167
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:10,119
I'm just an old lady
who enjoys square dancing.

168
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,320
Meanwhile, you're a rich missus
who loves flowers arrangement.

169
00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:14,359
We won't get along well.

170
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,320
Caixia,

171
00:10:17,719 --> 00:10:20,880
you're still as witty as before.

172
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,320
Do you think this is funny?

173
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:34,239
Aren't you here to send your gratitude?

174
00:10:35,119 --> 00:10:37,799
Since we've received your gratitude,
it's probably time for you to leave.

175
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,919
I'm in no hurry.

176
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,880
I'll wait for Li to come home.

177
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,559
I have something to tell her.

178
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:57,460
(Mom)

179
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,660
(Taekwondo)

180
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:09,119
I forgot to tell you beforehand.

181
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,719
I have a black belt in Taekwondo.

182
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,919
Do you still want to carry on?

183
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,159
Sure. The match will start now.

184
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:54,080
Are you going to stay there
until the match ends?

185
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:58,359
Let's start now.

186
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,840
Wait a minute.

187
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:03,080
I need to warm up.

188
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:20,320
I'll share with you the first tip.

189
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:23,200
The best defense is a good offense.

190
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,080
No.

191
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:26,159
Wait!

192
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:28,400
What are you waiting for?

193
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,359
Is this one of the Taekwondo moves?

194
00:12:32,967 --> 00:12:33,726
No.

195
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm afraid that my legs are too strong
and I will hurt you.

196
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,719
Then, you will pester me again,
saying that it's a work-related injury.

197
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,640
Wait a moment.

198
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:42,880
What is it again?

199
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:46,880
Are you going to surrender?

200
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,880
Wait a minute.

201
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,679
What do you actually want?

202
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:55,799
Mr. Jiang.

203
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,719
Look.

204
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:03,440
(Taekwondo)
Rooster!

205
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:04,880
It's standing on one leg!

206
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,239
Rooster!

207
00:13:10,479 --> 00:13:10,960
Don't come near me.

208
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,479
Don't come near me.

209
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,200
Stop right there.

210
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,359
I'm warning you.

211
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,280
If you come near me,

212
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,559
I'll turn it into chicken nuggets,

213
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,599
braised chicken, hot pot,

214
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,559
Kung Pao chicken,

215
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,280
Cola chicken wings,

216
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,000
skewers, fillet, boneless chicken feet,

217
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,080
braised chicken thigh...

218
00:13:22,119 --> 00:13:22,840
I...

219
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:25,239
Mr. Jiang, are you scared?

220
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,119
Look how cute it is.

221
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,880
Do you hate pigeons?

222
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,679
I hate all animals
with beaks and feathers.

223
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,640
Animals with beaks and feathers?

224
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,280
Leave this to me.

225
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,039
How is this cute?

226
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,080
Why is there a rooster here?

227
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,239
Take it away from me.

228
00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:50,880
Wait a minute.

229
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,239
They are solving
some personal issues there.

230
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,000
Give them a moment.

231
00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:54,039
Sure.

232
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:56,359
Oh, yes.

233
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,400
Why is there a rooster here?

234
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,640
It must be you who brought it here.

235
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,559
Why are you here?

236
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,039
Xiaoqi.

237
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:07,640
Can you do me a favor?

238
00:14:07,665 --> 00:14:10,100
(Xiaoqi)

239
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,599
Yes. That's it.

240
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,119
It has no idea too.

241
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:15,640
Mr. Jiang.

242
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,679
Do you want to give it a hug?

243
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:19,119
What's wrong?

244
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,280
Are you surrendering?

245
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:26,799
Nice.

246
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,239
I assume you've lost.

247
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,760
You're so mean.

248
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,520
I learned this from you.

249
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:40,960
No.

250
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,320
My heart is over here.

251
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,599
Xiaoqi.

252
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,359
Good luck!

253
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:05,080
One, one.

254
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,039
One more game.

255
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,080
What are we going to do?

256
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,080
Are you done yet?

257
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:09,280
I'm not doing this anymore.

258
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:11,599
You can't do this to me.

259
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:12,799
I'll do what I want.

260
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:14,520
I am the referee.

261
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,880
You can't do that.

262
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,799
You have to keep your words.

263
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:18,679
Stop right there.

264
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:21,880
If you don't keep your words,

265
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:23,359
others will not trust you anymore.

266
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:24,440
You won't get recognized by society

267
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,919
and you'll be just a soulless body.

268
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:26,840
Shut up.

269
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,479
If you say another word,

270
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:29,719
I'll make you leave tomorrow.

271
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:34,599
You have one last chance.

272
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:35,960
You will win this round

273
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,760
if you can return to the office on foot
before the sunsets.

274
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,320
Our office is 15km away from here.

275
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,919
It will take me one and half hours to
get there at my usual speed,

276
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,479
even if I don't take a break.

277
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,840
It's almost 6 PM.

278
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,119
The sunset is at 7 PM.

279
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:54,960
This is an impossible task.

280
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,280
You can give up now.

281
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,760
(Taekwondo)
See you at the office.

282
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,080
Are you mad?

283
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,040
Go home.

284
00:17:13,719 --> 00:17:14,680
I have to finish this.

285
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,920
Do you think you're invincible?

286
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,520
You should cut your coat
according to your cloth.

287
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,239
I don't want to leave Enchant.

288
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:27,280
I don't want to leave you.

289
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,560
All of you...

290
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,959
We'll talk about this later.

291
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:34,880
Go home.

292
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:38,079
Have you just agreed to reconsider it?

293
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,920
I worry that
you might overtire yourself,

294
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
and your body may not be able
to handle the stress.

295
00:17:42,199 --> 00:17:43,520
Are you worried about me?

296
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:45,079
Get in the car.

297
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,319
There's no need for that.

298
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:47,920
I can go home by myself.

299
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:50,280
Miss.

300
00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:52,680
You are wearing the clothes
from the Taekwondo gym.

301
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:54,719
They called and asked me to return it.

302
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:56,920
Get in the car.

303
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:14,800
Mom.

304
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,000
It's getting dark.

305
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,079
Are we not leaving yet?

306
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,800
This...

307
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,599
It's late now.

308
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:32,400
Do you want to stay for dinner?

309
00:18:33,239 --> 00:18:34,640
Thanks. We're fine.

310
00:18:34,959 --> 00:18:36,160
You guys go ahead.

311
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,199
The leftovers in our house

312
00:18:39,239 --> 00:18:41,280
won't suit this rich missus' palate.

313
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:45,319
She was well known as the picky eater
of our high school.

314
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,520
She never ate in our school's cafeteria.

315
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,359
Caixia.

316
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:49,319
I remember

317
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:52,040
that you had a great appetite
when you were a student.

318
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:54,119
You always snacked in class.

319
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:56,479
One time, you were caught by the teacher

320
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:57,439
and were punished.

321
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,319
I did that because...

322
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,000
Aunt Cheng. Director Jiang.

323
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,719
Why are you here?

324
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,719
Li, you're back.

325
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:18,959
All right.

326
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,479
What do you have to say? Say it now.

327
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,319
We are going to have our dinner soon.

328
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,800
In fact, I'm here

329
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:30,319
to propose marriage.

330
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:32,079
What?

331
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:34,680
Mom.

332
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,959
Are you mad?

333
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,319
I told you to stay calm.

334
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,079
Did I hear it right?

335
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:45,520
Li.

336
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,119
Do you want to be my daughter-in-law?

337
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,760
Cheng Yueru.

338
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,800
What nonsense is this?

339
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,319
Marriage? Daughter-in-law?

340
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:58,520
Are you mad?

341
00:19:59,640 --> 00:19:59,959
Caixia.

342
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,319
It seems like you know nothing.

343
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:04,359
After I met you,

344
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:07,839
I managed to connect all the dots.

345
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,760
You know what.

346
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,760
The day we ran into each other
at the hotel

347
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,359
was when Li and my son
fell for each other.

348
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,880
That was also why

349
00:20:17,439 --> 00:20:22,000
she joined my son's company.

350
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:29,439
Mom, that's not true.

351
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,359
Li.

352
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:34,359
Don't you like Yicheng?

353
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,359
Caixia.

354
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,640
Love is not something

355
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,719
we can control.

356
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:54,319
As parents,
we should be more understanding.

357
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,520
We shouldn't try
to separate the lovebirds.

358
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,800
Get out.

359
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,760
Get out of here.

360
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,719
Mom, don't do this.

361
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,479
Aunt.

362
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,319
Caixia.

363
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,839
You're still
as short-tempered as before.

364
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:11,560
Aunt.

365
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,760
Mom.

366
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,280
Sorry.

367
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:13,959
Aunt.

368
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,040
Caixia.

369
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:19,079
Mom, you shouldn't do this.

370
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,160
Shut up.

371
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,280
So, that's why you complimented her son.

372
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,959
Have you already taken a fancy to him?

373
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,599
She's an adult.

374
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,760
Mind your words.

375
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:28,079
Shut up.

376
00:21:28,239 --> 00:21:29,400
You spoiled her.

377
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:33,719
You told me you wanted to stay there
for your dreams.

378
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,119
Then, you showed me...

379
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,760
Hello... Hello, world.

380
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:38,839
World.

381
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,880
I fell into your trap.

382
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,000
Tender your resignation tomorrow.

383
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,920
That's enough.

384
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:46,680
Let's go eat.

385
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,439
Here.

386
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:48,119
It's okay.

387
00:21:48,199 --> 00:21:49,760
Don't be mad.

388
00:21:51,479 --> 00:21:52,199
Here.

389
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:53,000
Let's eat.

390
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:53,800
That's really worrying.

391
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,760
I'm mad.

392
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,319
Mom.

393
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,439
This is such a major decision.

394
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:12,520
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

395
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:13,880
Does Yicheng know about this?

396
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:15,040
There's no need to tell him about this.

397
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:16,239
We'll let him know after it's confirmed.

398
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,920
But Lu Li is a liar.

399
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,400
Silly girl.

400
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,119
If your brother hasn't fallen for her,

401
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:24,959
why would I propose marriage?

402
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:27,880
So, they have...

403
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,920
Then, she'll have nothing to do

404
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,400
with Yiming anymore.

405
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:41,479
But Lu Li's mother
doesn't look too pleased.

406
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,599
Caixia

407
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:46,920
hasn't changed a bit.

408
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:49,479
But you can rest assured.

409
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:52,479
I know how to handle her.

410
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:54,520
Zitong.

411
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,239
You have to run an errand for me

412
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:56,680
tomorrow.

413
00:22:57,439 --> 00:22:59,520
As long as I can kick Jiang Yicheng
out of our house...

414
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,000
I'm saying,

415
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:05,319
as long as Lu Li can
become my sister-in-law,

416
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,560
I will do everything for you.

417
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:11,839
But what if Yicheng finds out

418
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,040
about our plot?

419
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,280
We have your dad.

420
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:17,959
What's the instruction?

421
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,680
Do as I say.

422
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,119
Don't ask any more questions.

423
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:22,839
Hurry up. Drive safe.

424
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,439
Yes.

425
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,599
Are you going out?

426
00:23:58,719 --> 00:23:59,239
Darling.

427
00:23:59,319 --> 00:23:59,920
That...

428
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:03,280
I think there's a black spot
in the top right corner.

429
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:04,680
Over there.

430
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,040
Here?

431
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:05,640
Yes.

432
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,560
Further up.

433
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:08,280
Further up.

434
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,040
I can't reach it.

435
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,760
Why aren't you helping me?

436
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:22,040
Caixia.

437
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,719
I wish

438
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,000
to invite your family over today.

439
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,599
Don't reject me so quickly.

440
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,119
Although our families

441
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:33,280
are not of the same status,

442
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:35,119
you don't have to feel pressured

443
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:36,439
and be scared to pay me a visit.

444
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,000
Who said that I am pressured?

445
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:39,439
Who said that I am scared?

446
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:40,479
Believe it or not.

447
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:41,160
I'll be right there.

448
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:41,920
Sure.

449
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,359
I'll be waiting for you.

450
00:24:43,479 --> 00:24:44,280
Just wait.

451
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,680
That's great.

452
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,040
Who called you?

453
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:52,560
Get up now.

454
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:54,199
Hurry up and change into the suit

455
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,760
you wore when you received
the top-ten best employee award.

456
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:58,560
Yes. The suit you wore
when you received the award.

457
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,280
That's the one.

458
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,760
Get changed now.

459
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,479
Hurry up.

460
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,520
Where are we going?

461
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,119
Lu Li, get out of your room.

462
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,520
What's the matter, mom?

463
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,160
Change into the dress I bought you.

464
00:25:20,439 --> 00:25:21,920
Then, go to the beauty salon downstairs

465
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,920
and get your makeup done.

466
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:24,839
Where are we going?

467
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:25,599
Don't ask.

468
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,640
Hurry up.

469
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,560
Give your brother a call immediately.

470
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,079
Tell him that I fell and injured myself.

471
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:39,040
My legs are hurt.

472
00:25:39,199 --> 00:25:40,119
Tell him to come home right away.

473
00:25:40,199 --> 00:25:41,160
Sure.

474
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:44,520
Darling.

475
00:25:45,199 --> 00:25:46,719
What are you going to do

476
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,839
with such an extensive plan?

477
00:25:48,199 --> 00:25:49,920
Your son refuses to get married.

478
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:52,000
Therefore, I found him a wife myself.

479
00:26:01,479 --> 00:26:02,079
Wait a minute.

480
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:04,719
Some reminders.

481
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:06,000
When you are eating,

482
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:06,640
first,

483
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:08,199
don't chew loudly.

484
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:10,160
Second, don't burp.

485
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,719
Third, don't take off your shoes.

486
00:26:12,719 --> 00:26:13,319
No. Yes.

487
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,160
Fourth...

488
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:14,599
No.

489
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,439
Wait.

490
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:18,239
Do I do these?

491
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,439
You're so nervous that
you're spouting nonsense.

492
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,000
No.

493
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:23,640
I only want to remind you.

494
00:26:23,719 --> 00:26:25,239
I don't want you to make any mistakes.

495
00:26:25,439 --> 00:26:27,119
I won't allow Cheng Yueru

496
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:28,000
to look down on us.

497
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:28,760
Do you understand?

498
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:29,479
Understood.

499
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,319
Babe, relax.

500
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:33,479
We're here for a meal.

501
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:35,119
Just a meal.

502
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:37,839
Hello.

503
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:46,479
You're here.

504
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:47,839
Come on in.

505
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,719
Thanks.

506
00:26:49,239 --> 00:26:49,920
Mom.

507
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:01,760
What's going on?

508
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,280
Aunt Cheng invited us over.

509
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,640
Have a seat.

510
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,680
Please sit.

511
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:11,400
We're only serving you
with some home-cooked dishes today.

512
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,400
I hope you'll like it.

513
00:27:12,479 --> 00:27:13,680
Help yourselves.

514
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,079
You must have spent a lot of time
preparing all of these dishes.

515
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:20,239
Not really.

516
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:22,160
It's Chengyang's off day.

517
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:23,880
He helped me in preparing this.

518
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,319
Welcome to our place.

519
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,079
Yueru

520
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,400
has never been this happy

521
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,439
and excited.

522
00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:35,280
We live nearby,

523
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:36,599
and have known each other
for a long time.

524
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,800
Do visit us

525
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,079
more frequently.

526
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:43,000
Then, we can get to know
each other better.

527
00:27:45,439 --> 00:27:47,119
Let me propose a toast.

528
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,959
Welcome.

529
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:51,880
Thanks.

530
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:52,959
You've worked hard.

531
00:27:58,479 --> 00:27:59,040
Darling.

532
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,479
Here.

533
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,479
You don't like mushrooms.

534
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,199
I'll eat it.

535
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,680
Caixia, give it a taste.

536
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,439
Here.

537
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:16,760
This is your favorite braised pork.

538
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,199
I heard that Li is working
in Yicheng's company.

539
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:31,839
Yes, uncle.

540
00:28:33,199 --> 00:28:34,880
There aren't

541
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,239
many female programmers now.

542
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,000
But I think

543
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:38,959
you probably share

544
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,040
a lot of common interests with Yicheng.

545
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:48,400
Caixia.

546
00:28:48,479 --> 00:28:49,400
What a coincidence.

547
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,119
Your daughter, Li,

548
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:53,599
is Yicheng's junior.

549
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:54,599
Isn't that a coincidence?

550
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,680
What are you doing?

551
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,800
Jiang Yicheng.

552
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:04,280
Eating without music

553
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:06,760
is like cooking without salt.

554
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:07,560
It's boring.

555
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,640
I'll play some music.

556
00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:13,599
You're right.

557
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,280
This can also liven up the atmosphere.

558
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,280
You're right.

559
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:17,839
Caixia, let's eat.

560
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,719
Eat up.

561
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,400
Let's eat.

562
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:29,839
Mom.

563
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:32,359
When did you buy this speaker?

564
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,560
It sounds good.

565
00:29:34,479 --> 00:29:35,199
Keep the volume down.

566
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:37,760
I can't hear you.

567
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,800
Turn it off.

568
00:29:58,199 --> 00:29:59,800
What's wrong with you?

569
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,040
You're so rude.

570
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:01,839
Hurry up.

571
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,040
Apologize to uncle and aunt.

572
00:30:04,239 --> 00:30:04,880
Drink this up.

573
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,599
I...

574
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,719
This will show your sincerity.

575
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,439
Is this fruit wine?

576
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,359
Good.

577
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,520
Uncle, aunt.

578
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:26,439
I'll drink up.

579
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,479
Caixia, here.

580
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,040
Here.

581
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:37,680
Let's eat.

582
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,640
Eat up.

583
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:40,400
He drank up the wine

584
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,719
to show you his sincerity.

585
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:42,959
Here.

586
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,479
Eat up.

587
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:43,920
Let's eat.

588
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,920
Eat more.

589
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,359
Eat more.

590
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:48,680
You haven't changed at all.

591
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,119
Braised pork is still your favorite.

592
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:52,560
I can only eat it when I'm thin.

593
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:16,760
What's wrong?

594
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:18,680
What happened?

595
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:20,280
Mr. Jiang has
a low tolerance for alcohol.

596
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,680
I think he's drunk.

597
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:24,479
Shouldn't fruit wine be non-alcoholic?

598
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,760
Tong,

599
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,239
bring your brother to his room.

600
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,280
Sure.

601
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,920
Lu Li, can you help me?

602
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:32,439
Stars.

603
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:33,959
Let's go.

604
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,839
Caixia, sorry.

605
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,599
My son is terrible with alcohol.

606
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,920
He only took a few sips
and this is what happened.

607
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,000
He's obviously an honest man.

608
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:49,319
Please don't mind him.

609
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:49,800
Yes.

610
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:50,880
Here.

611
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,880
Eat up.

612
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:53,719
Here.

613
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,359
Sure.

614
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,640
Thanks.

615
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:57,079
Drink up.

616
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:00,079
He isn't usually like this
when he drinks.

617
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:07,760
Be careful.

618
00:32:10,479 --> 00:32:11,239
Stars.

619
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,719
Director Jiang.

620
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,239
Can you lend me a hand?

621
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,959
I'll be right there.

622
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,160
Why... are you here?

623
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:33,319
No way.

624
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,000
Again?

625
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:39,760
You look so pretty today.

626
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,040
I want

627
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,280
to bite you.

628
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,920
You will regret it
when you sober up tomorrow.

629
00:32:59,199 --> 00:32:59,920
I...

630
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,520
Will not regret it.

00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,040
Pull him away.

642
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:37,040
What is he doing?

643
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,359
What are you doing?

644
00:33:38,439 --> 00:33:39,239
You're so shameless.

645
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,119
What did you do?

646
00:33:40,439 --> 00:33:41,640
How could you do this?

647
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:42,839
What are you doing?

648
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:43,599
No. You...

649
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:44,319
Dad.

650
00:33:44,719 --> 00:33:46,760
He tripped and accidentally pushed me.

651
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:47,319
That's enough.

652
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,079
Shut up.

653
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,520
The young couple takes a liking
to each other,

654
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:56,800
and are doing this at their own will.

655
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:59,599
There's nothing wrong
with a little physical touch.

656
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,119
No.

657
00:34:00,199 --> 00:34:00,599
Aunt Cheng.

658
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,119
There must be a misunderstanding.

659
00:34:01,199 --> 00:34:02,280
It's nothing like that.

660
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:02,880
Li.

661
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,719
You should know

662
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:05,800
that I really like you.

663
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,719
The meal is over.

664
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,520
Let's go home.

665
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,600
Caixia.

666
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,600
Wait a minute.

667
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,719
Since everyone is present,

668
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,080
let's discuss it.

669
00:34:16,439 --> 00:34:17,360
What is there to discuss?

670
00:34:17,959 --> 00:34:24,280
The marriage of Li and our Yicheng.

671
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,439
What are you doing?

672
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,679
We came home a long time ago.

673
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,919
Why haven't you got change?

674
00:34:57,399 --> 00:34:58,199
Here.

675
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,360
Drink some water.

676
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,399
Where did Lu Li go all afternoon?

677
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,000
Give her a call
and tell her to come home right away.

678
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:14,399
Look at you.

679
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:15,560
You're short-tempered again.

680
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:17,719
She's a girl and
she gets embarrassed easily.

681
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,199
After what happened to her,

682
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,479
you should allow her some alone time
to clear her mind.

683
00:35:22,439 --> 00:35:23,840
Why does she need to clear her mind?

684
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,199
How could a young lady

685
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,879
do this at someone else's house?

686
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,199
I guess

687
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,560
Cheng Yueru must be really satisfied

688
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:32,879
and pleased now.

689
00:35:33,919 --> 00:35:34,520
Let me tell you.

690
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,639
They are a young couple in love,

691
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,320
right?

692
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:39,919
Of course, there are times...

693
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,520
They can't control themselves.

694
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,320
We...

695
00:35:44,479 --> 00:35:45,600
How could they do that?

696
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,000
Right?

697
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,439
We are both here.

698
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,479
It doesn't matter how badly they want...

699
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,320
Don't worry.

700
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,360
When she's back,

701
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,800
I will make sure to rebuke her sternly.

702
00:35:56,479 --> 00:35:57,520
How could she do that?

703
00:35:58,159 --> 00:35:58,840
Here.

704
00:35:59,080 --> 00:35:59,760
Drink some water.

753
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,159
overall,

754
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:05,639
Jiang is a decent guy.

755
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,399
Besides,

756
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,040
his parents seem to

757
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,800
really like Li.

758
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:11,639
Right?

759
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,959
If she marries him,
we won't have to worry about anything.

760
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:15,479
Is she going to marry him?

761
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,120
Is she going to marry him?

762
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:18,080
No.

763
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:18,760
She won't marry him.

764
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,520
She won't marry him.

765
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,439

767

No.

if I'm around.

769

as mother and daughter.

Please.

771
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:31,959
Go.

772
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,080
You're finally back.

773
00:39:45,919 --> 00:39:48,520
Mom, I've thought it through.

774
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,080
Have you?

775
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,040
Great.

776
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,919
Tell me what your plan is.

777
00:39:54,439 --> 00:39:55,719
I'm willing to marry him.

778
00:39:59,879 --> 00:40:00,840
What?

779
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:05,159
I said,

780
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:07,840
I'm willing to marry Jiang Yicheng.

781
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,439
Are you sick?

782
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,040
What are you saying?

783
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,439
It's your marriage,

784
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,399
not something you can fool around with.

785
00:40:17,959 --> 00:40:19,399
I'm not fooling around.

786
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:23,320
So, are you dating each other?

787
00:40:24,879 --> 00:40:25,840
No.

788
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:27,520
That's why.

789
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:28,439
We're not living in the past.

790
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,919
You don't need to get married
just because you kissed.

791
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:32,080
Wait.

792
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,760
If you're not dating each other,

793
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,719
why did you kiss?

794
00:40:46,959 --> 00:40:47,520
Mom.

795
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,760
This is a photo taken
during my college days,

796
00:40:50,879 --> 00:40:53,080
when I received an award
from Jiang Yicheng.

797
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,639
I have always had a crush on him.

798
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:00,199
I learned programming because of him.

799
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:02,600
I disguised as a man to join the company

800
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:04,040
because of him as well.

801
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:13,800
How did you two meet?

802
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,919
I met him in a game
when I was a senior in high school.

803
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,639
That was his first time participating
in the development of a game.

804
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,320
Then, he...

805
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,199
He...

806
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,760
He still has no idea who I am.

807
00:41:30,959 --> 00:41:34,199
Jiang Yicheng intended to fire me.

808
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,120
Tomorrow is supposed to be my last day.

809
00:41:36,479 --> 00:41:38,679
If I don't seize this opportunity,

810
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,679
I won't have a chance

811
00:41:39,879 --> 00:41:42,439
to stay by his side anymore.

812
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:48,879
Sweetheart.

813
00:41:49,919 --> 00:41:51,280
Love

814
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,239
is never a fair trade.

815
00:41:54,919 --> 00:41:57,639
You won't always get what you give.

816
00:41:57,679 --> 00:41:58,760
Do you understand?

817
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,280
I know.

818
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:04,000
That's why I want to take a bet.

819
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:08,040
Are you a fool?

820
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,439
Marriage is never a bet.

821
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,639
Even after you spend
a long time together,

822
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,439
it is not guaranteed that
he'll develop feelings for you.

823
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,919
What if you fail?

824
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,840
You're a young lady.

825
00:42:17,959 --> 00:42:19,840
This will put you at a disadvantage.

826
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:21,600
If I don't try at all,

827
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:23,439
I have already failed.

828
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,919
Even if you have failed,

829
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,840
you're not hurt.

830
00:42:27,919 --> 00:42:28,560
Mom.

831
00:42:28,959 --> 00:42:30,600
I watched a movie before.

832
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,959
In the movie, they said

833
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:36,000
"if" and "how" are two harmless words.

834
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,280
But if you put them together,

835
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:42,479
you will live the remaining
of your life in regrets.

836
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:48,080
In the future,
I don't want to be thinking about

837
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:50,320
what would've happened to
Jiang Yicheng and me

838
00:42:50,439 --> 00:42:53,560
"if" I seized this opportunity.

839
00:42:53,919 --> 00:42:54,840
I fear regrets

840
00:42:54,919 --> 00:42:56,760
more than failure.

841
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,479
Have you

842
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,919
really thought it through?

843
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,600
You didn't make this decision
out of impulse, right?

844
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,000
If I was doing this out of impulse,

845
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,959
I would've confessed my feelings to him

846
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,760
when I enrolled at
the University of Xinhai.

847
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:34,840
But I didn't do that.

848
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:37,000
I knew

849
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,639
a confession like that

850
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,120
would not work out.

851
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:42,959
Therefore, for the past four years,

852
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,439
I've been working hard.

853
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,520
I earned myself a scholarship,

854
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:49,639
and earned all the professional awards
he received before.

855
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,080
Then, only I can gradually
get closer to him.

856
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,080
What if

857
00:43:57,919 --> 00:43:58,959
your hard work

858
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,040
bears no fruit?

859
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,719
I won't regret it.

860
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,479
Because

861
00:44:04,879 --> 00:44:06,919
I will become a better self.

862
00:44:10,959 --> 00:44:12,719
Dad. Mom.

863
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,600
If I don't grab this chance,

864
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,159
all my previous efforts

865
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:18,679
will be in vain.

866
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,000
You taught me

867
00:44:25,479 --> 00:44:28,600
to persevere.

868
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,159
Caixia.

869
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,639
Give your friend a call.

870
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,120
But...

871
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:37,800
But...

872
00:44:37,879 --> 00:44:39,560
She's a grown-up.

873
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:41,479
I believe

874
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,639
that she will be responsible
for the choices she makes.

875
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,399
Right?

876
00:44:46,879 --> 00:44:47,600
Thanks, dad.

877
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:48,879
Mom.

878
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:53,840
I must have owed you this
in my previous life.

879
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,159
But

880
00:44:58,399 --> 00:45:01,280
we have to remind you something.

881
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:02,360
From now on,

882
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,879
you shouldn't force yourself
to do anything.

883
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,760
Come to us if you have any troubles.

884
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:06,639
Talk to us.

885
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:07,320
Sure.

886
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,159
Also,

887
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,000
if Jiang Yicheng

888
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:11,560
ever bullies you,

889
00:45:11,919 --> 00:45:12,959
you have to tell me about it.

890
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,159
I'll punish him.

891
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:15,280
Sure.

892
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,000
That's not right.

893
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:26,719
We have reached an agreement.

894
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,199
But what if Jiang doesn't agree
to this marriage?
