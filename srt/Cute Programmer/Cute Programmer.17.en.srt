How do you know how to make up?

23
00:02:48,614 --> 00:02:51,789
If you have two women in the family
who won't leave home without makeup,

24
00:02:51,869 --> 00:02:53,710
you'll pick it up no matter
how stupid you are.

Stop staring at me like that.

You make me feel like a pervert.

27
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:05,952
I used to fix Jiang Zitong's hair
when she was a kid.

It's truly a blessing to be your sister.

29
00:03:10,603 --> 00:03:12,333
My sister is not the most blessed person.

30
00:03:12,413 --> 00:03:13,573
My wife...

31
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,992
It's late.

32
00:03:19,072 --> 00:03:20,091
Let's go.

33
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,909
Here. Smile.

34
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,633
Done.

35
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,294
You're here.

36
00:03:35,512 --> 00:03:36,811
Do I sign here?

37
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:39,301
I want to take this opportunity
to show Lu Li around.

38
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:45,623
The summit has not started yet.

39
00:03:45,703 --> 00:03:47,757
Let me introduce the investors to you.

40
00:03:47,837 --> 00:03:48,884
Sure.

41
00:03:50,794 --> 00:03:52,663
Take care. Don't sprain your ankle.

42
00:03:52,743 --> 00:03:53,788
I'm fine.

43
00:03:53,868 --> 00:03:55,361
Don't worry about me.

44
00:03:55,441 --> 00:03:56,793
I'm not worried.

45
00:03:56,873 --> 00:04:00,035
I don't want you to embarrass me.

46
00:04:06,138 --> 00:04:07,645
Yicheng, this way.

47
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,612
-Hi.
-Mr. Jiang.

48
00:04:10,692 --> 00:04:12,373
Mr. Jiang.
(The 1st Game Developers Summit)

49
00:04:12,633 --> 00:04:13,740
Mr. Li is over there.

50
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,264
I have a new idea.

51
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:19,118
It's an interactive game.

52
00:04:19,714 --> 00:04:22,268
We'll connect the mobile phone
and the computer.

53
00:04:22,348 --> 00:04:24,287
When we're out, we can play it
on our mobile phones.

54
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:26,445
When we are home,
we can play it on the computers.

55
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,897
What do you think?

56
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,133
That's not a bad idea.

57
00:04:35,573 --> 00:04:36,990
Do you want anything?

58
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,279
I'll take it for you.

59
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,820
It's okay.

60
00:04:44,687 --> 00:04:47,334
You seem like a quiet person.

61
00:04:48,912 --> 00:04:50,927
I'm not a quiet person.

62
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:53,427
I simply don't feel like talking
at the moment.

63
00:04:53,507 --> 00:04:55,171
You're really an interesting person.

64
00:04:55,251 --> 00:04:58,810
By the way,
are you Mr. Jiang's secretary?

65
00:05:00,998 --> 00:05:03,099
I'm a programmer.

66
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,148
Are you kidding me?

67
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:08,043
I don't believe you
unless you can prove it.

68
00:05:08,123 --> 00:05:09,521
How can I prove it?

69
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:13,906
What about this? Tell me how
to socialize with programmers.

70
00:05:17,611 --> 00:05:21,643
You should never call them
the computer repair technicians.

71
00:05:21,723 --> 00:05:22,701
No.

72
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,358
You should never point out
their mistakes.

73
00:05:26,249 --> 00:05:27,237
Eat something.

74
00:05:27,696 --> 00:05:30,240
Lu Li. Go get the bill.

75
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,444
Take care.

76
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,272
Mr. Jiang.

77
00:05:40,867 --> 00:05:42,867
You're making me look bad.

78
00:05:42,947 --> 00:05:44,718
I said I would get the bill.

79
00:05:45,734 --> 00:05:46,898
Mr. Li.

80
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:48,182
This is my home ground.

81
00:05:48,262 --> 00:05:49,776
Of course, I should be hosting you.

82
00:05:49,856 --> 00:05:50,835
Fret not.

83
00:05:50,915 --> 00:05:53,516
When I visit Shenzhen in the future,
you'll have to buy me a meal.

84
00:05:56,717 --> 00:05:57,816
By the way,

85
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:02,355
he is my right-hand man, Liu.

86
00:06:02,435 --> 00:06:03,749
He's an all-rounder,

87
00:06:04,315 --> 00:06:06,638
but unfortunately, he's still single.

88
00:06:07,024 --> 00:06:08,207
Mr. Jiang.

89
00:06:08,287 --> 00:06:11,718
Do introduce him to some nice girls
if you know any.

90
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,429
Mr. Li.

91
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:15,272
I don't think I can be of any help.

92
00:06:17,239 --> 00:06:19,053
That girl looks pretty decent.

93
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:23,074
It seems like they had a good chat
and they both enjoyed it.

94
00:06:23,154 --> 00:06:24,834
I find Miss Lu quite interesting too.

95
00:06:24,914 --> 00:06:26,625
Besides, she's a programmer.

96
00:06:26,705 --> 00:06:28,071
That's right.

97
00:06:28,151 --> 00:06:30,062
You shall propose a toast...

98
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:33,402
to thank Mr. Jiang
for introducing a nice girl to you.

99
00:06:33,482 --> 00:06:34,546
Thanks, Mr. Jiang.

100
00:06:34,984 --> 00:06:36,232
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

101
00:06:36,536 --> 00:06:37,977
I should've introduced her earlier.

102
00:06:38,057 --> 00:06:40,682
Miss Lu is my wife.

103
00:06:51,366 --> 00:06:53,246
It was a misunderstanding.

104
00:06:53,326 --> 00:06:54,285
Just a misunderstanding.

105
00:06:54,365 --> 00:06:55,868
Cheers.

106
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,015
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:57,095 --> 00:06:58,159
I should've made it clear earlier.

108
00:06:58,239 --> 00:06:59,212
Here.

109
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,630
Yicheng said I looked good in blue.

110
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,538
I didn't expect you
to be in the same color as well.

111
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:28,427
He picked this color.

112
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,094
Seemingly, he still likes
the same thing as before.

113
00:07:36,047 --> 00:07:37,851
We are different.

114
00:07:37,931 --> 00:07:40,057
I used to be just like you,

115
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,332
but I'm different now.

116
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,491
I can help him in building rapport,

117
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:49,799
and am capable of doing
many things I couldn't do before.

118
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,175
Career and love are two different things.

119
00:07:54,255 --> 00:07:57,011
I guess he has already
made his stance clear...

120
00:07:57,091 --> 00:07:58,958
when he decided to bring me here today.

121
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,652
I've been through this,

122
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,755
and I want to give you a piece of advice.

123
00:08:05,835 --> 00:08:08,459
Don't judge a book by its cover.

124
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,778
What do you mean?

125
00:08:11,133 --> 00:08:13,434
Yicheng is working so hard
to win all the investors over,

126
00:08:13,514 --> 00:08:16,235
because he wants to free himself
from his parents.

127
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:20,117
He doesn't want to be threatened
to make another choice...

128
00:08:20,197 --> 00:08:21,831
that he will regret later.

129
00:08:23,886 --> 00:08:26,127
I suppose you don't need me
to elaborate on this further.

130
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:46,589
This...

131
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:47,979
What's going on?

132
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,027
Yicheng.

133
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:51,483
Yicheng.

134
00:08:51,563 --> 00:08:52,794
Are you all right?

135
00:08:57,181 --> 00:08:58,316
Li Man.

136
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,751
Don't touch me.

137
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,234
I want to go home.

138
00:09:03,003 --> 00:09:04,808
-You...
-Don't touch me.

139
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,383
Be careful.

140
00:09:08,463 --> 00:09:09,559
I want to go home.

141
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,388
Be careful.

142
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:14,212
Let me help you.

143
00:09:16,205 --> 00:09:17,327
Let me do it.

144
00:09:21,374 --> 00:09:22,860
I want to go home.

145
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,029
Is Miss Li coming home with us?

146
00:09:40,631 --> 00:09:42,680
You should go home early too.

147
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,804
Let's go home.

148
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,443
Be careful.

149
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,808
Goal!

150
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,263
Be careful.

151
00:10:19,176 --> 00:10:20,087
Be careful.

152
00:10:22,138 --> 00:10:23,454
The bed's right here.

195

Good morning.

196
00:15:42,123 --> 00:15:43,146
Morning.

197
00:15:43,226 --> 00:15:45,303
Have you just gotten up?

198
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,549
Were you the one
who brought me home yesterday?

199
00:15:56,271 --> 00:15:58,513
Who else could it be?

200
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:04,469
I remember that Li Man insisted
on bringing me home. Then...

201
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:13,900
Then, I blacked out.

202
00:16:14,523 --> 00:16:18,437
Then, did we...

203
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,406
You know it well.

204
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:29,245
I'm uncontrollable when I'm drunk.

205
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,405
After I helped you to bed,
I went back to my own room.

206
00:16:35,485 --> 00:16:38,267
I have no idea
what happened in your room later.

207
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,113
Then...

208
00:16:42,689 --> 00:16:44,358
Who changed my bedsheets?

209
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,265
You were drunk and threw up on the bed.

210
00:16:49,345 --> 00:16:52,608
If I didn't change the sheet,
you would surely give me a mouthful.

211
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:57,296
Is that all?

212
00:16:57,376 --> 00:16:58,514
That's all.

213
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:13,271
Thanks for taking care of me last night.

214
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,304
You're welcome.

215
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:20,615
Don't drink too much again.

216
00:17:20,695 --> 00:17:21,939
You are really heavy.

217
00:18:13,535 --> 00:18:15,911
Was it all just a dream?

218
00:18:22,682 --> 00:18:23,941
Xiaoqi.

219
00:18:24,461 --> 00:18:25,986
Time for breakfast.

220
00:18:26,494 --> 00:18:28,639
I'll skip it. I want to keep sleeping.

221
00:18:30,101 --> 00:18:31,807
Go back to sleep after you eat.

222
00:18:31,887 --> 00:18:33,344
Otherwise, it'll hurt your stomach.

223
00:18:33,424 --> 00:18:35,132
The dishes are getting cold.

224
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,812
Godmother said
that if you don't wake up right away,

225
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:03,285
she will remove your blanket.

226
00:19:04,719 --> 00:19:06,079
How did you get in?

227
00:19:06,462 --> 00:19:08,564
Your godmother asked me
to send you some fruit.

228
00:19:08,644 --> 00:19:11,227
Don't you think I will forgive you just
because you brought up my godmother.

229
00:19:11,307 --> 00:19:12,563
We are no longer friends.

230
00:19:12,643 --> 00:19:13,763
Gu Xiaoqi.

231
00:19:13,843 --> 00:19:16,506
I don't want to hear you
saying this for the third time.

232
00:19:17,261 --> 00:19:18,442
Sure.

233
00:19:18,522 --> 00:19:20,124
We're no longer friends.

234
00:19:22,722 --> 00:19:24,424
This is my room. Get out.

235
00:19:27,681 --> 00:19:29,749
This photo was taken
on an outing we went on...

236
00:19:29,829 --> 00:19:31,760
when you were in middle school.

237
00:19:32,752 --> 00:19:36,527
I bought that music box for you
with my first ever pay.

238
00:19:37,266 --> 00:19:40,569
I gave that picture to you
as a coming-of-age gift.

239
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,750
This.

240
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,481
When you first entered high school,
you had to live on campus.

241
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:46,986
You were scared and you couldn't sleep.

242
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:49,575
I deliberately skipped class
just to buy this rabbit for you.

243
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,701
What are you doing?

244
00:19:53,217 --> 00:19:54,576
Are you here to reminisce?

245
00:19:54,656 --> 00:19:55,798
Xiaoqi.

246
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:57,936
What I'm saying is...

247
00:19:59,148 --> 00:20:01,546
I took part in every stage of your life.

248
00:20:01,626 --> 00:20:03,241
We are the closest to each other.

249
00:20:03,321 --> 00:20:04,417
Therefore, there's no need for you...

250
00:20:04,497 --> 00:20:06,732
to throw tantrums at me
because of some unimportant persons.

251
00:20:06,812 --> 00:20:08,973
Someone I had a crush on was
not an unimportant person.

252
00:20:09,464 --> 00:20:10,894
Just because we grew up together,

253
00:20:10,974 --> 00:20:13,229
it doesn't give you the right
to interfere in my relationship.

254
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:14,413
No.

255
00:20:14,493 --> 00:20:16,169
I was just trying to
pick the right guy for you.

256
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:17,285
What am I to you?

257
00:20:17,365 --> 00:20:18,577
Your rag doll?

258
00:20:18,657 --> 00:20:20,476
Do you actually know what you did wrong?

259
00:20:20,556 --> 00:20:23,668
Even my parents
don't control me like this.

260
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,483
Mom.

261
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,891
Mom.

262
00:20:31,616 --> 00:20:33,873
Don't allow any outsider
into my room anymore.

263
00:20:33,953 --> 00:20:36,614
What's wrong with you?
Mo is not an outsider.

264
00:20:38,622 --> 00:20:40,793
She is so grumpy.

265
00:20:40,874 --> 00:20:42,781
-I hope she didn't scare you.
-Of course, not.

266
00:20:42,861 --> 00:20:45,031
-I have seen every face of hers.
-You're right.

267
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:47,907
-Let me peel an egg for her.
-Let me do it.

268
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,901
Look at the both of you.
You grew up together.

269
00:20:50,981 --> 00:20:52,141
Why is she nothing like you?

270
00:20:52,221 --> 00:20:54,474
I wish she could be
half as mature as you.

271
00:21:00,518 --> 00:21:01,800
So annoying.

272
00:21:21,726 --> 00:21:23,275
Why do you look blank?

273
00:21:32,596 --> 00:21:33,731
How do you like it?

274
00:21:35,439 --> 00:21:37,279
I can taste the sweetness
after the bitterness.

275
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:40,797
That's why they say
life is just like a cup of tea.

276
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,201
It's been a long time
since I last met you.

277
00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:49,605
You haven't explained to me
what happened the last time?

278
00:21:51,939 --> 00:21:55,315
Didn't you text me all of a sudden...

279
00:21:55,395 --> 00:21:58,017
to tell me to leave the office?

280
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:02,106
Too many things have happened of late.

281
00:22:02,186 --> 00:22:05,100
It felt like it was a long time ago.

282
00:22:06,051 --> 00:22:07,088
Lu,

283
00:22:07,586 --> 00:22:08,924
are you all right?

284
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:13,884
Perhaps I've been too occupied with work.

285
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,083
Speaking of work,

286
00:22:17,163 --> 00:22:21,336
the senior you met
at the tea house last time...

287
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:23,328
is Jiang Yicheng.

288
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,448
He is the founder of Enchant Technology.

289
00:22:25,923 --> 00:22:28,586
He gave me a call just to ask about you.

290
00:22:29,105 --> 00:22:30,395
Do you know each other?

291
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:34,628
I'm working at Enchant now.

292
00:22:35,796 --> 00:22:40,104
In fact, I sent you a text
because of him as well.

293
00:22:50,255 --> 00:22:51,438
Look at you.

294
00:22:52,307 --> 00:22:55,763
You even disguised as a man.

295
00:22:57,614 --> 00:22:59,166
They say you're stubborn.

296
00:22:59,246 --> 00:23:01,192
I think you're more than just stubborn.

297
00:23:01,272 --> 00:23:03,199
You're foolish.

298
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:06,027
Are you calling me a fool?

299
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,788
These days, the world is
full of intelligent people.

300
00:23:10,868 --> 00:23:12,431
In order to achieve a goal,

301
00:23:12,834 --> 00:23:14,677
what we lack is usually not intelligence,

302
00:23:14,757 --> 00:23:17,556
but this foolishness.

303
00:23:18,417 --> 00:23:19,479
That's nice.

304
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:20,485
Initially,

305
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,655
I wanted to recommend you
to work for their company.

306
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:25,581
Anyway, it has now ended up
the way I wanted it to.

307
00:23:26,946 --> 00:23:29,717
Professor, do you know Li Man?

308
00:23:29,797 --> 00:23:31,191
Of course.

309
00:23:31,271 --> 00:23:32,866
She was one of my students.

310
00:23:33,373 --> 00:23:36,447
There aren't many girls in
the faculty of computer science.

311
00:23:36,527 --> 00:23:39,101
Not only is she a pretty girl,
but she's also a smart one.

312
00:23:39,181 --> 00:23:41,100
She left a very strong impression on me.

313
00:23:42,477 --> 00:23:44,156
Why did you bring her up all of a sudden?

314
00:23:45,452 --> 00:23:47,596
I heard gossip in the office.

315
00:23:47,935 --> 00:23:51,165
It's said that
she used to date Mr. Jiang.

316
00:23:54,265 --> 00:23:55,581
Yes.

317
00:23:56,173 --> 00:23:57,938
During their college days,

318
00:23:58,018 --> 00:24:01,224
they were a famous couple on campus.

319
00:24:02,134 --> 00:24:06,177
I thought they would end up together.

320
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:09,771
What a pity.

321
00:24:09,851 --> 00:24:11,716
Li Man left the country later.

322
00:24:12,758 --> 00:24:13,844
Yes.

323
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,816
That incident has
hit Yicheng particularly hard.

324
00:24:18,592 --> 00:24:19,872
Because of Li Man,

325
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,788
he ran into a car accident.

326
00:24:23,217 --> 00:24:26,243
I was worried
that he wouldn't recover from it.

327
00:24:27,636 --> 00:24:29,502
Fortunately, he got over it.

328
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:36,151
It seems like he genuinely liked her.

329
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,546
By the way,

330
00:24:39,997 --> 00:24:43,489
you somewhat share a resemblance
with Li Man.

331
00:24:44,388 --> 00:24:45,810
How so?

332
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,006
Look.

333
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:50,285
Both of you are different from Yicheng,
the genius.

334
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:52,002
Both of you work very hard.

335
00:24:52,082 --> 00:24:53,865
Once you set your goal,

336
00:24:53,945 --> 00:24:56,498
you will keep moving forward
and never give up.

337
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:57,660
Besides,

338
00:24:58,127 --> 00:25:01,259
both your names have "Li".

339
00:25:02,116 --> 00:25:03,918
What a coincidence, right?

340
00:25:05,264 --> 00:25:07,116
Yes. It really is.

341
00:25:35,152 --> 00:25:36,768
Why are you on leave again?

342
00:25:36,848 --> 00:25:38,210
What's wrong?

343
00:25:39,326 --> 00:25:41,863
Leader Zhang, our companies
are working together...

344
00:25:41,943 --> 00:25:43,584
to develop "Xuan Zhong Ji".

345
00:25:43,664 --> 00:25:45,501
I hope we can be more considerate
of each other.

346
00:25:45,581 --> 00:25:47,270
Without this server,

347
00:25:47,572 --> 00:25:50,224
our team will not be able
to work normally.

348
00:25:50,304 --> 00:25:51,380
Miss Li.

349
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,188
Our company specially assigned this server
to our team.

350
00:25:55,268 --> 00:25:57,802
If you need anything,
you can request it from the company.

351
00:25:57,882 --> 00:26:00,439
-First come first serve.
-Precisely.

352
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:02,703
Your team's name
is not written on the server.

353
00:26:02,783 --> 00:26:03,740
Exactly.

354
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,388
If it's on
a first come first serve basis,

355
00:26:05,468 --> 00:26:07,147
I received the parcel.

356
00:26:07,227 --> 00:26:08,418
I unboxed it.

357
00:26:08,498 --> 00:26:10,511
Look at the paper cuts on my hands.

358
00:26:10,591 --> 00:26:12,040
You snatched it from us.

359
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,029
Snatched?

360
00:26:13,109 --> 00:26:15,032
This has always belonged to us.

361
00:26:15,112 --> 00:26:17,450
To be honest, we applied
for a server a long time ago.

362
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,618
It's true that it will
take some time to arrive.

363
00:26:19,698 --> 00:26:21,646
The server belongs to the company.

364
00:26:21,726 --> 00:26:23,662
It should be provided
to those who need it more.

365
00:26:23,742 --> 00:26:24,782
Miss Li.

366
00:26:24,862 --> 00:26:28,500
It's not that we don't want to give up
the server, but our team needs it too.

367
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,460
Miss Li. Stop arguing with them.

368
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,043
Let's talk to Mr. Jiang directly.

369
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:35,368
The only thing these people know
is to sneak on others.

370
00:26:35,448 --> 00:26:36,988
Who's sneaking on whom?
Who are you talking about?

371
00:26:37,068 --> 00:26:38,156
Who are you talking about?

372
00:26:38,236 --> 00:26:40,009
-What's with the fuss?
-I'm talking about you.

373
00:26:40,089 --> 00:26:41,943
What's wrong? What are you doing?

374
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:44,335
You only know how to sneak on others.

375
00:26:44,415 --> 00:26:45,599
Hit me, then.

376
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,135
Stop yelling.

377
00:26:47,215 --> 00:26:48,497
He's the one who's being unreasonable.

378
00:26:48,577 --> 00:26:49,892
Miss Li, aren't you going to stop them?

379
00:26:49,972 --> 00:26:51,352
Stop.

380
00:26:52,297 --> 00:26:53,468
Stop.

381
00:27:04,187 --> 00:27:05,521
Sit down.

382
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,225
This is not going to solve anything.

383
00:27:14,305 --> 00:27:16,337
Since neither of the parties
wants to give in,

384
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:17,619
we should compete for it.

385
00:27:17,699 --> 00:27:18,834
Do you want to fight?

386
00:27:18,914 --> 00:27:20,606
-Sure. Let's fight.
-Yes.

387
00:27:21,096 --> 00:27:23,846
We are programmers
and we don't solve issues with violence.

388
00:27:23,926 --> 00:27:25,955
We are going to fight with keyboards.

389
00:27:26,035 --> 00:27:29,396
Whatever it is,
our team will certainly beat you.

390
00:27:29,476 --> 00:27:30,549
Keep boasting.

391
00:27:30,629 --> 00:27:31,822
We'll find out.

392
00:27:33,525 --> 00:27:34,723
Miss Li.

393
00:27:34,803 --> 00:27:36,570
What do you think about my suggestion?

394
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,017
How are we going to do this?

395
00:27:39,422 --> 00:27:40,444
We'll use the airplanes.

396
00:27:47,477 --> 00:27:49,592
Her words are truly horrifying.

397
00:27:49,672 --> 00:27:51,685
How are we going to do this?

398
00:27:51,765 --> 00:27:54,405
Are you saying we should have a match...

399
00:27:54,485 --> 00:27:56,146
to find out who writes the best program
to control the airplanes?

400
00:27:56,226 --> 00:27:58,191
AI is the soul of a game.

401
00:27:58,271 --> 00:27:59,857
However smart humans are,

402
00:27:59,937 --> 00:28:02,468
we are no match for Alpha Go.

403
00:28:02,548 --> 00:28:05,719
Perhaps we should write an AI program.

404
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:07,189
What are the details?

405
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:11,106
Firstly, there will be 100 auto-generated
enemy aircraft in the game.

406
00:28:11,186 --> 00:28:14,515
They will be circling the area
on random routes.

407
00:28:14,595 --> 00:28:18,247
Both of the teams will appoint someone
to write an AI program...

408
00:28:18,327 --> 00:28:19,688
for aircraft of the same model.

409
00:28:19,768 --> 00:28:22,130
Within a certain time frame,

410
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:24,643
we need to prevent our aircraft
from being crashed,

411
00:28:24,723 --> 00:28:27,394
and in the meantime, bring down as many
enemy aircraft as possible.

412
00:28:27,911 --> 00:28:29,011
Those are the rules.

413
00:28:30,666 --> 00:28:32,535
Miss Li, what do you think?

414
00:28:32,615 --> 00:28:34,596
Do you agree with this idea?

415
00:28:34,676 --> 00:28:36,295
-We accept it.
-Okay.

416
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:37,800
Well. We will send...

417
00:28:37,881 --> 00:28:39,582
-This guy.
-Miss Li.

418
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,451
I heard that
you were also a top student...

419
00:28:41,531 --> 00:28:43,938
who graduated from the Computer Science
Faculty of the University of Xinhai.

420
00:28:44,018 --> 00:28:45,367
Let's have a one-on-one.

421
00:28:47,198 --> 00:28:49,215
It's been a long time
since I last did coding.

422
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:51,886
I'm no longer familiar with the keyboard.

423
00:28:55,126 --> 00:28:57,844
If Miss Li refuses to accept
the one-on-one,

424
00:29:02,726 --> 00:29:04,264
you should just surrender.

425
00:29:12,115 --> 00:29:13,900
Although I'm no longer familiar with it,

426
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,976
I still have the foundation.

427
00:29:16,056 --> 00:29:19,086
It will only take me a while
to get used to it.

428
00:29:19,166 --> 00:29:21,326
After all, it's an invitation
from my junior.

429
00:29:21,406 --> 00:29:22,637
I dare not reject it.

430
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,639
Let's do this.

431
00:29:29,606 --> 00:29:32,769
Since both of you have agreed to this,
let me read out the rules.

432
00:29:32,849 --> 00:29:35,166
You will be allowed two hours
to complete the coding.

433
00:29:35,246 --> 00:29:36,356
When you're done with the coding,

434
00:29:36,436 --> 00:29:39,759
the aircraft of both parties
will be launched at the same time.

435
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:41,611
It will last for five minutes.

436
00:29:41,691 --> 00:29:43,849
Whoever shoots down
the most number of aircraft...

437
00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:45,738
will be the winner.

438
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:46,862
Start.

439
00:30:09,636 --> 00:30:12,343
Miss Li does have a decent typing speed.

440
00:30:12,423 --> 00:30:15,324
She said that she hadn't
been doing this frequently.

441
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,655
Being humble doesn't make one weak.

442
00:30:17,735 --> 00:30:19,222
This is her strategy.

443
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:23,859
Shutian, who do you think
will be the winner?

444
00:30:23,939 --> 00:30:25,629
When you're writing an AI program,

445
00:30:25,709 --> 00:30:27,646
the most important thing
is decision-making.

446
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:29,069
It's just like a chess game.

447
00:30:29,149 --> 00:30:31,006
Every environmental factor
in the present...

448
00:30:31,086 --> 00:30:33,161
will affect their next decisions.

449
00:30:33,241 --> 00:30:35,876
The primary decision in this AI program...

450
00:30:35,956 --> 00:30:38,017
is about how to bring down
as many planes as possible...

451
00:30:38,097 --> 00:30:40,796
within a limited time.

452
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:44,182
If one doesn't understand
the goal thoroughly,

453
00:30:44,506 --> 00:30:47,013
this will lead to one
making wrong decisions.

454
00:30:47,859 --> 00:30:49,051
And then?

455
00:30:49,131 --> 00:30:50,470
And then, keep watching.

456
00:30:51,128 --> 00:30:52,886
I think Lu...

457
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,162
Lu's coding is too simple.

458
00:30:55,242 --> 00:30:57,536
It seems like there are
a lot of loopholes.

459
00:30:57,616 --> 00:30:58,724
That's not good.

460
00:30:58,804 --> 00:31:00,052
Let me remind her.

461
00:31:00,564 --> 00:31:01,780
It's too late now.

462
00:31:05,058 --> 00:31:06,940
Old Ape.

463
00:31:10,837 --> 00:31:11,973
All right.

464
00:31:12,309 --> 00:31:13,962
Time's up.

465
00:31:14,042 --> 00:31:16,041
Please leave the keyboard.

466
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:18,874
Both of you have completed the coding.

467
00:31:18,954 --> 00:31:25,011
Now, please launch your aircraft
into the space.

468
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,389
Five minutes, starting in...

469
00:31:28,911 --> 00:31:31,577
three, two, one.

470
00:31:31,917 --> 00:31:32,948
Start!

471
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,003
The Health Point of Lu's aircraft
is seeing a steep fall.

472
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:54,404
Yes.

473
00:31:56,258 --> 00:31:57,412
Done.

474
00:32:05,043 --> 00:32:06,115
She lost.

475
00:32:08,235 --> 00:32:09,437
Yicheng.

476
00:32:10,819 --> 00:32:12,235
Mr. Jiang...

477
00:32:12,315 --> 00:32:13,661
It's not the end yet.

478
00:32:13,741 --> 00:32:15,501
-Lu will not necessarily lose.
-Exactly.

479
00:32:15,581 --> 00:32:17,145
Facts speak louder than words.

480
00:32:17,225 --> 00:32:18,732
Just admit defeat.

481
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:20,764
Why are you being so mean?

482
00:32:20,844 --> 00:32:22,138
You are the loser.

483
00:32:22,218 --> 00:32:24,469
No. Mr. Jiang...

484
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:25,893
I think you're mistaken.

485
00:32:25,973 --> 00:32:27,539
The Health Point of Miss Li's aircraft...

486
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:30,308
and the number of the aircraft she shot
down are both ahead of her opponent's.

487
00:32:30,388 --> 00:32:31,328
Exactly.

488
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:33,932
However, her robot is acting
too aggressively.

489
00:32:34,606 --> 00:32:35,506
No...

490
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:36,914
Isn't it good to be aggressive?

491
00:32:36,994 --> 00:32:39,201
When you're designing
the strategy of an AI,

492
00:32:39,281 --> 00:32:40,993
you can't focus only on the AI itself.

493
00:32:41,073 --> 00:32:43,870
You need to also take into account
its surroundings.

494
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,341
The enemies in the game...

495
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:47,530
know how to evaluate
the strength of their opponents.

496
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:49,940
The stronger their opponents are,

497
00:32:50,317 --> 00:32:52,948
the more the fear.
They might even run away

498
00:32:53,028 --> 00:32:54,706
to find a weaker opponent.

499
00:32:59,658 --> 00:33:00,767
Indeed.

500
00:33:00,847 --> 00:33:02,060
It's getting more and more difficult...

501
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,402
for Miss Li's aircraft to
get near to the enemy aircraft.

502
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,271
They are now approaching
Lu Li's aircraft,

503
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:07,569
the one with lesser Health Point.

504
00:33:07,649 --> 00:33:09,696
But, Lu's aircraft has
too little Health Point.

505
00:33:09,776 --> 00:33:11,851
It seems like it's going to crash soon.

506
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:13,051
Look at the time.

507
00:33:13,131 --> 00:33:14,236
Even if the aircraft crashes,

508
00:33:14,316 --> 00:33:16,255
it won't leave the opponent
much time too.

509
00:33:16,687 --> 00:33:18,170
You're right.

510
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:21,241
The goal of this game
is not to defend the aircraft,

511
00:33:21,321 --> 00:33:24,129
but to bring down more enemies
within five minutes.

512
00:33:24,973 --> 00:33:28,222
She intentionally lowered
her aircraft's Health Point.

513
00:33:28,302 --> 00:33:31,750
She acted weak to get
the enemy aircraft to approach her,

514
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:34,357
and with that, to achieve more kills.

515
00:33:34,742 --> 00:33:36,822
She's willing to
sacrifice her aircraft for this.

516
00:33:36,902 --> 00:33:38,933
Lu is really smart.

517
00:33:39,013 --> 00:33:40,302
Well done.

518
00:33:40,382 --> 00:33:41,740
We'll definitely lose.

519
00:33:42,464 --> 00:33:44,001
What are you talking about?

520
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:46,860
(Final score: Li Man 35, Lu Li 39)

521
00:33:47,796 --> 00:33:49,203
39, 35.

522
00:33:49,283 --> 00:33:51,498
We won.

523
00:33:51,578 --> 00:33:52,985
I'm sweating.

524
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:54,861
Me too. It was really a tight match.

525
00:33:54,941 --> 00:33:57,244
You won. Good job.

526
00:34:00,352 --> 00:34:03,210
Those weren't flaws, but baits.

527
00:34:03,874 --> 00:34:05,266
I lost the game.

528
00:34:05,346 --> 00:34:06,703
You beat me fair and square.

529
00:34:06,783 --> 00:34:09,017
There are only a handful of people
who have beaten Miss Li fair and square.

530
00:34:09,097 --> 00:34:10,130
Koala Lu.

531
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,481
You made me proud.

532
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,375
It's just winning a game.

533
00:34:14,455 --> 00:34:17,400
Let's see who has the last laugh.

534
00:34:17,896 --> 00:34:20,693
The one who has the last laugh
is not necessarily the winner.

535
00:34:20,773 --> 00:34:21,946
She could be the clown too.

536
00:34:22,468 --> 00:34:23,440
Miss Li,

537
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,659
what you said just now
doesn't quite make sense.

538
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:28,078
Winning this game is important too.

539
00:34:28,158 --> 00:34:32,010
For now, this server belongs to us.

540
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:34,215
Don't worry. We will
make good use of it, right?

541
00:34:34,296 --> 00:34:36,001
-Yes.
-We'll make good use of it.

542
00:34:37,055 --> 00:34:40,049
Miss Li's team will take the server.

543
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,752
Mr. Jiang, we made a deal.

544
00:34:45,832 --> 00:34:47,645
The winner gets the server.

545
00:34:47,725 --> 00:34:51,028
Besides, we need it
to develop "Xuan Zhong Ji".

546
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:55,578
I'm here to inform you...

547
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:59,940
that you are no longer needed
in the development of "Xuan Zhong Ji".

548
00:35:02,187 --> 00:35:03,488
Why?

549
00:35:05,072 --> 00:35:07,500
I have other arrangements for you.

550
00:35:07,858 --> 00:35:08,875
Besides,

551
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:11,188
although you're given permission
to use the server,

552
00:35:11,268 --> 00:35:13,239
you have to work in the conference room.

553
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,333
Then, you can each mind
your own business.

554
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:16,633
Mr. Jiang,

555
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,530
didn't you say that you'd appoint Lu
as the lead programmer?

556
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:24,563
Moreover, Lu has always been the one
liaising with the other departments.

557
00:35:24,643 --> 00:35:26,274
You're removing her from the team
all of a sudden.

558
00:35:26,354 --> 00:35:27,650
Is this...

559
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,189
This is the company's decision.

560
00:35:29,269 --> 00:35:30,828
Lu Li will represent the company...

561
00:35:30,908 --> 00:35:33,782
and take part in the Game Design
Competition held by Netfalse.

562
00:35:37,187 --> 00:35:39,278
Mr. Jiang, I need to talk to you.

563
00:35:41,919 --> 00:35:43,082
Come to my office.

564
00:35:50,297 --> 00:35:51,843
That... I'm sorry.

565
00:35:52,305 --> 00:35:54,146
We'll head to the conference room.

566
00:35:54,226 --> 00:35:56,394
Remember to send it to us later.

567
00:35:56,474 --> 00:35:58,306
-Take care.
-Good job.

568
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,540
Miss Li.

569
00:36:06,442 --> 00:36:08,257
About that server...

570
00:36:08,337 --> 00:36:10,577
We'll send it to you later.

571
00:36:11,341 --> 00:36:12,430
Thanks.

572
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:14,470
It's okay.

573
00:36:17,501 --> 00:36:19,166
I can't accept this.

574
00:36:19,246 --> 00:36:20,533
I have accepted this.

575
00:36:21,101 --> 00:36:23,128
What happened to
all your physical training?

576
00:36:25,484 --> 00:36:26,645
Mr. Jiang.

577
00:36:26,725 --> 00:36:28,441
When did you make this decision?

578
00:36:28,521 --> 00:36:30,418
Why haven't you mentioned it before?

579
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:33,565
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

580
00:36:33,645 --> 00:36:34,585
Can I help you?

581
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:37,699
I need to talk to you about work.

582
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:38,973
Wait a minute.

583
00:36:39,053 --> 00:36:40,126
Sure.

584
00:36:45,109 --> 00:36:47,442
The Netfalse competition doesn't have
a specific theme.

585
00:36:47,522 --> 00:36:49,627
Someone will send you
the complete rules later.

586
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,522
The company only asks for one thing.

587
00:36:51,602 --> 00:36:53,136
You have to get the champion.

588
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:55,853
Mr. Jiang.

589
00:36:56,243 --> 00:36:57,669
I think it will be better...

590
00:36:57,749 --> 00:36:59,564
if you can assign this task
to another colleague.

591
00:36:59,644 --> 00:37:01,605
I wish to continue my current job...

592
00:37:01,685 --> 00:37:02,969
and participate in the development
of "Xuan Zhong Ji".

593
00:37:03,049 --> 00:37:04,562
This is the company's decision.

594
00:37:04,642 --> 00:37:06,106
You shall just follow the orders.

595
00:37:06,587 --> 00:37:08,963
I'll get colleagues
from other departments to help you out.

596
00:37:09,043 --> 00:37:10,396
He's right, Lu Li.

597
00:37:10,476 --> 00:37:12,715
Netfalse has promised
to provide talented projects...

598
00:37:12,795 --> 00:37:15,375
with incubator resources
and financial support.

599
00:37:15,455 --> 00:37:18,048
Besides, this contest
is the best and the fastest way...

600
00:37:18,128 --> 00:37:19,547
to make our company's name known.

601
00:37:19,627 --> 00:37:21,230
If you can get the first place,

602
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:24,499
many companies in this industry
will notice Enchant Technology.

603
00:37:25,016 --> 00:37:28,844
This can also help Yicheng
in winning more investors over.

604
00:37:32,223 --> 00:37:34,619
Yicheng is working so hard
to win all the investors over,

605
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:37,686
because he wants to
free himself from his parents.

606
00:37:37,766 --> 00:37:39,426
He doesn't want to be threatened...

607
00:37:39,506 --> 00:37:43,072
to make another choice that
he'll regret later.

608
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:48,154
You want me to take part in the
competition to earn more investment.

609
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,732
This is part of the reason.

610
00:37:53,038 --> 00:37:56,024
The most important thing is
with "Xuan Zhong Ji",

611
00:37:56,104 --> 00:37:58,552
you've already proven your ability
in planning and creating.

612
00:37:58,632 --> 00:37:59,973
Therefore, I hope that...

613
00:38:09,251 --> 00:38:10,705
Why was Lu Li running away?

614
00:38:11,733 --> 00:38:12,981
I was about to ask you.

615
00:38:13,061 --> 00:38:14,820
Why is her temper
getting worse and worse?

616
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,569
This is between you and her.

617
00:38:16,649 --> 00:38:17,811
You shall settle it at home.

618
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,696
Lu Li is too young.

619
00:38:19,776 --> 00:38:21,421
She doesn't know how to separate work
from her personal life.

620
00:38:21,501 --> 00:38:23,047
You need to talk to her nicely.

621
00:38:23,127 --> 00:38:25,299
Was she listening to
what I said just now?

622
00:38:25,674 --> 00:38:27,443
I'll teach her a lesson when I get home.

623
00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:29,729
You can do it however you like.

624
00:38:30,252 --> 00:38:33,135
You don't have to explain
the details to us.

625
00:38:33,215 --> 00:38:34,366
I'm still single.

626
00:38:34,446 --> 00:38:35,512
I can't take this.

627
00:38:38,097 --> 00:38:39,333
Are you done?

628
00:38:42,799 --> 00:38:45,504
I'm here to talk to you
about the equipment.

629
00:38:45,584 --> 00:38:47,361
I guess I shall talk to the
administration department directly.

630
00:38:47,441 --> 00:38:48,584
You guys go ahead.

631
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,267
How can I help you?

632
00:38:59,919 --> 00:39:02,453
I heard that you removed Lu Li
from the "Xuan Zhong Ji" team.

633
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,214
You too.

634
00:39:05,031 --> 00:39:07,756
You promised her
that if her proposal was approved,

635
00:39:07,836 --> 00:39:09,177
you would make her the lead programmer.

636
00:39:09,257 --> 00:39:11,713
Since you have made a promise,
you shouldn't break it.

637
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,804
Do you think I really want to do this?

638
00:39:14,884 --> 00:39:16,854
EG was the one who was against this idea.

639
00:39:16,934 --> 00:39:18,309
Is this Li Man's idea?

640
00:39:19,293 --> 00:39:20,789
She is EG's representative.

641
00:39:21,447 --> 00:39:23,739
Her idea is the EG.

642
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,308
Lu Li indeed lacks experience.

643
00:39:27,388 --> 00:39:29,763
However, she came up with the core idea.

644
00:39:29,843 --> 00:39:32,064
She understands "Xuan Zhong Ji" the best.

645
00:39:32,144 --> 00:39:33,958
That's why I made a deal with Li Man.

646
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,742
As long as Lu Li wins
the Netfalse competition,

647
00:39:36,822 --> 00:39:39,630
EG won't oppose her being the lead
programmer of "Xuan Zhong Ji" again.

648
00:39:42,692 --> 00:39:44,577
Judging from Lu Li's expression,

649
00:39:44,657 --> 00:39:46,191
she has no idea about
what's actually going on.

650
00:39:46,271 --> 00:39:48,075
Why didn't you explain it to her?

651
00:39:48,646 --> 00:39:50,926
There was an outsider here.
I wasn't able to say anything.

652
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,721
What are you doing?

653
00:39:56,801 --> 00:39:58,248
What's with this sinister smile?

654
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:03,357
Refusing to communicate
and an ineffective communication...

655
00:40:03,437 --> 00:40:05,296
will bring about regrets.

656
00:40:05,964 --> 00:40:07,549
What's with all the philosophy?

657
00:40:08,708 --> 00:40:09,862
Figure it out yourself.

658
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:35,306
Rubbish. Rubbish. Rubbish.

659
00:40:35,386 --> 00:40:36,390
Xiaoqi.

660
00:40:36,761 --> 00:40:37,811
Who's there?

661
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:42,057
What are you doing here?

662
00:40:42,431 --> 00:40:43,958
You haven't been visiting me.

663
00:40:46,185 --> 00:40:47,692
Are you still angry with him?

664
00:40:49,356 --> 00:40:50,317
Imagine there's a guy...

665
00:40:50,409 --> 00:40:52,340
always interfering in your relationships,

666
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,120
how can you not be angry at him?

667
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,196
I always thought
my love radar was broken.

668
00:40:57,276 --> 00:40:59,897
It turns out it's his brain
that's broken.

669
00:41:01,903 --> 00:41:04,843
Have you ever wondered
why he is doing this?

670
00:41:04,923 --> 00:41:06,466
Of course, I know.

671
00:41:06,546 --> 00:41:08,624
Because he is a Scorpio.

672
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:18,501
You don't know
how insanely controlling he is.

673
00:41:18,581 --> 00:41:21,447
He came to my place today
and told me not to get angry...

674
00:41:21,527 --> 00:41:23,874
over some unimportant persons.

675
00:41:23,954 --> 00:41:25,217
You be the judge.

676
00:41:25,297 --> 00:41:27,271
Is that a decent thing to say?

677
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:29,688
My mom likes him so much.

678
00:41:29,768 --> 00:41:31,462
I'm angry every time
I'm reminded of this.

679
00:41:31,542 --> 00:41:33,973
I'm so angry.

680
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:39,525
Never mind. Let's not talk about him.

681
00:41:39,605 --> 00:41:41,460
By the way, have you taken your dinner?

682
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,013
-I haven't.
-Great.

683
00:41:43,093 --> 00:41:44,515
I can finally have a barbecue at home.

684
00:41:44,595 --> 00:41:45,910
I'm afraid that I might not be able
to finish it by myself,

685
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:46,866
and I dare not to order it.

686
00:41:46,946 --> 00:41:47,982
What do you want?

687
00:41:48,062 --> 00:41:49,571
Anything. You decide.

688
00:41:49,651 --> 00:41:50,512
Sure.

689
00:41:56,745 --> 00:41:58,043
You're here.

690
00:41:58,959 --> 00:42:01,330
Xiaoqi, what's wrong with the cat?

691
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:02,987
It doesn't seem like it's in a good mood.

692
00:42:03,067 --> 00:42:04,290
It's in estrus.

693
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:06,473
I've been looking for a partner for it.

694
00:42:07,303 --> 00:42:10,291
If you know any handsome male cats,
do let me know.

695
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,740
(Jiang Yicheng)

696
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,260
(Shut down)

697
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,325
Hi.

698
00:42:29,405 --> 00:42:34,447
The number you've dialed is unavailable.

699
00:42:34,826 --> 00:42:36,595
How dare she turn off her phone?

700
00:42:36,675 --> 00:42:37,823
It's okay if you don't want
to pick up the call,

701
00:42:37,903 --> 00:42:39,407
but how dare you turn off your phone?

702
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:40,796
Stupid Koala.

703
00:42:40,876 --> 00:42:42,470
You're always annoying me.

704
00:42:49,343 --> 00:42:50,418
Here.

705
00:42:51,526 --> 00:42:52,592
Here.

706
00:42:52,672 --> 00:42:54,638
Let's toast to our friendship.

707
00:43:00,149 --> 00:43:01,335
This is the best.

708
00:43:02,026 --> 00:43:05,162
Nothing beats
having a barbecue with my best friend.

709
00:43:05,735 --> 00:43:07,335
All the men can go to hell.

710
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:13,262
Wait a minute.

711
00:43:14,002 --> 00:43:15,986
You can't be drinking like this.

712
00:43:17,638 --> 00:43:18,873
I'm thirsty.

713
00:43:19,919 --> 00:43:21,439
You're smiling like this again.

714
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,898
You wear this smile
whenever you're pretending to be happy.

715
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,034
Li, what happened?

716
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:31,977
Did Jiang Yicheng bully you?

717
00:43:33,392 --> 00:43:34,424
No.

718
00:43:34,504 --> 00:43:37,168
Something happened at work.

719
00:43:37,248 --> 00:43:38,925
Work?

720
00:43:39,005 --> 00:43:40,386
Do you think I'll believe you?

721
00:43:40,466 --> 00:43:41,804
If it's just about work,

722
00:43:41,884 --> 00:43:43,703
you would be sitting
in front of the computer,

723
00:43:43,783 --> 00:43:45,951
analyzing your strength
and your weaknesses.

724
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:52,377
Did Jiang Yicheng and Li Man
get back together?

725
00:44:02,383 --> 00:44:04,789
The difference between
men and machines is that...

726
00:44:05,372 --> 00:44:07,520
men get manipulated by emotions.

727
00:44:08,246 --> 00:44:12,481
That's why we can't always be rational
like the machines.
