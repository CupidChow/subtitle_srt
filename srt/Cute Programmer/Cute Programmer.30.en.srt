Shutian?

22
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,680
Why are you here?

23
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:11,120
So, were you the one who stole
Xuan Zhong Ji's program?

24
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,999
Sorry.

25
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,200
Why did you do so?

26
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,519
It's the culmination of
everyone's effort, you know?

27
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,159
I know you guys are old colleagues,

28
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:22,120
and you have plenty to talk about,

29
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:25,719
but I think we should
get straight to business today.

30
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,560
Have a seat.

31
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:37,480
I think I'll leave first.

32
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:49,960
Great tea.

33
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,320
Even after such a huge incident,

34
00:02:54,999 --> 00:02:57,040
Mr. Jiang is as calm as always.

35
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,799
You surprise me indeed.

36
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,600
I just don't know

37
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,919
whether you're calm
or you're pretending to be calm.

38
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,719
Even if one game is finished,

39
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,719
I can make a second,
or even a third game.

40
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:11,120
Because I'm that capable,

41
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,079
unlike some losers.

42
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:17,359
They only know how to steal
the fruits of other people's labour

43
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,519
and earn money from that.

44
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,240
Naturally, they won't understand.

45
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,600
Jiang Yicheng,

46
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,040
I do admit that you're capable.

47
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,439
But you shouldn't
get ahead of yourself.

48
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:28,200
For the past few years, none of
the games your company has developed

49
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:30,519
can win against us.

50
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,359
Speaking of which,

51
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,480
I think I should thank you

52
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,560
for selling Dream Maker to me back then.

53
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,320
That has established a solid foundation

54
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,719
for my company's development.

55
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,159
It's a pity that you've broken
the game's balance

56
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:45,480
and shortened its life span

57
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,279
just to make more money out of it.

58
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,840
The biggest regret in my life

59
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,519
was to sell the game to you.

60
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,639
Video games are just products.

61
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,919
My only concern

62
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:58,840
is to get the most money out of it.

63
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,600
You've sold Dream Maker to me.

64
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,279
So, it still exists.

65
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,279
If, it was managed under your concept,

66
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:05,840
it would have an even shorter life span.

67
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,159
What about Sanctuary?

68
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,480
You stole Sanctuary's source code.

69
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:14,400
But within three years,

70
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:16,639
the number of monthly active users

71
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,919
had decreased by three-fourths.

72
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,079
It's fine that you aren't
learning from your lesson.

73
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,240
Instead, you're using
the same trick again.

74
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,039
You continued to steal
the fruits of other people's labour.

75
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,199
You were a programmer.

76
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
Don't you feel ashamed of yourself?

77
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,199
Yeah.

78
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,440
I was a programmer.

79
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,519
That's why I know it's useless

80
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,479
no matter how much effort
a programmer puts in.

81
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,599
The most important thing is to
adapt yourself to the market.

82
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,199
You won't be able to succeed
if you only have your dreams with you.

83
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,599
This world isn't built on
technology and skills.

84
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:54,240
This world is built on capital.

85
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,039
Everything you see is a game of capital.

86
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,319
Forget it.

87
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:00,280
It's meaningless for us
to continue this conversation.

88
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,280
What I've done behind your back
doesn't matter,

89
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:05,639
since you're going to lose anyway.

90
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:10,199
Although you've lost to me,

91
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,840
I do

92
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,680
admire your talent.

93
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,919
Give me a price. I'm willing to buy
Enchant Technology from you.

94
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,919
In your dreams.

95
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:24,519
Why don't you take a look
at the contract first?

96
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,039
According to my knowledge,

97
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,359
(Enchant Technology Purchasing Contract)
EG has invested a lot into Xuan Zhong Ji.

98
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,120
You can go bankrupt from paying
their compensation fee.

99
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:33,599
If you sign this contract,

100
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,880
I can negotiate the deal with them.

101
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:38,039
And, to show my sincerity,

102
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:41,359
I will allow you to
bring your entire team here.

103
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:43,799
You can continue to
develop Xuan Zhong Ji.

104
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,079
You're a rich man's son.

105
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,519
There's no need for you
to make a living.

106
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,639
You can leave the company all you like.

107
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:52,359
But what about your employees?

108
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:55,079
What else do they have
besides the company?

109
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,199
Although my words

110
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,960
might be a little offensive,

111
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,079
it's your best choice right now.

112
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:11,960
We will never sign this contract.

113
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,799
Who are you?

114
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,280
I'm one of Xuan Zhong Ji's developers.

115
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:19,519
Pleased to meet you.

116
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,280
So, what do you
think about the contract?

117
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,840
I don't have anything
to say about the contract.

118
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,400
But I have something against you.

119
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,199
Please enlighten me.

120
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,120
Our initial goal was to create

121
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,919
a game that could bring happiness
to the gamers

122
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:36,519
and make the world a better place.

123
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,720
You'll never be able to create a good
game if earning money is your only goal.

124
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,799
We will never let Xuan Zhong Ji

125
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,560
become the second
Dream Maker or Sanctuary.

126
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,359
We won't abandon our initial goal

127
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,240
because of business profits.

128
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:50,359
So, stop wasting your time.

129
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,960
Mr. Jiang,

130
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,519
don't tell me

131
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:56,759
you're going to listen to
an unimportant employee like her?

132
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:00,280
She's more than an unimportant employee.

133
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,359
I forgot to introduce her to you.

134
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:04,000
She's my wife.

135
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,840
My wife makes the call here.

136
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,400
She's right.

137
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,560
When we create games, we mustn't
forget about our initial goal.

138
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,680
So, I will never work together
with people like you.

139
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,240
Good luck then.

140
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:46,960
Why are you here?

141
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,639
You're here.

142
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,319
Come in.

143
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:58,479
Mr. Jiang.

144
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,479
They started their alpha testing at 12 PM.

145
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,880
There are almost one million people
in the game right now.

146
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,560
That's great.

147
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,359
So, you two have been putting on
an act all the time?

148
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,359
Of course.

149
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,079
Mr. Jiang is my idol.

150
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,799
How could I betray him?

151
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,240
Why did you do so?

152
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,319
How would I let him step into my trap
willingly if I didn't do so?

153
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:26,359
Why are you still standing there?

154
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,720
Come and sit down.

155
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,519
Come.

156
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:33,719
Shutian.

157
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,359
What's going on?

158
00:08:37,359 --> 00:08:37,919
It's not working.

159
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,120
My data!

160
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,560
What's going on?

161
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,640
I'm still uploading them, you know?

162
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,080
What should we do?

163
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,440
What's going on?

164
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:57,120
Mr. Xu,

165
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,359
the servers are overloading.

166
00:08:58,359 --> 00:08:59,719
The service had stopped.

167
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,039
Done.

168
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,320
What do you mean?

169
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,120
What have you guys done?

170
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:20,839
Before this,

171
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,120
I've set a command
to shut down the program

172
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,440
in the program that
they were going to steal.

173
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,640
The timer was set

174
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,000
to 12 PM, today.

175
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:30,599
So, did they find out?

176
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,240
I used obfuscated codes.

177
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,799
So, they...

178
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:34,760
I guess

179
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,320
they're panicking right now

180
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:39,159
due to the server overload.

181
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,680
How did you guys find out?

182
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,479
Shutian,

183
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:46,680
you can answer your lady boss.

184
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,200
I'll go and wash the dishes.

185
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:54,479
So, Mr. Jiang still needs to
do the dishes at home.

186
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,640
It's tough getting married indeed.

187
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,000
Let's return to the topic.

188
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,520
Actually, one day,

189
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,120
I fought with someone in a cybercafe.

190
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:07,159
Now, there are two solutions

191
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,200
to this issue.

192
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,120
First,

193
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,520
we will sue you for intentional assault.

194
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:16,039
Not only will you
pay for his medical fee,

195
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:17,839
but you will also face
the risk of being imprisoned.

196
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:20,000
As for the second choice,

197
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,440
you can just do me a favour.

198
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,039
If you do so, this issue
will be resolved without a problem.

199
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,120
So, did you guys set me up?

200
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,159
Do you have any evidence?

201
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,839
Despicable.

202
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:35,799
What do you think?

203
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,599
So, are you interested in
working for Chendong?

204
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,440
Scram.

205
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,919
Little boy,

206
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,919
you shouldn't reject me in such a hurry.

207
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,959
How about this?

208
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:46,880
I will

209
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:49,359
give you 24 hours to consider.

210
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You can call me when
you've made your decision.

211
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,200
(Xu Yuanzhi)
Don't let me down, all right?

212
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,320
So, you went to Chongqing last time

213
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,120
to tell Jiang Yicheng about this matter.

214
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,120
Of course.

215
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,359
Do you think I'm that free

216
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,159
to fly all the way there
just to support you?

217
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,080
So, you just bet everything on it

218
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,599
without any hesitations at all?

219
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:12,959
Yeah.

220
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:15,359
When I'm in trouble, I'll find my boss.

221
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,020
(Chendong Technology Co. Ltd.)

222
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,940
(Chendong Gaming Scandal!
Sanctuary's Stolen Source Code)

223
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,839
Xu Yuanzhi was removed from his post.

224
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,159
That fast?

225
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,000
Because I exposed him
for stealing our source code.

226
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:03,799
He made a huge error, and
adding the scandal into consideration,

227
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:07,799
the company will surely kick him out
to protect the company's interest.

228
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,080
So, you got the evidence

229
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,359
to prove he stole
Sanctuary's source code long ago.

230
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:13,479
Why are you only exposing him by now?

231
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,399
I'm not doing this to cover up
for Li Man's father.

232
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:18,279
I was just waiting for a chance.

233
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,159
I wanted to wait until I could
utilise the condition fully.

234
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,959
For people like Xu Yuanzhi,

235
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,719
if you don't defeat him in one blow,

236
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,560
he'll make a comeback.

237
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,520
But now, it seems like

238
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,240
he's done for.

239
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,080
This is such a huge matter.

240
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,000
Why are you only telling me by now?

241
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:40,719
I couldn't eat well for
the past few days, you know?

242
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:43,719
I told you already.

243
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:47,320
I told you that Heaven would punish him.

244
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:49,919
How could someone be
as narcissistic as you?

245
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,479
You're actually comparing
yourself to Heaven.

246
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,680
Lu Li is here as well.

247
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,240
Don't be shy.

248
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,560
We can discuss my affair tomorrow.

249
00:13:02,719 --> 00:13:03,880
Wait.

250
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,719
Did you know about the deal
with Xu Yuanzhi long ago?

251
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,120
I didn't know at all.

252
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,320
If I did know,

253
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,359
there was no need for me to work
overtime to come up with a solution.

254
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,880
Didn't you work overtime
to hide the situation

255
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,039
so that Chendong
could let down their guard?

256
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,959
I surrender.

257
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,760
Your husband forbade me from saying it.

258
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,919
The male leads in dramas

259
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:30,399
always show their trump cards
at the very last second.

260
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,880
Don't you think
staging a reversal like this

261
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:34,959
makes me more charming?

262
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:39,640
You're really childish.

263
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,719
But why are you here?

264
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:47,440
I just want to ask you

265
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,440
why Zitong hasn't come to work lately.

266
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,320
I thought you said so yourself.

267
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,200
You said you'll be together with her

268
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,240
once she finds her passion.

269
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:58,240
That's why she's searching everywhere
to find her passion.

270
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,240
What?

271
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,279
Are you regretting your decision?

272
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,880
Since I've given her my words,
I won't regret it.

273
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,599
It seems like you're ready
to be my brother-in-law.

274
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:15,240
Be a good boy
and call me Brother-in-law then.

275
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:17,240
Call me Sister-in-law.

276
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:23,799
Brother-in-law.

277
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,560
Sister-in-law.

278
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,880
Be serious.

279
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,000
Lu Li, send me Zitong's address.

280
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,039
All right.

281
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:37,520
Thanks.

282
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,839
I never expected that Jiang Zitong

283
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,799
to conquer him.

284
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:46,839
It's because perseverance is...

285
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,799
Perseverance is magical, right?

286
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,880
This feels great.

287
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,320
I'm finally full now.

288
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:25,120
I didn't eat since last night.

289
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,719
I was too busy.

290
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,440
Why don't we order more crayfish?

291
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:29,760
Sure.

292
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,479
Wait.

293
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:34,839
I think I'll have them after my break.

294
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,760
No need.

295
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,839
I'll be in a great mood
when I have my fill.

296
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:45,959
Only then,

297
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,320
I'll be able to show my best self

298
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,959
in front of the customers
during the opening day.

299
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,000
Opening day?

300
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,560
What do you mean?

301
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,240
I plan to open a fashion boutique.

302
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,200
So, is that your passion?

303
00:15:58,359 --> 00:15:59,520
Yeah.

304
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:02,240
After many trials and errors,

305
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,359
I can confirm that
shopping is my passion.

306
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:08,799
And, I'm very sensitive towards fashion.

307
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:10,880
I have extraordinary
fashion sense as well.

308
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,240
Isn't it a waste of my talent
if I don't open a fashion boutique?

309
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,320
So, all this while,

310
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:18,080
were you actually preparing for this?

311
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,279
That's right.

312
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,120
Although I'm very talented,

313
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,479
gorgeous,

314
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,240
and have a wealthy family,

315
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:28,399
I don't have much experience.

316
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,799
So, all this while,

317
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:31,560
I've visited
plenty of fashion boutiques.

318
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:34,240
And, I plan to study them.

319
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,279
I will study fashion design.

320
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:41,880
I'm pretty happy to see you
being this serious for once.

321
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:44,440
I was especially happy as well.

322
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,919
I didn't know it would feel this great

323
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,479
to have my own passion.

324
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,880
I think my life has never
been this fulfilling before.

325
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,080
Zitong,

326
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,919
actually, I've been thinking
about this for a while.

327
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,760
The thing that I promised to consider...

328
00:16:58,839 --> 00:16:59,719
Oh no!

329
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:01,279
What's wrong?

330
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,120
I need to hang the clothes that
I just bought immediately.

331
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,679
If not, they'll crinkle.

332

You should at least
let me finish my words.

333
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,359
Yiming,

334
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,599
we can talk about that next time.

335
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,559
Some of the clothes can't be ironed.

336
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,599
So, I mustn't delay this.

337
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:20,640
All right then.

338
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,760
We can talk about it next time.

339
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,160
Let's go.

340
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:28,280

(China Dinosaurs Park)
(Venture out to mysterious realm)

342
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,040
Don't tell me you brought me here

343
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,400
just to take these rides?

344
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:53,079
Of course not.

345
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,520
Even if you're not afraid,

346
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:56,400
our little koala is afraid, you know?

347
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,160
We're here to play this game.

348
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,400
This is the true alpha testing
of Xuan Zhong Ji.

349

350
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,520
We tried this before, right?

351
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:08,719
It was pretty interesting.

352
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:11,120
That's why we made this beta.

353
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,920
(Xuan Zhong Ji, Special Edition)
But this beta

354
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,040
won't be uploaded to the Internet.

355

you will even get additional rewards.

358
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,479
I saw a row of arrows.

359

360
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:26,240
Go now.

361
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,760
Aren't you joining me?

362
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,959
We have different missions.

363
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,599
I'll wait for you at the exit then.

431

Impossible.

I know.

434

being my boyfriend

437
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:26,520
I knew that it was just an excuse
for you to reject me.

438
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,719
It isn't an excuse.

439
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,160
I just want you to know

440
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,319
that this world is vast. Besides me,

441
00:27:34,479 --> 00:27:37,280
there are plenty of other things for you
to like and explore.

442
00:27:37,479 --> 00:27:39,679
Now, you've found your passion.

443
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:41,719
And, I've found my answer.

444
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:46,839
Zitong, are you willing
to be my girlfriend?

445
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,400
Of course!

446
00:27:55,479 --> 00:27:55,920
I do!

447
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,000
I do!

448
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,679
Calm down.

449
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,800
Calm down.

450

Do you know how many years

451
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,079
I've been waiting for this moment?

452
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,079
How could I calm down?

453
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:11,199
Did my makeup smear?

454
00:28:12,479 --> 00:28:15,520
I shouldn't wear this outfit today.

455
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,839
You look gorgeous right now.

456
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,599
Wait.

457
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,199
You won't regret it by tomorrow, right?

458
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:33,880
What nonsense are you saying?

459
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,359
No, I need to keep some evidence.

460
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,880
I'll post it on my Moments
and announce it to the world.

461
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,520
Don't try to go back on your words.

462
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:54,959
Why would I do so?

463
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,520
It's just that...

464
00:28:56,679 --> 00:28:58,679
What?

465
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,240
It's just that your kiss wasn't right.

466
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,599
Let me teach you how.

467
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,000
Jiang Yicheng, did you see?

468
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,000
Zitong finally won his heart.

469
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:51,559
I saw that.

470
00:29:51,719 --> 00:29:53,079
Darling, come and have dinner.

471
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:01,959
You lit so many candles.

472
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:04,000
Is there a power shortage?

473
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,000
Can you be romantic for once?

474
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,280
This is the candlelit dinner
I've prepared for you.

475
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,160
Why are you making it
so formal right now?

476
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:15,040
I thought you were the one
who said it first?

477
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,400
This is our first meal together.

478
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,400
We must commemorate it, right?

479
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:22,000
Have a seat.

480
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:36,920
So, you remembered it.

481
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:39,199
The instant noodles
we ate together don't count.

482
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:41,839
This is our first meal together
after our wedding.

483
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,120
Come.

484
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:46,400
Let's celebrate my success
in proposing to you.

485
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,640
But we've been married for a long time.

486
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:01,839
What happened in the past doesn't count.

487
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,800
Besides taking the wedding certificates,

488
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:08,040
I would like to replay
all of the other levels.

489
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,120
What else do you want to do?

490
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:13,719
According to the standard procedures,

491
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,760
marriage comes after the proposal.

492
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:18,000
We haven't held our wedding yet.

493
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,800
Can I discuss something with you?

494
00:31:21,199 --> 00:31:22,679
Don't tell me you don't want to hold it?

495
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:27,000
I think our marriage belongs
to both of us.

496
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,599
Compared with a busy and lively wedding,

497
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,959
I like this kind of wedding better.

498
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:31,719
It's a sense of ceremony
we acquire in life.

499
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,679
But this is my view.

500
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,079
If you wish to hold a wedding,
we can hold one then.

501
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:38,640
I just thought

502
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,599
that you wanted a romantic wedding,

503
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,479
since other girls wish
to have a romantic wedding.

504
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,079
If you don't want to hold it,

505
00:31:44,199 --> 00:31:46,439
don't be burdened by it then.
We won't hold the wedding.

506
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:48,920
Will Dad and Mum agree to this?

507
00:31:49,439 --> 00:31:51,000
My parents will be fine.

508
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,160
Next year

509
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:53,959
will be my parents'
30th wedding anniversary.

510
00:31:54,199 --> 00:31:56,160
We'll be fine as long as we do
a good job with that.

511
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,240
Eat up.

512
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,199
Mr. Jiang,

513
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,559
thank you.

514
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:09,000
Even if you don't decorate the room,

515
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,000
I could still feel your sincerity.

516
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:15,599
Happy wedding,

517
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:17,959
Mrs. Jiang.

518
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:25,839
Eat up.

519
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,520
Did you make this?

520
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:34,359
See if it's cooked.

521
00:32:42,479 --> 00:32:45,760
Jiang Yicheng, did you
use my face cream?

522
00:32:47,959 --> 00:32:49,079
What did you say?

523
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,920
Did you use my face cream?

524
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,760
My hands felt dry
as I was washing the vegetables.

525
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,599
That's why I used it.

526
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:54,640
Look.

527
00:32:57,439 --> 00:32:58,079
This...

528
00:32:58,199 --> 00:33:00,000
This is meant for your face,
not your hands.

529
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,520
What's the difference?

530
00:33:01,959 --> 00:33:04,000
What's the difference?
This is very expensive!

531
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,920
Zitong gave me this, you know?

532
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,959
I was wondering why

533
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,120
my hands became smoother.

534
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,719
You're not allowed to
touch my stuff in the future.

535
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:16,079
You weren't this concerned about
your beauty before.

536
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,679
What's wrong with you?

537
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:20,959
It's not that.

538
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:22,199
I heard people saying that
pregnant mothers

539
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:25,319
will have freckles when they're
more than four months pregnant.

540
00:33:25,719 --> 00:33:27,000
It's not that I'm very particular
about my face.

541
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,719
But I don't want to become ugly.

542
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,800
Enough.

543
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:31,479
You don't need to care so much about it.

544
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:33,040
It's not that expensive.

545
00:33:33,199 --> 00:33:34,959
If you like it,

546
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,319
I can buy more of them for you.

547
00:33:38,439 --> 00:33:42,240
And, you'll always be the most beautiful
woman in my heart.

548
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:44,199
What a smooth talker.

549
00:33:45,439 --> 00:33:47,160
You'll know whether I'm smooth or not

550
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,240
when you try it out.

551
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:56,280
Let me answer a call.

552

(Rose In Seasons, Garden Restaurant)

What do you want?
I'll order them for you.

556
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,040
Plain water is fine.

557
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,240
I heard that you're pregnant.

558
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,959
Congratulations.

559
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,040
Thank you.

560
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,840
I guess you were surprised, huh?

561
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,199
I do feel surprised.

562
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:53,479
It's because I don't know

563
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,399
what else is there for us to talk about.

564
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:00,719
I'm here to apologise.

565
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:02,879
I know. My father and I

566
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,439
have done

567
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,159
some terrible things to you.

568
00:35:10,439 --> 00:35:12,479
I hope you can forgive us.

569
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,959
I won't forgive you two,
but I'll let it go.

570
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,439
I understand.

571
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,719
I'm here today

572
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:35,159
to put down some of my burdens.

573
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:38,199
I know I'm being selfish.

574
00:35:38,959 --> 00:35:42,280
You're not obliged to cooperate with me.

575
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:45,840
So,

576
00:35:46,439 --> 00:35:49,000
does that mean you have moved on
from Jiang Yicheng?

577
00:35:51,439 --> 00:35:52,879
I didn't move on.

578
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:55,639
I'm the same as you.

579
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,840
I just let it go.

580
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:02,159
Before this,

581
00:36:02,479 --> 00:36:07,000
I did everything just to approach him.

582
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,639
So, it's quite difficult for me

583
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,560
to move on from him

584
00:36:11,399 --> 00:36:13,320
in such a short period.

585
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:19,080
Sometimes,

586
00:36:19,399 --> 00:36:23,439
you'll lose yourself easily
if you keep looking back.

587
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:25,399
Yeah.

588
00:36:26,399 --> 00:36:30,320
I think it was because
I kept looking back.

589
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,080
That's why I forgot

590
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:36,159
that better scenery
might appear in the future.

591
00:36:37,479 --> 00:36:39,399
After my father is released from prison,

592
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,959
I'll bring him abroad for his treatment.

593
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:46,439
This should be our last meeting.

594
00:36:50,399 --> 00:36:53,840
I hope you can find the one
you're looking for in the future.

595
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,360
Thank you.

596
00:36:58,879 --> 00:37:00,240
See you.

Why are you here?

598
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,679
Who told you to activate
my follow command?

599
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,919
I had no choice but to follow you here.

600
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,959
What are we having for dinner tonight?

601
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,040
(Rose In Seasons, Garden Restaurant)
What do you want to have for dinner?

602
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:33,439
You can choose.

603
00:37:33,879 --> 00:37:34,719
All right.

604
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:37,000
Let's walk around and see if
there's anything we want to eat.

605
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,520
There's a mall up ahead.

606
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,439
We can go and take a look.

607
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,520
They look blissful.

608
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,959
Miss Man, don't worry.
I'm still with you.

609
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:56,600
I'll follow you wherever you go.

610
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,600
Why are you treating me so well?

611
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,760
It's because you're
the direction of my life.

Don't tell me they ran away
at the very last second?

in a traffic jam.

Why are you two wearing that when you're
here to take your wedding certificate?

affect a youngster's growth?

Even the nutritious lunch that I've
prepared doesn't taste as good anymore.

Do you guys know what you're doing?

660

You guys are just plain jealous.

Actually, I have plenty of resources
on my hands.

00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,199
Why don't I introduce
some of them to you guys?

663
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:33,600
No thanks.

664
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,360
You girls are too troublesome.

665
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,119
I don't need one.

666
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,360
My ideal type is still an unknown code.

667
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,199
Let's ignore them
and continue with our meal.

668
00:40:45,879 --> 00:40:46,560
Is it nice?

669
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:47,280
It's so good!

670
00:40:47,399 --> 00:40:48,600
It's good, right?

671
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:51,479
Brother Lei,

672
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,679
I think we should head to
Mr. Chen's office and have some coffee.

673
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,600
We can hand in
last week's report as well.

674
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:56,800
Let's go.

675
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:13,840
I forgot to ask you this.

676
00:41:14,399 --> 00:41:16,119
So, why did you fall for me?

677
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:23,159
It's because you were the only person
who was willing to play with me.

678
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,879
Did you forget?

679
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,199
During high school,
when I went to find my brother,

680
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,639
he always pushed me to you
because he said I was a nuisance.

681
00:41:32,919 --> 00:41:34,919
But back then, no matter
what kind of trouble I got into,

682
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,479
you never blamed me for them.

683
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:38,479
You were always so gentle.

684
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,240
I'm just...

685
00:41:40,399 --> 00:41:41,879
I know.

686
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:46,159
Back then, you took care of me
like a little sister.

687
00:41:49,399 --> 00:41:54,280
So, since when did you
succumb to my charm?

688
00:41:56,879 --> 00:41:58,479
Ever since you kissed me

689
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:00,040
in Chongqing.

690
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,600
So, you like these kinds of girls.

691
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,280
If I'd known earlier,
I would've forced myself upon you.

692
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:11,959
What I meant was, I only treated you
as a proper woman

693
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:14,320
after that incident.

694
00:42:14,479 --> 00:42:15,959
I didn't treat you as my little sister.

695
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:22,479
If so,

696
00:42:23,399 --> 00:42:24,959
will you fall deeply in love with me

697
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:27,240
if I kiss you more?

698
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,280
Those two people are something else.

699
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,000
Yeah.

700
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,479
They're being so intimate
this early in the morning.

701
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,439
Don't look! It's only meant for adults.

702
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,560
Why not?

703
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,479
This can help youngsters
as they grow up.

704
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,800
This is scary.

705
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:53,520
Now,

706
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:55,959
there's no place for single dogs like us
within the company.

707
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,639
You should be content, you know?

708
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,840
Lu Li and Mr. Jiang aren't here today.

709
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,840
If not...

710
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:06,280
Let's go.

711
00:43:41,959 --> 00:43:43,560
What's on your mind?

712
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,240
I want to...

713
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:23,000
(To a scientist,)

714
00:44:23,399 --> 00:44:26,119
(love is a chemical reaction.)

715
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,520
(To a philosopher,)

716
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:32,840
(love is the principle of life
and it is the only goal of life.)

717
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:35,080
(To a programmer,)

718
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,000
(love is a program that cannot be
created with codes.)

719
00:44:39,959 --> 00:44:41,240
(To me,)

720
00:44:41,479 --> 00:44:44,879
(love is a game that
belongs to the brave.)

721
00:44:45,719 --> 00:44:48,040
(In this game where
we're unable to save our progress,)

722
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,000
(I hope everyone can be
brave enough to love,)

723
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,560
(to move forward,)

724
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,840
(and find the secret password
that belongs to you two.)
