What are you doing?

22
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,599
You shall continue to work.
Just ignore him.

23
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,519
How did the inspection go?

24
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,360
I was astonished
by your company's working atmosphere.

25
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,639
Are you envious?

26
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,360
Do you want a junior like her too?

27
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,160
I'm hungry. Let's go for lunch.

28
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,039
Are you going to lunch now?

29
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,000
Junior, stop working.
Let's go for lunch.

(Langouste Restaurant)

31
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:15,839
Is there anything else you recommend?

32
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,240
Our seafood hot pot is very popular.

33
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,320
- No seafood.
- One...

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,520
I forgot that you liked seafood.

35
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,919
I'll buy you seafood next time.

36
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,160
She is allergic to seafood,
so we can't have it today.

37
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,320
What do you want?

38
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,119
She likes spicy and sour food.

39
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,839
Can I have a steamed fish
with pickled cabbage as well?

40
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:32,440
Thanks.

41
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,000
Sure. Give me a moment.

42
00:02:38,279 --> 00:02:39,600
Someone is missing you.

43
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:42,839
The air-conditioner is on full blast.

44
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,240
I'll turn it off.

45
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,000
Put this on.

46
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:51,839
It's okay.

47
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,479
This will keep you warm.

48
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,759
When a girl says
that she's feeling cold,

49
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:58,160
all she needs is a coat
from the man right next to her.

50
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,000
This can warm
both her body and her heart.

51
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:01,479
If you don't believe me,

52
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,600
you can try it on your wife.

53
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,199
That's if you still have the chance.

54
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,520
How did you meet?

55
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:07,360
That night

56
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,279
when I was preparing
the proposal of the IP for you,

57
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,639
I accidentally spilled water
on my laptop.

58
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,559
Then, I went to knock on her door.

59
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,559
You are a grown man.

60
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:19,520
How could you knock on
a girl's door late at night?

61
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,119
How dare you open the door for him?

62
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,479
He lives right upstairs.

63
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,600
I know him.

64
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:25,679
Yes.

65
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,759
We met on the first day she moved in.

66
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,919
However, if it was you,

67
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,759
she might have turned you away.

68
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:32,360
Yes.

69
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:33,720
I am never as good as you

70
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,320
at courting the ladies.

71
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,320
When he was in college,

72
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,080
he managed to collect girlfriends
of all 12 star signs.

73
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,520
Don't be envious.

74
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,360
If it weren't for him,

75
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:43,960
I would have been able to complete
my collection within two years.

76
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,720
Tell me

77
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,720
how many of them
have you snatched away from me?

78
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,240
I never agreed to date any one of them.

79
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,639
They didn't like you.

80
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,000
Anyway, you have become
my rival since then.

81
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:56,360
I will certainly redeem myself.

82
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,160
I won't allow that.

83
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,720
The foods are here.

84
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:01,960
Here.

85
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:04,119
Egg yolk and mashed taro.

86
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,639
And, this...

87
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:10,800
All right. Enjoy your food.

88
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,479
Thanks.

89
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,399
Let's eat.

90
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,279
Let's eat.

91
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,880
Ladies first.

92
00:04:22,119 --> 00:04:23,160
Eat up.

93
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:25,640
Why do you have to stare at her

94
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,119
while you're eating?

95
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,640
I like staring at Junior.

96
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,519
A good view makes the food tastes better.

97
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,559
Get it?

98
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:45,239
Eat more.

99
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:52,839
Here.

100
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,519
This tastes good.

101
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:56,040
You're not fat.

102
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:57,480
You don't have to lose any more weight.

103
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:01,640
Why is he not here yet?

104
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,720
Have you seen Mr. Jiang?

105
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:13,359
He went out for lunch
with Lu Li and Mr. Lu.

106
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,279
Lu Li?

107
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,519
Why did she tag along?

108
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:16,799
I have no idea.

109
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:18,959
Director Gao,

110
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:21,000
I need to get back to work.

111
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,320
I have work to do in the afternoon.

112
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,600
Get ready an office for me.

113
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,959
Sure, no problem.

114
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,480
I need an assistant as well.

115
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:39,920
Lu...

116
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,279
I shall get back to work.

117
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:45,040
It's okay.

118
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,440
I will get Gao Xi to help you.

119
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,480
There's no need for that.

120
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:57,640
Mr. Jiang, you're back.

121
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,480
Are you having lunch?

122
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:01,839
Yes.

123
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,839
Your boss, Mr. Lu,

124
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,480
insisted on bringing me out for lunch.

125
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,440
I bought this for you.

126
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,160
These two dishes have gotten cold
and no longer taste good,

127
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:13,079
so I finished them by myself.

128
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:15,200
These look good.

129
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,239
What about this?

130
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,040
Buy each one of these for me again.

131
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,480
Tianqi,

132
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,839
you're going to meet your dad soon.

133
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,279
Are you happy?

134
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,480
Hi.

135
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,839
I dared not come forward just now.

136
00:06:58,119 --> 00:06:59,720
I didn't know
this was how you looked like.

137
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:03,880
I didn't expect you
to look like this too.

138
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,279
If I had known you were this pretty,

139
00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:08,480
I would have listened to my mom

140
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:10,320
and met up with you earlier.

141
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,160
I regret this too.

142
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:16,519
I should've known better
and listened to my best friend.

143
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,000
Before this, we had only spoken
to each other online.

144
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:23,079
I'm usually very busy at work.

145
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,600
I hope you don't mind.

146
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,480
Of course, I don't mind.

147
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:26,920
Glad that you don't mind.

148
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,079
Anyway, after I return the cat to you,

149
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,000
we won't meet again.

150
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:32,720
"We won't meet again"?

151
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,320
"Cat"?

152
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,679
What cat?

153
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,399
Tianqi.

154
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,040
Aren't you here for him?

155
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,480
I'm here for a blind date.

156
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,200
Aren't you Mr. Ye?

157
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:45,079
My last name is Li.

158
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:50,320
I'm so sorry, Mr. Li.

159
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,119
You're not the person I'm waiting for.

160
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,279
Anyway, enjoy your blind date.

161
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,320
Good luck!

162
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,079
Farewell!

(Mood Management Bureau)

164
00:08:03,731 --> 00:08:08,760
(I have a bold idea)

165
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:24,880
Why are you here?

166
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:27,559
Didn't you ask me out?

167
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,839
It's you.

168
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,559
Xiaoqi, we need to talk.

169
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,599
Stop following me around, liar.

170
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,799
Because you're always upset with me,

171
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,679
I had no choice
but to approach you like this.

172
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,400
Don't mention this ever again.

173
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,039
I don't want to talk to you at all.

174
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:50,440
Sure.

175
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,799
Someone told me
that she had feelings for me.

176
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,520
No one has feelings for you.

177
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,880
I don't have feelings for you.

178
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:56,799
It only happened

179
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:59,080
because I was blinded
by the illusion you created.

180
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,119
It's just like having a crush
on a character in the drama.

181
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,559
It's fake.

182
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,840
Fine.

183
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:06,239
Then, give Tianqi back to me.

184
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,320
Tianqi is now mine.

185
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,359
It has nothing to do with you anymore.

186
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,559
Bye!

187
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,840
Liar.

188
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,840
A big fat liar.

189
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,760
I will throw out everything you gave me.

190
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Throw them out.

191
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,599
No one wants your lousy gifts.

192
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,559
Go to hell.

193
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:37,840
Aunt.

194
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:38,719
Sorry.

195
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:39,280
I'm not throwing this out anymore.

196
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,520
I'm not throwing this out anymore.

197
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,919
Have I fallen for him?

198
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,400
That's impossible.

199
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,400
That's certainly not going to happen.

200
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,359
The person I fell for is
the fictional Mr. Ye,

201
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,960
not Gu Mo.

202
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,559
That's not going to happen.

203
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,599
Yes.

204
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:03,080
I'm not blind,

205
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,359
so I won't fall for someone like him.

206
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,960
Darn it.

207
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:22,880
I suppose you're waiting for me.

208
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,239
Fortunately, I came back right in time.

209
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:25,960
Let's go. I'll send you home.

210
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,679
I can go by myself.

211
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,359
I bought you some snacks.

212
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,559
It's not convenient
to take them on a bus.

213
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:34,320
I don't like these anymore.

214
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,200
Then, what do you like?

215
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:37,440
I'll buy them for you.

216
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:39,440
Junior.

217
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:42,039
Why did you leave without me?

218
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,200
You're here too.

219
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:44,960
Who's going to send you home

220
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,919
if I've left?

221
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,919
Wait a minute.

222
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,200
Do you intend to keep living with me?

223
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:50,880
I don't like staying in a hotel.

224
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:53,520
Why does it feel like
you're obsessed with me?

225
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:55,599
Aren't you looking for your wife?

226
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:56,760
Why aren't you doing anything about it?

227
00:10:57,719 --> 00:10:58,559
I...

228
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,760
I won't disturb you further.

229
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:02,400
I have something else to do,
so I shall move on.

230
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:03,919
What is it that you are going to do?

231
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,760
Master.

232
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,039
Yao is looking for me.

233
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,359
What's the matter?

234
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm just wondering

235
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,559
when you will be free
to teach me programming.

236
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:14,159
Right now.

237
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,039
We can do it right now.

238
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,080
Sure.

239
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,239
Let's go.

240
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:18,880
We will get going. Bye!

241
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,000
My dinner plan is ruined again.

242
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,200
Does she always cook for you?

243
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:25,640
Yes.

244
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,200
Haven't you noticed
that I gained weight?

245
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:28,719
This all happened thanks to Junior.

246
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,760
Since I'm free today,

247
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,359
I can hit the gym.

248
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,039
Gym?

249
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:38,719
Are you taking a stroll?

250
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,400
What are you doing?

251
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:09,119
You behaved like a villain.

252
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,039
What's wrong with you?

253
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:13,599
I didn't steal your wife from you.

254
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:14,679
Why are you being so hostile to me?

255
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:16,320
I find you very annoying.

256
00:12:19,599 --> 00:12:22,080
Anyway, Lu Li is not your type.

257
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,919
Why are you always taking care of her?

258
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,520
Exactly because she's different
from all the other girls I met before.

259
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,440
This is my first time
meeting a female programmer,

260
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:33,119
not to mention one with a story to tell.

261
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:36,280
Girls of the computer science major
are boring.

262
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,359
She's not the one for you.

263
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:38,000
For you,

264
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,640
all girls are boring.

265
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:43,239
Why are you so concerned
about my junior?

266
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,719
I simply want to remind you

267
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,280
that you and Lu Li
are not meant for each other.

268
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,479
Don't disturb her.

269
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,119
Who's disturbing her?

270
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:52,159
I'm taking this seriously.

271
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:53,679
Can you imagine?

272
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,400
A girl

273
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,159
came to a new city alone.

274
00:12:57,479 --> 00:13:00,200
The more independent she seems,
the more I sympathize with her.

275
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:03,799
Now, all I want to do is to protect her.

276
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:51,919
(I have something to tell you.)

277
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,760
Is she asleep?

278
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:24,239
I did it.

279
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,159
Master, I did this by myself.

280
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,479
Welcome

281
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,919
to the programming world.

282
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:32,559
That's great.

283
00:14:32,719 --> 00:14:33,599
I did so well!

284
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:34,799
Thanks, Master.

285
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,520
She's still awake.

286
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,159
Yes.

287
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:37,479
I want to post this on Moments.

288
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,320
This book is for you.

289
00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:44,159
I've already highlighted
the important parts for you.

290
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:46,000
You can come to me if there's anything
you don't understand.

291
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,799
Oh, my. Master.

292
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:49,599
You're too nice!

293
00:14:49,719 --> 00:14:51,320
If I had known you earlier,

294
00:14:51,479 --> 00:14:54,320
I would probably have chosen
computer science as my major.

295
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,960
We came from the same batch.

296
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,799
We didn't know any better.

297
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:58,960
How was I supposed
to teach you anything?

298
00:14:59,119 --> 00:15:00,039
Yes.

299
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,520
When you sent in
your college application,

300
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,799
how did you know that you are
interested in computer science?

301
00:15:04,479 --> 00:15:06,200
I was pretty lost as well.

302
00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:07,559
Fortunately,

303
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,239
I met an excellent programmer.

304
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:12,679
He guided me through this.

305
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,760
That's really nice.

306
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,080
Why is someone
playing ball late at night?

307
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,080
Is there a mischievous kid
living upstairs?

308
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,559
He usually behaves normally,

309
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:37,840
but once in a while,

310
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,760
he turns into a mischievous kid.

311
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,440
How can you sleep like this?

312
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:44,320
Should we talk to the parents?

313
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,320
Never mind.

314
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,719
It will only take a while.

315
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:02,719
Master.

316
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,719
My friends saw my Moments,

317
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,320
and they were interested
in programming too.

318
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,679
Can they join

319
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,559
our lesson next time?

320
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:10,280
Sure.

321
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,400
They are always welcome to join us.

322
00:16:11,599 --> 00:16:13,320
After all, the teaching will be the same

323
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,239
no matter how many students are there.

324
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:15,359
That's great.

325
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:18,280
Our side hustle is going to do great.

326
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,239
Master, I've got to go.

327
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:22,400
It's late now.

328
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:23,039
Sure.

329
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,000
Take care.

330
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:24,760
All right.

331
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,719
Bye, Master.

332
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:26,599
Bye!

333
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:37,960
What are you doing?

334
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:40,320
Leave me alone.

335
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,400
If I leave you alone,

336
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:42,479
the neighbors will
lodge a complaint against us.

337
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:43,559
Yes.

338
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:46,919
Have you been possessed?

339
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:53,159
I'm telling you.

340
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,159
You're leaving in a few days,

341
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,119
but I'm not.

342
00:16:56,239 --> 00:16:57,440
I'll stay here for a long time.

343
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,359
The neighbors

344
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,000
will form strange opinions about me.

345
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:02,080
Seriously.

346
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:08,640
You're scaring me.

347
00:17:08,719 --> 00:17:09,839
I'm scared.

348
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,800
I'm more scared than you.

349
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,000
Where did you go late at night?

350
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,479
Lu Li.

351
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,479
Lu Li.

352
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,680
Lu Li, come out.

353
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:39,479
I have a lot to tell you.

354
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:42,000
I'll stay here until you show yourself.

355
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:44,839
Lu Li.

356
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,599
It's the middle of the night.
Stop knocking!

357
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:52,160
Lu Li.

358
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:54,000
Lu Li, I have things to tell you.

359
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,199
Come out now.

360
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:57,359
Lu Li.

361
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,000
Lu Li.

362
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:02,319
Sir, what are you doing?

363
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,640
I'm talking to you.
What are you doing here?

364
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,880
Who are you?

365
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:11,560
Why are you here?

366
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,079
I received a call from
the security guard.

367
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,359
Let's go.

368
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,000
You are Miss Lu's friend.

369
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:17,000
Then, I suppose
you have her phone number.

370
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,040
Why not you give her a call?

371
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:19,479
You should...

372
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:21,319
Mr. Lu.

373
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,280
Miss Lu.

374
00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:24,359
This is what happened.

375
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:25,160
A nuisance complaint

376
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:25,959
was lodged

377
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:26,959
against this mister right here.

378
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:27,880
According to him,

379
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:28,920
he lives here

380
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,439
and is your friend.

381
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:31,520
Therefore...

382
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,680
I gave you a call,

383
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,439
hoping that you can verify this.

384
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,400
Yes.

385
00:18:38,479 --> 00:18:39,880
He is my friend.

386
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:42,079
He is living with me these two days.

387
00:18:42,439 --> 00:18:43,359
I see.

388
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,599
Miss Lu,

389
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:46,119
who is he to you?

390
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,079
We are all friends.

391
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:52,439
She's not my friend.

392
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:53,920
Not your friend?

393
00:18:54,239 --> 00:18:55,880
If you're not her friend,

394
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,160
why did you knock on
a single lady's door late at night?

395
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,359
That is considered harassment.

396
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:00,560
I can hand you over
to the police station.

397
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,280
She's my wife.

398
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,880
Ex-wife.

399
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,439
We haven't divorced yet.

400
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,800
We can pay the Civil Affairs Bureau
a visit whenever you want.

401
00:19:18,439 --> 00:19:19,400
Lu Li.

402
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,800
I'm here for you.

403
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:24,599
Can you stop being so indifferent to me?

404
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:26,880
I'll go with you if it's for a divorce,

405
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,880
but not for anything else.

406
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:35,199
Sorry.

407
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,439
There's no need for apologies.

408
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,599
I've figured out who the stalker was.

409
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:44,920
It was Li Man's father.

410
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:48,160
If it wasn't for me,

411
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,119
you wouldn't have had to
go through all these.

412
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,000
I'm sorry.

413
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,800
Apology accepted.

414
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:01,280
What else do you want to say?

415
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,400
It was Li Man

416
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,000
who deleted the demo of "Boss".

417
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:08,800
I wasn't doubting you.

418
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:11,280
We didn't have enough evidence,

419
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,520
and keeping fighting with Li Man
would only put you at a disadvantage.

420
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,439
All of these don't matter anymore.

421
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,040
I don't believe you.

422
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:24,280
You left because of these.

423
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,160
They were all in the past.

424
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:32,319
I've started a new life.

425
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:35,839
A new life?

426
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,160
I have fallen for someone else.

427
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,439
Please stop bothering me.

428
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:43,079
Who is he?

429
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,079
Is it...

430
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:49,520
Me?

431
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:54,959
It's me.

432
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,760
Junior,

433
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:00,400
I've been waiting for this for so long.

434
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,800
Does it mean

435
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:03,479
that I've been promoted from your senior

436
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,760
to your boyfriend?

437
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,760
Yes.

438
00:21:12,719 --> 00:21:13,800
Lu Li.

439
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,640
You shouldn't do this just to upset me.

440
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,520
That's all I have to say.

441
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,119
It's up to you to believe it or not.

442
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,680
Junior.

443
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:37,119
Ex-husband, ex-wife, boyfriend.

444
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:39,920
Young people sure know how to have fun.

445
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:42,800
Mr. Jiang.

446
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,000
You can come to me
if you need anything.

447
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:45,280
I'll get going.

448
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:45,800
Let's go.

449
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,079
All right.

450
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,199
The main character of your story

451
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,880
turned out to be Jiang Yicheng.

452
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,839
No wonder he has been so hostile to me
for the past two days.

453
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,319
Thanks for your help.

454
00:22:09,439 --> 00:22:10,959
I'm more than willing to help you again.

455
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,280
I finally got to see

456
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,760
how Jiang Yicheng
got rejected by a girl.

457
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,160
That was really exciting.

458
00:22:18,439 --> 00:22:18,959
I made a mistake.

459
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,319
I should've recorded it.

460
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,920
What a waste.

461
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,479
Aren't you friends?

462
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,359
I guess you don't know yet.

463
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,280
For me, it's always gals before pals.

464
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,439
Don't worry.

465
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,479
Nonetheless,

466
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,719
I will always side with justice.

467
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:35,920
If he dares bully you again,

468
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,079
I'll always back you up.

469
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:38,760
He's not bullying me.

470
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:41,160
He simply has no feelings for me.

471
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,560
Then, do you still
have feelings for him?

472
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:55,439
I understood.

473
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,880
Let's put on an act

474
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,000
and pretend to be lovey-dovey
in front of Jiang Yicheng.

475
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:01,719
I will torture him on your behalf.

476
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,040
Stop looking around.
Jiang Yicheng's not here.

477
00:23:32,199 --> 00:23:32,839
Let's go.

478
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:50,959
I didn't expect him

479
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:53,280
to have such a weak mind.

480
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:56,439
I haven't done anything yet,

481
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,800
and he has already backed out.

482
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,079
Has he left already?

483
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,160
Yes.

484
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,479
He left yesterday at midnight.

485
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,760
He was so petty that
he didn't even bid me farewell.

486
00:24:15,439 --> 00:24:17,760
What happened between the two of you?

487
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,520
Didn't he tell you anything?

488
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:23,520
It's easier earning his money

489
00:24:23,719 --> 00:24:25,160
than getting any information from him.

490
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,079
The only thing I knew
was that he had a wife.

491
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,079
Other than that,

492
00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:31,160
I need you to feed my curiosity.

493
00:24:34,479 --> 00:24:35,880
I told you

494
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:38,560
that I had a crush on him,

495
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:40,800
but he didn't reciprocate my feelings.

496
00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:42,319
That's it.

497
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,719
Is that all?

498
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,280
That's so simple.

499
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,119
I sacrificed myself for you.

500
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:53,760
Don't I deserve more details?

501
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:02,520
Master.

502
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,439
Take a look at the photo
I just sent you.

503
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,239
Someone's looking for you online.

504
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,540
(Missing person.
Location: Xinhai. Mr. Jiang)

505
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:16,680
Was it Jiang Yicheng?

506
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,359
Judging from your expression,
I guess this has melted your heart.

507
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:31,400
I simply

508
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:34,319
don't want his presence
in my life anymore.

509
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:38,640
It's good that he left.

510
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,839
Liar.

511
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:47,319
Let's listen to some music.

512
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,280
Sure.

513
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:59,680
You are finally back.

514
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,880
How are things at Chendong?

515
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:03,239
I received news from insiders,

516
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,599
which says that Chendong

517
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,199
is developing a game
similar to "Xuan Zhong Ji".

518
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,000
Is Xu Yuanzhi instigating
a cut-throat competition?

519
00:26:09,439 --> 00:26:10,359
Have you found the leaker?

520
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:11,359
Yes.

521
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,280
Someone from programmer team C
resigned from his job not long ago.

522
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:15,160
I'm sure Xu Yuanzhi offered him a job.

523
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:16,119
If Chendong

524
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,800
manages to release the game before us,

525
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:19,520
we will become the passive party.

526
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,800
He can copy our game,

527
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,359
but he can't copy our technology.

528
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,160
That's why I insist on
developing the HPC server

529
00:26:25,439 --> 00:26:27,520
despite the immense
technical challenges.

530
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,560
Besides,

531
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,760
this also involves

532
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,359
the 64 square kilometers

533
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,560
super large seamless map
streaming technology.

534
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,880
As long as we have this program,

535
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,800
Xu Yuanzhi's effort will be in vain.

536
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:40,119
I will enhance the security
of the programming teams.

537
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,199
I have confidence in programming team A.

538
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:44,319
While we ensure the quality,
we need to expedite the progress too.

539
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:45,959
Try to complete it before Chendong.

540
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,839
Don't worry. I'll work on it.

541
00:26:48,199 --> 00:26:50,280
I've left the documents in your office.

542
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,479
Sure.

Yezi.

558
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:32,040
Book me the earliest ticket
to Chongqing.

559
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,119
Sure, Mr. Jiang.

560
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,359
They told me that you arrived yesterday.

561
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,959
Have you been working here since then?

562
00:28:49,719 --> 00:28:51,199
No matter how much
you want to torture yourself,

563
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:52,599
you should come home too.

564
00:28:52,719 --> 00:28:54,199
Mom has been missing you.

565
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,640
I have something urgent to handle.

566
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:56,599
I'll go home next time.

567
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,680
Are you going to Chongqing again?

568
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,599
What's so attractive there?

569
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,079
Tell Yiming

570
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,599
that I've processed
all of these documents.

571
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:06,680
He can give me a call

572
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,920
if there's an issue.

573
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:08,760
You can talk to him yourself.

574
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:09,599
I'm not going to talk to him.

575
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:11,520
What's wrong with the two of you?

576
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,319
We're fine.

577
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:16,239
Why did you book another plane ticket?

578
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,199
Do you have to leave
at such a critical time?

579
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,880
I have something more important there.

580
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:22,800
You're here,
so I have nothing to worry about.

581
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,239
Without you looking after the company,

582
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:25,880
don't you worry that
I'll sell the company off?

583
00:29:27,239 --> 00:29:28,280
We are family.

584
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:29,040
Besides,

585
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,439
I'll be your brother in the future.

586
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,680
Am I right, Brother-in-law?

587
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,000
What's wrong with your brother?

588
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,319
You too.

589
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,560
What's wrong with you?

590
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,800
I don't know what's wrong with him.

591
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:49,599
Anyway,

592
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:52,079
we're now at an awkward recovery period.

593
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,479
How long is this period going to last?

594
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,520
Until the day

595
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,959
you completely forget about
what happened to me the last time.

596
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,280
Then, I guess we will never see
each other again.

597
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:14,040
Because

598
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,839
I took a picture of it.

599
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:19,560
Give it to me.

600
00:30:26,439 --> 00:30:27,079
Where is it?

601
00:30:27,199 --> 00:30:28,119
I don't see any of the photos.

602
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:29,760
I was just kidding.

603
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,079
There are no photos.

604
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,280
That's all.

605
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,560
All right.

606
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,920
Today's syllabus is quite simple.

607
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,400
You can go through it again at home.

608
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:53,719
Thanks, Lu Li.

609
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,880
Can we come here with Yao again?

610
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:58,040
Of course.

611
00:30:58,239 --> 00:30:59,160
You're always welcome.

612
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,239
You're not allowed to bring any gifts

613
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,599
the next time you're here.

614
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,079
We feel bad about
attending the classes for free.

615
00:31:03,199 --> 00:31:05,239
My friend attended
a programming class before,

616
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,079
and it cost her 400 yuan per lesson.

617
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,800
I attended a trial class too.

618
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:10,920
Not only was it expensive, but I also
couldn't understand any of it.

619
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,719
Lu Li,

620
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,119
you make it way easier to understand.

621
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:16,160
We want to keep learning from you.

622
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,920
Why not we pay you tuition fees?

623
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:20,560
That's a good idea.

624
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,439
By the word of mouth,

625
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:24,599
I'm sure you will gain
more and more students.

626
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,199
Then, your place won't have enough
space to accommodate us all.

627
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:29,400
We should just conduct
a programming class.

628
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,760
You can also earn money from it.

629
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:32,599
Yes.

630
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:32,839
Yes.

631
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:34,040
I'll have to consider your idea.

632
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,280
Give it a thought.

633
00:31:35,439 --> 00:31:37,640
Perhaps, we can be business partners.

634
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,319
I'll think about it.

635
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,319
Sure.

636
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,119
All right.

637
00:31:41,239 --> 00:31:41,800
That's all for today.

638
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,119
Sure.

639
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:42,719
Sure.

640
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,400
Miss Lu, we'll get going.

641
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,719
Take care.

642
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:50,239
- Bye.
- Bye.

643
00:31:51,239 --> 00:31:52,239
Take care.

644
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:55,000
I'm so tired.

645
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,199
I didn't invite you in.

646
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:06,680
Don't you want to know why I am here?

647
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,119
No.

648
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:09,280
I went to Xinhai yesterday,

649
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:09,959
finished all my work,

650
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,319
and came here immediately.

651
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:13,520
I'm exhausted.

652
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:16,160
Can I take a rest here?

653
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,160
You can go to Mr. Lu's house.

654
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:19,040
It's right upstairs.

655
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:20,000
You knew where it was.

656
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,719
There's no one home.

657
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:23,479
Can you pour me a glass of water?

658
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:26,880
You'll leave right after that.

659
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,920
Lu Li.

660
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:41,199
Hand.

661
00:33:41,239 --> 00:33:42,280
Do you like it?

662
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,599
Why are you here?

663
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,479
I should be the one asking.

664
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:46,280
You're my business partner,

665
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,239
and you're here sleeping
at my girlfriend's house.

666
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:47,880
Don't you find it inappropriate?

667
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:48,560
Let me remind you.

668
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,359
We haven't divorced yet.

669
00:33:49,439 --> 00:33:50,719
Let me remind you

670
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,359
that you are separated.

671
00:33:52,479 --> 00:33:52,839
Besides,

672
00:33:52,959 --> 00:33:54,560
my girlfriend is willing
to file the divorce at any time.

673
00:33:54,719 --> 00:33:56,199
Do you want to be her backup lover?

674
00:33:56,439 --> 00:33:57,719
Sorry, brother.

675
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,359
You should have cherished it

676
00:34:01,479 --> 00:34:02,760
while you could.

677
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:05,680
Junior and I are
in love with each other.

678
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:07,959
Moreover, I always cherish
the one I love.

679
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,800
I will never let her down.

680
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:13,000
Let me warn you again.

681
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:13,919
She is still my wife.

682
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,000
Stay away from her.

683
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:16,320
Fine.

684
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,320
I'll be as far away from her as you are.

685
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,280
Since we are love rivals,

686
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,639
we shall do it fair and square.

687
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,399
Sure.

688
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,520
You can leave now.

689
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,560
Sure.

690
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,120
We'll leave together.
You'll be staying at my place.

691
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,520
I'll stay at the hotel.

692
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,080
I can charge you.

693
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,800
Let's go.

694
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,600
What I'm wearing

695
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,199
is a black Lolita-style dress.

696
00:34:41,439 --> 00:34:42,800
The fabric I used

697
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,840
is of very good quality.

698
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:45,639
You'll definitely look good in this.

699
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,159
It will make you look very attractive.

700
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,159
Whoever likes this
can click on the link below.

701
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,560
Yes.

702
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:54,360
Momo.

703
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,000
Momo, what's the matter?

704
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:01,959
Momo seems weird.

705
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:03,479
(Is it pregnant?)

706
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:04,399
Yes.

707
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,719
It is pregnant.

708
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,199
(Is it going to give birth soon?)

709
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,840
Is it going to give birth?

710
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,199
What should I do?

711
00:35:12,439 --> 00:35:13,800
I have never delivered a kitten before.

712
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:15,919
Does a cat deliver its kittens
at the hospital

713
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,520
or at home?

714
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,320
Gu Mo.

715
00:35:22,439 --> 00:35:23,280
Don't worry.

716
00:35:23,399 --> 00:35:24,760
I'll go pick you and Momo up now.

717
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,760
Sure.

718
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,360
I've got to go. Bye.

719
00:35:42,439 --> 00:35:44,239
Don't worry. Drink something warm.

720
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,679
How can I not worry?

721
00:35:45,879 --> 00:35:47,919
I heard that some cats die
while giving birth too.

722
00:35:48,399 --> 00:35:49,360
It won't happen.

723
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,959
We sent it here right in time.

724
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:52,360
It's being handled
by professional veterinarians.

725
00:35:52,439 --> 00:35:53,679
It's very unlikely that will happen.

726
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,159
The timing was impeccable.

727
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,760
You even knew that
Momo was about to give birth.

728
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,120
I was watching your live stream.

729
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,840
I never miss any of it.

730
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,600
You're stalking me.

731
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,560
How is this stalking?

732
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:09,080
I care for you.

733
00:36:12,479 --> 00:36:14,679
It's rare to see you so disheveled.

734
00:36:15,919 --> 00:36:16,639
That's all because of you.

735
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:18,239
You made me nervous.

736
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,199
The kittens are here.

737
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,239
Momo has fallen asleep.

738
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:43,320
Let me send you home.

739
00:36:43,399 --> 00:36:44,320
We'll pay them a visit tomorrow.

740
00:36:44,479 --> 00:36:45,280
Why?

741
00:36:45,399 --> 00:36:46,719
Can't I bring them home?

742
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:49,239
Newborn kittens get sick very easily.

743
00:36:49,479 --> 00:36:50,719
It's better to leave them here
for a few more days.

744
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,360
We'll bring them home later.

745
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,239
Are you going to take this opportunity

746
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,919
to bring them home?

747
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,679
If you still refuse to be my friend,

748
00:37:05,879 --> 00:37:08,959
I'll consider fighting
for the kittens' custody.

749
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,239
No.

750
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:11,919
They are all mine.

751
00:37:12,959 --> 00:37:14,120
All yours?

752
00:37:14,959 --> 00:37:16,479
For their sake,

753
00:37:17,439 --> 00:37:18,959
can we be friends again?

754
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:24,399
You have to promise

755
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:27,360
that Tianqi and the kittens
will all be mine.

756
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:28,439
Sure.

757
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,239
They will never be separated.

758
00:37:33,399 --> 00:37:34,560
Promise.

759
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:35,959
Pinky promise.

760
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,040
It's boiling. Let's eat.

761
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,159
We have to go to work later.

762
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,040
You've lost weight.
You should eat more meat.

763
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:26,280
Girls should eat more vegetables.
They are good for your skin.

764
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,439
Drink some water before you eat.

765
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:29,439
Stop pretending.

766
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,959
Who suggested hotpot?

767
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,120
Who rejected the dual-sided pot?

768
00:38:32,399 --> 00:38:33,679
You insisted on adding
more spices and Sichuan peppers too.

769
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,919
Excuse me.

770
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,600
I'm not buying this meal for nothing.

771
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,320
I knew you weren't that nice.

772
00:38:47,439 --> 00:38:47,800
Tell me.

773
00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:48,679
What's the matter?

774
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,879
I need an assistant to help me
with my work here.

775
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,760
You can have anyone you like
except Lu Li.

776
00:38:55,879 --> 00:38:57,560
Let our abilities decide
who's the winner.

777
00:38:57,879 --> 00:38:59,840
The winner gets Lu Li.

778
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:02,360
The one who drinks water first
will be the loser.

779
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,600
Stop eating if it's too spicy.
Here are some cold drinks.

780
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,199
Thanks.

781
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:07,080
You lost.

782
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,719
Lost?

783
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,520
I heard that

784
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:16,840
you were the leader

785
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:18,719
in the development of
"A Hundred Ways to Kill A Boss".

786
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,320
I think it'd be a waste for you

787
00:40:21,439 --> 00:40:23,679
to be a network manager in our company.

788
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,639
That's not true.

789
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,399
I'm very happy with my current job.

790
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:29,760
I know.

791
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,000
Since you were
part of the development team,

792
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,280
I'll leave the liaison with
Mr. Jiang's company to you

793
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:37,080
in the future.

794
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,840
Mr. Lu.

795
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,360
Are you going to

796
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,840
break your promise?

797
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,360
You knew it yourself.

798
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,239
You're the most suitable candidate
for this job.

799
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,760
More importantly,

800
00:40:47,959 --> 00:40:49,679
I believe that you will
stay loyal to me.

801
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,800
I will always be there
to protect you too.

802
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,760
I won't allow the scheming man
to get what he wants.

803
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:55,560
Darling.

804
00:41:57,439 --> 00:41:58,520
Wait a minute.

805
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,919
Put this on.

806
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:06,199
This makes you look good.

807
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,760
No one cares about
how I look at this age.

808
00:42:08,879 --> 00:42:09,600
You're wrong.

809
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,719
No matter how old you are...

810
00:42:20,439 --> 00:42:24,840
♪For me, you're always
the most beautiful girl.♪

811
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,520
♪I am captivated by every smile of yours.♪

812
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,959
♪Your mischievous...♪

813
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,560
Mr. Jiang. Mrs. Jiang.

814
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,199
Can you see me?

815
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,879
Tong, you're here.

816
00:42:40,439 --> 00:42:43,159
Your lovely daughter
has always been here.

817
00:42:44,959 --> 00:42:47,600
How did you finish the snacks
so quickly?

818
00:42:47,879 --> 00:42:50,159
Didn't you buy this for me?

819
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,239
I bought this for your mom.

820
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,159
Fine.

821
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,879
I won't eat this anymore.

822
00:43:04,959 --> 00:43:07,919
Judging from your attires,
are you going out for a meal?

823
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,840
Yes.

824
00:43:08,959 --> 00:43:11,439
Can I come with you?

825
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:12,959
I don't think so.

826
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:14,399
Why not?

827
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,719
It's our anniversary today.

828
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,760
Thirty years ago today,

829
00:43:19,239 --> 00:43:22,439
I met your mom for the first time.

830
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:26,479
Then, what about me?

831
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,479
You can finish the snacks.

832
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:30,639
I'll buy some more for your mom later.

833
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,479
It's not nice having only snacks.

834
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,280
Mom is the best.

835
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,520
You can order takeaway.

836
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,239
I'm your daughter.

837
00:43:45,399 --> 00:43:46,840
No wonder Yicheng is moving out.

838
00:43:46,959 --> 00:43:48,439
I want to move out of here too.

839
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,639
Speaking of Yicheng,

840
00:43:51,719 --> 00:43:53,360
he gives us a call every year
on our anniversaries.

841
00:43:53,439 --> 00:43:55,120
Why hasn't he called us yet?

842
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,879
Where did he go?

843
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,479
The anniversary of your first date.

844
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:03,639
The anniversary of your first letter
written for each other.

845
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,280
The anniversary of
your first bike ride.

846
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:07,760
We are not Siri.

847
00:44:07,879 --> 00:44:09,959
How can we remember all of these dates?

848
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,679
Tong.

849
00:44:11,959 --> 00:44:13,600
Speaking of Yicheng,

850
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,520
I've been calling him lately,

851
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:17,360
but he always tells me that he's busy.

852
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,199
What is he doing?

853
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,879
He's on a business trip.

854
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,080
Such a long business trip.

855
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,320
Is it really a business trip?

856
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,040
Where else can he go?

857
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:28,560
Can he...

858
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,199
What are you talking about?

859
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:35,919
The opera is about to start.

860
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,080
We're running late.

861
00:44:37,159 --> 00:44:38,120
Let's go.

862
00:44:43,399 --> 00:44:44,639
Keep eating your snacks.

863
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,040
I'm coming.

864
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,360
Don't you want to know why I'm here?

865
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,080
I'm afraid that
once I start the conversation,

866
00:45:19,239 --> 00:45:20,679
I won't be able to finish my coffee.

867
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,040
You're right.

868
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:24,399
I want you to go to Chongqing with me.

869
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,760
Why should we go to Chongqing?

870
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:28,959
Catch the lovers.

871
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,159
Who?

872
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,639
It's obviously Jiang Yicheng.

873
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,919
There is so much going on
in the company right now,

874
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,320
but he refuses to come home.

875
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,840
I'm sure he's been bewitched
by one of the girls.

876
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:44,239
No.

877
00:45:44,399 --> 00:45:45,959
Yicheng is still waiting for Lu Li.

878
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:47,840
He's the most vulnerable now,

879
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,560
and he needs to be consoled terribly.

880
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:51,399
What if the girl takes the initiative
to seduce him?

881
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:53,520
I worry that he might not
be able to hold himself back.

882
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,800
Don't act recklessly.

883
00:45:56,959 --> 00:45:58,080
I'll give Yicheng a call.

884
00:45:58,239 --> 00:45:58,719
No.

885
00:45:58,879 --> 00:46:01,320
How are we going to catch them
if we give them prior notice?

886
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:02,600
Anyway,

887
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,320
you are coming with me to Chongqing.

888
00:46:04,439 --> 00:46:05,879
It'd be the best
if he hasn't got himself a lover.

889
00:46:05,959 --> 00:46:06,800
If he has a lover...

890
00:46:06,879 --> 00:46:08,040
What's your plan?

891
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,000
You can rest assured.

892
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,679
I've already planned this out.

893
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:17,120
(We are all responsible
for our own feelings.)

894
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,120
(We have to bear the profit, the loss,
and the risk on our own.)

895
00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:23,199
(We don't need sympathy and compensation
of the other party)

896
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:28,719
(because love is never a fair trade.)
