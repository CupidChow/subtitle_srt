Lu Li.

22
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,160
Apologise to her.

23
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:01,120
So, in your eyes,

24
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:03,360
is she the only person worth your trust?

25
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm the person who was together
with you morning until night.

26
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,800
But you think I'm someone
who only knows how to mess around.

27
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,479
Did you ask me out

28
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:43,160
because you plan to forgive me?

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,360
I'll leave after finishing my words.

30
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,240
I hope you can pull out

31
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,839
from the Xuan Zhong Ji project.

32
00:02:50,559 --> 00:02:51,639
Why?

33
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,639
Because I don't want to
be involved with you any longer.

34
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:58,000
But I've explained everything
to you on that day.

35
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,119
I was really in the dark

36
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,720
when my father went to see Lu Li.

37
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:03,199
And now, he has received
his just desserts.

38
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:03,919
Do you know something?

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,240
He's actually in bad health right now.

40
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,440
I'm uninterested
in your father's matter.

41
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,759
Your relationship with him
has nothing to do with me.

42
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:12,119
You have three days
to do your work handover.

43
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,479
This is a requirement, not a suggestion.

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,160
I disagree.

45
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,880
Even if we have personal grudges
against each other,

46
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,360
we shouldn't bring them to work.

47
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,160
You were the one who deleted
Boss's demo, right?

48
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,360
I've explained everything to you.

49
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:36,960
I went to the office
to turn off the lights.

50
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:44,600
The CCTVs were fixed.

51
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,360
It proved that the lights in the office
have been left off.

52
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:03,960
So, have you been
investigating me in secret?

53
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,360
You have never trusted me.

54
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,039
If you insist on staying here,

55
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,919
I will present this evidence to EG.

56
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,880
They will pursue your responsibility.

57
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,200
Do you really need to resort to this

58
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,880
because of a person like Lu Li?

59
00:04:22,119 --> 00:04:23,640
I owe her a clear name.

60
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,200
I need to return it to her.

61
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,679
But she doesn't care about it anymore.

62
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:29,200
She has left.

63
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,679
She will never come back.

64
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,000
I will find her.

65
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,480
It's a pity that it's too late.

66
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:48,519
Lu Li was at the hotel as well

67
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,799
when we went to the hotel

68
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,399
to meet Andrew that day.

69
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,239
The receptionist told me about it.

70
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,679
A girl in a white t-shirt came

71
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,760
to search for our names.

72
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,320
I forgot to tell you something.

73
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:08,359
That day, I left my lipstick mark

74
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,920
on your t-shirt.

75
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,320
She thought we got back together again.

76
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:17,000
That's why she gave up entirely on you.

77
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:20,679
Do you think she'll still forgive you?

78
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,959
Do you even know who you are right now?

79
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,320
Lu Li,

80
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,559
come here.

81
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:13,200
Director Gao,

82
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,279
can I help you?

83
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,640
I have a file that I was supposed to
show to Mr. Lu.

84
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,920
I think I deleted it by accident.

85
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,000
Can you restore the file for me?

86
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:19,959
I can.

87
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,040
When did you delete it?

88
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,000
A few days ago.

89
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:23,760
All right.

90
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,040
Let me take a look.

91
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,140
(Data Recovery)

92
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,279
Is this the file?

93
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,640
What I want is last year's
wage summary sheet.

94
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:58,040
But I've restored everything
you deleted for the past week.

95
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,440
This is the only file I got.

96
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,480
I'm sure I've deleted it.

97
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,000
All right.

98
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:07,279
I'll give it another try.

99
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,839
Please take a look

100
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,720
and see if your file is in these.

101
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,000
It isn't there.

102
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,720
Do you even know how to do your job?

103
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,480
She joined the company
through backdoor means.

104
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,160
What can you expect from her?

105
00:07:30,359 --> 00:07:31,239
Lu Li,

106
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:34,000
you can tell me directly
if you're not good at your work.

107
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:36,239
Since Mr. Lu was the one
who recommended you,

108
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,839
I won't make things difficult for you.

109
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,480
But there's no need for you
to make all these trash

110
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,079
to waste my time.

111
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,559
Where's last year's payroll record?

112
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,160
Why do you need that?

113
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:47,119
Don't tell me you want to
redo it right now?

114
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,720
I need to remind you.

115
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,519
Two people from our department

116
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,119
spent half a month completing that.

117
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,320
Where's the file?

118
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,239
I got it.

119
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:25,679
Lu Li,

120
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,040
what exactly are you doing?

121
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,799
Do you know we can start a new project

122
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,679
with the time you're wasting right now?

123
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,640
Done.

124
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,479
(Payroll of December 2020)
That's impossible.

125
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,200
That's right.

126
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,520
This is the one.

127
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,200
She used barely five minutes
to complete it.

128
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,840
How did you do it?

129
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,359
When you use Microsoft Excel
to deal with data,

130
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,679
you need to key in the data
multiple times.

131
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,000
But it is embedded with VBA Programming.

132
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,200
It can store high numbers
of repetitive functions

133
00:08:56,359 --> 00:08:58,840
as a VBA code.

134
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,679
Director Gao,

135
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:15,400
I think you should be more careful

136
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:17,239
with the files our colleagues
have worked so hard on.

137
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:20,599
If you wish to learn about
report automation,

138
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,359
you can come to me at any time.

139
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:24,919
I don't mind wasting my time
to teach you.

140
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:38,960
Lu Li!

141
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,599
You were so cool just now.

142
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,200
That was satisfying.

143
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,479
I don't think I'm that cool.

144
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,840
Before I became a network manager,

145
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,320
I was a programmer.

146
00:09:47,479 --> 00:09:49,840
She'll only embarrass herself
when she challenges me.

147
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,679
Actually, Director Gao
didn't delete the file.

148
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,520
She just wanted to
make things difficult for you.

149
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,559
I know.

150
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,880
The computers will never deceive us.

151
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,679
Lu Li,

152
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,679
you are so cool.

153
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:06,559
I will surely court you
if you were a man.

154
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,559
If you want a programmer as a boyfriend,

155
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:11,400
I can introduce some to you.

156
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,520
Sure!

157
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,559
It's best if they're as capable as you.

158
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:17,200
I want a man who can make
my report automation come true.

159
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,799
Actually,

160
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:21,200
you can use your time
in filling out the datasheet

161
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:23,159
to learn VBA Programming.

162
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,840
If you do so, you won't need to
worry about it in the future.

163
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,719
You're right.

164
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,679
I always heard people
talking about programming.

165
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,479
So, what exactly is programming?

166
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:33,599
Actually, programming

167
00:10:33,719 --> 00:10:36,159
is the process where
humans interact with computers.

168
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:40,559
You mean humans can give orders
to other humans,

169
00:10:40,719 --> 00:10:42,760
and even computers
by using different languages?

170
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,799
Is that what you mean?

171
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,159
That's right.

172
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,119
By using certain words,
sentences and formats

173
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:50,239
that computers can comprehend,

174
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,000
you can form a source code
when you place them together.

175
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,239
The process where we write source codes

176
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,280
is called programming.

177
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,479
Thank you for leading me
into a new world.

178
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:04,119
Master, please accept my bow.

179
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,760
You may drop the formality.

180
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,599
In the future,
if you wish to learn programming,

181
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,000
you can come to me at any time.

182
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,919
That's great.

183
00:11:11,359 --> 00:11:14,159
From now on, I will unshackle myself

184
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,719
and proceed to become
a master of administration.

185
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:40,520
My dear Li!

186
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:41,840
You are having your meal.

187
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:46,919
Let me show you my fruits of labour.

188
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:49,280
Are you only having vegetables?

189
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:51,520
You should have some meat.
You shouldn't be this stingy on yourself.

190
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:52,559
I can pay them for you.

191
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:54,320
I just don't feel like eating meat.

192
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,760
I feel like puking
when I smell meat lately.

193
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,119
Why do women have to suffer so much?

194
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,719
Not only do we have
to bleed every month,

195
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,880
but we also need to bear the pain
of giving birth.

196
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,039
Tell me, why do men

197
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,559
have the privilege to be carefree then?

198
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:07,280
This is so unfair.

199
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,880
Wait, why did I mention that scum?

200
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,320
I saw him last night.

201
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,520
What?

202
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:22,840
Did he go to find you?

203
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:26,479
I think he's here on a business trip.

204
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,400
But he didn't see me.

205
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:30,280
He must be a toxic person.

206
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,280
He's still haunting you

207
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,880
even though you went somewhere far away.

208
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:33,799
Forget it.

209
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,719
Let's forget about him.

210
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:38,760
How's the progress with your neighbour?

211
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,640
Don't spout nonsense. He's my boss.

212
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:43,719
Will your boss send you to work
and pick you up every day?

213
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:45,280
We're staying in the same building.

214
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,520
I guess only a person like you
won't notice it.

215
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,840
Look at how he's treating you.

216
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:49,880
It's obvious that
he's interested in you.

217
00:12:50,599 --> 00:12:52,400
Look at the condition I'm in right now.

218
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:53,719
How could I ruin his future?

219
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,640
How is this ruining his future?

220
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,840
Don't tell me you wish to stay single
for the rest of your life?

221
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,479
But it's better for you to be cautious.

222
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,080
What if he's a playboy

223
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,599
and he flirts with
every girl beside him?

224
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,919
Did you receive the local speciality
that I had sent to you?

225
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:07,960
I think they've arrived.

226
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:09,719
I haven't opened the parcel
I received just now.

227
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,640
Give me a second.

228
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,719
Lu Li,

229
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,840
look.

230
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,640
I didn't buy that for you.

231
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,119
Tianqi's dad made it for me.

232
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:50,599
I'm sure that he's flirting with me.

233
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:54,119
But it's unfortunate that
I've fallen for him.

234
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:58,000
Don't tell me you're dating him online?

235
00:13:58,239 --> 00:14:01,520
What if he's a sleazy middle-aged man?

236
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,760
What should you do by then?

237
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,400
I don't think that will happen.

238
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,159
He's a great artist.

239
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,760
He even knows
how to make clay sculptures.

240
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,000
He's gentle, kind, and humorous.

241
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:11,880
Even if he's not Prince Charming,

242
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:14,320
I guess he's an artistic youth.

243
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:17,239
I think it's best for you
to meet him in person.

244
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:18,440
If he doesn't live up
to your expectations,

245
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:20,679
you can give up on him sooner.

246
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,320
You're right.

247
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:23,840
I should meet him in person.

248
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,440
If he's a great guy,

249
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:27,719
I can be his girlfriend officially

250
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,440
so that no one can steal him from me.

251
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:31,400
All right.

252
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,760
I'll stop disturbing you.

253
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,479
Remember

254
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:34,919
to eat more meat, all right?

255
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:35,840
Goodbye.

256
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,280
Goodbye.

257
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,239
The hotpot seasoning is great.

258
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:48,840
So delicious.

259
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:51,159
The hotpot seasoning is tasty indeed.

260
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,559
Are you a deliveryman?

261
00:14:58,359 --> 00:14:59,479
Who are you looking for?

262
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,599
Why aren't you knocking?

263
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,919
Don't tell me he's still here?

264
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:16,000
I'll call the cops
if you continue knocking.

265
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:18,000
Caixia, it's me.

266
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:19,799
It's Sister Wang.

267
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:21,239
Coming!

268
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,359
I'll get the door.

269
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:23,880
Coming.

270
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,320
Sister Wang.

271
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:27,559
Caixia.

272
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,039
Mum.

273
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,080
Mum?

274
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,400
Is this your son-in-law?

275
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,520
He's handsome indeed.

276
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:37,280
This...

277
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,039
Look at the number of things
he brought with him.

278
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
My child, hurry and enter.

279
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,320
Thank you, aunt.

280
00:15:43,119 --> 00:15:44,119
Caixia,

281
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,200
your son-in-law is top-notch indeed.

282
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,400
You did a great job at hiding him away.

283
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,200
The people in our dance group

284
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,479
kept gossiping about your daughter.

285
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,119
They said Li had a bad husband.

286
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,320
Some people even say that
she got a remarried husband.

287
00:15:58,479 --> 00:16:00,280
You have great tolerance indeed.

288
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,799
Are these dumplings for us?

289
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:05,280
Thank you.

290
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:05,919
See you next time.

291
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:06,479
Goodbye.

292
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,640
Thank you.

293
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:12,840
Dad,

294
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,960
Mum.

295
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:16,320
This...

296
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:19,080
These are the local specialities
I brought back from Chongqing.

297
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,440
Please try them.

298
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,239
- Why did you go to Chongqing?
- Why did you go to Chongqing?

299
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:27,000
My company is working together
with a company in Chongqing.

300
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,159
We don't lack food here.

301
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,520
I think you can keep them for yourself.

302
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,000
But I'm already here.

303
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:37,280
Just try them.

304
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,100
(Chongqing's local delicacies)

305
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,719
Did you guys go to Chongqing as well?

306
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:52,679
I have friends all over the world.

307
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,479
Yeah.

308
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,000
My friend in Chongqing sent them to me.

309
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,479
He's right.

310
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,880
It's none of your business.
Hurry and leave.

311
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:57,960
Just leave.

312
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,200
I won't interrupt your meal then.

313
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,020
(From Chongqing to Xinhai, Lu)

314
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,040
Look.

315
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,800
Why did you leave the boxes here?

316
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,880
Did Lu Li send them here?

317
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
- No!
- No!

318
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,000
Is Lu Li in Chongqing?

319
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,199
- No.
- No.

320
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,319
Thank you, Dad, Mum.

321
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,239
Chongqing's hotpot is pretty good.

322
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,000
Why did he thank us?

323
00:17:42,439 --> 00:17:45,079
He didn't realise it, did he?

324
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,599
It's because of your stupid boxes!

325
00:17:46,719 --> 00:17:47,680
I already told you to throw them away!

326
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,119
But you couldn't bear
to throw them away.

327
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:49,680
Wait.

328
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,079
It's because I was busy preparing
the ingredients just now.

329
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:52,959
You could've thrown it away
if you watched less drama.

330
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,560
I do every other chore in the house.

331
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,079
Tell me, what have you done
for the family?

332
00:17:57,199 --> 00:17:58,199
Fine.

333
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:00,040
You're always right.

334
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,760
Enough.

335
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:02,359
We should stop arguing.

336
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:04,640
We must do something
about this situation.

337
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,119
It would be good

338
00:18:08,439 --> 00:18:10,079
if they could reconcile with each other.

339
00:18:10,439 --> 00:18:11,599
Reconcile with each other?

340
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:13,640
Do you want him to bully Li again?

341
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,040
No way in hell!

342
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:16,439
Let's finish our meal.

343
00:18:22,439 --> 00:18:23,319
Yiming,

344
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:25,040
I need to head to Chongqing.

345
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,520
This might be a long trip.

346
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:28,400
I'll leave the company to you.

347
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,199
Didn't you just return?

348
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,839
Is something wrong with the contract?

349
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:33,359
It's more important than that.

350
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:34,680
Call me if anything happens.

351
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,719
I'll hang up now.

352
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,640
I guess I must've owed
you and your brother

353
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,400
a huge debt in my past life.

354
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,479
I feel like puking.

355
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,400
Now, you feel like puking.

356
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,280
What were you thinking
when you were drinking?

357
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:53,520
I didn't drink for fun.

358
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,680
I drank to get rid of my troubles.

359
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:00,079
Drank to get rid of your troubles? Sure?

360
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,839
Of course.

361
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:06,000
My sister's boyfriend cheated on her.

362
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:09,160
My brother had a divorce.

363
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:12,199
The person I like doesn't like me.

364
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,920
It's too hard for me!

365
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:18,520
Your makeup will be smeared
if you continue to cry.

366
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:22,560
Yiming,

367
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,400
tell me. Why isn't our relationship
proceeding smoothly?

368
00:19:30,439 --> 00:19:32,359
When you like someone,

369
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,359
it doesn't necessarily mean
that they'll like you back.

370
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:39,239
I need to donate my money.

371
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,839
But why?

372
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:46,319
I'm sure it's because I'm too rich.

373
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:51,160
That's why God is taking away
my love from me.

374
00:19:53,479 --> 00:19:55,319
When will you reach home in this state?

375
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,439
Let me carry you on my back.

376
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:05,800
Can you carry me on your back
for the rest of your life?

377
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,400
Only until I send you home.

378
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,560
Yiming, thank you
for picking me up.

379
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:17,560
Thank you for picking me up.

380
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:20,479
I can't return home.

381
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,439
My parents will give me a beating.

382
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,760
I told you I couldn't return home.

383
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:28,079
Did you hear me?

384
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:30,920
What? Don't tell me you want
to stay in a hotel?

385
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:33,680
I don't want to stay in a hotel.

386
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,079
I don't want to stay in a hotel!

387
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:37,079
I don't want to stay in a hotel!

388
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:38,760
Fine. What about my house?

389
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,520
All right.

390
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,479
Go!

391
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:56,439
I need water.

392
00:21:37,719 --> 00:21:40,160
I finally managed to sleep on his bed!

393
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:49,959
That fool!

394
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,680
Why are you wearing my shirt?

395
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,520
I smell like alcohol.

396
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:36,000
But you didn't even
change my clothes for me.

397
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:37,359
You're annoying.

398
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:39,359
Go and wash up.

399
00:22:39,479 --> 00:22:41,040
Breakfast will be ready soon.

400
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,520
Don't move.

401
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,479
Zitong, stop messing around.

402
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,319
I dreamt about this scene before.

403
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,319
Let me enjoy this moment once again.

404
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,119
I should've sent you home last night.

405
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:17,479
Go and wash up.

406
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,239
Breakfast will be ready soon.

407
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,280
Yiming,

408
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,239
why don't you dare to look at me?

409
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,839
Is it because
I look attractive right now?

410
00:23:32,439 --> 00:23:34,359
I think you should
look at yourself in the mirror.

411
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:06,479
Why did I use toothpaste?

412
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:11,280
Zitong, are you done?

413
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,160
Breakfast is ready.

414
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,640
Zitong,

415
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,079
come and have your breakfast.

416
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,800
Just ignore me.
I'm too embarrassed to face you.

417
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,173
(Hangout)

418
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:34,040
Hello.

419
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:35,439
Hello.

420
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,319
Did your company

421
00:24:36,439 --> 00:24:38,359
hire an employee called Lu Li lately?

422
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,079
This is her picture.

423
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,280
I'm sorry.

424
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:43,239
We didn't hire her.

425
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:45,560
Thank you.

426
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,620
(Namelist of tech companies)

427
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:18,060
(Lu Li, tracing family member)

428
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,359
Hello, mister.

429
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,359
(The 47th Floor)
Hello,

430
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:32,800
I wish to pass a message to my wife

431
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,199
(The 47th Floor Food Stall)
using this platform.

432
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:35,920
All right.

433
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,439
So, what do you wish
to say to your wife?

434
00:25:41,199 --> 00:25:43,880
Lu Li, I'm sorry.

435
00:25:46,239 --> 00:25:47,599
I'm at Chongqing.

436
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:50,920
Can we meet up?

437
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,839
I'm still using the same phone number.

438
00:26:10,199 --> 00:26:12,400
I heard that you came to Chongqing.

439
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:14,880
I'm here for my private matter.

440
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,239
What private matter?

441
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,599
Do you need help?

442
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,239
I'm here to find my wife.

443
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:20,920
You don't even have a girlfriend.

444
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,439
Since when did you get yourself a wife?

445
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:23,920
Are you helping me or not?

446
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:25,079
Of course.

447
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,119
I want to see

448
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,040
what kind of woman she is.

449
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,239
She has great taste for dumping you.

450
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,640
I'll hang up for now.

451
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:32,599
Wait.

452
00:26:32,719 --> 00:26:34,359
Come and sign the contract.

453
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:35,800
After that, I'll treat you to a meal.

454
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,000
We'll celebrate our cooperation.

455
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,400
Mainly, I want to
understand your situation

456
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,319
so that I can help you find your wife,

457
00:26:40,439 --> 00:26:41,160
am I right?

458
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:42,839
Sure.

459
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,000
Mr. Lu, looks like
you're in a good mood today.

460
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:03,000
The guy I hated the most

461
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,719
was dumped by his wife.

462
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,920
He reaped what he sowed.

463
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:09,319
All of the ladies I fancied
went to court him.

464
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,079
I'm curious about the lady

465
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,119
who had avenged me.

466
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:15,839
Sign here.

467
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:24,119
I heard that you were accepting
students in the company.

468
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,839
I'm doing it to increase
the company's work efficiency.

469
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,760
Boss, will you add my salary?

470
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Only my girlfriend can spend my money.

471
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,640
Why don't you

472
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,599
give it a try?

473
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,119
Do you want me to quit?

474
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,000
You're no fun.

475
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:39,520
Don't you know that it's a joke?

476
00:27:42,439 --> 00:27:43,560
I won't increase your salary.

477
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,160
But I can treat you to a meal.

478
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,719
Let me bring you out

479
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,079
for a feast today.

480
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,119
You can forget about it.

481
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,760
I'm used to sleeping early
and waking up early.

482
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,479
You're wasting your beautiful youth.

483
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,839
Honestly speaking,

484
00:27:58,119 --> 00:27:59,760
I don't know what happened
to you in the past.

485
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:01,839
But since you came to a new city,

486
00:28:01,959 --> 00:28:02,959
if you wish to start anew,

487
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:04,479
you shouldn't isolate yourself.

488
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,839
You need to interact with others
more often.

489
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,079
At least, you should
make yourself happier.

490
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,239
Mr. Lu, since you wish
to treat me to a meal,

491
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,800
I won't stand on ceremony then.

492
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,479
Mr. Lu,

493
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,239
have you ever heard of the saying
"Heaven spares nobody"?

494
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,359
Maybe, you'll experience the same fate

495
00:28:23,719 --> 00:28:25,000
as your friend in the future.

496
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,520
Bye.

497
00:28:33,199 --> 00:28:33,920
Thanks.

498
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,439
I think the people we referred to
have the same name,

499
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,800
but their age doesn't match.

500
00:28:40,199 --> 00:28:41,239
Lu Li?

501
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:49,640
Sorry about that.

502
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,040
You're here.

503
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,359
Have a seat.

504
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:09,359
Mr. Lu, was this what you meant
by treating me to a meal?

505
00:29:09,719 --> 00:29:10,199
Yeah.

506
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:11,760
It just so happens that
I need to welcome my guest as well.

507
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,839
That's why I called everyone here.

508
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,599
Don't tell me you don't wish to see us?

509
00:29:16,479 --> 00:29:18,040
I would've stayed home

510
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,400
if I knew this would happen.

511
00:29:20,479 --> 00:29:21,079
My guest will arrive soon.

512
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:21,400
Come.

513
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,239
Sit beside me.

514
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:23,040
All right.

515
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,800
By the way, Gao Xi,

516
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,160
later,

517
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:29,640
Mr. Jiang will sit here.

518
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,920
You must attend to his needs.

519
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,560
No problem.

520
00:29:31,719 --> 00:29:32,719
Mr. Jiang?

521
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:33,959
That's right.

522
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:34,959
Mr. Lu prepared this feast

523
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:37,719
to welcome Mr. Jiang
from Enchant Technology.

524
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,280
Don't tell me you don't know?

525
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:43,079
Sorry for being late.

526
00:29:44,439 --> 00:29:44,959
Mr. Jiang.

527
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:46,160
You're finally here.

528
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,640
I guess the VIP is always
the last person to arrive, huh?

529
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:53,760
Did you go to find your wife?

530
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,719
Let me introduce them to you.

531
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,319
This is Lu Li, our company's
network manager.

532
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,079
She's our junior as well.

533
00:30:19,199 --> 00:30:20,439
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

534
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,439
What?

535
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,719
Do you two know each other?

536
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,199
No, we don't.

537
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:29,839
We...

538
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:33,800
All right.

539
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,439
Come.

540
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,119
Let's welcome Mr. Jiang with a toast.

541
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,880
Welcome.

542
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,439
Mr. Jiang is not a stranger.

543
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,680
You don't need to be shy.

544
00:30:51,959 --> 00:30:52,479
Dig in.

545
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,719
Put on some weight.

546
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,359
Miss Lu, since you graduated from
the University of Xinhai,

547
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,160
why did you come to work in Chongqing?

548
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:03,560
I like Chongqing.

549
00:31:04,719 --> 00:31:06,920
I heard that you majored in
Computer Science.

550
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,920
Isn't it a waste for you to
be a network manager at a film company?

551
00:31:10,199 --> 00:31:11,599
Why didn't you become a programmer?

552
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,199
That concerns my privacy.
I do not wish to answer that.

553
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:23,599
Mr. Jiang, I haven't
offered you a toast.

554
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,640
Since we know each other,

555
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,800
let's drop the formality.

556
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,280
If so, Mr. Jiang, let me offer you
a personal toast

557
00:31:29,479 --> 00:31:32,079
as my acknowledgement
of your talent and good looking.

558
00:31:32,199 --> 00:31:33,079
Can I do so?

559
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:36,119
A beauty is offering you a toast.
If you don't drink it,

560
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,520
you're not a gentleman.

561
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:39,359
Cheers.

562
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,439
You may do as you please.

563
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:50,040
Thanks.

564
00:32:02,199 --> 00:32:03,839
It's rare for the three of us

565
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,680
to gather at the same place
after graduation.

566
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,079
Junior,

567
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,760
don't you think you need to
offer your senior a toast?

568
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,439
Mr. Lu, I can't drink.

569
00:32:13,239 --> 00:32:14,199
Are you sure you can't drink?

570
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,000
Or, are you refusing to drink
because Mr. Jiang is around?

571
00:32:16,239 --> 00:32:18,680
I don't think it's good for you
to act so arrogantly.

572
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,319
It's inconvenient for me to drink today.

573
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,640
Mr. Jiang, if you don't mind,

574
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,199
I would like to
replace my wine with juice.

575
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,359
Lu Li, you don't know your place at all.

576
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:33,040
I don't mind.

577
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:49,239
Our junior isn't drinking with you

578
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:51,520
because you aren't
as important as I am to her.

579
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,040
Come, Junior. We should drink

580
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,599
when we're this close to each other.

581
00:32:57,199 --> 00:32:58,119
Jingwen,

582
00:32:58,239 --> 00:32:59,400
I'll drink on her behalf.

583
00:33:09,719 --> 00:33:10,680
Bottoms up.

584
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:25,119
I finally understand
why you're not drinking.

585
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,119
It's because you become a hoodlum
after you drink.

586
00:33:28,719 --> 00:33:29,680
Darling,

587
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,800
I've finally found you.

588
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:33,680
Give me a hug.

589
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:38,599
Can you see closely before you hug me?

590
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,119
I'm not your wife.

591
00:33:42,199 --> 00:33:43,640
It's you.

592
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,560
I was wrong.

593
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,680
Will you please forgive me?

594
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,439
Jiang Yicheng,

595
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,839
get your dirty hands off me.

596
00:33:50,959 --> 00:33:51,520
No!

597
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,719
You're disgusting.

598
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:53,359
Get away from me.

599
00:33:53,479 --> 00:33:54,880
You're not allowed to push me away!

600
00:33:54,959 --> 00:33:55,959
I was wrong.

601
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:56,800
Forgive me.

602
00:33:59,959 --> 00:34:01,239
Lu Li,

603
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:03,800
please drive faster.

604
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:05,400
I can't take it anymore.

605
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,040
All right.

606
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,880
Darling, give me a hug.

607
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,159
(He drank so much just now. Will he...)

608
00:35:14,399 --> 00:35:15,199
(I'll drink on her behalf.)

609
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,280
(Darling, I finally found you.)

610
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:29,439
(I was wrong.
Will you please forgive me?)

611
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:29,679
Why are you here?

612
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:33,239
Do you think I wish to sleep with you?

613
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,520
You were the one
who wanted to sleep with me.

614
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,360
You've tainted my reputation.

615
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:39,439
Where's Lu Li?

616
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,120
Of course she's at her own house.

617
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:42,600
What?

618
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,479
Don't tell me you want her to serve you?

619
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:46,239
It's your honour

620
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,280
to be served by a person like me.

621
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,560
Last night, you called me your darling
and you kept hugging me.

622
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,639
I was drunk.

623
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:14,679
One's true nature will be revealed
when they get drunk.

624
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,199
Speaking of which,
when did you get married?

625
00:37:17,479 --> 00:37:18,679
Why didn't I hear about it at all?

626
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,760
Why did she dump you in the first place?

627
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,879
Did you cheat on her?
Or did she cheat on you?

628
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,520
Don't use your standard

629
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,120
to measure our relationship.

630
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:30,040
You should at least
reveal something to me.

631
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:31,520
You're making me very curious.

632
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:33,399
So, what kind of girl

633
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,080
can torture you in this way?

634
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,120
Do you have any pictures of her?
Let me have a look.

635
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,600
Are you kidding me?

636
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:54,560
Is this your wife?

637
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,239
Later, I'll follow you
to your company for an inspection.

638
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,320
Inspection?

639
00:37:58,239 --> 00:37:59,120
Aren't you leaving?

640
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,320
I'm not leaving.

641
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,120
Is this the car you rented?

642
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,439
What? Do you have something to say?

643
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,120
I thought

644
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:22,360
you would rent an expensive car
which feeds on petrol.

645
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,959
I didn't expect you
to rent an electric car.

646
00:38:25,479 --> 00:38:27,159
It's better for the environment.

647
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,439
Pardon me for my rudeness.

648
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:35,600
She's here.

649
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,439
Junior.

650
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:43,879
Mr. Jiang will fetch us today.

651
00:38:47,479 --> 00:38:48,120
No thanks.

652
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:49,080
I'll take public transport.

653
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:50,360
I need to go to your company anyway.

654
00:38:50,439 --> 00:38:51,840
And last night, you drove us back.

655
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,639
Precisely.

656
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,600
You don't need to stand on ceremony.

657
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,560
Get in the car.

658
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,159
Your seat belt.

659
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,320
What? Did the music offend you?

660
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:43,639
It's too noisy.

661
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,120
You have such a lousy personality.

662
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,959
It's no wonder your wife left you.

663
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,239
Fine.

664
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,479
I'll stop adding salt to your wound.

665
00:39:57,639 --> 00:39:59,600
What's with the silver strip?

666
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,760
It looks so shabby.

667
00:40:00,879 --> 00:40:02,959
I'll give you
a better accessory next time.

668
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,320
No need for that.

669
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,479
This is the only one of its kind.

670
00:40:06,919 --> 00:40:09,399
Is this some kind of top-quality
product that I have never heard of?

671
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:16,199
My wife made this herself.

672
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,639
Why are you hanging all these
accessories on a car you rented?

673
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,560
I remember that you hate

674
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:24,639
these kinds of accessories in the past.

675
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,159
My wife loved them.

676
00:40:26,879 --> 00:40:29,080
What's with you referring to her
in every sentence you speak?

677
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,439
So, what made her leave you
in the first place?

678
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,479
It's fine.

679
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,760
Junior, you'll keep this a secret, right?

680
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:43,800
She's asleep. You can tell me.

681
00:40:43,919 --> 00:40:45,120
Lower your volume.

682
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:01,919
By the way,

683
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,479
I need to attend a meeting later.

684
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:05,560
I'll ask Gao Xi to bring you around.

685
00:41:05,879 --> 00:41:08,040
I wish to know more about
your company's network management.

686
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,000
Why did you come to a film company
to know more about network management?

687
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,239
Maybe it's because I'm a programmer.

688
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,800
I think you two have
a common interest then.

689
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,040
Junior,

690
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,520
I'll leave him to you then.

691
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:21,639
Show him how amazing
our Network Department is.

692
00:41:22,399 --> 00:41:23,280
All right.

693
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:24,959
See you.

694
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:34,040
Mr. Jiang,

695
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,000
is there anything
you would like to know?

696
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,040
I wish to know

697
00:41:38,399 --> 00:41:39,719
how you're doing lately.

698
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:45,000
If there's nothing else,

699
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:46,840
I'll ask Director Gao
to take over from here.

700
00:41:47,399 --> 00:41:48,280
Lu Li,

701
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:51,040
there's no need for you
to be this formal with me.

702
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:52,919
Mr. Jiang,

703
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,639
I'm afraid you found the wrong person.

704
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,840
I'm not responsible for
any of the company's projects.

705
00:41:57,159 --> 00:41:59,239
Naturally, I have nothing to say to you.

706
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:02,840
You knew that I was not here
because of those projects.

707
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:05,719
If that's the case, there's no reason
for us to speak at all.

708
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,439
We need to have a chat.

709
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,120
When will you stop ignoring me?

710
00:42:47,879 --> 00:42:49,239
Are you here to sign
the divorce agreement?

711
00:42:49,399 --> 00:42:50,159
No.

712
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,479
If that's the case,
I have nothing to say to you.

713
00:42:55,159 --> 00:42:56,919
Is our divorce the only thing
between us right now?

714
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,479
Aren't you curious

715
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,840
as to why I chose to stay here?

716
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,600
I don't care.

717
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,639
Mr. Jiang,

718
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:09,959
please excuse me.

719
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,280
I still have work to do.

720
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,959
You're different now.

721
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:23,560
Gao Xi,

722
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:24,760
did you see Lu Li?

723
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,320
No.

724
00:43:25,439 --> 00:43:26,399
I'm looking for her as well.

725
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,760
Strange. Where did she go?

726
00:43:28,879 --> 00:43:29,959
If you see her, tell her
to come to my office.

727
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:30,800
My computer broke down.

728
00:43:30,959 --> 00:43:31,919
All right.

729
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,479
What's wrong?

730
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,120
Are you afraid that they'll
know about our relationship?

731
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:43,159
We're...

732
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,080
You better shut up
if you don't want me to quit.

733
00:43:55,919 --> 00:43:57,239
Are you a dog?

734
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,000
Lu Li, did you see Mr. Jiang?

735
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,639
He's at the depository.

736
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,520
All right.

737
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:16,719
Mr. Lu was looking for you.

738
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:17,760
Got it.

739
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:23,879
Mr. Jiang,

740
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:25,959
Mr. Lu told me to attend to your needs.

741
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,159
Please tell me if you need anything.

742
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,120
I'm quite curious about something.

743
00:44:31,239 --> 00:44:32,040
Last night, when we were having dinner,

744
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:34,080
I saw that Lu Li and Mr. Lu

745
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:35,239
were quite close to each other.

746
00:44:35,399 --> 00:44:36,439
What kind of relationship do they have?

747
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,639
Mr. Jiang,

748
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:38,800
I'm just an employee.

749
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,840
I don't think it's suitable for me
to gossip about my boss.

750
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,959
Are you implying

751
00:44:44,439 --> 00:44:45,639
that they have another relationship
with each other

752
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,800
besides being a boss and an employee?

753
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,439
I don't know the exact details.

754
00:44:49,639 --> 00:44:50,639
I just know

755
00:44:50,879 --> 00:44:52,760
that Mr. Lu brought her
into our company.

756
00:44:52,959 --> 00:44:53,919
Many colleagues

757
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,120
saw them coming to work
and returning from work together.

758
00:44:56,479 --> 00:44:58,120
And Lu Li

759
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:00,199
frequents Mr. Lu's office.

760
00:45:00,439 --> 00:45:02,679
Lu Li may seem innocent,

761
00:45:02,959 --> 00:45:05,840
but she's pretty devious.

762
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,639
I wonder what she did

763
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,840
to make Mr. Lu care so much about her.

764
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,080
Mr. Jiang,

765
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,879
Mr. Lu is your friend.

766
00:45:13,159 --> 00:45:15,439
I think you should advise him
to be wary of her if possible.

767
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:19,879
Director Gao,

768
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,199
I heard that you're from Chongqing.

769
00:45:21,439 --> 00:45:22,199
That's right.

770
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,719
Mr. Jiang, if you're interested in
exploring Chongqing,

771
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,439
I'm happy to be your tour guide.

772
00:45:27,399 --> 00:45:29,760
I heard that there are ten must-eat
snacks when people visit Chongqing.

773
00:45:29,919 --> 00:45:31,439
Please buy all of them for me
before lunch break.

774
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:32,600
Before lunch break?

775
00:45:32,879 --> 00:45:34,959
I'm afraid I can't make it in time.

776
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,439
And some of them are hot dishes.

777
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:38,479
I'm afraid they'll be cold
when I bring them back.

778
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:40,679
I heard from Jingwen

779
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,439
that you're the most capable person
in his company.

780
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:44,919
Don't tell me you can't even
complete an easy task like this?

781
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,120
Mr. Jiang, if this is your wish,

782
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,840
I'll do my best to achieve it.

783
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:51,639
I'll go and buy them right now.

784
00:46:00,439 --> 00:46:01,600
What kind of lousy computer is this?

785
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:03,239
It logged out instantly
when I just logged in.

786
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,719
My friends are waiting for me
to join their game.

787
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,800
Your computer wasn't designed
for gaming in the first place.

788
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,560
I'm done.

789
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:13,120
Miss Lu, you're amazing.

790
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,800
Why don't you take me in
as your disciple?

791
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,360
I only accept female students.

792
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,679
I decline.

793
00:46:20,959 --> 00:46:23,040
Say, regarding the drivers...

794
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:24,520
What are you guys doing?

795
00:46:26,439 --> 00:46:30,399
(Correcting the wrong codes
is much harder than writing new codes.)

796
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,199
(Just like a relationship,)

797
00:46:32,399 --> 00:46:35,840
(it's tough to resolve
the misunderstandings between couples.)

798
00:46:36,479 --> 00:46:38,080
(Instead of wasting our time on it,)

799
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,000
(it's better for us
to put down the past temporarily)

800
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:41,439
(and follow our heart.)
