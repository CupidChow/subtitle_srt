So, you've finally returned...

22
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:56,440
Yicheng.

23
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,440
Is it you?

24
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:01,279
Why are you here at this late hour?

25
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,919
Aren't you going to let me in?

26
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,440
Actually, I heard

27
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,440
that you and Lu Li had a divorce.

28
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:43,679
Where did you hear that?

29
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,039
Zitong told me by accident.

30
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,000
Everyone in the company
knows about it now.

31
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,160
They said it's because of me.

32
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,399
This has nothing to do with you.

33
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,919
That's a relief.

34
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,839
If Lu Li has any misunderstandings
about our relationship,

35
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,440
I can explain it to her personally.

36
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,279
You have nothing to explain to her.

37
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,360
I don't even know why
she filed for a divorce.

38
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,800
I told you already.
A young girl like her

39
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,720
is unpredictable.

40
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,679
I guess she must be tired
of the relationship.

41
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,039
Tired of it?

42
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:21,080
Yeah.

43
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,320
Actually, I knew
you were forced to marry her.

44
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,199
Actually, having a divorce

45
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,119
can at least cover your losses.

46
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,080
Who told you I was forced to marry her?

47
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,800
That's not the point.

48
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,759
The point is you're free now.

49
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:39,759
Lu Li is still young.

50
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,039
She's reckless.

51
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,559
She never thinks

52
00:03:42,559 --> 00:03:43,360
from your perspective.

53
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,320
After my observation,

54
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,800
I think she doesn't suit you at all.

55
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,119
It's a good thing for you two
to be separated.

56
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:50,960
I know the best
whether she suits me or not.

57
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,440
I don't need you
to remind me about that.

58
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,679
Your wound hasn't fully recovered yet.

59
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,600
You should return and rest.

60
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,199
Sorry.

61
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,440
If my words made you uncomfortable,

62
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:14,639
I'll apologize for it.

63
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,079
I'm just worried about you.

64
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,320
I just feel troubled as there are
too many things to do lately.

65
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,000
You should return.

66
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,399
All right.

67
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,640
Rest well, all right?

68
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:25,799
I'll return first.

69
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,760
(It's fine.)

70
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:52,640
(We still have a long way to go.)

71
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,000
(Yicheng,)

72
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,920
(you'll definitely
return to my side one day.)

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,880
(Lu Li,)

74
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:17,119
(why are you still fantasising about him?)

75
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,119
What are you doing?

76
00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:54,160
I was watching my drama, you know?

77
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,200
The news will begin soon.

78
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,799
I know you love drama,

79
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,959
but we need to be concerned with
national affairs as well,

80
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:00,959
am I right?

81
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,839
National affairs?

82
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,920
You're not even concerned with
your family affairs.

83
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:09,359
Did you buy the free-range chicken
for our daughter?

84
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:13,839
This...

85
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,279
I didn't manage to buy it.

86
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:17,440
It was sold out when I went there.

87
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,000
Who's that?

88
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,040
At this late hour?

89
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,399
Coming.

90
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,880
Li, why are you back at this late hour?

91
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,079
Where's Jiang?

92
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,160
Didn't he send you back?

93
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,279
I came back alone.

94
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:38,519
Li, come in.

95
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:38,959
Come.

96
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,399
Come in.

97
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,440
Come in.

98
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,519
Are you going on a business trip?

99
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,000
Dad, Mum,

100
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:55,839
I resigned from my job.

101
00:07:11,239 --> 00:07:12,000
Dad,

102
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,880
do we still have any
Instant Cardio-Reliever Pill?

103
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,239
I think so.

104
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,079
Please get it for me.

105
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:22,399
You guys can take it

106
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,000
if you experience any chest pain later.

107
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,200
Wait.

108
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,559
I think our hearts are pretty healthy.

109
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,440
Tell us.

110
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,239
What happened between
you and Jiang Yicheng?

111
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,320
The person he truly fancies has returned.

112
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,640
So,

113
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,160
I choose to back out
of the relationship.

114
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:47,359
Back out?

115
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:49,200
What do you mean?

116
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,559
You guys are married, you know?

117
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,160
Dad,

118
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,160
Mum,

119
00:07:58,679 --> 00:07:59,799
I'm sorry.

120
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,480
I failed.

121
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,640
What do you mean by saying you failed?

122
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,559
When did it happen?

123
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,320
Today.

124
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
Have you completed the procedures?

125
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:12,079
Not yet.

126
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,399
I've signed the divorce settlement.

127
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,239
Divorce?

128
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,600
Wait.

129
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,920
Are you guys having a divorce?

130
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:22,640
Li,

131
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,799
be honest with me, okay?

132
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:28,200
Did Jiang Yicheng force you
to go for a divorce?

133
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,119
I'll look for him.

134
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,799
Dad,

135
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,159
I made the decision myself.

136
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,280
But why?

137
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,919
When you got married, you told me

138
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,479
that you were more afraid of
having regrets than of failing.

139
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:54,320
Do you regret your decision now?

140
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:07,159
I don't.

141
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:12,000
Without this period,

142
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,520
I can never understand how it feels like

143
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,239
to contribute to one's relationship
in a unilateral way.

144
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:19,679
You'll never win a person's heart

145
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,119
by giving in all the time
while disregarding your principles.

146
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,479
Mum,

147
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,760
I was the one
who forced the marriage to happen.

148
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,200
Now, everything is back
to its original place.

149
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:49,080
Good.

150
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,479
Where are you going?

151
00:09:54,599 --> 00:09:55,880
I'm going to sleep.

152
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,479
Wait.

153
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:56,960
You...

154
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,760
How could you sleep at a time like this?

155
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,640
What about our daughter?

156
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,520
Your daughter can make her own decision.

157
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:07,520
She didn't even discuss

158
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,239
her marriage and divorce with us.

159
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,760
Now that the dice is cast,

160
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,719
what else do you expect me to do?

161
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,200
Marriage isn't child's play.

162
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,559
She can't just get married

163
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,159
and have a divorce
whenever she feels like it.

164
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:24,479
Li,

165
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,640
how about this?

166
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,640
I'll bring you to
the Jiang Family right now,

167
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,479
all right?

168
00:10:28,719 --> 00:10:30,840
Let's have a chat with Yicheng.

169
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:32,119
Come.

170
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,559
Let's go.

171
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:33,119
Dad,

172
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,440
I already had a chat with him.

173
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:36,039
Next,

174
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,320
I plan to live in a new environment.

175
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,280
Where are you going?

176
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,359
Chongqing.

177
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:43,320
Chongqing?

178
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:47,679
Chongqing.

179
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,679
That's too far.

180
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,200
How about this?

181
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,760
I'll register a tour for you,

182
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,359
all right?

183
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,400
Let's go on a relaxing trip.

184
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:58,679
Listen to me, okay?

185
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,239
Lu,

186
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,799
you saw it yourself.

187
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,799
Your daughter has
made arrangements for everything.

188
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,599
She's just here to notify us.

189
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,719
Fine.

190
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,239
You can do whatever you like.

191
00:11:15,599 --> 00:11:17,200
I'm too tired to care.

192
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:26,799
Dad,

193
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,880
I've sent my resume to them.

194
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:32,440
The company in Chongqing told me
to go for an interview two days later.

195
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,599
You're something else.

196
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:56,320
Where's Lu Li?

197
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,440
I wanted to ask you the same question.

198
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:00,359
You didn't answer my call
the entire night.

199
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,679
What happened between you and Lu Li?

200
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:02,840
Did you divorce her?

201
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:04,760
Don't you know where she is?

202
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,840
That's a strange question.

203
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,359
How would I know where she is?

204
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:10,039
If so, what did she tell you

205
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,359
two days ago?

206
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:15,159
That day, she gave me a coffee cup.

207
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,359
She said she wanted to thank me
for taking care of her.

208
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,679
I didn't expect it
to be a farewell gift.

209
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:27,239
Why are you staring at me?

210
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:30,119
Don't tell me you think that
she and I...

211
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,760
She got in your car

212
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,119
after she mentioned to me
that she wanted a divorce.

213
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,200
I do admit that I was frustrated
at that moment.

214
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:39,799
But after I cool down,

215
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,559
I realised that it was
a misunderstanding.

216
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:44,000
We've been brothers for many years.

217
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:45,440
I'm sure you won't do that
behind my back.

218
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:47,320
It seems like you retained your clarity.

219
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,840
But you always had
a great relationship with Lu Li.

220
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,280
Do you know why
she wanted to divorce me?

221
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,359
Didn't I remind you long ago?

222
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,840
If you don't communicate with her,
you'll regret it.

223
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,719
I did ask her what happened.

224
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,039
She wasn't willing to tell me.

225
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:01,320
Men and women are different.

226
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:04,039
Sometimes, you need more than
just your ears to listen.

227
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,479
What do I need then?

228
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:09,599
You need to use your heart.

229
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,440
You two have been married
for quite some time.

230
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:14,559
Let me ask you this.

231
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,760
Do you know what's
Lu Li's favourite food?

232
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,440
Besides programming,

233
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,000
what else does Lu Li like to do?

234
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,119
What's her favourite movie?

235
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,479
What's her favourite colour or book?

236
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:26,159
And,

237
00:13:26,359 --> 00:13:27,679
do you know where her home is?

238
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,080
Have you been there before?

239
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,440
You see.

240
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:33,719
These might be the reasons
why she left you.

241
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,239
That's impossible.

242
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:38,640
We got married to each other on terms.

243
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:40,679
She won't file for a divorce
because of petty things like these.

244
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:42,039
Didn't I tell you already?

245
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,039
How are you this slow?

246
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:45,520
Forget it.

247
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:46,239
Actually, I promised

248
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,719
Lu Li not to tell anyone about this.

249
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:49,280
But it seems like you will never
find your answer

250
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,159
if I don't tell you about it.

251
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,359
What is it?

252
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,119
Do you still remember
the first game you created?

253
00:13:56,599 --> 00:13:57,440
Dream Maker?

254
00:13:57,719 --> 00:13:59,000
Log into the game.

255
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:00,799
You may find the answer you seek.

256
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,700
(ID: ZERO, Password)

257
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,320
Koala.

258
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,200
(Sofun Game)
Take a break.

259
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:27,679
You won't get any inspiration
from staring at the screen.

260
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:29,359
You'll get conjunctivitis instead.

261
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,000
I didn't expect a genius like me

262
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,880
to be stuck here.

263
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,000
Since you don't have any inspiration,

264
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,479
you should change your mindset
and relax for a while.

265
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:42,000
How do I relax?

266
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:43,599
The game you sold to Chendong,

267
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:44,400
Dream Maker,

268
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:45,479
it's very popular now.

269
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:46,919
Why don't you log into your account?

270
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,359
The games I sold
are just like spilled milk.

271
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:51,479
Besides, I don't know

272
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,799
what changes they've made to the game.

273
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,119
What if they did a bad job?

274
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,760
I'll be infuriated by then.

275
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,080
You should take a nap then.

276
00:14:58,599 --> 00:14:59,599
I don't wish

277
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,880
to see you becoming
the first wealthy kid

278
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,880
to die because of his own business.

279
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,359
The interface sucks.

280
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:27,440
The animation is rubbish.

281
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,039
They did make great changes to the game.

282
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,047

and kill some monsters?)

285
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:43,520
(I can test the attack animation as well.)

286
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:45,559
(Okay.)

292
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:13,039
This must be a brat.

293
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:18,080

Don't you need to study?)

instead of playing games.)

(I'm a postgraduate, you know?)

298
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,919
(Little brat.)

299
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,200
(What's your major then?)

300
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,559
(I don't even know
which major to choose.)

301
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:37,039
(I feel lost.)

302
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,200
(You're playing video games every day
even though you're a little brat.)

303
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:41,880
(Of course you'll feel lost.)

304
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,559
(I don't play video games every day.)

305
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,760
(I just love to play Dream Maker.)

306

(I think the game developer)

307
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,479
(is amazing.)

308
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,039
I guess you have great taste.

309
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:57,320
(Why is Dream Maker
your favourite game?)

310
00:16:58,039 --> 00:16:59,559
(Because it can help me
get rid of the real world's trouble)

(I can head to another world.)

you haven't answered me yet.)

319
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,760

320
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,880

She's pretty interesting.

I played many matches with her.

In the end, I received
plenty of inspiration.

327

502
00:26:24,479 --> 00:26:25,319
Dad, Mum,

503
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,040
where's Lu Li?

504
00:26:26,199 --> 00:26:27,239
Who are you calling Dad and Mum?

505
00:26:27,439 --> 00:26:28,359
You're something else, huh?

506
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:29,959
You turned up in front of us

507
00:26:30,199 --> 00:26:31,479
before we went looking for you.

508
00:26:32,479 --> 00:26:33,439
Great.

509
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,719
Let me teach you a lesson today.

510
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,439
What are you doing?

511
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,119
Don't do this!

512
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,880
Who told him to bully Li?

513
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:37,800
You mustn't do this.

514
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,160
Why are you stopping me?

515
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,199
You want all of our neighbours

516
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:42,160
to know about Li's divorce?

517
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,400
Fine.

518
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,800
I'll let you off today.

519
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:47,359
Dad, Mum...

520
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,520
I dare you to say that again!

521
00:26:50,479 --> 00:26:51,439
I'm sorry.

522
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,640
I really wish to have a chat with her.

523
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,640
Jiang,

524
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,640
this marriage

525
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:58,599
was proposed by my daughter
in the first place.

526
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,760
But

527
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,280
you guys can't live together anymore.

528
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,880
I think you two should
just lead separate lives.

529
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,040
There's a misunderstanding between us.

530
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:05,359
What misunderstanding?

531
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:06,479
Listen,

532
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,560
from today onwards,

533
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,439
you will never get to see Li again.

534
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:10,439
Scram!

535
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,760
If she doesn't want to see me,

536
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:14,000
I'll wait here until she sees me.

537
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,680
That's useless.

538
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,439
She's not here.

539
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:19,119
Where did she go?

540
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,239
What has that got to do with you?

541
00:27:23,719 --> 00:27:24,520
And,

542
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,000
you're not welcomed here.

543
00:27:27,239 --> 00:27:28,959
In the future, I'll beat you up

544
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:30,800
whenever you show your face!

545
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,920
She went to the airport.

546
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:33,920
Wait!

547
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,040
Thanks, Mum.

548
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,760
You!

549
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:37,680
Wait.

550
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,479
Don't go.

551
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:40,400
Just let him go.

552
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,199
What if your heart can't take it?

553
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,119
What should I do then?

554
00:27:43,199 --> 00:27:44,199
I can't take that, you know?

555
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:45,640
Even so, you shouldn't tell him.

556
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,199
You!

557
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,000
Don't worry. He won't make it in time.

558
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:48,000
The plane has departed.

559
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:48,719
Youngsters nowadays

560
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,880
are glib talkers, you know?

561
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,760
I'm just worried that
your heart can't take it.

562
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,300
(Security Check)

563
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:58,439
Morning, Mum.

564
00:28:58,479 --> 00:28:59,119
Are you arranging flowers?

565
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:00,079
Morning.

566
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:01,319
Tong,

567
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:02,439
are you heading to the company?

568
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:03,479
Yeah.

569
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,760
Wait a moment.

570
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:06,280
I need to send something to your father.

571
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:07,400
I can visit Li as well.

572
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:18,119
Let's go.

573
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,839
I suddenly remembered that there was
nothing for me to do in the office.

574
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,319
I think I can skip work today.

575
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,479
You've skipped the morning shift,
you know?

576
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,880
What would other employees

577
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:27,680
think about you if you skipped
the afternoon shift as well?

578
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,079
By the way, Mum,

579
00:29:29,239 --> 00:29:30,199
my car broke down.

580
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:31,599
I can't drive there.

581
00:29:31,719 --> 00:29:32,959
We can call a cab then.

582
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,479
I think I'm having a stomachache.

583
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,160
Is this appendicitis?

584
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,599
Your appendix is over here.

585
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,119
It's not acute gastroenteritis, right?

586
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:47,359
Mum,

587
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:48,800
bring me to the hospital.

588
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,760
My tummy hurts so much.

589
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,280
It hurts.

590
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:05,479
Did your father cheat on me?

591
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:09,040
Did Dad cheat on you?

592
00:30:09,199 --> 00:30:10,280
With who?

593
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,239
If that wasn't the case,

594
00:30:12,719 --> 00:30:15,439
why did you stop me
from going to the company?

595
00:30:15,719 --> 00:30:18,160
What exactly happened?

596
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:19,880
Mum,

597
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,880
I...

598
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,040
Did something happen
between your brother and Li?

599
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:27,079
They're fine.

600
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:29,839
It's just that they're busy lately.

601
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,520
(Hello.)

602
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:38,920
(The number you have dialled
is unavailable.)

603
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:43,239
Tell me honestly.

604
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,680
What happened between
Li and your brother?

605
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,119
This is the first time
she has not answered my call.

606
00:30:48,239 --> 00:30:49,160
Why did she turn off her phone?

607
00:30:50,719 --> 00:30:51,520
This...

608
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,479
I...

609
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:57,920
Don't you want to tell me?

610
00:30:58,079 --> 00:30:58,560
Fine.

611
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,680
I'll head to the company myself.

612
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,760
Wait, Mum.

613
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,000
It's not that I don't want to tell you.

614
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:02,959
Just let me go.

615
00:31:03,199 --> 00:31:03,959
What are you doing?

616
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:05,239
Let me go!

617
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,119
Let me go!

618
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:07,640
I'm sure you're hiding something from me.

619
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,719
I need to ask them what happened.

620
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,599
Brother!

621
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,920
Mum wants to head to the company.

622
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:12,880
Yicheng,

623
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,400
tell me.

624
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,000
What happened between you and Li?

625
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:16,640
What's going on?

626
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:19,359
She wants a divorce.

627
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:23,079
Mum.

628
00:31:23,199 --> 00:31:23,880
Calm down.

629
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:24,920
Come.

630
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:26,040
Have a seat.

631
00:31:26,479 --> 00:31:27,560
Have a seat.

632
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,599
Was it because of Li Man?

633
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,560
I told you before.

634
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,640
I told you not to be in touch with her.

635
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,119
I told you not to be in touch with her.

636
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,680
Even if Li has the nicest temper
in the world,

637
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,760
she can't stand it

638
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,640
when you're having your way
with both women at the same time.

639
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,280
My son,

640
00:31:57,479 --> 00:31:59,719
I know you like Li.

641
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,319
How about...

642
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:02,719
How about this?

643
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:04,280
Let me bring you to her.

644
00:32:04,479 --> 00:32:05,920
Maybe, Li will forgive you

645
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:07,079
on account of me.

646
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:08,599
Let's go.

647
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:09,800
Mum,

648
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,119
she left.

649
00:32:14,959 --> 00:32:16,199
Where did she go?

650
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,680
She left Xinhai.

651
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:23,760
I don't know where she went.

652
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,079
Mister,

653
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,800
please drive slower.
Safety is our priority.

654
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,839
Miss, don't worry.

655
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:05,880
I'm the best driver

656
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,800
in Chongqing.

657
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,479
Okay.

658
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,360
(Chaotianmen Square;
Liberation Monument)

659
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,719
Hello.

660
00:33:40,439 --> 00:33:42,640
I've reached the location you mentioned.

661
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,520
Where should I go after that?

662
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:46,839
Continue along the path.

663
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:48,119
You'll see a building in front of you.

664
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,439
There's a flight of steps
beside the building.

665
00:33:50,439 --> 00:33:51,400
Go down the stairs.

666
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,760
I'll be waiting for you
in front of the house.

667
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,319
All right.

668
00:33:55,439 --> 00:33:56,280
Thank you.

669
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,959
Excuse me, is this the right path?

670
00:34:00,199 --> 00:34:00,599
Yes.

671
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,280
This path is nearer to the house.

672
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,560
Chongqing is a mountain city.

673
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,439
You need to climb hills quite often
when you're here.

674
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,640
It'll be fine when you get used to it.

675
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,919
Chongqing is a 5D city indeed.

676
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:10,000
Of course.

677
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,919
We have plenty of delicacies here.

678
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,000
- Yet you won't see many fatties around.
- Let me help you.

679
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,520
It's because we need to
exercise every day.

680
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,000
Thanks.

681
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,239
Miss, you can do it.

682
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,080
Why don't we carry it together?

683
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,560
It's fine. It's not that heavy.

684
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:31,040
Wouldn't it be great

685
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,760
if I got to know Lu Li
when I was in university?

686
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:35,320
Calm down.

687
00:34:35,439 --> 00:34:37,800
Take your time.
You'll find her eventually.

688
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,760
Why didn't she tell me?

689
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:43,959
What to tell?

690
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,439
Do you want her to confess to you?

691
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,239
Brother,

692
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:47,800
you don't understand women at all.

693
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,080
Do you know why people
have a crush on someone else?

694
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,800
It's because they're afraid that
they will no longer be friends

695
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:53,199
with their crushes once
their confession fails.

696
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,560
But if she doesn't confess to me,

697
00:34:55,959 --> 00:34:57,679
how would she know
what the result will be?

698
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:00,280
When you like someone,

699
00:35:00,479 --> 00:35:02,320
you'll feel inferior subconsciously.

700
00:35:02,479 --> 00:35:03,040
Moreover,

701
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:04,679
you haven't given her
enough sense of security.

702
00:35:04,879 --> 00:35:06,280
You weren't there by her side

703
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,040
when she was caught in an accident.

704
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,840
I've already explained it to her.

705
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,040
Rome wasn't built in a day.

706
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:14,439
That incident might just be the fuse.

707
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,040
Moreover, it wasn't
just a normal accident.

708
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:19,000
I'm sure she was terrified back then.

709
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,000
It's normal for her to hate you.

710
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:24,439
What do you mean by
it wasn't a normal accident?

711
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:26,199
She was tailed by someone.

712
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,600
She was caught in an accident
because someone tailed her.

713
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:28,879
Didn't she tell you about it?

714
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,000
Where's the assailant?

715
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,239
Did they manage to catch him?

716
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:32,600
Not yet.

717
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,959
That person wore a face mask.

718
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:36,239
Lu Li couldn't identity his features.

719
00:35:36,399 --> 00:35:38,320
She just saw a scar on his hand.

720
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,719
Besides, it happened
at the CCTV's blind spot.

721
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,360
So...

722
00:35:40,479 --> 00:35:41,239
Wait.

723
00:35:42,479 --> 00:35:44,399
You said there's a scar on his hand.

724
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,800
Was it the left or the right hand?

725
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:48,280
The right hand.

726
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:50,600
Do you know that person?

727
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,439
I need to verify something.

728
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,919
Pay the booking fee for me.

729
00:36:14,479 --> 00:36:15,439
Yicheng,

730
00:36:15,959 --> 00:36:18,040
I didn't expect you
to ask me out for a meal.

731
00:36:18,439 --> 00:36:19,600
I was in a bad mood last time.

732
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,679
Sorry.

733
00:36:21,439 --> 00:36:22,520
I understand.

734
00:36:22,879 --> 00:36:25,479
So, is this meal my compensation?

735
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:27,000
Can I choose the venue then?

736
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,120
Go ahead.

737
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,080
Seat belt.

738
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:38,000
Thanks.

739
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,360
No thanks.

740
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:39,959
Thank you.

741
00:36:43,439 --> 00:36:44,439
I'll foot the bill.

742
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:56,080
Amy,

743
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:57,479
I'm not in the office.

744
00:36:57,639 --> 00:36:59,000
We can talk after I return.

745
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:03,760
So, are you seeing somebody?

746
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:05,840
Why are you here?

747
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,760
Don't worry.

748
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,679
Even if the cops find me,

749
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,159
you won't be implicated.

750
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:15,040
Because Lu Li collided with
the car herself.

751
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,159
I didn't push her.

752
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,840
She can only blame herself
for her bad luck.

753
00:37:19,479 --> 00:37:21,479
What kind of nonsense are you spouting?

754
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,760
Didn't you call me here

755
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,120
because of Lu Li's accident?

756
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:30,239
What accident?

757
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:32,679
When did I call you here?

758
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,040
You sent me a message.

759
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:35,080
You told me to rush here.

760
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:36,719
Look.

761
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,945
(Man: The cops are here.)
Stop pretending.

762
00:37:38,969 --> 00:37:39,919
(Come immediately)
Only the two of us are here.

763
00:37:39,919 --> 00:37:42,239
Are you addicted to acting?

764
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:44,239
Get up!

765
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:44,719
What?

766
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,080
Just leave!

767
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:46,719
Hurry!

768
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,159
Since you're here,
we should have a chat.

769
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,719
Were you the one who sent the message?

770
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,280
It's all thanks to you for

771
00:37:58,479 --> 00:38:00,040
using the same password
even after so many years.

772
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:00,840
Come.

773
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,159
Come.

774
00:38:12,479 --> 00:38:13,520
Your lipstick is smearing.

775
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,560
Let me head to the washroom.

776
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:23,000
Wait for me, okay?

777
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:34,199
What's going on?

778
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,080
Why did you do this?

779
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,040
Because Lu Li saw someone
chasing her with a knife.

780
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:44,600
And, there's a scar on his right hand.

781
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,280
Listen,

782
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,239
I just wanted to scare her off

783
00:38:52,479 --> 00:38:54,560
so that she could leave you.

784
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,719
Actually, I can swear to God.

785
00:38:57,959 --> 00:38:58,719
Lu Li's accident

786
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,320
has nothing to do with me.

787
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:03,159
She collided with the car herself.

788
00:39:16,439 --> 00:39:18,520
I also found out about it just now.

789
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,719
I didn't order him to do this.

790
00:39:24,919 --> 00:39:26,399
Speak!

791
00:39:26,959 --> 00:39:28,479
It's all me.

792
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,159
It has nothing to do with Man.

793
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,080
It's my fault.

794
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:34,159
I took it upon myself to act.

795
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,360
Stop pretending.

796
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,439
Are you addicted to acting?

797
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,439
He said that just now, right?

798
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:42,719
I wasn't pretending.

799
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:45,159
He was spouting nonsense.

800
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,320
I was truly in the dark.

801
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,159
How could he know who Lu Li was

802
00:39:51,479 --> 00:39:52,919
if you didn't order him to do so?

803
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,360
It's because Man

804
00:39:57,479 --> 00:39:58,439
couldn't let you go.

805
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,520
And you have another girlfriend.

806
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,199
That's why I followed you guys.

807
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:05,639
So, did you do it because of her?

808
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,439
Of course.

809
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,520
Last time, you were still
abusing your daughter.

810
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,840
But now,

811
00:40:12,399 --> 00:40:14,280
you're saying that you did everything
because of her.

812
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,639
How do you guys still dare to say
that you are not pretending?

813
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,600
Yicheng,

814
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,080
it isn't what you think.

815
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,959
Give me some time.

816
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,560
I'll explain everything to you,

817
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:27,439
okay?

818
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,360
You didn't tell me the truth before this

819
00:40:29,959 --> 00:40:31,639
because you guys wanted to put on an act

820
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,159
so that I can discover
what happened three years ago myself

821
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,600
and feel guilty about it, am I right?

822
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,600
You did change.

823
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:43,199
I don't even know who you are anymore.

824
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,280
I'm sorry.

825
00:40:50,479 --> 00:40:51,479
I just wanted

826
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,280
to make you fall for me again.

827
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,840
I told you long ago.

828
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:58,159
It's all in the past.

829
00:40:58,479 --> 00:41:00,639
It will never be the same
as the present.

830
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:02,159
Our relationship

831
00:41:02,399 --> 00:41:04,280
ended three years ago.

832
00:41:04,959 --> 00:41:07,879
But my love for you hasn't ended yet.

833
00:41:08,879 --> 00:41:10,120
You said I changed.

834
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,360
Yes,

835
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,199
I did change.

836
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:15,439
But if I didn't change,

837
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,120
I would never be able to get
to where I am right now.

838
00:41:18,479 --> 00:41:21,120
And I'll never be able
to meet your mother's requirements.

839
00:41:21,439 --> 00:41:22,199
I have no way
to stay beside you officially

840
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,439
if I didn't change.

841
00:41:24,919 --> 00:41:26,479
Why do you think I'm doing this?

842
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:28,639
I did everything because of you.

843
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:29,800
So, do you think I should

844
00:41:29,919 --> 00:41:31,800
accept you and what you've done for me?

845
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,600
Stop deceiving yourself.

846
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,320
You're just unwilling
to accept the truth.

847
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,520
Am I unwilling to accept the truth?

848
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:41,760
Isn't it because
you already fell for Lu Li?

849
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:44,360
My relationship with her

850
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:46,080
has nothing to do with you.

851
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:49,280
We should never meet in private again.

852
00:41:49,919 --> 00:41:50,879
By the way,

853
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:57,840
I plan to report this to the cops.

854
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,000
You!

855
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:04,679
Who does he think he is?

856
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:29,360
Are you happy now?

857
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,919
Man,

858
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,280
I tried to teach Lu Li a lesson

859
00:42:33,479 --> 00:42:35,719
because of you.

860
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,080
Now, are you pretending
to be my kind father?

861
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:41,040
Where were you when I needed you?

862
00:42:41,919 --> 00:42:44,080
I know my mistake now.

863
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,439
I want to make it up to you.

864
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,919
How do you plan to do that?

865
00:42:49,159 --> 00:42:50,719
What else can you do

866
00:42:50,959 --> 00:42:52,919
besides dragging me down?

867
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,399
Would you do these things for me

868
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,439
if I weren't as wealthy?

869
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,760
I didn't do it for money.

870
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,439
Fine then.

871
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,560
Return me the money I gave to you.

872
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,520
I...

873
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:19,479
It's been so many years.

874
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,439
I really had enough of you!

875
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:26,000
You should ponder over what you'd done!

876
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,360
Miss Lu,

877
00:43:48,439 --> 00:43:48,919
it must've been tough on you.

878
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,879
You're here to check out the houses
right after you arrive here.

879
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:51,919
This house

880
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,679
satisfies your every need.

881
00:43:54,679 --> 00:43:55,159
And,

882
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,120
there are several
huge industrial parks nearby.

883
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,479
Most people who work here

884
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:00,040
will rent a house in this area.

885
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,840
And, the quality of the tenants

886
00:44:01,959 --> 00:44:03,120
is pretty high.

887
00:44:03,879 --> 00:44:05,560
This house looks new.

888
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:05,919
Yes.

889
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:07,639
Initially, the owner
wanted to stay here.

890
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,040
But he changed his job after that.

891
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:10,439
That's why he's renting it out.

892
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:11,199
Miss Lu,

893
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,040
if you do wish to stay here,

894
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:15,439
I can give you another 200 yuan offer.

895
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,120
All right. I'll move in immediately.

896
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,159
Immediately?

897
00:44:19,439 --> 00:44:20,040
This is my first time

898
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,800
seeing a tenant like you.

899
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,560
Is there a problem?

900
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,320
No problem at all.

901
00:44:23,399 --> 00:44:24,360
No problem.

902
00:45:44,479 --> 00:45:45,800
(From today onwards,)

903
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:48,760
(I, Jiang Yicheng,
will pursue you again.)

904
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,040
(I will surely find you.)

905
00:45:52,399 --> 00:45:53,479
(Lu Li,)

906
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,399
(wait for me.)

907
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:04,760
(There's a popular Chinese proverb.)

908
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:06,520
(The best time)

909
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,520
(to plant a tree was ten years ago.)

910
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,560
(The second best time is now.)

911
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,719
(Maybe, it's the same
for relationships.)

912
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,919
(As long as you wish to start anew,)

913
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,760
(it will never be too late.)
