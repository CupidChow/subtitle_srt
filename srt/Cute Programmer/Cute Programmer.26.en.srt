Do you know what time it is?

00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:07,959
Why did you only wake up by now?

23
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:09,479
You never overslept in the past.

24
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,679
Mr. Jiang, today is my rest day.

25
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,639
I'll apply for
an overtime subsidy for you.

26
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,639
We need to do
an on-site investigation today.

27
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,839
I've sent the address to you.

28
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,080
See you in an hour.

29
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,720
Be careful.

30
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,000
It's okay.

31
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,520
Why are you here as well?

32
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,759
I'm here to enjoy the scenery.

33
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:40,119
As the boss of Party A,

34
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,360
this is my job as well.

35
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:44,039
Say, you found us a great place indeed.

36
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:46,119
Let's go.

37
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,919
This cableway is quite famous in our city.

38
00:02:56,279 --> 00:02:59,759
Rumour has it that couples will stay
together if they take the ride together.

39
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:02,759
I didn't know that
there's a cableway here.

40
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,080
Let's go to another place.

41
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:06,960
Why aren't we taking the ride
when we're already here?

42
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,679
I wanted to bring our junior here
for a date initially.

43
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,399
Thanks for the arrangement.

44
00:03:11,839 --> 00:03:14,199
Don't you know that Lu Li
is afraid of heights?

45
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,039
Junior,

46
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:19,080
why didn't you tell me about that?

47
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,520
There's no need for you
to compromise with me

48
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,160
just because I like

49
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,119
things like these, understood?

50
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,039
I tried platform diving before.

51
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,240
This is nothing.

52
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:28,880
Since we're here already,
we should take the ride.

53
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,720
It breaks my heart to see my girlfriend
being this considerate.

Thank you.

87
00:05:43,119 --> 00:05:44,600
When we speak of Chongqing,

88
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,559
we must mention the delicacies here.

89
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,000
(King of Spiciness)
That is our hotpot.

90
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:49,480
(A Test of Tolerance for Spiciness)
When we speak of our hotpot,

91
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,799
one word comes to mind,

92
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:51,559
spiciness.

93
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,359
So today,

94
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,279
we will hold the King of Spiciness
competition.

95
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,399
The one who ate the most chillies
within a minute

96
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:03,079
(Come if you dare)
will be able to win this prize.

97
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,119
Does anyone want to give it a go?

98
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,079
Do you want to test him out?

99
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,160
No. Don't try anything funny.

100
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,640
What?

101
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,200
You want that prize, don't you?

102
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:15,079
I don't think I can handle this.

103
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:18,519
I'll win it for you.

104
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,640
Don't worry.

105
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,399
So does anyone

106
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,440
want to give it a go?

107
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,640
Hurry and get on the stage

108
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,679
if you wish to win this prize.

109
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:28,480
All right.

110
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,880
We have a cute girl with us here.

111
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,119
Get ready.

112
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:33,239
Three, two, one, go.

113
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:43,600
You can do it!

114
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:54,760
All right.

115
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,320
Time's almost up.

116
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,839
I think I feel touched as well.

117
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:17,959
He's so nice to you.
Won't you be moved by him?

118
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,119
Will you treat someone kindly
out of guilt?

119
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,279
I guess so.

120
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:27,519
Will you fall for someone out of guilt?

121
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,239
Most probably not.

122
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,320
Being touched
doesn't necessarily mean it's love.

123
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,480
If we force ourselves to be together,

124
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,359
we will be separated in the end.

125
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,279
That's right.

126
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,959
I don't want him
to do all these out of guilt.

127
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:44,760
I don't want him
to compensate me in this way.

128
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,519
I understand now.

129
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:52,239
Three, two, one, time's up.

130
00:07:52,359 --> 00:07:55,399
Let's congratulate our male contestant

131
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,959
for winning the competition.

132
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,180
(Pray for blessing)

133
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,960
Thanks.

134
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,919
There's no need for you
to be this courteous with me.

135
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:12,119
What kind of wish did you make?

136
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:13,960
I wished for my family's safety.

137
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,880
I wished for your forgiveness.

138
00:09:23,719 --> 00:09:25,640
Will my wish come true?

139
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,760
If you're staying

140
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,200
because of this,

141
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,039
I'll forgive you.

142
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:34,320
Really?

143
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:38,799
There's no right or wrong
in our marriage.

144
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,719
Choosing to leave was my own decision.

145
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,799
You may return in peace now.

146
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,640
So did you forgive me this easily

147
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,799
just to chase me away?

148
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,359
That's right.

149
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:02,280
It's because of Lu Jingwen, right?

150
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,880
I don't believe it.

151
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,479
You've fancied me for five years.

152
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:09,919
How could you experience a change of
heart in such a short time?

153
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,840
I've seen all the messages you wrote
to me in Dream Maker.

154
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:17,119
You were Koala.

155
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,599
You took Computer Science
as your major because of me.

156
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,280
You joined my company because of me.

157
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,280
You did so many things for me.

158
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,640
And I only realized
what happened by now.

159
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,679
I'm sorry.

160
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,799
You don't need to apologise to me.

161
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,239
I know.

162
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,280
No matter what I say,

163
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,440
I won't be able to make it up to you.

164
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:42,840
But I still wish to tell you this.

165
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:44,799
I didn't get back together with Li Man.

166
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:47,799
And EG has sent a new representative.

167
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,320
You don't need to force yourself
to give me a response

168
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,359
just because you feel touched
or sorry for me.

169
00:10:56,599 --> 00:10:57,760
I'm not forcing myself to do this.

170
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,159
When it comes to feelings,
it concerns only one party.

171
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,239
I don't need anyone to take pity on me.

172
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:08,919
Go and find the person you truly love.

173
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,919
Lu Li,

174
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,359
listen to me.

175
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:13,840
I'm not forcing myself to do this

176
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,320
because I feel sorry for you.

177
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,000
I did it because...

178
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:16,599
Stop.

179
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:18,039
What are you doing?

180
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:20,919
Are you trying something funny
when I'm not around?

181
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:24,880
Are you okay?

182
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,479
It's fine even if you don't believe me.

183
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:38,159
I will prove myself to you.

184
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:51,380
(Lu Li, I hope you can forgive me)

185
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:09,820
(I hope my family can stay safe)

186
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:30,640
Are you After Dusk?

187
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,239
Sorry.

188
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,159
You're right.

189
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:34,400
Sorry about that.

190
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:36,000
It's him.

191
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,479
What's wrong? Do you know him?

192
00:12:37,599 --> 00:12:39,039
Have a seat.

193
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,760
He's one of the company's programmers.

194
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:46,640
He seems like a silly guy.

195
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:49,679
Look, the girl in front of him
is already frustrated.

196
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:51,760
Aren't all programmers the same as him?

197
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,559
They're frank and silly.

198
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,159
This...

199
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,200
I ordered this milk tea for you.

200
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:57,320
I won't drink that. I'm on a diet.

201
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
That's fine.

202
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,159
I...

203
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,080
We can order another drink later.

204
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:03,200
No need.

205
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:03,919
I need to leave soon.

206
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,200
I'm busy later.

207
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:07,080
Are you leaving already?

208
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:09,400
I can send you back.

209
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,919
I was joking when I said
I wanted to date you.

210
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:18,359
Don't tell me you took it seriously?

211
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,719
Were you joking?

212
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:21,559
Yeah.

213
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:24,000
We haven't met each other before this.

214
00:13:24,719 --> 00:13:27,479
I was just saying it for fun
during our online chat.

215
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,119
I...

216
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,679
I thought you said yes to meeting me

217
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,440
because

218
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:36,919
you were interested in me?

219
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,799
That's what I thought initially.

220
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,640
But you...

221
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,679
You're not my type at all.

222
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:46,320
Your outfit looks too outdated.

223
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:50,039
Do you think that
we're suitable for each other?

224
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,440
What about the time
we chatted with each other?

225
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,239
What do you mean by that?

226
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,080
Are you asking me
to return the money to you?

227
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,840
No.

228
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:01,080
That's not what I mean.

229
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,280
That's for the best.

230
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,000
It seems like

231
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:05,080
your colleague was scammed by her.

232
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,960
Poor guy.

233
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,039
You were the one who sent me the gifts

234
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:10,520
of your own accord.

235
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,960
I didn't force you to do so.

236
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,320
I didn't expect you
to be this dirty-minded.

237
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,359
Do you think I must be your girlfriend

238
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,919
just because I accepted your gifts?

239
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:21,840
Huang,

240
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,119
so you rejected me

241
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,039
because of a girl like her?

242
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,320
Miss Yezi.

243
00:14:27,479 --> 00:14:28,760
Don't call me Miss.

244
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,359
Call me Ye.

245
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:32,799
I didn't expect you to be a two-timer.

246
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:33,479
I...

247
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,000
What a despicable scum.

248
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:36,840
Miss,

249
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:37,840
Huang

250
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,679
isn't a scum.

251
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:41,840
I think you're the scum here.

252
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,960
What do you mean by that?

253
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,039
Are you insulting me?

254
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,280
Oh, I didn't expect you
to understand me.

255
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,799
You better look at yourself
in the mirror.

256
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,239
Don't think that you're hot
just because you have makeup on.

257
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,359
Do you want me to give you
a bottle of cleanser?

258
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:52,320
You!

259
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,280
I suggest you to return
all those gifts to him.

260
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,080
If not, I'll post about it
on the Internet.

261
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,039
Let's see who's the scum by then!

262
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,280
How is it?

263
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,880
What do you mean?

264
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,239
How was my acting?

265
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,760
All those dramas I watched

266
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,400
do have their uses.

267
00:15:13,599 --> 00:15:15,000
Why are you staring at me?

268
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,039
I think you look beautiful.

269
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:29,760
Yicheng,

270
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:31,640
what's your address in Chongqing?

271
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,039
I need your signature for a document.

272
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,039
I'll send my address to you later.

273
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,880
All right.

274
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,960
I'll wait for you to
send me the address.

275
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,479
Here you go.

276
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:41,479
Let's go.

277
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:46,479
Why did you buy so much food?

278
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,080
Of course it's for our investigation.

279
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:49,679
This is a protracted battle.

280
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,400
What if we're hungry
in the middle of the process?

281
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,359
A telescope?

282
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,239
Do we even need this?

283
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,599
Of course.

284
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:01,000
We need to be serious about this.

285
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,640
It all falls on this whether my brother
can get his happy ending or not.

286
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,280
Did he send the address to you?

287
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:10,919
All right.

288
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:13,359
We will catch the third wheel
red-handed.

289
00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:17,640
Wait for me.

290
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,760
Thank you for sending me home today.

291
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:39,960
Drive safely when you return.

292
00:16:40,719 --> 00:16:41,520
Wait.

293
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,159
Do you see?

294
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,679
I told you something was going on.

295
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:59,119
Let me send you up there.

296
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,200
What if a drunk person attacks you?

297
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:06,680
And I promised Jingwen that
I'd send you back.

298
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,599
Come.

299
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,280
Since when did my brother
become a gentleman?

300
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,319
He's even opening the door for a woman.

301
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:21,880
How is it?

302
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,199
Did you see her face?

303
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,760
I can't see her face clearly.

304
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,199
Pass it to me.

305
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,439
This won't do.

306
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,800
Where are you going?

307
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:37,520
I need to see where the vixen lives.

308
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,880
Wait for me.

309
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,800
I'm home now. You may leave.

310
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,000
I'll only leave after
you enter the house.

311
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:58,199
What are you doing?

312
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,119
I...

313
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,439
My tummy feels uncomfortable.

314
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:01,920
I think my gastric is acting up.

315
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:03,439
Can you get me a cup of warm water?

316
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,920
Don't tell me he's staying here tonight?

317
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:35,959
No.

318
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,880
I can't let you
commit a mistake like this.

319
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:43,199
I...

320
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:44,040
I'll get the door.

321
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,760
Who's there?

322
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:48,280
Who are you? Why are you here?

323
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,319
Who do you think I am?

324
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,719
Vixen, come out!

325
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:52,359
Vixen!

326
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:52,680
Hey!

327
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,520
Jiang Zitong, why are you here?

328
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,400
Shut up for now.

329
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,760
I know you're bewitched.

330
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,280
Don't worry, let me handle this.

331
00:19:57,479 --> 00:19:58,839
Vixen, you better come out!

332
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,359
Tell me.

333
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:00,839
How much do I need to pay you
before you leave him alone?

334
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,359
Where is she?

335
00:20:01,479 --> 00:20:02,319
Jiang...

336
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:06,479
Zitong?

337
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,319
Sister-in-law?

338
00:20:31,719 --> 00:20:32,880
What a coincidence, huh?

339
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,040
What a coincidence.

340
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:38,479
Are you here as well?

341
00:20:39,199 --> 00:20:41,160
So are you here
to deliver the document to me?

342
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:57,000
So you tracked me down.

343
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,520
No.

344
00:20:58,599 --> 00:20:59,400
Not at all.

345
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:03,439
What is this then?

346
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:06,760
It's because you rarely return home.

347
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:08,280
Mum and I thought...

348
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:09,719
We thought something happened to you.

349
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:11,319
That's why we're here to check on you.

350
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,719
Coincidentally, this is the weekend.

351
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,079
Zitong has never been
to Chongqing before.

352
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,160
That's why we came here for a trip.

353
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,040
He's right.

354
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,560
That's the whole situation.

355
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,839
Brother,

356
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,359
finding Sister-in-law is a huge deal.

357
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,839
Why didn't you notify us?

358
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,319
Mum was worried about you.

359
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,920
We met each other
by accident in the company.

360
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,280
Don't tell me you're working for
Lu Jingwen right now?

361
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:34,199
Wait.

362
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,599
Does that mean

363
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,719
the company my brother
will be cooperating with

364
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:39,640
is your company?

365
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,959
This is amazing.

366
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,959
I guess you two are
destined to be together.

367
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,119
Sometimes, fate may lead us to
encounter each other.

368
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,839
But being together is
a different thing entirely.

369
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,839
So don't you plan to return?

370
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,199
I think Chongqing is a nice place.

371
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,800
The work is relaxing as well.

372
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,479
I plan to stay here.

373
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:08,680
Isn't this too sour?

374
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,239
Is this sour?

375
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,319
I don't think it's that sour.

376
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:19,560
You can have the entire thing then.

377
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:21,680
I'll get the door.

378
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:30,119
Junior,

379
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:31,400
look at what I've brought you.

380
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,479
Who are you?

381
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:42,420
(Height: around 168cm. Very beautiful.
Attire: stylish. Average Score: 100 marks)

382
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:55,400
What are you staring at? Haven't you
seen a beautiful girl like me before?

383
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:56,359
I'll close the door if you keep staring.

384
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:58,599
Senior, come in.

385
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,000
This is my junior's house.
Please make way for me.

386
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:07,199
Yiming? You're here as well.

387
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:08,760
Why didn't you tell me?

388
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,000
I just arrived today.

389
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,280
So who is this Miss?

390
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,640
She's Yicheng's sister.

391
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,599
So it's Young Lady Jiang.
I've heard a lot about you.

392
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,119
Come.

393
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:20,479
Treat yourself at home.

394
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:20,959
Have a seat.

395
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:24,079
Of course I'm treating myself at home.
This is my sister-in-law's house.

396
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,920
I think you're wrong.

397
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:35,400
To put it accurately,
she's your ex-sister-in-law.

398
00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:47,760
Isn't this too sour?

399
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,959
I think you should eat the food
I brought for you.

400
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:53,599
Sorry about this.

401
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:54,680
I didn't know you guys were here.

402
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,000
I only brought one
hot and sour noodles for Lu Li.

403
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,359
You two are...

404
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,800
Oh, pardon me for my negligence.

405
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,359
Now, Lu Li is my girlfriend.

406
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,079
Brother,

407
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,680
did he steal Sister-in-law from you?

408
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,719
It's getting late.

409
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,719
Let me send you guys back.

410
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:17,359
But...

411
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,560
This...

412
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,239
Let's go.

413
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:21,319
Don't leave.

414
00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:22,479
Stay here for a little longer.

415
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,760
We've been travelling the entire day.
I'm exhausted.

416
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,119
We'll return to our hotel now.

417
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:27,800
All right then.

418
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,239
See you guys tomorrow.

419
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:34,119
It's Zitong's first time in Chongqing.

420
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,640
I bring her around the city tomorrow.

421
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:36,880
Do you guys want to join us?

422
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,160
I won't join you guys.

423
00:24:39,439 --> 00:24:40,280
Sister-in-law, don't reject us.

424
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,880
It's been a long time
since we met last time.

425
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:44,000
Don't you want to accompany me?

426
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,560
I...

427
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:47,479
Of course she does.

428
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:49,479
Junior,

429
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,599
we should show our courtesy
as their host.

430
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,560
We should take care of our friends
who came a long way here.

431
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:56,280
All right, I'll listen to you.

432
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,119
I'll send you the address then.

433
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:03,160
Good night.

434
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,800
- See you.
- Take care.

435
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:12,439
All of us are leaving.
Aren't you leaving?

436
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,599
I'm staying one floor above
my beloved's unit.

437
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:21,959
I'll reach home in just a few steps.

438
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:22,839
Miss Jiang,

439
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:24,599
please visit us often when you're free.

440
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,479
Sister-in-law, I'll leave first.

441
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:29,040
Goodbye.

442
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,479
A hot chick with an explosive temper?
Interesting.

443
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,719
Jiang Yicheng isn't
a genuine person at all.

444
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:45,119
He didn't even bring his sister

445
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:46,920
to university even though
we studied together for four years.

446
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:49,199
Say, she doesn't have a boyfriend,
right?

447
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,680
Lu Li,

448
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,000
what's wrong?

449
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,439
Do you feel uncomfortable?

450
00:25:58,719 --> 00:25:59,920
Send me to the hospital.

451
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,079
All right.

452
00:26:01,199 --> 00:26:01,719
Let's head to the hospital.

453
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,479
Let's go.

454
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:04,000
Come.

455
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,680
Come.

456
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:13,856
(Obstetrics department)

457
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,760
What did the doctor say?

458
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,199
I'm fine.

459
00:26:17,439 --> 00:26:19,079
Maybe it's because
I took too many steps today.

460
00:26:19,239 --> 00:26:20,560
My body couldn't stand the strain.

461
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:22,760
I was careless.

462
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:25,839
So it's...

463
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,479
Wait, let me think about it.

464
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,760
The child belongs to Jiang Yicheng, right?

465
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:46,000
I knew it. You were
pregnant with his child.

466
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,560
Wait.

467
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:51,280
Does he know about this?

468
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,719
Why are you still hiding it from him?

469
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,119
So what was the reason for your divorce?

470
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,800
You have so many questions.

471
00:26:57,959 --> 00:26:58,800
Which one do you want me
to answer first?

472
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,400
Answer the first question.

473
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,479
Fine.

474
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,560
He doesn't know about it.

475
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And I hope you can keep this a secret.

476
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:09,280
If not, he'll never leave Chongqing.

477
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:13,199
But it's obvious that
you still love him.

478
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,520
Our feelings aren't like a tap.

479
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,160
We can't just turn it off
whenever we feel like it.

480
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:23,479
If he keeps pestering me,

481
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,839
it'll be an excruciating process.

482
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,280
Initially, I thought of
cutting him some slack

483
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:30,079
since he was doing well
for the past few days.

484
00:27:30,479 --> 00:27:32,400
I didn't expect him to
hurt you this deeply.

485
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,079
Even though you were pregnant,
you still chose to leave him.

486
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:38,760
I just feel exhausted.

487
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:40,680
That's why I pulled out
of the relationship.

488
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Actually,

489
00:27:42,199 --> 00:27:43,560
he did nothing wrong.

490
00:27:43,719 --> 00:27:44,719
"He did nothing wrong"?

491
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,000
He was the reason that
a pregnant woman like you

492
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:48,920
moved to Chongqing alone
in search of a job.

493
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,199
You wouldn't even be in the hospital
in the first place

494
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:52,719
if he didn't insist on
asking you out today.

495
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:54,920
Even now, are you speaking up for him?

496
00:27:56,439 --> 00:27:57,920
I'm not speaking up for him.

497
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,239
I just understood

498
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:08,280
that true love isn't what you get from
the relationship. It's what you give.

499
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,760
I truly hope that he can find happiness

500
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,760
instead of wasting his time

501
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,479
in order to make it up to me.

502
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,400
What's wrong?

503
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,920
Were you touched?

504
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,359
Yes.

505
00:28:35,439 --> 00:28:36,719
It's pretty touching.

506
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,680
I never expected such selfless love
to exist in the world.

507
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,740
(Open file)

508
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,980
(Koala)

509
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:00,020
(I hope we can take more
pictures together in the future)

510
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,760
Come in.

511
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,160
Why are you still awake at this hour?

512
00:29:22,479 --> 00:29:23,839
I wish to chat with you.

513
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:29,479
Initially, I'm here today

514
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:31,760
to call you back to the company.

515
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,880
Xu Yuanzhi has been acting in secret.

516
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,439
I'm afraid he might come up
with devious plots.

517
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,040
But now, it seems that you won't
be able to return for some time.

518
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,239
I'll try to return to the company
at least once per week.

519
00:29:40,439 --> 00:29:42,280
We can hold video meetings
for the rest of the days.

520
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:43,319
No problem.

521
00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:45,319
I'll keep an eye on the company for you.

522
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,000
Thanks.

523
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,319
So what's with Lu Li and Lu Jingwen?

524
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,959
I don't know.

525
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,880
Maybe it's real,

526
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:04,800
or maybe they're just putting on an act.

527
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,040
So what's your plan?

528
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,119
Lu Li still doesn't believe that
I'm sincere towards her.

529
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:13,760
If so, I'll take it one step at a time.

530
00:30:13,959 --> 00:30:14,959
There's no need to rush.

531
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:16,920
She stood strong for many years
because of me.

532
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,920
I'm sure I can do the same for her.

533
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:23,400
Lu Li once told me something.

534
00:30:23,719 --> 00:30:26,079
She said she believed that
perseverance is magical.

535
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:29,040
She's so silly.

536
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,199
Look at you, aren't you mimicking her?

537
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:37,839
So is that a compliment?

538
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,719
Take a guess.

539
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:02,199
Xiaoqi.

540
00:31:04,719 --> 00:31:06,280
Hello, Xiaoqi. We meet again.

541
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,839
Come.

542
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,000
Be careful.

543
00:31:17,439 --> 00:31:18,599
Are you here for a long time?

544
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,800
Nope.

545
00:31:23,479 --> 00:31:24,839
Order anything you like.

546
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,599
It's fine.

547
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,079
Miss Yezi, you can
take a look at the menu first.

548
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,000
She?

549
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,719
She loves the spaghetti carbonara here.

550
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,599
She loves the mushroom soup as well.

551
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,560
Am I right?

552
00:31:36,719 --> 00:31:37,760
Anything is fine for me.

553
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,079
Just order something random for me.

554
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:40,160
All right.

555
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,760
Waiter,

556
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,199
give us two spaghetti carbonara

557
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,439
and two bowls of mushroom soup.

558
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,400
Xiaoqi,

559
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,119
I'll order a steak for you.

560
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,079
Give us one steak.

561
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,520
I always wanted to introduce you two
to each other,

562
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,599
but I couldn't find the chance to do so.

563
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:57,920
That's why I had to be shameless
and tagged along today.

564
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:00,280
Xiaoqi, will you be angry at me?

565
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,239
Why should I be angry?

566
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,439
I'm here to sponge food
off of him anyway.

567
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,920
Yezi, you can ask her anything you like.

568
00:32:10,199 --> 00:32:11,119
Xiaoqi,

569
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:13,599
I heard that you two grew up together.

570
00:32:13,719 --> 00:32:15,359
You must know
everything about him, right?

571
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,920
He said he had never been
in a relationship before.

572
00:32:17,479 --> 00:32:18,880
Was he telling the truth?

573
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,880
How should I know?

574
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,040
Anyway, he has received

575
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,560
countless love letters
from girls since young.

576
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,319
I knew it.

577
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,959
Don't listen to her.

578
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,680
I've never received
any love letters before.

579
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,719
Yezi, you can take this.

580
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,319
Is it mine?

581
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:43,839
One bowl wasn't enough for you, right?

582
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:45,800
That's why I ordered two bowls for you.

583
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:47,000
Thank you.

584
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:48,439
Enjoy yourself.

585
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:52,760
It's so hot.

586
00:32:55,479 --> 00:32:57,239
You can't drink cold water
for the next few days.

587
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:11,199
Wait!

588
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,239
I...

589
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:18,920
I need to use the washroom.

590
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,400
Wait for my return.

591
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,400
Don't touch my steak.

592
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:31,239
Director Gu, what do you think?

593
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:32,599
How's my acting?

594
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,839
Very good. Keep up the good work.

595
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Don't worry. I can do even better.

596
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,199
You don't need to go overboard.

597
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:15,879
Come.

598
00:34:15,959 --> 00:34:17,080
Give it to me.

599
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:17,959
You shouldn't take it.

600
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,320
Be careful.

601
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,600
Hold on to me.

602
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,600
Be careful.

603
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,919
Do you feel better?

604
00:34:28,479 --> 00:34:30,280
Can you be punctual next time?

605
00:34:30,439 --> 00:34:32,040
We've been waiting for ten minutes.

606
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,080
Sorry about that.

607
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,239
Junior was experiencing car sickness
on our way here.

608
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,120
That's why...

609
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,439
Are you okay?

610
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,959
Naturally, she'll be fine

611
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,000
under my great care.

612
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,280
You guys don't need to worry about that.

613
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,719
Come, Junior. Have another sip.

614
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,919
There are some rides nearby.
Are you guys interested?

615
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,159
No.

616
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,600
Junior can't take
any dangerous rides for now.

617
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:58,479
That's right.

618
00:34:59,439 --> 00:35:00,879
Let's take a walk then.

619
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,639
Let's take in some fresh air.

620
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,479
Sure.

621
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,600
You guys can go ahead.

622
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:08,000
I'll take care of the luggage.

623
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,919
I need some help with them.
Lu Jingwen, help me out.

624
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,879
Ask Yiming to help you.

625
00:35:12,959 --> 00:35:13,840
I need to take care of Junior.

626
00:35:13,959 --> 00:35:14,959
No.

627
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,879
Yiming needs to stay by my side.

628
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,879
I'll take care of Sister-in-law.

629
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:22,239
Sister-in-law, let's go.

630
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:30,439
Let's go.

631
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:35,439
There are plenty of boats here.

632
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,080
Let me ask them if we can tour the lake.

633
00:35:51,879 --> 00:35:54,199
If I knew this would happen,
I wouldn't have accepted your gift.

634
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,280
What?

635
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,719
You left without saying goodbye
after I accepted your gift.

636
00:35:58,879 --> 00:36:01,159
After that, you even left Xinhai
and went missing.

637
00:36:01,399 --> 00:36:02,159
Lu Li,

638
00:36:02,479 --> 00:36:04,399
I don't think this is
how you should treat your friend.

639
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:06,280
Sorry about that.

640
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:09,120
Back then, I had no choice.

641
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,679
I wasn't able to operate on
Jiang Yicheng's system anymore.

642
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,439
The only thing on my mind
was to uninstall myself from it.

643
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,879
I forgot to consider your feelings.

644
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,040
If the program can't be processed,

645
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,199
the missing DLL files

646
00:36:19,399 --> 00:36:21,159
may be the cause of it.

647
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,159
He has patched up the system
for the past few months.

648
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,879
Don't you want to give it another go?

649
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:26,560
Yiming,

650
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:27,199
Sister-in-law,

651
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,000
come quickly.

652
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,560
We can take the boats here.

653
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,399
Let's go.

654
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:35,280
I'll stay here.
The scenery here is great.

655
00:36:35,399 --> 00:36:36,600
I'll take a walk myself.

656
00:36:36,879 --> 00:36:37,959
Let me accompany you.

657
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,040
No need.

658
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,199
Why are you guys still standing there?

659
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,040
Come quickly.

660
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:42,679
Help me put on some sunscreen.

661
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:46,120
Do me a favour.

662
00:36:46,399 --> 00:36:47,840
Put on sunscreen for her
before you leave, all right?

663
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:52,800
Before this, you envied me
because of my perseverance.

664
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,000
Look at Zitong, she's willing to
persevere until now because of you.

665
00:36:56,919 --> 00:36:59,120
No matter how many times you reject her,

666
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,239
she's still as courageous as always.

667
00:37:03,479 --> 00:37:06,360
And she's your program, not mine.

668
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,080
Good luck.

669
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,520
Yiming.

670
00:37:16,959 --> 00:37:18,000
Coming.

671
00:37:21,919 --> 00:37:22,879
Where's Sister-in-law?

672
00:37:23,399 --> 00:37:25,000
She wants to take a walk over there.

673
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,320
Let's have a private date then.

674
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:27,919
Come.

675
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,760
We'll take the boat
after you put on sunscreen for me.

676
00:37:29,959 --> 00:37:31,199
Can't you do it yourself?

677
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,840
I can't reach my back.

678
00:37:32,919 --> 00:37:34,600
Hurry up.

679
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,040
Why are you standing there? Hurry up.

680
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,120
What's wrong again?

681
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,679
I think it's better for you
to wear your shirt

682
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,159
and protect yourself from the sun.

683
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,360
There's no need for sunscreen.

684
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,800
That won't do. I need double protection.

685
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,159
Please hurry, all right?

686
00:38:17,479 --> 00:38:18,320
Yiming,

687
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,479
in the future,

688
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:22,120
you'll be in charge of putting on
sunscreen for me.

689
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:24,000
Yiming.

690
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,399
Why are you guys here?

691
00:38:26,879 --> 00:38:27,719
Where's Lu Li?

692
00:38:27,919 --> 00:38:29,320
She said she wanted
to take a walk over there.

693
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:30,520
I'll go and find her then.

694
00:38:30,919 --> 00:38:31,679
Me too.

695
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:33,320
No.

696
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,560
We need another person
for the boat ride.

697
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:38,080
If not, they won't allow us
to take the ride.

698
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:39,879
Jingwen, join us.

699
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,439
If so,

700
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,080
fine then.

701
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:44,280
But let me warn you.

702
00:38:44,439 --> 00:38:45,719
You must take good care of Junior.

703
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,360
You mustn't pester her.

704
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,840
And when it comes to her,

705
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:49,639
she...

706
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:51,560
I did not finish yet.

707
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:53,439
Can you at least let me
finish my words before leaving?

708
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,600
Don't you even have basic manners?

709
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:25,520
Let's go.

710
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:27,199
Be careful.

711
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,919
Thanks.

712
00:39:55,919 --> 00:39:57,159
I told you before.

713
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,360
There's no need for you
to be this courteous with me.

714
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,919
It was fine just now.

715
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,879
I never expected it
to rain all of a sudden.

716
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,879
Sunshower is also known as fox rain.

717
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,159
Have you ever heard of its story?

718
00:40:16,439 --> 00:40:17,320
No.

719
00:40:19,479 --> 00:40:20,360
Rumour has it

720
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:22,840
that a fox transformed into a human

721
00:40:22,919 --> 00:40:24,600
and came to the human world
in search of love.

722
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:27,280
But because of its beautiful appearance,

723
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,280
people started to get jealous of it.

724
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,840
They spread rumours about

725
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:33,800
it eating men's innards.

726
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,600
That's why it didn't manage
to find its true love.

727
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,399
It cries whenever it feels sad.

728
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,080
When it cries, it'll rain.

729
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,679
Did they not believe in her
because of mere rumours?

730
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,639
I guess that wasn't the true love
she was looking for.

731
00:40:55,439 --> 00:40:56,760
You're right.

732
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,879
When there's no trust in a relationship,

733
00:41:00,439 --> 00:41:03,280
only suspicions and injuries exist.

734
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,879
I know.

735
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,280
I know my trust value

736
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,800
is zero or negative right now.

737
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,239
But I will work hard

738
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,639
to boost it to its original value.

739
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,120
Look, there's a rainbow.

740
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,719
Hurry and make a wish.

741
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,040
Do you still believe in that?

742
00:41:45,399 --> 00:41:46,479
Initially, I didn't believe in it.

743
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,840
But now, I do believe in it.

744
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:53,080
Because right now, I have wishes
that I hope will come true.

745
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,639
The rain stopped.

746
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:08,439
Let's return.

747
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,080
Lady Jiang.

748
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,919
You do look great
no matter what you wear.

749
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,320
Are you telling me?

750
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:34,199
I think we haven't
had a proper chat yet.

751
00:42:34,439 --> 00:42:36,800
Why don't I introduce myself
to you again?

752
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,520
I'm uninterested in you.

753
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,159
I'll go and find my junior then.

754
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,639
Suddenly, I feel

755
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,959
that interests

756
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,199
can be cultivated.

757
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,760
What do you think?

758
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:54,280
You have a point.

759
00:42:54,399 --> 00:42:55,560
But I think

760
00:42:55,719 --> 00:42:57,719
looking for my junior is more important.

761
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,959
The rain has stopped.

762
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,520
I think they'll return soon.

763
00:43:01,639 --> 00:43:03,360
Even if you go there, you might not
be able to find them.

764
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,760
It's better for you to wait here.

765
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,040
Fine then.

766
00:43:08,439 --> 00:43:09,520
I'll go and cook.

767
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:10,600
When Junior returns,

768
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,479
she'll be able to enjoy
a hot and delicious meal.

769
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:14,159
Do you want to join me?

770
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:15,600
Sure.

771
00:43:15,919 --> 00:43:16,800
Let's go.

772
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:21,280
(Brother, I'm sacrificing myself
because of you.)

773
00:43:21,479 --> 00:43:22,959
(You better don't let me down.)

774
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,159
Must you guys need to express
your boredom in that way?

775
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,040
Life is great.
You guys should be happier.

776
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,320
Why don't we play a game?

777
00:43:48,479 --> 00:43:50,320
The loser will wash the dishes.
How about that?

778
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,199
What kind of game?

779
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,800
How about tearing the tissue paper?

780
00:43:56,199 --> 00:43:57,120
How do we play this?

781
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,719
First, you'll hold a tissue paper
with your mouth.

782
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,439
After that, you'll pass it around.

783
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,719
The next person needs to tear a portion
of the tissue paper with their mouth.

784
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,320
They can't use anything else to help them.

785
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:08,399
If, there's no more tissue paper to tear

786
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,080
or the next person doesn't dare
to tear the tissue paper,

787
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:12,239
that means he or she will be the loser.

788
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,040
What do you think?

789
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:13,879
Game on.

790
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:14,719
I'll be the next player after Yiming.

791
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,239
He's number one. I'm number two.

792
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:17,879
I'll be number three then.

793
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,560
- If so, I'll be number four.
- I'll be number four.

794
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,679
Since both of you
want to be number four,

795
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,520
why don't you two have
an arm-wrestling match?

796
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:28,919
The winner will take number four.

797
00:44:28,959 --> 00:44:29,800
What do you think?

798
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:31,120
Great idea.

799
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,639
No problem.

800
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,320
No problem at all.

801
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,879
It's finally time for my muscles
to be useful.

802
00:44:36,959 --> 00:44:37,719
Come.

803
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,959
It's not too late for you
to admit defeat.

804
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,120
If not, you'll embarrass yourself later.

805
00:44:42,199 --> 00:44:43,239
Let's begin.

806
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:48,760
Three, two, one, begin.

807
00:44:49,919 --> 00:44:51,600
I wasn't ready yet. Again.

808
00:44:51,959 --> 00:44:52,560
Wait!

809
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:53,360
I want a rematch!

810
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,280
You should accept your defeat graciously.

811
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,040
Yiming.

812
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:56,719
Fine.

813
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,159
(If love is a program,)

814
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,280

and uninstalled at will,)

815
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,719
(everything will be much easier.)

816
00:46:14,399 --> 00:46:16,679
(It's a pity that it's not a program.)

817
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,639
(We can't send or receive love at will.)
