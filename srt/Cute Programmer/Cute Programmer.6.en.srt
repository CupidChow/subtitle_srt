in the middle of the night?

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,080
Mum, come over here.

24
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,120
Come over here.

25
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,039
Just type randomly.

26
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:09,279
What do you mean?

27
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:09,880
Like this.

28
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:11,399
Like this?

29
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:18,720
What are you two doing

30
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,479
instead of sleeping?

31
00:02:19,559 --> 00:02:20,720
Come and take a look.

32
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,279
How did you make that?

33
00:02:24,839 --> 00:02:26,039
Dad, Mum,

34
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,320
this was the first program I learned

35
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,919
in the programming language course
I'm taking.

36
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,960
Hello World.

37
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,800
It's a greeting to the world.

38
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,000
Back then, I asked my lecturer
why he chose this phrase.

39
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,279
My lecturer said

40
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,800
that from now on,

41
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,919
there's life in your program.

42
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:44,839
This is pretty interesting.

43
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:45,559
Come.

44
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,839
Explain it to us.

45
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,320
I love programming.

46
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:51,240
Because, it's a simple world.

47
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:53,240
When you're right, you're right.
When you're wrong, you're wrong.

48
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,039
You can use alphabets and symbols

49
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,960
to create the things you want.

50
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:58,479
It's something very fulfilling

51
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,399
and it brings me a sense of achievement.

52
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:03,679
Even if you like it, it doesn't mean
that it's suitable for you.

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,839
It's tough for a girl
to be a programmer, you know?

54
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:11,039
Don't tell me you're a genius and
you don't need to work overtime?

55
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,479
Mum,

56
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:14,800
although I'm not talented,

57
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:17,399
every occupation out there is tough.

58
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,800
I wish to spend my youth and energy

59
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,720
on something I like.

60
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,119
Mum,

61
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,000
it was hard for me to join this company.

62
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:29,240
I don't want to lose this chance.

63
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,240
Why don't you give me one year
to prove myself?

64
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,479
If, I'm still the same person
I was after one year,

65
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:37,919
I'll quit my job.

66
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:42,720
Mum,

67
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,399
didn't you say this before?

68
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,880
You don't expect me to be a millionaire.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,360
You just want me
to be healthy and happy, right?

70
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,440
That's what you told me.

71
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:51,720
You can't just lie to me.

72
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,919
How is that possible?

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's fine as long as you're happy.

74
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,039
Am I right?

75
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,240
I'll give you my full support.

76
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:58,839
Thank you, Dad.

77
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,119
It's not that I'm trying to stop you.

78
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,000
It's fine as long as
you don't regret your decision.

79
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:10,839
Thank you, Mum.

80
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:16,119
So, you don't need to quit your job.

81
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,320
Even so, you need to
find yourself a boyfriend.

82
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:22,000
So, that Mr. Chen who came today,

83
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,799
I think he's a nice guy.

84
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:25,600
Yeah.

85
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:28,160
It's time for you to
get into a relationship.

86
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,200
Regarding this,

87
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:30,600
your mother and I don't object to it,

88
00:04:30,679 --> 00:04:31,200
understood?

89
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,600
Dad, Mum, you guys should sleep early.

90
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:36,880
All right.

91
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,480
All right.

92
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:38,239
Don't stay up too late.

93
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:38,880
All right.

94
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:39,799
Don't stay up too late, alright?

95
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:40,679
Let's go.

96
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:01,839
My son,

97
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,200
I found a restaurant which serves
great fish dishes.

98
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:03,880
I'll bring you there later.

99
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:04,320
Morning.

100
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,440
I bought coffee for everyone.

101
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,839
Lu Li.

102
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:07,720
Morning.

103
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,440
Lu Li, did you strike the lottery?

104
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,640
It's better than striking the lottery.

105
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,600
Tell us about it then.

106
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:13,119
Let us celebrate
your happiness together.

107
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:13,519
Yeah.

108
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:13,880
Yeah.

109
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:14,760
It's a secret.

110
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:16,000

111
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:16,600
A secret?

112
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,040
Let's fix him!

113
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,920
Yeah!

114
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:19,760
Don't touch me!

115
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,000
Are you telling us or not?

116
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,600
Are you telling us or not?

117

118

Put me down!

120
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,359
Put him down.

121
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:30,559
Are you guys done with
the optimization test?

122
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,839
Not yet.

123
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,559
Have you finished doing what
the Planning Department told you to?

124
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,839
No.

125
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,679
I don't think so.

126
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:37,440
And you,

127
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,839

who suffers from a stomachache

when you see the lecturers.

This is an old ailment of mine.

197
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,520
Since it's an old ailment,

198
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,159
you should rest in
our lecturer's office.

199

Let's go.

200

I'm looking for Professor Li.

Professor Li isn't around.

211
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,799
It's fine. We'll wait for him.

212
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,479
Professor Li left early as he has
family affairs to attend to.

213
00:09:54,599 --> 00:09:55,679
It's useless even if you wait here.

214

We came at such bad timing.

215
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,320

Are you free tomorrow?

223
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,719
I'm free.

224
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,000
I was planning to go,

225
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,359
but I couldn't get the ticket in time.

226
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,200
I need another cosplayer.

227
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,599
Can you recommend one friend?

228

Our pay is much higher

229
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:55,880
than our peers in the same field.

230
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:56,960

isn't working tomorrow.

lend me your mask.

00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:41,760
Xiaolongnü.

341
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:43,119
It's just a picture.

342
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,000
Yeah.

343
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:44,799
You don't need to resort to this.

344
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,320
Can you put it down?

345
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,239
Yeah, put it down.

346
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
Jiang...

347
00:14:55,719 --> 00:14:56,799
Mr. Jiang.

348
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:07,280
Lu Li?

349
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,359
Lu Li?

350
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,960
Why are you wearing a female costume?

351
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,919
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

352
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,599
Since when did you become a girl?

353
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,320
Yeah.

354
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:18,880
Gender doesn't matter to a cosplayer.

355
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,080
My hair!

356
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,840
I got both evidence and witnesses now.
How do you explain yourself?

357
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,880
Mr. Jiang.

358
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:50,320
You tried so hard to join my company.

359
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:51,599
What's your motive?

360
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,479
Mr. Jiang, I'm sorry.

361
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:56,840
It's all my fault.

362
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:00,320
I came up with this idea because

363
00:16:00,479 --> 00:16:02,559
I truly love the games
developed by your company.

364
00:16:05,479 --> 00:16:06,799
I'm giving you a chance
to explain yourself,

365
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:08,080
not to brush me off.

366
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,400
I'm serious.

367
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,880
Games produced by
different game companies

368
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,679
are different from one another.

369
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,760
Although the games produced by
Enchant Technology

370
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,239
have an other-worldly vibe to them,

371
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:19,080
they bring the simplest

372
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:20,400
and most direct experience
to the gamers.

373
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:22,400
I love these kinds of games.

374
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,880
You managed

375
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,359
to create a simple and
uncomplicated world for the gamers.

376
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:29,359
This is the same as why I fell in love
with programming in the first place.

377
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,080
I guess you have great taste.

378
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,280
But I hate it when people deceive me.

379
00:16:35,599 --> 00:16:36,799
From tomorrow onwards,
you can stay at home.

380
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,280
Mr. Jiang, I know my fault now.

381
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,599
Can you please give me another chance?

382
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,520
No.

383
00:16:40,719 --> 00:16:41,880
You don't have any special rights.

384
00:16:46,599 --> 00:16:49,799
I guess you fell in love with
a female programmer before.

385
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:53,599
What did you say?

386
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:57,640
You got your heart broken by
a female programmer.

387
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,200
That's why you have prejudices
against female programmers.

388
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:02,159
You know nothing about me.

389
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,799
Do you think you understand me?

390
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,119
If so, why aren't you
allowing me to stay?

391
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:06,959
Because I think you're a nuisance.

392
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,520
I don't like it.

393
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,560
Do you understand me?

394
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,920
From tomorrow onwards,

395
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,160
never show your face in front of me.

396
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,560
Mr. Jiang,

397
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,160
I know my words

398
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,119
won't be able to change your mind.

399
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,000
But I hope you can give me more time.

400
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,400
Let me leave after I finish my handover.

401
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,640
Okay?

402
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,359
Seven days.

403
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,119
You have seven days.

404
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,239
All right.

405
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,520
Thank you, boss.

406
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:30,520
(You know nothing about me.)

407
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,280
(Do you think you understand me?)

408
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:34,439
(If so, why aren't you
allowing me to stay?)

409
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,439
(Because I think you're a nuisance.)

410
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,079
(I don't like it.)

411
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,239
(Do you understand me?)

412
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:43,400
I think I've made Jiang Yicheng
angry for real.

413
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:46,839
I've never seen him this angry before.

414
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,640
It's all my fault.

415
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,040
He wouldn't have found you

416
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:54,359
if I didn't drag you to the
anime convention.

417
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:54,959
Come.

418
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:55,839
Let me drink with you.

419
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:57,079
This is too cold.

420
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,839
Drink this.

421
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:00,319
It's all because of you.

422
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:01,359
He might not be able to spot
Lu Li in the first place

423
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:02,880
if you weren't that easy to spot.

424
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,199
Do you guys really think that
this incident is a coincidence?

425
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,400
It's not a coincidence.

426
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,640
It's a misfortune.

427
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,599
Jiang Yicheng may look like
a random person,

428
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:15,599
but he does everything

429
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,319
for a reason.

430
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,520
Are you saying

431
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,560
that he blocked me on purpose?

432
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,160
To put it more accurately,
he laid a trap for you.

433
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,319
And you fell into his trap.

434
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,000
According to what I know,

435
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:28,880
Enchant Technology

436
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,640
was one of the organisers
for the anime convention as well.

437
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:31,839
Xiaoqi,

438
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,880
didn't you say that someone recommended
you to attend the anime convention?

439
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:36,000
Who's that person?

440
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:40,319
That Jiang Yicheng is too devious.

441
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:42,199
My Lu Li

442
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,400
is no match for him.

443
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,479
Now, I have seven days left.

444
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,119
You guys should help me out.

445
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,560
What can I do

446
00:19:53,719 --> 00:19:55,359
to make him change his mind?

447
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,520
Li, I'm not trying to make you
feel disheartened,

448
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,800
but a crush is a bitter affair.

449
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,800
You'll never be able to wait until
the day it bears fruit.

450
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,880
Why don't you go to the forest

451
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,920
and take a look at other animals?

452
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,599
Lu Li,

453
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,199
now, Jiang Yicheng
has given you a red card.

454
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,920
Even if you can stay by his side,

455
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,160
I'm afraid your relationship with him
will be stunted.

456
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,040
I know that.

457
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,439
Correcting a code is harder than
creating a new code.

458
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,439
But if I give up because I'm afraid
of correcting the code,

459
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,839
I will never be able
to create a good program.

460
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,000
Why are you looking at me?

461
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,199
How about this?

462
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,239
I'll give you a chance
to atone for your sins.

463
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,239
You're allowed to join our bestie group

464
00:20:58,439 --> 00:21:00,920
and come up with a seven-day plan.

465
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:06,599
Cheers.

466
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,160
No joke.

467
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:16,959
It's true.

468
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,599
Who is this?

469
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:22,760
Morning, everyone.

470
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,439
Morning.

471
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,719
Brother,

472
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:27,839
your hair is pretty long, huh?

473
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,479
It's pretty thick as well.

474
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,479
I brought some fruits for everyone.

475
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,400
Thanks.

476
00:21:33,479 --> 00:21:34,359
The orange of successful coding?

477
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:35,439
This is great.

478
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,079
This can be the mascot of our company.

479
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:38,079
What mascot?

480
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:39,280
She's just a cheater.

481
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,719
Sorry.

482
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:46,520
It was my fault for hiding the truth.

483
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,640
If you guys think it's uncomfortable
to get along with me,

484
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,400
you can act like you always did.

485
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:51,640
It's fine.

486
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,680
Come, brother.

487
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,079
I mean, sister.

488
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:00,479
I'm not used to seeing her like this
after a sudden change of attributes.

489
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,359
Brother Lei,

490
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,280
these are the data I recorded
last night. Take a look.

491
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:05,680
Sure.

492
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,800
Just leave it to me.

493
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:07,599
Actually,

494
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,839
Lu is still quite professional
as a programmer.

495
00:22:09,959 --> 00:22:10,680
You don't say?

496
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,959
She's not a chatterbox
and she's hard-working.

497
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,880
She's better than all of you.

498
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,760
Especially you.

499
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:15,520
What's wrong with me?

500
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,319
She's only good at writing codes.

501
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,959
I don't think she's good
at anything else.

502
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:20,959
What do you know?

503
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,719
Boys and girls together,
the work becomes lighter.

504
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:24,119
Even if Lu does nothing in the office,

505
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:25,560
she can be our eye candy

506
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,079
even if she just stays in the office.

507
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,800
It can relieve our eye fatigue.

508
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,719
Am I right?

509
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,079
Everyone,

510
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:34,599
seems like all of us

511
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,280
can't bear for Lu to leave us.

512
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,760
So, should we think of something

513
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,160
to persuade Mr. Jiang to...

514
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,079
What?

515
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,479
Let's go to our usual place,
the staircase.

516
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,040
Let's go.

517
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,319
F4 plus one.

518
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,199
Coming.

519
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,839
We need to think of something.

520
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:05,640
How do we go about this?

521
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:06,239
This is tough.

522
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:07,439
We need to deal with it
even if it's tough.

523
00:23:13,719 --> 00:23:14,319
(Remember.)

524
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,199
Jiang Yicheng is a workaholic.

525
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:17,640
(As long you work hard,)

526
00:23:17,719 --> 00:23:19,280
(you might be able to change his mind.)

527
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,800
(Men can't stand it when women
are being concerned about them.)

528
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,119
If you wish to move his heart,

529
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,800
you need to move his stomach first.

530
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,400
Tears are our weapons
provided by the heavens.

531
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,839
You can use them to move
Jiang Yicheng's heart.

532
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:53,959
I've never seen
a girl with skills like hers.

533
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,040
I'm going to have a solo match with her.

534
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:56,640
Say,

535
00:23:56,719 --> 00:23:58,760
she has both the looks and abilities.

536
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,719
Won't it be embarrassing

537
00:24:00,959 --> 00:24:02,119
(if she ends up
being our rival one day?)

538
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:02,920
(My goodness.)

539
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,000
The data structures are quite good.

540
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,800
Lu Li was the one who made it.

541
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:11,319
The young girl is professional
and flexible.

542
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,959
The most important thing is...

543
00:24:20,199 --> 00:24:21,640
I've belittled you.

544
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:23,599
You're actually staging this act
in our current society?

545
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,160
Do you think you're Zhu Yingtai?

546
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:29,160
I'm not finished yet.

547
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,199
Where are you going?

548
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,040
I'm going to return
Mr. Chen's book for him.

549
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,400
I knew you did it
to approach Chen Yiming.

550
00:24:36,199 --> 00:24:37,719
No one can escape from my eyes.

551
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,839
It's no wonder you couldn't make
Mr. Chen fall for you.

552
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,599
You!

553
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,119
Tong, don't be angry.

554
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:48,079
Tell me.

555
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:50,280
How much do I need to pay you
to leave the company?

556
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,439
You don't need to pay a single cent.

557
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,560
Mr. Jiang told me to leave
after a few days.

558
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,359
He's my brother indeed.

559
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,719
He's merciful enough

560
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,359
by not punishing you in public.

561
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,479
Let me warn you.

562
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:05,439
From today onwards,

563
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,040
you better stay away from Chen Yiming.

564
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:08,400
(Don't let me catch you!)

565
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,280
Have a taste.

566
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:14,760
I made this with
the new coffee beans I bought.

567
00:25:15,439 --> 00:25:16,800
Unaccountably solicitous,
one is hiding evil intentions.

568
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,560
Don't worry.

569
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,760
I just want to keep someone
in the company.

570
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,680
You can leave the coffee here,
but not the person.

571
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,239
I don't want you to
ruin another person's dream

572
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,719
because of your personal reasons.

573
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:32,160
She was the one who deceived me first.

574
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,319
What has it got to do with me?

575
00:25:33,439 --> 00:25:34,079
Is that so?

576
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:35,719
If Lu Li leaves,

577
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:36,640
can we

578
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:38,199
find another female programmer
to replace her?

579
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:39,359
What's the matter with you?

580
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,359
Why are you so passionate about
female programmers?

581
00:25:43,239 --> 00:25:45,040
I just hope that you can
stop being stubborn

582
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,719
after Lu Li's arrival.

583
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,839
Fine.

584
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,000
It's okay for female programmers
to join us, except for her.

585
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:52,280
But why?

586
00:25:54,439 --> 00:25:55,959
Will you pretend to be a girl

587
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,199
to join a company?

588
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,839
No, right?

589
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,199
Ordinary people won't do so.

590
00:26:00,719 --> 00:26:02,839
Unless she has a secret.

591
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,400
Mum?

592
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:41,479
What's wrong? I'm busy.

593
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,599
I told you to observe

594
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,280
the man beside your brother, right?

595
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,359
It's been a few days.

596
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,680
How did the observation go?

597
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,920
Man?

598
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,599
She's just a woman
with an ulterior motive.

599
00:26:54,439 --> 00:26:55,599
A woman?

600
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,479
It's nice, right?

601
00:27:39,439 --> 00:27:41,040
Yeah.

602
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:42,160
Lu Li.

603
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,319
Do you know me?

604
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,280
I didn't expect you to be the same
person as you were in senior high.

605
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,680
You're just as outspoken as always.

606
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:01,880
(Why is she here?)

607
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:03,719
Sorry.

608
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:05,040
I must've scared you.

609
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:06,760
You should have something hot
to soothe your nerves.

610
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,359
Let me introduce myself.

611
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,599
I'm Yicheng's mother.

612
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,160
You can call me Aunt Cheng.

613
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,520
Nice to meet you, Aunt Cheng.

614
00:28:26,719 --> 00:28:27,719
So, you...

615
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:28,839
What's with...

616
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:30,959
I heard

617
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:33,800
that Yicheng hired a female programmer.

618
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,239
I was especially curious.

619
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:36,640
That's why I came here to check you out.

620
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,319
I know our meeting is quite sudden.

621
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:44,199
Why don't you come to my house tomorrow?

622
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,000
Let me compensate for my rudeness,

623
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:47,000
okay?

624
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:48,560
Aunt, it's fine.

625
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,239
I still need to work tomorrow.

626
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,719
It hurts!

627
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,880
Aunt, what's wrong?

628
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:00,079
I think I was shocked.

629
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,000
Do you want me to
send you to the hospital?

630
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,040
No need.

631
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:05,719
I feel much better

632
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,079
after I see you.

633
00:29:08,199 --> 00:29:09,640
Why don't you come to my house tomorrow?

634
00:29:09,719 --> 00:29:11,439
Let's have a chat, alright?

635
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,880
But Mr. Jiang is...

636
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,439
Mr. Jiang isn't at home usually.

637
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,040
I think it's hurting again.

638
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:21,920
Aunt, I...

639
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,199
Please?

640
00:29:24,479 --> 00:29:25,800
I'll visit you tomorrow then.

641
00:29:26,479 --> 00:29:27,359
Really?

642
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,880
It's a deal then.

643
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,280
I'll wait for you.

644
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:32,680
I think it's still hurting.

645
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:34,239
I'll return first.

646
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:36,760
Goodbye.

647
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:52,640
Why do I feel like I was deceived?

648
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,560
Xiaoqi, I'll leave first.

649
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,439
Wait!

650
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,800
What's wrong?

651
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,000
My goodness.

652
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:12,920
Do you plan to see your future
mother-in-law like this?

653
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,880
This is my most expensive pair of jeans,
you know?

654
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,160
That's not the main point.

655
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:20,119
The main point is elders love skirts.

656
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,560
They love girls
who are obedient and cute.

657
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:24,160
They said it's easier
to get married that way.

658
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,079
But that's not the real me.

659
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,199
This is the real me.

660
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:29,239
I won't feel restricted in this way.

661
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:30,760
You do have a point.

662
00:30:31,439 --> 00:30:32,280
But

663
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,719
wait a moment.

664
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,040
This is my last insistence.

665
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,760
Relax.

666
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,160
I believe that no matter who it is,

667
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,479
as long as they try to understand you,

668
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,760
they'll fall for you.

669
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,560
Except for Jiang Yicheng.
It's been four days.

670
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,920
But he's still ignoring me.

671
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,479
Why don't you try an indirect method?

672
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,760
You should deal with his mother first.

673
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:02,839
Maybe, you'll be able to stay in
his company after that.

674
00:31:05,719 --> 00:31:07,000
I don't think that's suitable.

675
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,800
So, you want to pack your things,

676
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,800
leave the company after three days,

677
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,880
and never see Jiang Yicheng again?

678
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:14,880
No.

679
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,920
That's right.

680
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,839
Head towards your goal

681
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,920
and move forward!

682
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,040
You!

683
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,680
You're here?

684
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:22,560
Hi, Aunt.

685
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:23,719
Come in.

686
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:25,520
This is a gift for you.

687
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,800
You don't need to be so courteous.

688
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,319
Your presence is enough.

689
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:30,920
What is this?

690
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,359
This is a portable speaker.

691
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,119
You can use it when you do your dances.

692
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,160
What kind of dance?

693
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,560
Square dance.

694
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,280
Square dance?

695
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,640
My mother said

696
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,119
when they do square dancing,

697
00:32:44,199 --> 00:32:45,800
they need to bring their speakers
there in turn.

698
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,280
This model covers a huge range

699
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:49,760
and it looks stylish as well.

700
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,439
Do you want to give it a try?

701
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,280
No thanks.

702
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:56,880
No thanks.

703
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:57,959
I was arranging my flowers just now.

704
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,119
Why don't we do it together?

705
00:32:59,239 --> 00:33:00,239
Come in.

706
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,680
It must be boring.

707
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,839
It's not that bad.

708
00:33:13,239 --> 00:33:14,959
But this is my first time doing it.

709
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,920
I'm inexperienced.

710
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,119
Just follow your heart.

711
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:20,280
You can arrange it
according to your preferences.

712
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,520
Li,

713
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:23,560
how old are you?

714
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,640
I'm 22.

715
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,040
You just graduated from university.

716
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,880
You're quite young, huh?

717
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:33,359
So, what kind of hobbies do you have?

718
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,280
I love to write codes.

719
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:36,920
Anything else?

720
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,400
I love to repair computers as well.

721
00:33:41,199 --> 00:33:43,800
This hobby of yours is pretty unique.

722
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,199
Because in the past,

723
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,160
my neighbours and relatives
always ask me to repair their computers.

724
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,359
I can't always explain to them

725
00:33:52,439 --> 00:33:55,439
that computer science is different from
repairing computers.

726
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,359
That's why I learned how to
repair computers by myself.

727
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:12,000
Aunt,

728
00:34:12,439 --> 00:34:13,360
I'm done.

729
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,040
It's pretty exquisite.

730
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:24,639
Li,

731
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,159
why did you trim all of its leaves?

732
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,560
I think arranging flowers is the same
as writing codes.

733
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,600
I need to save as much space as I can

734
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,600
without destroying
its semantic correlation.

735
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,560
That way, it'll be short and clean.

736
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,000
You do have a point.

737
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,000
You do have a point.

738
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:42,679
Aunt,

739
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,679
what's wrong?

740
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,159
I think the splinter
is deep inside my finger.

741
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,239
I can't get it out.

742
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,719
Do you have baking soda?

743
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,479
It's on the kitchen table.

744
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,040
Aunt,

745
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,800
just immerse your hands in them
for a while.

746
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,320
I've put some salt and baking soda
into the water.

747
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:05,879
Salt can disinfect your wound

748
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,639
while baking soda can soften your skin.

749
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:09,760
Warm water can make your skin expand.

750
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,239
Will I be able to get
the splinter out then?

751
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,439
We can give it a try.

752
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,239
I did get it out.

753
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,840
You're pretty good at this.

754
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:26,719
Aunt, you flatter me.

755
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,840
It's just some basic knowledge.

756
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,320
Do you know how to cook then?

757
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:02,959
Aunt,

758
00:36:03,879 --> 00:36:04,679
have a try.

759
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:24,639
Is it too salty?

760
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,320
It's fine.

761
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:28,800
You did great for your first time.

762
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:34,239
Come.

763
00:36:34,399 --> 00:36:35,639
You should eat them together with me.

764
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,199
Aunt,

765
00:36:36,399 --> 00:36:36,919
I still have other dishes to make.

766
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,679
You can stop now.

767
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:38,479
It's more than enough for us.

768
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:38,919
Come.

769
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,439
Have a seat.

770
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:39,919
Come.

771
00:36:40,919 --> 00:36:41,320
Eat up.

772
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:42,239
Eat up.

773
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,360
Aunt,

774
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:51,280
I'm not too good at cooking.

775
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:52,639
That's normal.

776
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,199
Everyone has their own field
that they like.

777
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,000
It's just

778
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,360
that you don't like
to arrange flowers or cook.

779
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:03,360
We don't have a common interest.

780
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:05,679
How could we live together?

781
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,120
What do you mean by living together?

782
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:09,479
Silly girl,

783
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,600
in the future,

784
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:12,479
you and Yicheng...

785
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:15,760
Why did the lights go out?

786
00:37:15,879 --> 00:37:17,360
Aunt, let me check.

787
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:27,800
Aunt,

788
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,239
the circuit breaker tripped.

789
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,120
Great timing.

790
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:32,360
Let's have a meal outside.

791
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,959
We can leave this to your uncle.

792
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:35,760
Let's go.

793
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:36,520
Aunt,

794
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:38,800
is there anything in your refrigerator?

795
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,199
Oh yeah,

796
00:37:41,919 --> 00:37:43,280
there are plenty of things inside.

797
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,600
What should I do if they thaw?

798
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:47,280
Do you have a toolbox?

799
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:49,959
Aunt, I just examined the cause.

800
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:52,800
This bulb had short-circuited
and caused the trip.

801
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,320
It'll be fine after I change this bulb.

802
00:37:57,919 --> 00:37:58,560
Be careful.

803
00:37:58,679 --> 00:37:59,479
Don't fall down.

804
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:00,760
Don't get yourself electrocuted.

805
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:02,120
Aunt, it's fine.

806
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,639
I tested it using a test pen.

807
00:38:04,399 --> 00:38:05,360
Don't worry.

808
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:12,159
You know how to change bulbs

809
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:13,120
while I know how to cook.

810
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,719
A complementary relationship
like this is great as well.

811
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,239
What do you mean by that?

812
00:38:17,439 --> 00:38:18,800
You know, as mother-in-law
and daughter...

813
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:21,600
Aunt, what's wrong?

814
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:22,199
It pricked my foot!

815
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,280
Take a look!

816
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,520
It's bleeding!

817
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,719
Let me send you to the hospital.

818
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,679
Come.

819
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:38,220
(Nurse Station)

820
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,919
Mum, are you okay?

821
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,159
I'm fine.

822
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,360
The doctor said I could be discharged.

823
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,360
But your father was worried about me.

824
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,120
He told me to stay here for one day.

825
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:03,120
Why are you here?

826
00:39:04,439 --> 00:39:05,280
I...

827
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,600
You see,

828
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,679
it's all thanks to Li.
She carried me to the hospital.

829
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,639
If not, I would've still been
lying on the floor.

830
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,840
You skipped work

831
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:13,879
to go to my house?

832
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,080
I told Mr. Chen that
I was applying for leave.

833
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,840
I'm the one who's sacking you.

834
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,000
It doesn't matter who you try to please.

835
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:20,159
My son, what are you saying?

836
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:21,360
Why are you sacking Li?

837
00:39:21,479 --> 00:39:22,360
I won't agree with that.

838
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:24,679
You actually persuaded my mother
to side with you

839
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,919
after just a few hours?

840
00:39:26,399 --> 00:39:27,760
What are you saying?

841
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,399
Can you be polite for once?

842
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,080
Aunt, I'll return to the company first.

843
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,679
I'll visit you when you feel better.

844
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:37,399
Goodbye, Aunt.

845
00:39:37,919 --> 00:39:38,800
Goodbye, Mr. Jiang.

846
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:45,080
What were you doing?

847
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,800
Mum, you must be out of your mind.

848
00:39:46,959 --> 00:39:48,679
What do you mean by that?

849
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,040
Why did you

850
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,080
suddenly invite her to our house?

851
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,800
How is it sudden?

852
00:39:54,399 --> 00:39:55,639
You rejected all of
your blind date partners

853
00:39:55,879 --> 00:39:57,919
because of her.

854
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,159
Of course I need

855
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:00,159
to see what kind of person she is.

856
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:01,600
It's all because I was deceived by her.

857
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,959
I thought she was a man at first.

858
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,520
So...

859
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:08,679
You did use this trick

860
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,840
to ruin your blind dates.

861
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,800
Hurry and apologise to her.

862
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:14,800
Why should I?

863
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,879
She was the one who deceived me first.

864
00:40:16,479 --> 00:40:17,439
She deceived you

865
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,199
because she wanted to join your company.

866
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,719
Does that justify why she deceived me?

867
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,239
No matter what,

868
00:40:23,399 --> 00:40:25,000
you've insulted her by saying

869
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:26,919
that she tried to please me.

870
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,639
I was the one who invited her
to our house.

871
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:29,719
Go and apologise to her!

872
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,439
Go now.

873
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,040
I...

874
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:31,879
Are you going or not?

875
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,560
I feel giddy.

876
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:37,520
My head is spinning!

877
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:39,320
It's all because of you!

878
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,159
I feel so giddy!

879
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,080
Mum, you should stop pretending.

880
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,639
What are you saying?

881
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:50,239
Mum,

882
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:50,919
are you okay?

883
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:51,639
Don't worry.

884
00:40:51,879 --> 00:40:52,600
I'm sure

885
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:53,600
you'll live a long life.

886
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:55,719
Old Jiang is here?

887
00:40:57,239 --> 00:40:58,000
Now,

888
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:58,879
you can take care of Mum.

889
00:40:58,919 --> 00:41:00,040
I'll find the doctor.

890
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,159
You brat!

891
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:03,800
My dear.

892
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:04,439
Come,

893
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,320
let me take a look.

894
00:41:05,919 --> 00:41:07,159
Do you have a headache?

895
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,800
Do you want to go for a head CT scan?

896
00:41:09,879 --> 00:41:10,479
Okay?

897
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,239
I'm fine.

898
00:41:12,439 --> 00:41:15,199
My dear, just give me a massage.

899
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,360
You'll feel better after that?

900
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:17,399
All right.

901
00:41:17,479 --> 00:41:18,000
Over here.

902
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:18,760
Let me give you a massage.

903
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:21,399
That little brat just now,

904
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,840
did he make you angry again?

905
00:41:22,959 --> 00:41:24,800
I should teach him a lesson.

906
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:26,239
What do you mean by little brat?

907
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,399
Why are you calling him a little brat?

908
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:29,280
What about me?

909
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:31,959
Sorry.

910
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,040
I said the wrong thing just now.

911
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,040
Have an orange.

912
00:41:35,439 --> 00:41:36,159
Have an orange.

913
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:36,719
Come.

914
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:37,239
Mum!

915
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:37,840
Have an orange.

916
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:38,399
Mum!

917
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,040
Mum!

918
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:42,280
Why are you lying on the hospital bed?

919
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:43,560
Don't tell me you're paralysed?

920
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:45,439
Mum!

921
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,479
Get up!

922
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,479
What are you doing?

923
00:41:47,479 --> 00:41:47,800
Old Jiang,

924
00:41:47,919 --> 00:41:48,600
don't stop me!

925
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,879
Let me look at Mum's legs one last time.

926
00:41:51,439 --> 00:41:54,120
Mum!

927
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:56,879
Silly girl!

928
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:57,800
Get up!

929
00:41:57,919 --> 00:41:59,560
You're crushing your mother's legs!

930
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,879
Your mother will be paralysed for real
if you keep doing this.

931
00:42:01,959 --> 00:42:03,000
Do you understand?

932
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,000
I'm sorry.

933
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:05,520
I'm sorry.

934
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:06,239
My dear.

935
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,879
My dear, are your legs okay?

936
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,360
Are your legs okay?

937
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,800
Silly girl,

938
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:12,000
you're not young anymore.

939
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,199
Why do you still speak rashly
without thinking?

940
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,399
Do you want me to take back your car?

941
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:15,520
Do you still want your car?

942
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:16,280
I do.

943
00:42:16,399 --> 00:42:18,479
I was just worried about Mum.

944
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:19,800
Tong,

945
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,760
do you have Lu Li's home address?

946
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,679
Why are you asking for her address?

947
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:25,199
Just answer your mother's question.

948
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,239
Stop asking questions.

949
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,000
Alright, Old Jiang.

950
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:27,800
I promise I'll get her address.

951
00:42:27,919 --> 00:42:28,760
I'll go and get it immediately.

952
00:42:28,959 --> 00:42:29,959
She said she promised
to get her address.

953
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:35,360
What are you doing?

954
00:42:35,479 --> 00:42:36,479
I want to leave the hospital.

955
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:39,639
I'll deal with that, okay?

956
00:42:39,879 --> 00:42:41,919
Hold your orange, take two more of them.

957
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:44,320
Wait for me. I'll be back immediately.

958
00:42:45,879 --> 00:42:46,760
Wait for me.

959
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:55,600
(Actually, losing isn't that scary.)

960
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,360

to have no chance at winning.)
