Good.

23
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:13,919
This one, and this one here.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,199
Why did none of you wake me up?

25
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,320
I'm late.

26
00:02:18,279 --> 00:02:19,759
Why are you staring at me?

27
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,639
Did I become more dashing today?

28
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:24,320
Come.

29
00:02:24,399 --> 00:02:25,039
Mr. Jiang.

30
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:25,919
Please raise your hand.

31
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:27,279
I need to get your measurements.

32
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:28,520
Jiang Zitong.

33
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:29,639
Just so you know,

34
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:30,880
you're also a staff of our company.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,600
If I'm late,

36
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:32,600
you're late too.

37
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:34,800
Then I shall take one day off

38
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:36,559
because I have to get your costume done

39
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:38,320
and I won't have time
to go to the office.

40
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,240
What costume?

41
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,320
Yicheng.

42
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:41,039
Come.

43
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:41,479
Have a look.

44
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:42,320
Wait.

45
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:44,199
Come.

46
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,080
This hotel, this hotel,

47
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,000
and this hotel.

48
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,880
Which one do you like the most?

49
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,679
Tong and I think they are quite good,

50
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,880
o we'll make the booking now

51
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,520
if you're okay with them.

52
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,039
Costume?

53
00:02:56,119 --> 00:02:57,240
Hotel?

54
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,759
Are we having a party or what?

55
00:02:58,839 --> 00:02:59,320
Yes.

56
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,639
A wedding ceremony.

57
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,600
Chen Yiming and you are getting married?

58
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:07,479
Not at the moment.

59
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,080
But in the future, yes.

60
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,679
Mom,

61
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:13,839
isn't your 30th wedding
anniversary with dad

62
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,119
next year?

63
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,800
You dummy.

64
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,880
It's not for our wedding anniversary.

65
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,759
It's

66
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,559
your wedding ceremony.

67
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,320
My wedding ceremony?

68
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,639
Did I hear that correctly?

69
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:25,720
Yes.

70
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,559
Jiang Yicheng.

71
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,440
Congratulations, you're getting married.

72
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:29,600
With whom?

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,279
With Lu Li, of course.

74
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:32,759
Lu Li?

75
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,440
Yes.

76
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,320
Lu Li and I are getting married?

77
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,800
You hugged and got all touchy with her

78
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,279
in front of her

79
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,399
parents.

80
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,639
Now, you have to be responsible for her.

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,479
But I was drunk.

82
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,479
Wait.

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,880
I had fruit wine yesterday.

84
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,119
How did I get drunk off that?

85
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:54,600
Jiang Zitong.

86
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,119
Did you mix it with baijiu to set me up?

87
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,720
It was just a tiny bit of baijiu.

88
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,759
I asked her to do so.

89
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:05,520
Mom!

90
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,720
Why would you set your own son up?

91
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,800
Is it because you want me
to get married?

92
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,160
I like Lu Li.

93
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,119
Then marry her yourself.

94
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,520
Jiang Yicheng.

95
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,959
Where's your manner?

96
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,279
Dad.

97
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:18,799
Great timing.

98
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,519
Come sit.

99
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:19,920
Move.

100
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,399
Off you go.

101
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,079
I...

102
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,480
Have a seat.

103
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,320
I'll go...

104
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:23,959
Disrespectful kid.

105
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,359
To the tailoring company then.

106
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:29,480
Speak.

107
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,079
Please be the voice of reason.

108
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,119
Mom

109
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:34,000
loves Lu Li a lot

110
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,000
and so I have to marry her.

111
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,480
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

112
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,839
Even if we are in a relationship now,

113
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,959
we're not at this stage

114
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,399
where we're ready for marriage.

115
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,839
And we aren't in a relationship!

116
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,920
Ridiculous, you say?

117
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,079
In front of her parents,

118
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,839
you behaved

119
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,880
inappropriately in the room.

120
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:51,760
Have you thought about our face?

121
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,679
And you think you're in the right?

122
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,679
I was...

123
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:54,839
Fine.

124
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,760
I made this mistake.

125
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:56,600
I'll apologize to her.

126
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,160
But

127
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,399
whatever you're doing here,

128
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,559
have you consulted Lu Li beforehand?

129
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:00,480
Even if I'm okay with this arrangement,

130
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:01,480
will she be okay?

131
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,320
I did ask her.

132
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,760
She said yes.

133
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,119
She did.

134
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,239
Lu Li said yes?

135
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,679
I already talked to Lu Li's parents.

136
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,559
Pick a nice day

137
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,119
and get your marriage license.

138
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,920
As for the wedding ceremony,
we'll see it in the future.

139
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:22,920
I...

140
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,040
I will not marry her.

141
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:33,959
Darling,

142
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,519
do you think we took it too fast?

143
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,000
Marriage is a serious matter.

144
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,279
The will to do it
should come from him, not us.

145
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,839
When he's willing to get married,

146
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,880
I'll be too old
to babysit my grandchild.

147
00:05:45,239 --> 00:05:46,640
But if you force him like this,

148
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,679
he...

149
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:50,600
But if we force him like this,

150
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,600
he might hold a grudge against Lu Li

151
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:54,679
and we'll ruin her life.

152
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,600
I know my son very well.

153
00:05:57,799 --> 00:05:59,079
He just refuses to admit it.

154
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,160
Yesterday

155
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,600
when Lu Li came here,

156
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,119
his eyes were glued to her.

157
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:06,279
Have you ever seen him

158
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,760
that interested in a girl before?

159
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,079
He

160
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,559
just hasn't noticed his feelings
towards Li.

161
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:16,399
If I don't give him a nudge,

162
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:19,320
he will never move on from
what happened three years ago.

163
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,200
Darling,

164
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,399
you have to stand by me in this regard.

165
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:26,760
Don't you piss me off like your son did?

166
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,720
Darling,

167
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,640
did you hear what you said?

168
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,359
I never upset you.

169
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,160
In all these years,

170
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:35,000
have I done anything
that pissed you off?

171
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:35,920
Not one thing.

172
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:40,079
We have to work together

173
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,239
so that he agrees to our arrangement
as soon as possible.

174
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,320
As you wish.

175

You're the queen.

176
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,399
I'm your pawn.

177
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,679
I'll go wherever you want me to.

178
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,279

00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,119
I won't go.

185
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:16,519
Did I count it wrongly?

186
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,119
Today is the seventh day.

187
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:20,399
You counted it properly.

188
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,279
I've decided to stay.

189
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:21,839
Wait.

190
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,519
Lu,

191
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,239
did Mr. Jiang take his words back?

192
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,200
Lu Li.

193
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,320
Come with me.

194
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,279
I'll explain later.

195
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,239
Okay.

196
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,519
I...

197
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,279
Something is off.

198
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,559
I haven't had my breakfast.

199
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,040
Should we share this cake?

200
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:47,720
Sure.

201
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:48,760
No!

202
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:51,359
Lock it in the fridge.

203
00:07:52,359 --> 00:07:53,160
You dummy.

204
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,079
Isn't Miss Yezi's

birthday in two days?

206
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:56,799
We can reuse it.

207
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:58,040
You're a cheapskate.

208
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,839
Lock it.

209
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,480
Lock it.

210
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:01,279
Cheapskates.

211
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,359
Cheapskates.

212
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,600
Why?

213
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,320
What?

214
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,200
Why did you say yes to my parents?

215
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,760
Did you agree to this arranged marriage

216
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,279
just because you want to work here?

217
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,239
Don't you think your future
is too high a stake?

218

(Personality Matching Chart)

219
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:27,279
What's this?

220
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:30,160
This is the table I made yesterday.

and our compatibility analysis.

226
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:39,799
Do you like to make
a comparison table that much?

227
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,039
This is not a job interview

228
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:42,359
and I am not your interviewer.

229
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:43,679
Please go through it.

230
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,599
We are only six years apart

231
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:45,479
so age is not a problem.

232
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,479
You're a Leo

233
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,440
and I'm a Virgo.

Earth and Fire, Active and Passive.

235
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,719
We make up for one another.

236
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,960
Both of us majored in computer science

237
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:53,640
and we work in a similar field.

238
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,719
We won't run out of
conversational topics.

239
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:55,919
Conclusion, please.

240
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,599
We are very compatible.

241
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,400
If high compatibility
means we can get married,

242
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,880
why don't you marry Chen Yiming then?

243
00:09:02,239 --> 00:09:02,840
Oh,

244
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:04,880
you came to work here because of him.

245
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:07,280
He's just someone
that I look up to professionally.

246
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:08,280
All in all,

247
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:09,760
you don't want to quit this job

248
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,960
so you came up with this plan.

249
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:11,960
Guess what?

250
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,359
Talk to my mom and tell her

251
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:14,320
you don't want to marry me.

252
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:15,119
I won't fire you.

253
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:15,880
Deal?

254
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,320
Studies have shown that

255
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,200
45% of the divorces are due to

256
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,280
inharmonious mother
and daughter-in-law relationships.

257
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,239
I get along with your mom very well

258
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,200
and it's the main reason why
I want to marry you.

259
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,479
Are you into me?

260
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:30,919
If I say yes,

261
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,039
does that mean you'll marry me?

262
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,679
Of course not.

263
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,520
I have a lot of admirers.

264
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:35,119
I can't possibly marry them all, can I?

265
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,119
So you're really into me?

266
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,080
No.

267
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,880
I just think that

268
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,679
at the moment,

269
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,440
finding someone of your caliber
is challenging.

270
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,440
So...

271
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,359
You don't like me

272
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,599
and yet, you want to marry me.

273
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,159
What kind of logic is that?

274
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,440
Lu Li,

275
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:54,520
I don't care how your logic

276
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,359
interprets the relationship
between love and marriage.

277
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,559
But in my opinion,

278
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,400
you cannot rationalize love,

279
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,440
let alone marriage.

280
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,159
As such, I cannot agree to this
ridiculous arrangement.

281
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,000
Think deep and hard.

282
00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:10,760
Oh.

283
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,640
I was drunk yesterday.

284
00:10:14,119 --> 00:10:14,960
Pardon me.

285
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,000
What a tough nut to crack.

286
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:44,960
Dad.

287
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,880
Why are you here?

288
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,000
Call me Mr. Jiang.

289
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:50,840
Mr. Jiang,

290
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:53,840
do you have something to say
about our company?

291
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,559
I was thinking, I gave you this building

292
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,559
for free.

293
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:01,799
Should I take it back?

294
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,119
I see.

295
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,119
Mom sent you here.

296
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,200
Just give up.

297
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:07,280
I won't compromise.

298
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,559
From what I know,

299
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,479
Enchant Technology achieved
break-even last year.

300
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:14,159
If you want to develop more games,

301
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,559
you need more funds.

302
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,919
If I withdraw

303
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,799
my initial investment...

304
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,840
Then you will suffer
a huge investment deficit.

305
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:25,159
That's no bother.

306
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,359
All I have to do is
to rent the building out

307
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,280
and I'll get my money back
in a few years.

308
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:31,400
This loss is nothing

309
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,640
for me.

310
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,239
Dad.

311
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,039
You just want to watch me suffer?

312
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,320
Better than seeing my wife suffer

313
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,960
because of you.

314
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,559
So you'll just watch me

315
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,000
walk into a doomed marriage like this?

316
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:45,119
We cannot thank our ancestors enough

317
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,479
now that someone as good as Lu Li
wants to marry you.

318
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,640
If you do what you're told

319
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,559
then no bad thing will come to you.

320
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,239
Dad,

321
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:57,719
if mom and I
fall into the river together,

322
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,640
who will you save first?

323
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,599
I made you learn how to swim since young

324
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,159
so that you won't ask me

325
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,159
this stupid question when you grow up.

326
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,479
Seems like those swimming lessons
are for nothing.

327
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,440
Am I your biological son?

328
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:10,320
Why would I care

329
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,960
if you were not?

330
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,000
So if I don't marry her,

331
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:18,280
you'll withdraw your investment.

332
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:20,440
As stipulated in the contract,

333
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:24,280
I am free to withdraw whenever.

334
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,280
If you do that,

335
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:27,400
my company will go bankrupt.

336
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,559
Dad,

337
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,000
do 28 years of filial relationship

338
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,679
not mean anything to you?

339
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:34,960
Well, your mom and I share a
30-year marital relationship.

340
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:37,239
Negotiation possible?

341
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,520
Of course.

342
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,599
Now,

343
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:43,880
you have one choice.

344
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,520
Just remember that

345
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,239
once you've made a decision,

346
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,280
you have to be responsible for it.

347
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,280
Understood?

348
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,320
Mull it

349
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,320
over.

350
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Do you want to come with me?

351
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,119
To where?

352
00:13:37,239 --> 00:13:39,000
Why did you bring me here?

353
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,000
I remember you're acrophobic.

354
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:43,679
Didn't you say you wanted to marry me?

355
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,599
I shall see how sincere you are.

356
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,239
Are you trying to...

357
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,239
Jump from here.

358
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,960
This is a diving stadium.

359
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:25,000
You'll be fine.

360
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,520
Also, you know how to swim.

361
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:28,080
Unless

362
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,640
you want to call it quits?

363
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,599
So diving

364
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,799
will be able to prove
my sincerity to you?

365
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:36,559
Perhaps.

366
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,760
But you can

367
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,200
quit too.

368
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:32,640
It's okay

369
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,440
to give up.

370
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,359
Let's leave.

371
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,760
Can you feel my sincerity now?

372
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:28,440
You won.

373
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,080
Let's get married.

374
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:48,159
Why did you agree to marry me
out of a sudden?

375
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,760
The same reasons you gave me.

376
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:52,239
Okay.

377
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,719
But we need to agree to
several conditions

378
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,039
before we get married.

379
00:16:57,119 --> 00:16:57,960
Go ahead.

380
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,919
Firstly, after one year of marital life,

381
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:02,880
if one party wishes for a divorce,

382
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,040
the other party has to agree
without any objection.

383
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,239
Can do.

384
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,800
I don't get you at all.

385
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,280
Secondly,

386
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,719
we have to hide our relationship,

387
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,560
especially in the office.

388
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,640
Do not let anyone know.

389
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,599
And?

390
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,319
You agreed to that too?

391
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,439
Thirdly, do not meddle
in each other's private life

392
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,760
and we have to sign a prenup.

393
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,599
Our parents cannot know the content

394
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,479
of this prenup.

395
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:36,959
No problem.

396
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,719
I'll say yes to everything.

397
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,000
To make sure it's fair,

398
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:42,479
tell me what you want too.

399
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,920
I want to keep my job.

400
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,160
That's all?

401
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,520
That's all.

402
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:51,959
Nothing else?

403
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,119
Pinky promise.

404
00:17:57,439 --> 00:17:58,359
Pinky promise?

405
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,719
That's how you do it.

406
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,319
Childish.

407
00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:03,199

501
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:06,199
I forgot to tell you.

502
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,479
I actually didn't have
the time to tell you.

503
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,920
I'm staying.

504
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,520
Okay.

505
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,079
I'll explain tomorrow.

506
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,280
Thanks, Mr. Chen.

507
00:24:17,719 --> 00:24:19,400
So even if you leave Enchant,

508
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:21,439
you will have another job ready
due to Chen Yiming.

509
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:23,160
Idolizing him is so worth it.

510
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,839
Mr. Chen saw that I was suddenly fired

511
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,520
and he worried that I might be jobless

512
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,359
so he wanted to introduce me
to some other companies.

513
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:33,239
You're saying it's my fault then?

514
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,800
I'm saying Mr. Chen is a kind man.

515
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:38,119
Why didn't you ask him
to help you move as well?

516
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,599
By the way,

517
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:44,079
first thing first,

518
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:46,199
you can only take the guest room.

519
00:24:46,239 --> 00:24:47,400
Don't touch my belongings.

520
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,160
Petty.

521
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:05,479
Li, how dare you

522
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,880
get married without telling anyone?

523
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:09,760
I told you last night.

524
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,319
Who knew you were serious?

525
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:12,760
I was on my bed

526
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:13,599
and was all drowsy

527
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,920
so I thought it was just a dream.

528
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:18,479
You would really abandon me here?

529
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:22,319
Should I move out tomorrow then?

530
00:25:23,199 --> 00:25:24,000
It's fine.

531
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:25,560
You finally got what you wanted.

532
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:27,239
I shouldn't hold you back.

533
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,000
Did you really think it through?

534
00:25:30,199 --> 00:25:31,040
No regret?

535
00:25:33,239 --> 00:25:33,959
Wait.

536
00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:40,479
Congratulations, Li,

537
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:42,880
for becoming a married woman.

538
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:45,959
Sorry.

539
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:47,599
I'll clean it up for you.

540
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:58,359
Xiaoqi, now that you live alone,

541
00:25:58,479 --> 00:26:00,280
don't eat that much junk food.

542
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,160
When you sleep at night,

543
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,839
lock the door.

544
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:05,239
And feed Momo

545
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:06,880
regularly.

546
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,079
Okay?

547
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,800
Jiang Yicheng is now my sworn enemy
for taking you away from me.

548
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:16,479
He's not into me yet

549
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:18,199
so he's not your sworn enemy per se.

550
00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:19,760
However, I believe that

551
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,400
once I find the right code,

552
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,560
I will solve him like how I solve

553
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,640
a programming puzzle.

554
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,439
Li, you are the proactive one
in this relationship,

555
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,880
but just remember that

556
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,640
a woman sometimes can't be too eager.

557
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,719
Even if you're very into him,

558
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:37,280
you can only show 50% of it.

559
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:38,400
Got it?

560
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,280
Don't worry.

561
00:26:40,439 --> 00:26:41,800
I have a very rational mind.

562
00:26:42,439 --> 00:26:44,719
A rational mind is the scariest thing
when it goes haywire.

563
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,359
Okay.

564
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:45,800
Fine.

565
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:46,640
I won't nag you.

566
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:47,640
Let me help you pack up.

567
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:48,839
I'll see you off later.

568
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,839
She's not a tigress.

569
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:08,959
Why should I be scared of her?

570
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,479
Isn't she like a roommate?

571
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,560
What's so scary about that?

572
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,560
Has she not moved in yet?

573
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:09,439
You're back.

574
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,959
Why did you dress up

575
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,880
like an elementary school student?

576
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,199
I bought this when I was in high school.

577
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,199
The quality is still good

578
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,640
so I keep it.

579
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,359
You're done moving in?

580
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,319
Why didn't you switch on the light
in the living room then?

581
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,560
You said that

582
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,880
I shouldn't touch anything
in your house.

583
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:31,839
If you're this obedient,

584
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,359
why didn't you quit the job?

585
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:42,280
Well, rest early.

586
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,199
What are you doing?

587
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:34,040
Did I wake you up?

588
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:35,199
Do you even know what time it is?

589
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,319
I'm sorry.

590
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:39,199
I was busy unpacking

591
00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:40,599
so I didn't eat.

592
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,479
Can't you be quieter then?

593
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,880
All right.

594
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,280
Pass me

595
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,920
that thing.

596
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:57,920
I cooked for two.

597
00:29:58,079 --> 00:29:59,119
Do you want some?

598
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,359
I don't eat junk food like this.

599
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,119
Also,

600
00:30:02,439 --> 00:30:03,400
I'm not hungry.

601
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,760
So, do you want some?

602
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,880
Wasting food is a sin.

603
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,359
If you can't finish it,

604
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,560
then I'll help you.

605
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:48,520
Do you

606
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:51,560
like sauteed prawns a lot?

607
00:30:52,479 --> 00:30:53,359
How do you know?

608
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:57,400
I noticed that when I saw you
eating last time.

609
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,439
I should have bought some prawns.

610
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,800
Do you plan to cook some more
this late at night?

611
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,359
It's our first meal as a married couple.

612
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,479
I want to have something delicious
to commemorate it.

613
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,719
I...

614
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:17,079
I'm sleepy.

615
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,560
Enjoy the food.

616
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:19,959
Finish them all, okay?

617
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:21,160
Sleep early too.

618
00:31:29,199 --> 00:31:29,959
Okay.

619
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,640
(It's our first meal
as a married couple.)

620
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:44,800
(I want to have something delicious
to commemorate it.)

621
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,680
(Wasting food is a sin.)

622
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:50,160
(If you can't finish it,)

623
00:31:50,439 --> 00:31:51,439
(then I'll help you.)

624
00:31:58,239 --> 00:31:59,160
Sweet dreams.

625
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,719
Morning.

626
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:23,760
Morning.

627
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,540
(Prenup. Male Party: Jiang Yicheng.
Female Party: Lu Li)

628
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:52,800
Prenup...?

629
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,239
This is the prenup

630
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:57,079
that both of us agreed on.

631
00:32:57,319 --> 00:32:58,160
I appended

632
00:32:58,239 --> 00:33:00,119
several house rules.

633
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,927
(About morale.
About safety. House Rules)

634
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:03,920
Do not make loud noises at home.

635
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,199
Complete silence after 11 PM.

636
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,599
No pet animal that pecks.

637
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,199
No food with a strong odor.

638
00:33:11,439 --> 00:33:12,400
In case of conflicts,

639
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,239
no throwing stuff,

640
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:13,839
no hitting,

641
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,400
no knocking on windows,

642
00:33:14,479 --> 00:33:15,119
no

643
00:33:16,239 --> 00:33:17,319
shouting like this.

644
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:19,959
I will pay for every expenditure

645
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:20,839
for this house,

646
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:21,760
but to assure fairness,

647
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:23,400
you are in charge of every chore.

648
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,680
No provocative outfit in communal areas

649
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,400
such as living room, kitchen,
and toilet.

650
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,239
The bedroom is your private territory

651
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:31,520
and this territory

652
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,800
is sacred and untouchable.

653
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,800
If you

654
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,160
violate the rule,
you have to be punished.

655
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:39,439
What kind of punishment?

656
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,000
I haven't thought

657
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,439
about it yet.

658
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,680
We'll deal with it
once you break a rule.

659
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,040
Also, one more rule.

660
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,640
Close the door
when you use the bathroom.

661
00:33:52,439 --> 00:33:54,920
Can I ask for something?

662
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:56,079
Speak.

663
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,359
Since you'll pay for everything,

664
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,920
can I be the one cooking?

665
00:34:03,239 --> 00:34:04,880
And can we eat together?

666
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:05,719
No.

667
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:08,000
My mom said you couldn't cook at all.

668
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,719
My tummy shouldn't suffer, should it?

669
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,040
If you are okay with it,

670
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,280
sign

671
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,520
here.

672
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:35,460
(Female Party's Signature: Lu Li)

673
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,719
Done.

674
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,320
Cheers.

675
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,439
This agreement only has one copy.

676
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,800
Put it in my room.

677
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:06,840
Why?

678
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,959
You're regretting it now?

679
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,080
Didn't you say the bedroom
was sacred and untouchable?

680
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,439
Do it yourself.

681
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,360
You...

682
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:19,800
It was just a test.

683
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,520
Well done. Keep it up.

684
00:35:34,479 --> 00:35:36,000
Day 1 of being Mrs. Jiang

685
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,439
begins now.

686
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:44,360
You can get out now.

687
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,520
The office is over there.

688
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:46,239
Also,

689
00:35:46,399 --> 00:35:47,959
try not to speak to me in the office.

690
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,080
Lu Li, you're finally here.

691
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:13,800
You took a day off yesterday

692
00:36:13,879 --> 00:36:15,760
so I thought you were erased
by Mr. Jiang.

693
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,639
I was almost erased

694
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,080
but thank god I asked for data recovery.

695
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,679
I had private business yesterday.

696
00:36:25,439 --> 00:36:26,239
I'm glad you're back.

697
00:36:26,879 --> 00:36:27,560
You know what?

698
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:28,800
Let's have a get-together tonight

699
00:36:28,959 --> 00:36:31,560
to celebrate Lu Li's return.

700
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:31,959
Sure.

701
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,120
Let's have a normal hot pot
or crab hot pot.

702
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:36,199
There's a new restaurant by south street

703
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,000
and it's famous.

704
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,120
Let's have something light.
Something stir-friend.

705
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:39,679
No...

706
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,760
Whatever you like.

707
00:36:40,879 --> 00:36:41,399
It's my treat.

708
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,320
Okay.

709
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:44,000
It's my treat. I insist.

710
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:44,439
I...

711
00:36:44,439 --> 00:36:44,719
Lu Li.

712
00:36:45,879 --> 00:36:46,479
Come to my office.

713
00:36:46,879 --> 00:36:47,479
Okay.

714
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,080
Buy the food then.

715
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:50,639
Go, go.

716
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,520
Go buy some food.

717
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,639
Who?

718
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:53,879
She buys, you pay.

719
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,080
She'll pick then.

720
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,800
Great timing. Have some coffee.

721
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,199
Thank you.

722
00:37:09,919 --> 00:37:11,000
I haven't had this for a few days.

723
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:12,800
I've missed this.

724
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,040
How did you manage to change
Yicheng's mind?

725
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:21,879
My mom and Mr. Jiang's mom
are high school friends.

726
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,639
What a coincidence.

727
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,959
I only learned of it recently too.

728
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:29,239
It's like you were coding
and halfway through,

729
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,159
you realized that you wrote a backdoor.

730
00:37:33,399 --> 00:37:35,760
Whatever the reason is,
I'm glad you can stay.

731
00:37:38,479 --> 00:37:41,959
Thank you for looking after me
all this time, Mr. Chen.

732
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,239
I hope you can attend
the gathering tonight.

733
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:46,320
Sure.

734
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,479
But if you really want to thank me,

735
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:50,800
cook me something.

736
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,719
But I can't cook.

737
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:57,000
I can prepare breakfast for you.

738
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:58,399
It's easier.

739
00:37:58,879 --> 00:37:59,560
Sure.

740
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,520
I can't wait.

741
00:38:08,879 --> 00:38:10,000
Oh no.

742
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,159
Linux and Java are abandoning me.

743
00:38:14,879 --> 00:38:15,520
Old Ape.

744
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:17,360
You even named your hair.

745
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,560
Can you tell me

746
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:19,959
their gender?

747
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,360
The long one is a boy.

748
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,479
The short one is a girl.

749
00:38:22,879 --> 00:38:23,879
Heed my advice.

750
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,719
Appreciate your hair.

751
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:28,120
I start losing hair
when I'm 30-something.

752
00:38:28,399 --> 00:38:30,399
For all you know, it might creep on you

753
00:38:30,479 --> 00:38:32,120
and slowly, you become bald.

754
00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:34,040
I can't even fix all the bugs.

755
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,959
I don't have time
to care about hair loss.

756
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:37,840
Old Ape, don't worry about me.

757
00:38:37,919 --> 00:38:39,520
My bloodline
does not have a baldness history.

758
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:42,679
Knowledge workers indeed tend to
lose hair when compared

759
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,679
to other workers.

760
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,439
See?

761
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,760
Lu, geniuses are all bald, are they not?

762
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:50,879
Old Ape,

763
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,159
can you send me the link
to that densifying shampoo?

764
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,360
Me too.

765
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,760
Are you guys not hungry?

766
00:38:56,879 --> 00:38:57,760
Come, let's eat.

767
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,959
This bug took a heavy toll on my body.

768
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:01,520
I need to replenish my energy.

769
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,040
Let's go, Lu.

770
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:02,560
Let's go.

771
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:04,399
I have to take a rain check.

772
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,040
Do you want me
to pack something for you, Lu Li?

773
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:07,399
It's okay. I ordered some food already.

774
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:08,520
All right. Let's go.

775
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:09,320
Let's go.

776
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,320
Bye.

777
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,280
Linux and Java left me just like that.

778
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:14,639
You have the entire population
on your head.

779
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,120
Impressive.

780
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:24,320
Mr. Jiang.

781
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:26,520
Should we grab lunch together?

782
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,760
Didn't I tell you

783
00:39:34,879 --> 00:39:35,879
to keep a distance from me?

784
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:37,000
What if someone sees us?

785
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,560
If someone sees us,

786
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,959
we'll say that I'm here
to report to you.

787
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,520
You're right.

788
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,360
No normal being will think that

789
00:39:46,479 --> 00:39:47,879
we're married.

790
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,919
Weird.

791
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:53,000
Just like bugs, some things

792
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:55,000
will just happen.

793
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,199
No, thanks.

794
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,199
It's the most famous food delivery here.

795
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,239
Your tummy won't suffer.

796
00:40:01,439 --> 00:40:02,159
I don't want to eat.

797
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,159
We'll play a game of
rock, paper, scissors.

798
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,399
If I win, you have to eat with me
from now on.

799
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,199
If you lose, will you get off my back?

800
00:40:11,399 --> 00:40:13,159
I swear on the honor
of the programmer F4.

801
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,320
Come.

802
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,879
Rock, paper, scissors.

803
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,120
(Does she really want
to eat with me that badly?)

804
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,959
I won!

805
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,479
You won.

806
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:37,199
Come, eat some.

807
00:40:42,919 --> 00:40:44,639
You might need to put up with
what I ordered today.

808
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,399
If you want to eat something tomorrow,
let me know beforehand.

809
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,760
Or just let me know
if you need anything.

810
00:40:50,479 --> 00:40:52,600
You make it sound like you
can solve anything.

811
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,159
This is like coding.

812
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:00,280
As long as the requirement is clear,
the technology is there,

813
00:41:00,399 --> 00:41:01,520
and the server can manage it,

814
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:03,199
then nothing is impossible.

815
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:05,639
Okay, I want to watch fireworks.

816
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:08,080
It's illegal to light fireworks
in the city.

817
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:10,239
See?

818
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,479
Don't bite more than you can chew.

819
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:39,280
Hurry up, Lu Li.

820
00:41:39,479 --> 00:41:40,879
Old Ape is waiting for you in his car.

821
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,159
You guys go ahead.

822
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,040
She can come in my car.

823
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,040
Sure.

824
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,159
Hold on, I'll be done in a jiffy.

825
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:54,040
Take your time.

826
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,540
(Add to output, zip)

827
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,380
(Compressing)

828
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,740
(Your wish)

829
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:07,700
(Send to: Jiang Yicheng.
Subject: Your Wish)

830
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,439
Done.

831
00:42:26,439 --> 00:42:28,399
Slacking off during office hours

832
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,399
just to make something silly like this.

833
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:35,399
Fine.

834
00:42:36,399 --> 00:42:37,360
I lost the game anyway.

835
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,120
I'll have

836
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,199
lunch with you.

837
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,560
(Just like bugs, some things)

838
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,479
(will just happen.)

839
00:42:49,959 --> 00:42:52,919
(However, if you look closely,
you'll realize that)

840
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:55,239
(90% of them)

841
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:58,560

to a well-intended meaning.)
