21
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,400
Mr. Jiang.

22
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,160
I've run a background check
on Li Man's father.

23
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:03,080
He doesn't have a fixed income

24
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,160
and is a gambling addict.

25
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,360
He is waist-deep in debts.

26
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,000
Three years ago, the secretary
of Chendong's President Xu Yuanzhi,

27
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,320
wired him a large sum of money.

28
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:10,679
It took place exactly after Chendong

29
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,119
stole our source code.

30
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:13,639
Okay. Got it.

31
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:18,759
Did

32
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,119
something happen?

33
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,000
An emergency.

34
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:23,199
Let me send you back now.

35
00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:23,919
It's okay.

36
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,720
I can take a cab.

37
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:27,800
Go do your thing.

38
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,119
Come back early once you're done.

39
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,160
Let's go.

40
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,960
Let's go.

41
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,600
Who's there?

42
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,440
Weren't you

43
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,679
the person with Li Man last time?

44
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,639
She's not here.

45
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,600
Why are you here?

46
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,320
Just last one time?

47
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:10,119
Our history went way back than that.

48
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,919
But I don't know you.

49
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:14,919
Shoo shoo.

50
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,039
Calm down.

51
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,679
Unless you're worried that
I know your secret

52
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,279
and I'm here to settle the score.

53
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,360
What secret?

54
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,039
I don't know what you're talking about.

55
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,240
This footage here is enough

56
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,399
(Chendong)
to land you three years in jail.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,080
It's no use to threaten me.

58
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,479
That footage can't prove anything.

59
00:03:58,559 --> 00:03:59,880
I didn't come here

60
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:01,559
just to show you this.

61
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:04,759
Why are you here?

62
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,000
Tell me

63
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,559
what happened three years ago?

64
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:17,320
If I tell you, will you let me live?

65
00:04:17,679 --> 00:04:18,799
If you don't tell me,

66
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:20,920
I'll see you in jail.

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,640
Okay.

68
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,839
I sold the source code of the game.

69
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,079
You and your daughter,

70
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:32,640
one stole the code,

71
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,799
and the other found the buyer.

72
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:36,640
No.

73
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:39,079
This has nothing to do with Man.

74
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,959
I heard

75
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,640
that Chendong called her to persuade her

76
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,200
to sell them your source code

77
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,239
but she refused to do so.

78
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,839
It was me who
took the source code and sold it.

79
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,040
Are you saying

80
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,279
Li Man wasn't aware of this?

81
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,480
Of course not.

82
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,279
She was falling head over heels
in love with you

83
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:08,640
that she didn't even have time
for her own dad.

84
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,320
I was at my wits' end due to
the debt collectors so I...

85
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:18,279
Considering the shared history
you had with my daughter,

86
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,959
can you let me go?

87
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,040
What's wrong?

88
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,640
Mr. Jiang.

89
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,640
I beg of you.

90
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,320
Please let us go.

91
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,040
He's here.

92
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:33,760
Hello.

93
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,000
Your package is here.

94
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
Thank you.

95
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,519
Dad, your package.

96
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,880
I...

97
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,000
I thought it was Jiang.

98
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:53,679
It's past 6 PM already.

99
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,839
Was he still at work?

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,320
Give him a call.

101
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:57,959
Mom,

102
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,839
why not we eat first?

103
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,279
He might be busy.

104
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,480
Let's be patient.

105
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:06,160
This is our first dinner
with our son-in-law.

106
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:08,160
It's not right to start

107
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,679
without him.

108
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:11,239
Is he in the right then?

109
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:13,720
He never visited once after

110
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:15,000
getting married.

111
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,200
And finally, we agreed on a date

112
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,320
but he's nowhere to be seen.

113
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,279
Does he think
he's the only one who's busy?

114
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:21,679
Mom.

115
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,279
Let's have some snacks
to fill your tummy.

116
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,799
Jiang Yicheng bought them for you.

117
00:07:27,799 --> 00:07:28,279
Sure.

118
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,119
Wonderful idea.

119
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,559
Come.

120
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,679
Let's try his gifts.

121
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,279
Come.

122
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:41,119
Crunchy rice, your favorite.

123
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,839
Come, have some.

124
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:49,559
It's quite crunchy.

125
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,239
You know,

126
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,679
a young man like him should be busy.

127
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:58,200
It's much better than those
who loiter around

128
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,880
and do nothing.

129
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:00,679
Don't you agree?

130
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,679
Exactly.

131
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,119
I love Jiang Yicheng

132
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:04,040
because I like

133
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:06,760
how he insists on
pursuing a career path he likes.

134
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,799
He doesn't forget his root.

135
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,239
So all work

136
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,399
and no life then?

137
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,000
If he can

138
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,200
forget about you during your birthday,

139
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:18,480
then I dare not imagine
how he treats you every day.

140
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:19,880
It's not like that.

141
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,519
Your mom is right.

142
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,399
Supporting your husband's ambition
is one thing.

143
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,839
But if Jiang mistreats you,

144
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,320
you have to tell us.

145
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,239
Got it?

146
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,520
Dad,

147
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,080
he's very nice to me.

148
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,799
When we were in Ancient Town yesterday,

149
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,520
we celebrated my birthday together.

150
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,359
He even prepared a surprise
for me before midnight.

151
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:42,039
See?

152
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,440
I told you.

153
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,679
Jiang is a lovely husband.

154
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,320
Tell us

155
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,799
what happened last night.

156
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,039
Check this out.

157
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,200
He made me this fruit cake

158
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,520
and we lit the sparklers together.

159
00:08:58,679 --> 00:08:59,440
Also this one.

160
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,479
He made me this too.

161
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:02,960
And that cake over there.

162
00:09:03,479 --> 00:09:05,119
We baked it together.

163
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,799
Let me see.

164
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,679
Beautiful.

165
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:11,320
Indeed.

166
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,840
This is a good angle.

167
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:16,559
So pretty.

168
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,400
This one is cute.

169
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:23,960
Two lion cubs.

170
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,000
I came here to give him money.

171
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,559
Yicheng.

172
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,200
Why did you look for him?

173
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,159
To ask him about what happened
three years ago.

174
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,799
So you know.

175
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:47,919
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

176
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:50,520
Do you think taking the blame alone

177
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,880
and moving to another country
can solve the problem?

178
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,320
My father committed a crime

179
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,080
and as a result, you and your company
suffered a great loss.

180
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,479
I cannot stay out of it.

181
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,000
But the code was the fruit
of everyone's effort in the company.

182
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,520
Do I not deserve

183
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,320
an explanation?

184
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,760
I wanted to tell you

185
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,880
but

186
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,200
I couldn't.

187
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,039
Couldn't you?

188
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,119
You shut down your phone.

189
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:24,359
No one was at home.

190
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,679
I asked everyone you knew

191
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,559
but I still couldn't find you.

192
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,400
To look for you,

193
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:34,479
I got into an accident
and was hospitalized for a month.

194
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,840
But you,

195
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:39,239
did you even reach out to me once?

196
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,280
Because I was arrested.

197
00:10:46,239 --> 00:10:47,400
I wanted to reach out

198
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,239
but I couldn't.

199
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:51,239
Wait!

200
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,239
Give me that hard disk.

201
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:54,200
Let go!

202
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:56,719
We toiled for a year to make this.

203
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,479
You cannot sell it to someone else.

204
00:10:58,599 --> 00:11:00,400
I didn't raise you

205
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,280
so that you can be a hindrance
to my money-making scheme.

206
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,039
How much money did you owe?

207
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,119
I'll pay them off.

208
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:06,840
But you can't sell the code.

209
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:08,559
You'll ruin Jiang Yicheng.

210
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,840
Jiang Yicheng?

211
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:12,159
Someone offered me 500,000 Chinese yuan!

212
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,719
Back off!

213
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,840
If you sell the code,

214
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,080
I'll end my life here!

215
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:23,719
Will you sacrifice

216
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,000
your dignity for a man?

217
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,719
Let's die together!

218
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,679
Call the police now!

219
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:38,520
She wants to kill me.

220
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,880
Call the police!

221
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,520
(Xinhai Detention House)

222
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,400
You're here.

223
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,320
Come.

224
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,280
I'll treat you to a nice meal.

225
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,039
Did you sell the code?

226
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,320
Why would I turn down
such a delicious offer?

227
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:58,239
Is money everything for you?

228
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,359
For the money,

229
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,679
you accused your own daughter
of physical assault.

230
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,640
I was in prison for 15 days.

231
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,640
If I don't do that,

232
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,760
I can't get the money!

233
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,919
Didn't you say
you wanted to study abroad?

234
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:13,520
We have the money now.

235
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,880
You're looking for that Jiang kid again?

236
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:19,119
I owe him an explanation.

237
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:20,799
If he wants to
take legal action against you,

238
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,119
I won't stop him.

239
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,280
He's hospitalized.

240
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,719
He got into an accident
when he was looking for you.

241
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,080
Poor son.

242
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,719
You thought you found a soulmate

243
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:40,119
but she's just a conniving wench.

244
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,000
Guess I was blinded by love.

245
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:45,880
Truth be told,

246
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,599
it's good that she's gone.

247
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:48,880
Think about it.

248
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:51,840
The atrocity she committed

249
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,640
must be due to her abysmal upbringing.

250
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,359
I saw how much you liked her

251
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,080
so I didn't want to comment
on her background.

252
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:00,400
But in my opinion,

253
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:01,919
you deserve better.

254
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,479
Once you're discharged,

255
00:13:03,719 --> 00:13:04,679
I'll find you some...

256
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,440
Mom.

257
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,880
I just want to
get my company back on track.

258
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:09,159
Don't add more to the plate, can you?

259
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,799
Just so you know,

260
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,960
even if she reappears

261
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,880
one day,

262
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,799
do not forgive her.

263
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,080
I will not accept a girl

264
00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:22,799
with that kind of upbringing.

265
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:25,359
She doesn't have what it takes
to be my daughter-in-law.

266
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,200
Back then, perhaps my pride got hurt
upon hearing

267
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,559
what your mom said

268
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:39,880
or perhaps

269
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:42,679
I just didn't know how to face you,

270
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,000
so I decided to run away.

271
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,200
During these three years,

272
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,200
I worked hard

273
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:51,599
so that I could become a better person.

274
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,799
I thought I could move on

275
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:57,200
but then I realized that

276
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,599
I can't get you out of my mind.

277
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,840
My hatred towards you was what

278
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:07,159
fueled me to brave through
the company's darkest year.

279
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,640
I didn't know that...

280
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:11,280
It's only normal that you resent me.

281
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,159
A child has to pay off
his parents' debt.

282
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,640
I bear responsibility

283
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,760
for what my dad did.

284
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:24,400
Your dad is your dad.

285
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:25,359
You are you.

286
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,159
If I knew the truth,

287
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,679
while I might not be able to stay calm

288
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,039
but I would still know right from wrong.

289
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,719
You could have taken legal action.

290
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:42,400
So why didn't you?

291
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,919
My company was on the verge
of bankruptcy.

292
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,280
I didn't have time
to think about lawsuits.

293
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:49,239
Also,

294
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,559
I didn't have solid evidence
to prove that

295
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,400
you stole our source code.

296
00:14:55,599 --> 00:14:57,119
Even if I take it to court,

297
00:14:57,719 --> 00:14:58,760
I won't be able to win it.

298
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,080
It will just be a waste of time.

299
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,440
What about now?

300
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,880
Will you sue my father?

301
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,239
What's the point?

302
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,239
Chendong used that source code

303
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,719
to develop games and went public.

304
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,640
If I sue,

305
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,080
it is Chendong which should pay me back
what they owe me.

306
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,719
You've been laying low for three years

307
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,840
so I thought you had given up.

308
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,840
Moving on doesn't mean giving up.

309
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,599
I see.

310
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,840
Whether it's a relationship or a career,

311
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,719
you've moved on.

312
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,080
I am the one who refuses to let go.

313
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:48,599
If nothing had happened back then,

314
00:15:49,479 --> 00:15:52,799
would we be happily married now?

315
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:57,080
What happened has happened.

316
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,679
There's no rewind button.

317
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:00,400
Your hypothesis doesn't hold.

318
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,559
You're back.

319
00:16:44,479 --> 00:16:45,799
Why didn't you sleep in your room?

320
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,599
I was waiting for you.

321
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:53,359
Sorry.

322
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,159
Today was a busy day

323
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,359
and I couldn't meet your parents.

324
00:16:57,479 --> 00:16:59,559
When you picked up that phone today,

325
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,960
you sounded serious.

326
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:02,559
What happened?

327
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,479
Nothing.

328
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,520
Rest early.

329
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,079
To present a seamless,

330
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,000
open world in Xuan Zhong Ji

331
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:39,199
so that our players can have
an immersive gaming experience,

332
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:41,000
we have opted for a high quality

333
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:42,680
cartoon art style to render the images.

334
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,359
It adheres to the highest standard of PBR.

335
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,439
In terms of scene, pet and class design,
we also integrated many

336
00:17:48,479 --> 00:17:50,959
cultural elements inspired by
Shan Hai Jing.

337
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,439
We want the players

338
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,640
to experience an authentic
mystical world.

339
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,040
In addition,
the Planning Department has also

340
00:17:58,053 --> 00:17:59,359
(Product Introduction)
come up with more content.

341
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,839
Not only can players

342
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:02,839
capture various legendary creatures
in the game,

343
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,239
they can also build their own home

344
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,520
and raise those creatures.

345
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,520
They can even meet their friends online

346
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:10,920
through the AR function
to raise pets together.

347
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,920
Hi, is this Mr. Jiang Yicheng?

348
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:18,959
Your friend, Li Man,
is now hospitalized.

349
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,119
Can you come here now?

350
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,439
Okay.

351
00:18:24,719 --> 00:18:25,760
My friend is in the hospital.

352
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,520
I have to go now.

353
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,839
You guys carry on.

354
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,199
Da Huang.

355
00:18:36,439 --> 00:18:38,040
This is the first time Mr. Jiang

356
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:39,280
left a meeting halfway.

357
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,079
What's happening?

358
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:40,920
No idea.

359
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:42,760
Sounds like a female friend.

360
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:44,199
But other than Lu Li,

361
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:46,040
who else can make him look this worried?

362
00:18:46,439 --> 00:18:47,040
Is it possible that...

363
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:47,839
Enough.

364
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:48,640
The meeting has ended.

365
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:49,839
You should work.

366
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,560
Yes.

367
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,040
Work. Work.

368
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:52,800
Let's work.

369
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:53,760
What are you staring at?

370
00:19:10,239 --> 00:19:12,280
Tong, are you home?

371
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:13,800
Yes.

372
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:15,800
I'm in the middle of my beauty nap.

373
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,439
What's up?

374
00:19:17,719 --> 00:19:18,959
How's my mother-in-law?

375
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:19,839
Is she okay?

376
00:19:20,479 --> 00:19:21,319
It couldn't be better.

377
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:23,359
She nags me all the time.

378
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:25,199
I'm glad.

379
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,199
Continue your sleep.

380
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:31,319
(Not my mother-in-law.)

381
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,560
(Not Zitong either.)

382
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,239
(Someone that he cares a lot about...)

383
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,719
(Could it be Li Man?)

384
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:45,160
(Honey, I'm downstairs.)

385
00:20:02,719 --> 00:20:03,400
Li.

386
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:05,199
For you.

387
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,560
Not bad.

388
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,959
You still remember to give me good food.

389
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,319
Tell me.

390
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,719
Is there any huge progress
between you and Jiang Yicheng?

391
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,880
Ever since we came back from Ancient Town,

392
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:17,920
he's been acting weird.

393
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:19,520
He would just disappear suddenly.

394
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,760
Did his ex come back?

395
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm not sure.

396
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,400
EG sent another person in
as our liaison.

397
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:29,280
I don't know if both of them

398
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:30,640
share other kinds of relationships.

399
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,199
How can you not know
what your love rival is up to!

400
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:36,239
Check his phone then.

401
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,719
Look at his WeChat history

402
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,920
and purchase history.

403
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,880
See if he went to a hotel

404
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:41,680
and bought some feminine products.

405
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:43,760
I...

406
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,199
What if I see something

407
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,000
I'm not supposed to?

408
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:48,199
What should I do then?

409
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,599
Didn't they say that
you'll only upset yourself

410
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,959
if you peek at your lover's phone?

411
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,880
Jiang Yicheng and I

412
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,319
are finally back on good terms.

413
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,000
I don't want him to resent me again.

414
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,680
So we stay put,

415
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,359
observe,

416
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,439
and deal with it as we proceed.

417
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:04,680
All right.

418
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,599
Stop sulking.

419
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,000
Come, let's grab something to eat.

420
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,000
No, thanks.

421
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:09,160
I'm not hungry.

422
00:21:09,479 --> 00:21:10,400
Really?

423
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:11,880
Fine then.

424
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:12,599
I'll just leave then.

425
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,280
Bye.

426
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:20,079
Stay there!

427
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,560
Face me!

428
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:24,560
Are

429
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,800
you here for Lu Li?

430
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,880
I'll ask her to come down now.

431
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,599
Come back here.

432
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,359
Did I do anything wrong?

433
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,800
No.

434
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:34,920
Have you had a girlfriend already?

435
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:36,199
No.

436
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,400
Then why are you ghosting me?

437
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,479
You only give me short replies
on WeChat.

438
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,439
So insincere.

439
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:40,959
I'm busy.

440
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,359
I don't have the time.

441
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,800
People like you always use
"busy" as an excuse.

442
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,719
I should have seen through your tricks.

443
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:49,920
You flirt and scoot.

444
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:50,920
Playboy.

445
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:51,839
No, no.

446
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,680
It's just a misunderstanding, Xiaoqi.

447
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,800
I just haven't thought about

448
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,119
how I should be with you.

449
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,119
So am I just your backup plan?

450
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,439
If you need me, you contact me.

451
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,040
If you don't, you ghost me.

452
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,640
I won't let people take advantage
of me like that!

453
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,439
Director Gu stopped me
from contacting you.

454
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,479
Gu Mo?

455
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:10,920
Why is he in the picture?

456
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,760
He thinks that

457
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,199
my current situation

458
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:16,439
is not good enough for your family.

459
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,199
He wants me to give up.

460
00:22:18,439 --> 00:22:20,959
You mean Gu Mo asked you
to stay away from me?

461
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:24,280
Why do you believe him so blindly?

462
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,439
He's not my biological brother.

463
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,439
He's my superior!

464
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:26,880
If I don't

465
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:28,119
listen to him, who else?

466
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,079
Did he ever threaten you with your job?

467
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,520
I haven't settled the score
with him for Lu Li.

468
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,880
And now, he did this as well.

469
00:22:35,199 --> 00:22:37,560
So am I not the first man he threatened?

470
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,199
No wonder he knows what button to push.

471
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:41,760
He's an expert.

472
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,599
I was wondering why
ever since I was small,

473
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,760
men would steer away from me.

474
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:48,359
He's behind this.

475
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:49,079
Yes.

476
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:50,560
Ask him to come down here now!

477
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,359
We work in different departments.

478
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:55,520
I'm not crazy.

479
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,400
If I argue with you further,
I'll be late.

480
00:22:57,439 --> 00:22:58,479
You go...

481
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,400
You'll pay for this, Gu Mo!

482
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,199
Yicheng?

483
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:31,719
I didn't really mean to bother you,

484
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:35,400
but the nurse insisted on calling you.

485
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:38,640
She said that I took
some anti-allergy medicine,

486
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,680
so my family is required to be here.

487
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,959
I only remember your number.

488
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:46,560
Thank you for coming.

489
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,880
What happened to your hands and face?

490
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,560
Nothing.

491
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,160
Did he hit you?

492
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:02,839
Why did he come to you?

493
00:24:04,199 --> 00:24:05,160
For money.

494
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:07,800
Ever since I came back,

495
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:10,920
he kept pestering me for money.

496
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:12,520
Regularly?

497
00:24:14,439 --> 00:24:17,160
If I said no or didn't give him enough,

498
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,800
he'd hit me.

499
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,599
You can call the police.

500
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,560
Can I send him to the police station

501
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:26,599
like what he did to me back then?

502
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,400
He has enjoyed freedom
for so many years.

503
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:30,640
Sending him to jail as punishment
is already too light.

504
00:24:31,439 --> 00:24:32,199
Yicheng.

505
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,520
He's my dad.

506
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,880
He raised me.

507
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:38,359
I can't be this heartless.

508
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,280
Your kindness

509
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:42,079
enables him.

510
00:24:42,479 --> 00:24:45,000
Are you willing to be his ATM
for the rest of your life?

511
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,479
You're right.

512
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:53,599
I've worked hard to improve myself

513
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,359
during the past three years.

514
00:24:56,479 --> 00:24:58,160
However, I cannot deny that

515
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,439
I have this loser as a father.

516
00:25:02,439 --> 00:25:03,479
There is a way.

517
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:06,479
What way?

518
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:07,800
Triage.

519
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,079
Didn't I tell you
not to drink cold drinks?

520
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,719
It's not good for your health.

521
00:25:35,479 --> 00:25:37,680
The Black Forest cake that you ate
last time was from here.

522
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:38,920
Do you want to eat it?

523
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,280
Gu Mo.

524
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,439
No need to play nice anymore.

525
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,280
I know

526
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:44,479
what you did.

527
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,239
What did I do?

528
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,680
The first year of high school,

529
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,319
the class monitor confessed to me.

530
00:25:50,439 --> 00:25:52,400
He took his words back the next day.

531
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,560
You're the only person
who knows about it.

532
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:56,160
Was it your doing?

533
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:58,400
Your parents didn't want you to
have a relationship too early.

534
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,119
They asked me to look after you.

535
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,760
Fine.

536
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:03,280
Forget about high school.

537
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:04,400
In university,

538
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:06,439
I have only fallen in love
with three people.

539
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,199
The first one broke up with me

540
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,800
after a day.

541
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:11,239
The other two just told me that
I wasn't good enough

542
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,640
before we even dated.

543
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:16,359
Did you talk to them?

544
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,520
I merely tested their sincerity

545
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,520
but they all chickened out.

546
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,079
The band singer
whom I spent half a year courting

547
00:26:24,199 --> 00:26:25,599
ghosted me suddenly last year.

548
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,839
Did you do that too?

549
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,079
Those who are in a band

550
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,280
cannot give you a sense of security.

551
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:30,560
They are not good for you.

552
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,800
I'm free to like whoever I want

553
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:33,319
and it's none of your business!

554
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,839
I'm just trying to protect you.

555
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:45,000
You're too naive.

556
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:47,400
I don't want you to get hurt.

557
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:49,079
I'm not that girl who can be bought

558
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,160
by one lollipop.

559
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:50,920
All right?

560
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:52,280
I'm an adult.

561
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,119
I can be responsible for what I do.

562
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,439
You don't have the right to intervene.

563
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,640
Well, I am your brother

564
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,079
so I have the right.

565
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,520
Having Gu in your name

566
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:02,839
doesn't mean
you're my biological brother.

567
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,280
And even if you are,

568
00:27:04,479 --> 00:27:06,119
you cannot meddle in my private life.

569
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,000
You just want to be a control freak

570
00:27:08,199 --> 00:27:09,640
under the pretext of
"for your own good."

571
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,479
No,

572
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,160
a possessive control freak!

573
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,079
Gu Xiaoqi.

574
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,839
Listen carefully.

575
00:27:19,199 --> 00:27:20,959
Other than your parents,

576
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:23,040
no one else can vow that
they won't hurt you other than me.

577
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:23,959
But what you did

578
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,839
ruined my youth.

579
00:27:27,239 --> 00:27:28,439
Ever since I entered university,

580
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:30,800
every year, my birthday wish and
my new year wish

581
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,160
are to find a boyfriend.

582
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,560
Until now,

583
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,160
it hasn't come true.

584
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:38,239
I thought there was

585
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:39,920
something wrong with me

586
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,920
and that's why no man would approach me.

587
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:44,199
I didn't expect that you were behind

588
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,439
all of this!

589
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,760
All right.

590
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,160
But you have to know that

591
00:27:50,439 --> 00:27:52,280
those who can give you up readily

592
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:54,640
do not deserve your love.

593
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,079
I know.

594
00:27:56,479 --> 00:27:58,199
I don't like them anymore.

595
00:27:58,599 --> 00:27:59,319
But that doesn't mean

596
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,959
I can forgive you for meddling.

597
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,400
From now on,

598
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:05,199
you leave me

599
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:07,160
and my life alone.

600
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:10,199
I officially announce that

601
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:13,800
you and I are no longer friends!

602
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,560
Gu Mo.

603
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:24,239
It's over!

604
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:36,239
(Did something bad happen?)

605
00:28:36,493 --> 00:28:38,640
(Jiang Yicheng)
(You left so quickly just now.)

606
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:47,020
(Jiang Yicheng)

607
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,233
(Jiang Yicheng)

608
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,719
(Are you coming back
to the office this afternoon?)

609
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,340
(Jiang Yicheng)

610
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,280
What got into you this time?

611
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,239
Lu Li.

612
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,560
I think I've been dumped.

613
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,319
Were you ever in a relationship?

614
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,280
Exactly.

615
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:20,520
I was dumped before

616
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:21,680
I got into a relationship.

617
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,640
My life is so sad.

618
00:29:24,479 --> 00:29:26,079
Did Xiaoqi reject you?

619
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:26,880
Not Xiaoqi.

620
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,000
If Xiaoqi rejects me,

621
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,319
I'll still dog after her shamelessly.

622
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,599
It's Director Gu.

623
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:33,079
Director Gu?

624
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:38,599
Doesn't he want you
to be together with Xiaoqi?

625
00:29:39,439 --> 00:29:40,000
You know,

626
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,160
with someone like him as the gatekeeper,

627
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,920
even if Director Gu
is not Xiaoqi's boyfriend,

628
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,599
Xiaoqi's boyfriend has to be

629
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,800
someone better than Director Gu.

630
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,760
I can work hard but

631
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,119
I can never fight him.

632
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,640
You can fight.

633
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:56,119
You'll just get one shot.

634
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,520
You're right.

635
00:29:59,479 --> 00:30:00,160
Speaking of which,

636
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:01,119
the Art Department didn't

637
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:03,000
give me the render last time.

638
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,800
That was supposed to be
the warning from Director Gu.

639
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:07,680
What was I thinking

640
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,880
fighting a robot like that?

641
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:10,760
I'm digging my own grave, aren't I?

642
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,160
I agree.

643
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,199
Your opponent

644
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:18,280
will make you realize
how powerless you are.

645
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:20,079
Lu Li.

646
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,880
I have a question.

647
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,560
If you can only have either
love or a career,

648
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,839
which one will you pick?

649
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:30,359
My love and my career
are related to the same person.

650
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:32,199
What you said

651
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,359
is stinky.

652
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,959
Are you my buddy or not?

653
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:41,000
Why?

654
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,680
Why can't I have both love and a career?

655
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,359
Da Huang.

656
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,479
What got into you?

657
00:30:49,199 --> 00:30:50,400
Another love problem?

658
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:52,400
Da Huang.

659
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,280
Have you forgotten

660
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:54,800
how challenging it was
to keep your job last time?

661
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,199
Too tough, too tough.

662
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:59,119
The path to true love is too tough,

663
00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:00,880
and too bumpy.

664
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:03,520
No relationship is easy.

665
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:05,359
There will be ups and downs.

666
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:08,359
Something's off with you
and Mr. Jiang today.

667
00:31:08,439 --> 00:31:10,079
Did both of you crash

668
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:11,199
due to malfunction?

669
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:14,760
Why are you so interested
in someone's private life?

670
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,000
Are you lovesick?

671
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:17,119
I can ask around for you.

672
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:19,040
I... I'm not lovesick.

673
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:20,079
The relationship is too much trouble.

674
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:22,199
Well...

675
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,479
Lu.

676
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:25,199
I'm interested.

677
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:27,359
Feel free to distribute some to me.

678
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,520
You know what?

679
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,560
I will

680
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,439
talk to Yezi
from the Administration Department

681
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:33,359
and see if we can merge

682
00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:35,400
the admin and the Programming Department.

683
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,719
Not bad, Old Ape.

684
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:45,680
Calm down.

685
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:47,199
I'll come back now.

686
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:50,479
Guys.

687
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,280
It looks like...

688
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,680
Family issues. I have to go.

689
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,959
Can you help me take a half-day leave?

690
00:31:54,439 --> 00:31:55,079
Sure.

691
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,280
My friends.

692
00:31:58,199 --> 00:32:00,880
Suddenly, I feel like my path
to true love

693
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,959
isn't that bumpy.

694
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:11,920
Mr. Chen.

695
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,920
The leave notice from Old Ape.

696
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,040
Can you sign here?

697
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,599
You smelled it, didn't you?

698
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,000
The coffee I just brewed.

699
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,000
Thank you then.

700
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,760
Are you and Yicheng okay now?

701
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,520
You guys seemed happy in Ancient Town.

702
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,959
Thanks to you and Zitong.

703
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,040
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay there.

704
00:32:41,719 --> 00:32:44,040
So did you think about
what you need to do?

705
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,239
I believe there's a charm to persevere.

706
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,920
Even ice can be melted with enough heat.

707
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:51,400
Didn't you say that

708
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,640
opportunity is for those
who reach out to it?

709
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,839
What if your effort

710
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:57,599
only brings you disappointment?

711
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,520
There's a limit to

712
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,680
how low one can stoop
for the sake of love.

713
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:07,000
Should that day come,

714
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:09,479
maybe I won't be able to
give my blessing with a smile

715
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:11,439
but I still know
how to take defeat gracefully.

716
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:16,239
Why are you laughing?

717
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,400
I admire you.

718
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,199
You're laughing at me

719
00:33:22,239 --> 00:33:24,800
because I'm a headstrong dummy
who won't back down until I hit a wall.

720
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:25,880
I'm serious.

721
00:33:26,439 --> 00:33:27,800
When faced with a relationship,

722
00:33:27,959 --> 00:33:29,400
many will hesitate,

723
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:30,239
including me.

724
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,599
We're used to weighing
the gain and the loss.

725
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,640
But the more you hesitate,
the more you lose.

726
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,599
It's hard to keep a pure heart
when love is involved

727
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,439
like what you do now.

728
00:33:40,439 --> 00:33:41,920
You have something rare in you, Lu Li.

729
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,800
Thank you for your kind words.

730
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,640
I will try to be someone
you can look up to forever.

731
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,080
I need to lay low.

732
00:34:14,439 --> 00:34:15,560
If Zitong asks for me,

733
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,879
just say that I'm outbound.

734
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:18,959
What happened to you two?

735
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,399
You guys have been acting weird
since the trip to Ancient Town.

736
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,120
Her CPU is overheating.

737
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,000
She needs to cool down.

738
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:24,080
See you.

739
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,199
Too many hesitations, I see.

740
00:35:19,919 --> 00:35:20,600
Sister-in-law.

741
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,360
Have you seen Yiming?

742
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,320
He

743
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,320
went out.

744
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:28,959
When?

745
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:30,120
It's been a while.

746
00:35:31,399 --> 00:35:32,239
He's not here.

747
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:33,479
He won't pick up his phone.

748
00:35:33,919 --> 00:35:35,479
He's hiding from me.

749
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:40,080
My brother is not here too.

750
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:41,159
Did they go out together?

751
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,879
He went out this morning.

752
00:35:43,919 --> 00:35:44,439
Right.

753
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,840
You called me too.

754
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:46,919
So

755
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:48,959
do you have no idea
where my brother went either?

756
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:54,199
Unacceptable.

757
00:35:54,479 --> 00:35:55,840
They can have all the fun outside

758
00:35:55,919 --> 00:35:57,320
while the women
have to earn money for them.

759
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,840
Men.

760
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:00,560
Useless beings.

761
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,040
Maybe they have something else to do.

762
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:08,120
You indulge my brother too much.

763
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:10,679
Come, let's go out to vent.

764
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,800
It's still office hours.

765
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,360
You're the lady boss.

766
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:16,479
What are you afraid of?

767
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:17,479
Come, come.

768
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,120
Let's go.

769
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:19,199
Wait.

770
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,520
I need to bring my bag.

771
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:22,639
Go now.

772
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:33,454
(In-patient Department)

773
00:36:33,479 --> 00:36:34,679
Keep this triage result.

774
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,080
There should be surveillance cameras
in your residential area

775
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:39,040
as well as in the staircase.

776
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,959
Keep the footage of his visit.

777
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,679
It might not be very useful

778
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,560
but at least he has something to fear.

779
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:48,719
I think I've troubled you long enough

780
00:36:48,959 --> 00:36:50,600
that your work has been affected.

781
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,439
Yes.

782
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,439
When the doctor called me,
I was in a meeting.

783
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,600
I'm so sorry.

784
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,919
I shouldn't have bothered you

785
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,199
with my dad's problem.

786
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:01,399
But I was scared.

787
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,439
The only one I could think of was you.

788
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:08,040
Perhaps your mom is right.

789
00:37:08,439 --> 00:37:11,280
People like me will only hold you back.

790
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:15,000
If my mom said something hurtful to you,

791
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,120
I apologize on behalf of her.

792
00:37:17,959 --> 00:37:20,399
If your mom hadn't given me
a wake-up call,

793
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,199
the Li Man you see here
wouldn't exist.

794
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,840
Thank you

795
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,520
for coming to my aid
on such short notice.

796
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:28,919
We know each other, after all.

797
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,199
Also, you're the victim.

798
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,520
So,

799
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,000
are you saying that

800
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,919
we're still friends?

801
00:37:37,879 --> 00:37:38,800
You know.

802
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:41,239
I didn't grow up in a happy household.

803
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,840
I don't have many friends.

804
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,719
You, Zitong,

805
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,040
and Yiming are all important to me.

806
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,000
Even if we can't be together,

807
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:50,679
I still don't want to

808
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:52,159
lose you guys as my friends.

809
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,800
I'll send you back.

810
00:37:54,959 --> 00:37:56,040
I don't want to go back.

811
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:59,040
It's scary back there.

812
00:37:59,959 --> 00:38:01,120
Let me treat you to a meal

813
00:38:01,439 --> 00:38:03,239
as my way to thank you

814
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,800
for your great help today.

815
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,040
Okay?

816
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:57,320
That feels awesome.

817
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,120
There is nothing

818
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:01,479
money can't cure.

819
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,280
That's the privilege the rich have.

820
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,919
Did you not spend a dime today?

821
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,439
I don't have a strong urge to spend.

822
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,040
Come, let me take the picture for you.

823
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,040
No, no, no.

824
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,719
This has nothing to do
with my spending spree.

825
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:18,040
Some people spend

826
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:18,919
to buy happiness,

827
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:19,959
like my brother.

828
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:22,840
Other than games and Lego,

829
00:39:22,919 --> 00:39:24,719
he spends all his money on his company.

830
00:39:24,919 --> 00:39:27,239
Some people are happy, so they spend.

831
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,280
Like us here.

832
00:39:28,439 --> 00:39:29,520
I'll be your camerawoman.

833
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:30,800
Go.

834
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:32,479
Today,

835
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,840
you should spend until my brother
can't pay with his card anymore.

836
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,560
Show my brother
what an upset wife can do.

837
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:39,639
It's quite unrealistic, you know.

838
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:42,239
Revenge spending is only fun
for a short while.

839
00:39:42,439 --> 00:39:44,959
Ultimately, I'm depleting
our mutual resources.

840
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:47,199
I will suffer too in the end.

841
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:50,159
You're right.

842
00:39:50,959 --> 00:39:51,679
That said,

843
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:52,800
a woman

844
00:39:52,919 --> 00:39:54,600
needs to know how to spend money.

845
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,120
Or someone else will spend it

846
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:57,040
for you.

847
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,439
What do you mean?

848
00:40:00,919 --> 00:40:03,399
Aren't you worried that my brother
might be sick of vanilla flavor

849
00:40:03,479 --> 00:40:04,600
and go for something else?

850
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,919
Jiang Yicheng is not like that.

851
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,199
Personality matters too.

852
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:12,239
My brother is so picky.

853
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,879
He will want both
personality and appearance.

854
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,199
Have you not seen him with...

855
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,000
What about this restaurant?

856
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:19,919
I don't mind.

857
00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:22,040
What did you see?

858
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,840
I'm saying that you should stay alert

859
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:29,840
because someone
might take away my brother.

860
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:35,560
Don't you think so?

861
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,080
Let's go.

862
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:40,959
Where to?

863
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,679
My feet hurt from walking so much.

864
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,879
Let's go back.

865
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:44,919
I can't drive.

866
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,800
Can you drive?

867
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:50,000
Careful.

868
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,360
Let's go.

869
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,800
It's late now.

870
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Perhaps you can go back

871
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,280
and come visit another day?

872
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:20,000
I'm fine.

873
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,439
Normally, my brother
won't allow me to come visit.

874
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,040
Since he's not here today,

875
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,320
I should have the house tour.

876
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,120
Open the door.

877
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:52,320
Sister-in-law.

878
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,600
Can you get me a drink?

879
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:54,360
Sure.

880
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:04,760
Here.

881
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:10,239
If you're tired,

882
00:42:10,399 --> 00:42:11,320
you can rest on the sofa.

883
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:12,600
Okay.

884
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:19,439
Where are you going?

885
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,360
To the toilet.

886
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:26,159
I'll show you the way.

887
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:26,719
Come.

888
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:32,840
Please.

889
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:37,040
Take your time.

890
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:04,320
You're done.

891
00:43:06,439 --> 00:43:07,120
Sister-in-law.

892
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,639
Have you been waiting by the door?

893
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:15,199
Didn't you want a house tour?

894
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:15,800
Come.

895
00:43:15,959 --> 00:43:16,800
Let me show you.

896
00:43:20,919 --> 00:43:21,760
See?

897
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,239
Your beauty standard

898
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,239
hasn't changed since elementary school.

899
00:43:45,879 --> 00:43:47,919
Yicheng said the same thing too.

900
00:43:48,879 --> 00:43:50,159
It's very comfortable.

901
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:53,959
Please don't tell me

902
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:56,320
all your clothes are like this.

903
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:04,800
Only my brother's clothes are here.

904
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,439
Where are yours?

905
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:09,280
You know,

906
00:44:09,879 --> 00:44:12,479
your brother is quite territorial.

907
00:44:12,959 --> 00:44:14,239
Also, this wardrobe is too small.

908
00:44:14,679 --> 00:44:16,239
That's why we have separate wardrobes.

909
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:21,439
That's quite like him.

910
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:24,439
Come.

911
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,080
Let's play some games.

912
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:28,800
Have a seat.

913
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:32,840
You...

914
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,479
It's really late.

915
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,080
Are you sure
you don't want to head back?

916
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,159
You...

917
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,520
If you're tired, you can sleep first.

918
00:44:39,879 --> 00:44:40,679
Just ignore me.

919
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,959
Do you really want to stay here?

920
00:44:46,919 --> 00:44:48,320
I need to talk to my brother.

921
00:44:51,719 --> 00:44:54,239
(One-sided love is like
taking herbal medicine:)

922

923

(But as unpleasant as
the medicine might be,)

924
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:03,199

to pick you up.)
