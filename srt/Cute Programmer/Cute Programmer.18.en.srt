That's why he made me participate
in the game design competition.

22
00:01:53,663 --> 00:01:55,781
And I must get first place.

23
00:01:56,701 --> 00:01:59,997
It's because he wants
to attract more investments,

24
00:02:00,595 --> 00:02:04,992
so that we can stop his parents
from controlling him and our marriage.

25
00:02:06,635 --> 00:02:08,357
Give me Jiang Yicheng's number!

26
00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:11,235
What are you doing?

27
00:02:11,315 --> 00:02:14,004
I'll give him a taste of what it means
to be verbally insulted!

28
00:02:14,084 --> 00:02:15,081
He's such a playboy!

29
00:02:16,186 --> 00:02:17,515
He's not a playboy.

30
00:02:20,344 --> 00:02:22,326
It's just that he doesn't fancy me.

31
00:02:23,716 --> 00:02:25,927
Every time I see him and Li Man together,

32
00:02:26,007 --> 00:02:28,752
it's as if there's a bone
stuck in my throat.

33
00:02:29,295 --> 00:02:31,861
I can't spit it out or swallow it.

34
00:02:31,941 --> 00:02:34,515
It feels bad.

35
00:02:34,595 --> 00:02:35,921
Li.

36
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:39,898
Li?

37
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,422
There's a Li in her name as well.

38
00:02:43,502 --> 00:02:45,083
Say, is that on purpose?

39
00:02:45,163 --> 00:02:46,838
This must be fate, right?

40
00:02:47,447 --> 00:02:48,977
What fate?

41
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:52,590
I think you shouldn't give up
on the other trees in the forest...

42
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,819
because of a stunted tree like him.

43
00:02:55,983 --> 00:02:58,315
But he's the only tree in my forest.

44
00:02:58,395 --> 00:03:00,138
And he's not bad by any means.

45
00:03:01,011 --> 00:03:04,713
He's tall, huge, and at his prime.

46
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:09,270
He's the best-looking tree there is.

47
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,484
Even so, his flowers won't bloom for you.

48
00:03:11,564 --> 00:03:12,756
Silly girl!

49
00:03:13,216 --> 00:03:14,655
But it's the opposite for me.

50
00:03:14,973 --> 00:03:16,541
Every time I see him,

51
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:20,116
my flowers will bloom for him.

52
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,826
I know how to recite that.

53
00:03:27,214 --> 00:03:29,616
How to let you see me...

54
00:03:30,095 --> 00:03:32,539
at my most beautiful moment?

55
00:03:33,261 --> 00:03:34,456
For this,

56
00:03:34,536 --> 00:03:37,635
I've prayed to Buddha for 500 years.

57
00:03:37,715 --> 00:03:40,925
I pray that Buddha can let
our relationship bear fruit.

58
00:03:41,442 --> 00:03:43,448
-Give me your two hands.
-Two hands.

59
00:03:43,528 --> 00:03:44,934
According to the sayings of Buddha,

60
00:03:45,277 --> 00:03:47,338
it means to transform me into a tree...

61
00:03:47,418 --> 00:03:51,325
and let me grow beside the path you take.

62
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:12,276
"As the flowers bloom under the sunlight,"

63
00:04:12,356 --> 00:04:16,704
"each flower represents my longing
for you."

64
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,010
"When you approach me,
please listen closely."

65
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:26,435
"The trembling leaves
represent my passion as I wait for you."

66
00:04:27,077 --> 00:04:30,082
"When you passed by without noticing me,"

67
00:04:30,162 --> 00:04:33,274
"the petals behind you..."

68
00:04:34,737 --> 00:04:36,563
"My friend!"

69
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,005
"Those are not petals!"

70
00:04:39,085 --> 00:04:43,124
"Those are pieces of my withered heart!"

71
00:05:05,812 --> 00:05:07,637
Eat up. You should eat more.

72
00:05:22,054 --> 00:05:23,974
How dare you not return home last night?

73
00:05:25,131 --> 00:05:26,849
I'll deal with you after breakfast.

74
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:40,698
I didn't make coffee for you today.

75
00:05:40,778 --> 00:05:42,499
Have some honey water
to cure your hangover.

76
00:05:42,978 --> 00:05:44,020
Thanks.

77
00:05:45,091 --> 00:05:47,436
Do I smell like alcohol?

78
00:05:47,516 --> 00:05:48,940
I didn't wash my hair last night.

79
00:05:49,252 --> 00:05:50,821
You didn't go home last night, did you?

80
00:05:52,698 --> 00:05:53,901
No problem.

81
00:05:55,196 --> 00:05:56,405
Don't make a mistake.

82
00:05:57,288 --> 00:05:58,583
Mr. Jiang.

83
00:06:01,858 --> 00:06:03,086
Where's Lu Li?

84
00:06:03,807 --> 00:06:05,912
I think she went to Mr. Chen's office.

85
00:06:10,343 --> 00:06:12,546
So, you haven't got to chat with Yicheng.

86
00:06:12,626 --> 00:06:13,527
Actually, before this,

87
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:15,625
Yicheng has a reason for you
to quit Xuan Zhong Ji...

88
00:06:15,705 --> 00:06:17,185
and join the game design competition.

89
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:19,796
It's because of Li Man, right?

90
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:21,436
That's right.

91
00:06:21,516 --> 00:06:22,748
But it isn't what you think.

92
00:06:22,828 --> 00:06:23,819
He...

93
00:06:25,403 --> 00:06:26,568
What's wrong with your neck?

94
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,066
That's for Lu Li to cure her hangover.

95
00:06:29,648 --> 00:06:30,894
I'll get you another cup.

96
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,514
It's too sweet.

97
00:06:34,683 --> 00:06:37,150
Wait, did you drink last night?

98
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,150
Why didn't you pick up
my call last night?

99
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,322
My battery was flat.

100
00:06:44,146 --> 00:06:45,753
Can you come up with a better lie?

101
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,974
I can expose you immediately
with a lie like this, you know?

102
00:06:48,054 --> 00:06:48,956
Fine.

103
00:06:49,036 --> 00:06:50,831
I just don't feel like
answering your call. Are you happy now?

104
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:51,808
What kind of attitude is that?

105
00:06:51,888 --> 00:06:53,524
You told me to tell you the truth.

106
00:06:53,604 --> 00:06:55,392
What? Do you think you're in the right
for staying outside last night?

107
00:06:55,472 --> 00:06:56,932
I'm not a robot. I have emotions.

108
00:06:57,012 --> 00:06:58,337
I do get upset as well.

109
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:01,459
I know you're upset because I forced you
to pull out from Xuan Zhong Ji, right?

110
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:03,214
You just need to complete
the mission I gave you.

111
00:07:03,294 --> 00:07:05,147
I know that.
You don't need to emphasise it.

112
00:07:05,227 --> 00:07:06,154
I'll resume my work.

113
00:07:06,234 --> 00:07:07,642
Stop right there.

114
00:07:09,977 --> 00:07:12,360
I'm not finished yet.
Did you have gunpowder for breakfast?

115
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,103
Fine, I won't argue with you.

116
00:07:20,183 --> 00:07:21,366
Let's talk about work then.

117
00:07:21,446 --> 00:07:22,971
There's a time limit to
the game design competition.

118
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:25,585
Have you come up with any concept about
the game you're going to design?

119
00:07:25,665 --> 00:07:26,842
No, I haven't.

120
00:07:26,922 --> 00:07:29,803
Are you so confident that you can
win the first prize in the competition?

121
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:33,308
First, you didn't answer my call.

122
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,383
Second, you didn't report
your work progress to me.

123
00:07:35,463 --> 00:07:37,112
Third, you drank and didn't return home.

124
00:07:37,192 --> 00:07:39,419
As an employee,
you're not responsible at all.

125
00:07:39,499 --> 00:07:41,233
How could anyone
trust an employee like you?

126
00:07:41,787 --> 00:07:44,060
Look at you getting
all drunk and dejected.

127
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,070
Making you pull out from Xuan Zhong Ji
was the best decision I've made.

128
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:54,765
Yicheng.

129
00:07:56,315 --> 00:07:58,030
If you don't want
to join the competition,

130
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,347
you can tell me directly.

131
00:07:59,427 --> 00:08:01,540
I don't need you to win the competition.

132
00:08:02,258 --> 00:08:05,179
Do you think you're so important that
we won't be able to win without you?

133
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,361
He's saying everything out of spite.

134
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:10,712
Don't take his words to heart.

135
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:12,224
I will join the competition.

136
00:08:12,304 --> 00:08:13,582
And I will win the first prize.

137
00:08:13,662 --> 00:08:14,967
I won't disrupt your plan.

138
00:08:16,369 --> 00:08:17,636
Lu Li.

139
00:08:17,716 --> 00:08:18,610
Plan?

140
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,053
What plan?

141
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:21,218
What are you saying?

142
00:08:21,298 --> 00:08:22,573
Are you still drunk?

143
00:08:31,873 --> 00:08:32,880
Get your own.

144
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,337
I'm a victim, you know?

145
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:35,771
You deserved it.

146
00:08:37,202 --> 00:08:39,358
Why didn't you explain
the situation to her?

147
00:08:39,438 --> 00:08:40,799
Look at her attitude.

148
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,298
Do you think she'll listen
to my explanation?

149
00:08:42,378 --> 00:08:44,092
I'm the boss here.
She's just an employee.

150
00:08:44,172 --> 00:08:46,171
We need to be professional
when it comes to work.

151
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:49,128
We shouldn't let personal matters
affect our work.

152
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,439
Do you know what you look like right now?

153
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:51,475
What?

154
00:08:51,555 --> 00:08:53,839
You look like a husky that's
trying to rip apart the house.

155
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,339
Are you saying that I look like a dog?

156
00:08:55,419 --> 00:08:57,888
Jiang Yicheng,
I've known you for such a long time.

157
00:08:57,968 --> 00:09:01,486
Only now, I realise
that your EQ is unbelievably low.

158
00:09:01,566 --> 00:09:03,363
Initially, I wanted to help you out,
you know?

159
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:05,023
You better pray for yourself.

160
00:09:09,867 --> 00:09:11,188
Do you think you're so important...

161
00:09:11,268 --> 00:09:12,908
that we won't be able to win without you?

162
00:09:13,193 --> 00:09:16,085
I must prove to him
that I'm irreplaceable.

163
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,617
Rubbish. I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

164
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:26,822
I'll kill you!

165
00:09:37,281 --> 00:09:39,380
(Great Stress Reliever)

166
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,780
(I can raise my health point.
You shall give up!)

167
00:09:53,665 --> 00:09:54,694
Lu Li.

168
00:09:57,326 --> 00:09:58,372
Have a mint candy.

169
00:09:58,452 --> 00:09:59,583
Cool off for a bit.

170
00:09:59,998 --> 00:10:01,040
No need for that.

171
00:10:02,391 --> 00:10:03,271
Lu Li,

172
00:10:03,351 --> 00:10:06,843
when it comes to the relationship
between a boss and an employee,

173
00:10:06,923 --> 00:10:08,121
it's just like a couple.

174
00:10:08,201 --> 00:10:10,681
Even though they love each other,
they hurt each other.

175
00:10:10,761 --> 00:10:12,833
Adding to the fact that
the two of you are a couple,

176
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:14,493
you'll receive double the damage.

177
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,605
Actually, this is a great way.

178
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:20,386
It's impossible to defeat me with money
for you to heal up.

179
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:22,516
You won't cause any real injuries...

180
00:10:22,596 --> 00:10:25,123
and it won't affect
your relationship with him.

181
00:10:26,122 --> 00:10:29,421
It's just that the scene is too gory.

182
00:10:30,154 --> 00:10:32,431
Why don't we use
another method to kill him?

183
00:10:34,495 --> 00:10:35,598
Give me an example.

184
00:10:36,607 --> 00:10:38,256
For example, you see,

185
00:10:38,336 --> 00:10:40,585
he can die from a falling light bulb.

186
00:10:40,665 --> 00:10:42,648
Or, you can beat him up
until he's disfigured.

187
00:10:42,728 --> 00:10:44,723
He will die from his own hideousness
when he looks into the mirror.

188
00:10:44,803 --> 00:10:47,892
Anyway, there are plenty of ways
for you to kill your boss.

189
00:10:47,972 --> 00:10:50,055
You can change the method
every day if you like.

190
00:10:52,672 --> 00:10:53,865
So,

191
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:57,500
do bosses and employees have
an antagonistic relationship?

192
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,652
It's not completely true.

193
00:10:58,732 --> 00:11:00,030
But you see,

194
00:11:00,475 --> 00:11:02,440
those bosses who ask their employees
to work overtime every day...

195
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,058
without paying overtime fees,

196
00:11:04,138 --> 00:11:05,694
those who don't let the employees
take the weekend off,

197
00:11:05,774 --> 00:11:07,646
those who never promote their employees,

198
00:11:07,726 --> 00:11:09,589
those who command their employees around,

199
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,909
and those who humiliate their employees
for no reason,

200
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,885
naturally, those people are our enemies.

201
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:18,295
Were you referring to Jiang Yicheng?

202
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,311
I... I wasn't referring to him.

203
00:11:20,391 --> 00:11:21,959
Although Mr. Jiang didn't
give me a promotion,

204
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,504
he did increase my wage.

205
00:11:23,584 --> 00:11:25,214
I was referring to other companies.

206
00:11:26,213 --> 00:11:28,837
But if every employee
vents out their frustration and anger...

207
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:31,815
in a cute way like yours,

208
00:11:31,895 --> 00:11:34,100
this world will be much more peaceful.

209
00:11:36,674 --> 00:11:38,015
You're right.

210
00:11:41,093 --> 00:11:43,407
Da Huang, you're a genius!

211
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,708
Thanks!

212
00:11:48,627 --> 00:11:50,103
Did you guys hear that?

213
00:11:50,183 --> 00:11:51,917
Did you hear how Lu Li
praised me just now?

214
00:11:51,997 --> 00:11:53,525
She said I was a genius!

215
00:11:53,605 --> 00:11:54,853
Yeah.

216
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:57,654
You're an ordinary love genius.

217
00:11:57,734 --> 00:11:59,955
Hey, can you say something good for once?

218
00:12:00,035 --> 00:12:02,862
Both of us are single here.
We're of equal status, you know?

219
00:12:02,942 --> 00:12:04,037
I'm not in a rush.

220
00:12:04,117 --> 00:12:06,628
I'm not old enough
to be legally married yet.

221
00:12:09,538 --> 00:12:10,885
That's ruthless of you.

222
00:12:12,145 --> 00:12:13,108
I know.

223
00:12:13,188 --> 00:12:14,915
But what's the use of telling me that?

224
00:12:14,995 --> 00:12:17,106
Back then, you said
I would never lose money from this.

225
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:18,439
Look at how much I've lost!

226
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:20,993
I've invested all of my money in it,
you know?

227
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,824
Wait. Tell me, what should I do?

228
00:12:22,904 --> 00:12:24,843
Tell me! What should I do right now?

229
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:33,911
Old Ape, are you okay?

230
00:12:35,064 --> 00:12:36,452
I'm fine.

231
00:12:37,158 --> 00:12:40,678
I passed by
and overheard your conversation.

232
00:12:42,516 --> 00:12:44,468
I was just messing with my friend.

233
00:12:44,548 --> 00:12:46,806
You can tell us
if you're facing any difficulties.

234
00:12:46,886 --> 00:12:48,503
We can come up with something together.

235
00:12:50,743 --> 00:12:52,743
You just graduated from university.

236
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,969
How could you help me out?

237
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:56,482
No, I didn't mean that.

238
00:12:56,562 --> 00:12:57,994
I'm just trying to say that I'm fine.

239
00:12:58,074 --> 00:12:59,509
You don't need to worry about me.

240
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:01,429
I'll have some water.
You can resume your work.

241
00:13:12,914 --> 00:13:16,837
Lu Li, I have something to ask you.

242
00:13:16,917 --> 00:13:19,252
Didn't you say that
I was a genius just now?

243
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:23,606
I just want to know how I inspired you.

244
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:26,428
Did something happen to Old Ape
and his family?

245
00:13:26,508 --> 00:13:28,682
Old Ape? I heard nothing of the sort.

246
00:13:28,762 --> 00:13:31,769
Is he doing okay lately?

247
00:13:33,068 --> 00:13:35,477
He doesn't work overtime much.

248
00:13:35,557 --> 00:13:36,929
I think he's doing fine.

249
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:40,589
It's been a long time
since we had biscuits made by his wife.

250
00:13:41,814 --> 00:13:42,850
What's wrong?

251
00:13:43,388 --> 00:13:44,513
Nothing.

252
00:13:44,593 --> 00:13:46,805
Maybe I'm over-thinking it.

253
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:50,502
So, about the different ways
to kill a boss,

254
00:13:50,582 --> 00:13:51,788
do you have any other ideas?

255
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,085
You asked the right person.

256
00:13:55,165 --> 00:13:58,533
After years and years of enduring
Mr. Jiang's bullying,

257
00:13:58,613 --> 00:14:01,411
I've accumulated
plenty of creative ideas.

258
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:04,200
Tell me about them then.

259
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,500
Do you want me to tell you? No problem.

260
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,952
But you see,

261
00:14:08,475 --> 00:14:11,709
I think I need some coffee,
Luosifen noodles...

262
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:12,927
Sure, no problem.

263
00:14:13,007 --> 00:14:14,571
-Maybe some roasted lamb kidneys.
-No problem.

264
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:16,203
-Maybe some roasted pork trotters.
-No problem.

265
00:14:16,283 --> 00:14:18,409
And I think my stomach has
been feeling uncomfortable.

266
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:19,434
I need supplements as well.

267
00:14:19,514 --> 00:14:20,824
No problem.

268
00:14:20,904 --> 00:14:23,691
Death by alcohol poisoning.

269
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:26,587
Death by a falling vase.

270
00:14:27,054 --> 00:14:30,792
Sudden death due to overexerting oneself
on the toilet bowl.

271
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,371
Death by swallowing flies.

272
00:14:33,451 --> 00:14:36,020
Death by Luosifen noodle's pungency.

273
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,475
Death by clamping lifts.

274
00:14:37,555 --> 00:14:38,996
Death by shock due to cockroaches.

275
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:40,995
Death by drowning.

276
00:14:42,403 --> 00:14:44,026
What are these?

277
00:14:53,302 --> 00:14:54,901
Why is there no sound?

278
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:31,773
Luosifen noodles?

279
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,073
You didn't return home
and you didn't answer my call.

280
00:15:40,153 --> 00:15:42,593
That's why I said all those to you
when we were in the office.

281
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,161
This won't do.

282
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:46,831
It'll make me look petty.

283
00:15:54,096 --> 00:15:56,630
Everything in the office
stays in the office.

284
00:15:57,116 --> 00:15:58,745
Don't bring it home with you.

285
00:16:01,262 --> 00:16:02,430
This is good.

286
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,684
What smell is that?

287
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,389
What are you eating?

288
00:16:34,469 --> 00:16:35,953
Why does it smell like dung?

289
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,442
Is it smelly?

290
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:39,463
I think it smells great.

291
00:16:41,553 --> 00:16:43,117
That's a biochemical weapon.

292
00:16:43,197 --> 00:16:44,437
You better hurry and finish it.

293
00:16:45,345 --> 00:16:46,564
Chewing our food slowly...

294
00:16:47,427 --> 00:16:50,742
will aid us in food digestion.

295
00:16:50,822 --> 00:16:51,957
Besides,

296
00:16:52,037 --> 00:16:53,509
this is a delicious dish.

297
00:16:53,589 --> 00:16:55,354
Of course we must
take our time to enjoy it.

298
00:16:55,434 --> 00:16:57,509
I need to take my time
to enjoy its taste and smell.

299
00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:01,264
How could such a smelly thing
exist in the world?

300
00:17:04,103 --> 00:17:05,563
Are you a dung beetle?

301
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,416
Move aside. Move aside.

302
00:17:11,012 --> 00:17:12,055
What are you doing?

303
00:17:12,527 --> 00:17:14,182
Didn't you say I was a dung beetle?

304
00:17:14,262 --> 00:17:16,156
-I'm pushing the dung away from me.
-You!

305
00:17:34,802 --> 00:17:36,312
So delicious!

306
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:11,190
Why do you put so much perfume on you?

307
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:13,280
There's a dung beetle in my house.

308
00:18:19,175 --> 00:18:20,148
Let's begin.

309
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,140
(A Hundred Ways to Kill A Boss)

310
00:18:31,479 --> 00:18:35,901
The game is called
"A Hundred Ways to Kill A Boss" for now.

311
00:18:51,357 --> 00:18:52,455
Continue.

312
00:18:53,371 --> 00:18:55,722
This is a casual puzzle game.

313
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,670
It's a high difficulty game,
but its rules are simple.

314
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,775
I can conclude it with one sentence.

315
00:19:00,855 --> 00:19:04,916
We must use all kinds of methods
to reduce the boss's HP to zero.

316
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,180
(Please choose the design
of the boss you hate)

317
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,460
(Please choose the design
of the boss you hate)

318
00:19:34,058 --> 00:19:35,137
Who drew this?

319
00:19:35,796 --> 00:19:37,948
I asked Mr. Gu to draw this for me.

320
00:19:38,028 --> 00:19:39,451
Gu Mo is exceptional indeed.

321
00:19:39,531 --> 00:19:41,610
It looks just like you.

322
00:19:46,334 --> 00:19:49,847
The Programming Department has come up
with three types of bosses.

323
00:19:49,927 --> 00:19:51,856
This is one of them.

324
00:19:51,936 --> 00:19:53,671
He may look cool and wealthy.

325
00:19:53,751 --> 00:19:57,625
In reality, he's arrogant and mean.

326
00:19:58,167 --> 00:20:00,302
Players can choose
different types of bosses...

327
00:20:00,382 --> 00:20:02,020
according to their preferences.

328
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,461
The charm value,

329
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:07,036
acuity, and stamina of each boss
are different.

330
00:20:07,116 --> 00:20:08,837
So, every level
has different difficulty...

331
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,658
Battle scene
and different ways to solve them.

332
00:20:10,738 --> 00:20:12,783
There are all kinds of deaths available.

333
00:20:12,863 --> 00:20:16,215
For example,
death by Luosifen noodle's pungency.

334
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,195
I think that's a great idea.

335
00:20:22,275 --> 00:20:25,446
It puts the focus on the conflict
between bosses and their employees.

336
00:20:25,526 --> 00:20:27,846
I guess it can spark some discussions
in the work industry.

337
00:20:28,597 --> 00:20:31,533
It seems like most of you
are unhappy with your superiors, huh?

338
00:20:33,387 --> 00:20:36,035
Da Huang, tell me your thoughts.

339
00:20:36,115 --> 00:20:38,975
I'm happy with my superiors.

340
00:20:39,055 --> 00:20:41,136
Boss, you see, in my heart,

341
00:20:41,216 --> 00:20:43,379
you're mighty and talented.

342
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:45,980
You're one of the best bosses there is.

343
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,720
I'm happy with you.

344
00:20:48,979 --> 00:20:50,397
Actually, I just wanted...

345
00:20:50,477 --> 00:20:52,838
to know if the gamers will like
this kind of content or not.

346
00:20:53,063 --> 00:20:54,422
Tell me your honest thoughts.

347
00:20:54,767 --> 00:20:56,255
I will reward you accordingly.

348
00:20:56,528 --> 00:20:57,506
Is that so?

349
00:20:57,586 --> 00:20:59,434
I'll tell you what I think then.

350
00:21:00,066 --> 00:21:04,232
Boss, I think the schedule
for our development cycle is too tight.

351
00:21:04,312 --> 00:21:06,029
We've been working overtime constantly.

352
00:21:06,109 --> 00:21:07,861
We don't even have time
to be in a relationship.

353
00:21:07,941 --> 00:21:13,319
And boss, something simple for you may be
extremely difficult for us.

354
00:21:13,624 --> 00:21:16,360
And the users are changing
their preferences and needs constantly.

355
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,517
A slight change will affect everything.

356
00:21:18,597 --> 00:21:19,976
And you see,

357
00:21:20,056 --> 00:21:22,023
I don't suggest we change it too much.

358
00:21:22,103 --> 00:21:25,197
The more we change it, the
more likely a bug is going to appear.

359
00:21:25,277 --> 00:21:26,221
Boss,

360
00:21:26,301 --> 00:21:29,017
you were complaining about
our low work efficiency as well.

361
00:21:29,097 --> 00:21:30,389
We really...

362
00:21:39,718 --> 00:21:43,584
After all I've said, I just want to say...

363
00:21:43,664 --> 00:21:46,353
that our game has its value
in the market.

364
00:21:47,314 --> 00:21:49,183
You've proven yourself with your points.

365
00:21:49,263 --> 00:21:50,785
So, I've decided...

366
00:21:50,865 --> 00:21:53,599
to reward you with an extra 50 hours
of overtime work...

367
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,738
after you finish your 100 hours
of overtime work.

368
00:21:55,818 --> 00:21:58,526
I wonder if you're happy with this reward?

369
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,213
I am.

370
00:22:01,924 --> 00:22:03,077
I am.

371
00:22:03,157 --> 00:22:05,444
Since everyone is happy with this game,

372
00:22:06,121 --> 00:22:09,821
you guys may start
developing the demo version.

373
00:22:11,973 --> 00:22:13,082
Meeting dismissed.

374
00:22:16,866 --> 00:22:17,983
I...

375
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:20,623
Resume your work.

376
00:22:21,417 --> 00:22:22,688
You did great.

377
00:22:25,543 --> 00:22:27,579
I was inspired by his scolding.

378
00:22:28,228 --> 00:22:30,986
Is this a blessing in disguise?

379
00:22:31,822 --> 00:22:34,638
I think you mean
after rain comes fair weather.

380
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,294
When things seem like
they're at their bleakest moments,

381
00:22:37,374 --> 00:22:39,303
good things will happen.

382
00:22:41,315 --> 00:22:42,384
Good luck then.

383
00:22:42,464 --> 00:22:44,326
Call me if you need any help.

384
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:45,452
All right.

385
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,840
(Now I will delete your connection
from my list of friends)

386
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,240
(Now I will delete your connection
from my list of friends)

387
00:23:10,378 --> 00:23:11,587
We'll leave first.

388
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:12,832
Goodbye.

389
00:23:14,439 --> 00:23:16,540
-Lu, we'll leave now.
-Goodbye.

390
00:23:46,997 --> 00:23:49,451
Mimi, why do you look so cute?

391
00:23:49,531 --> 00:23:51,310
You look almost the same as Momo.

392
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:53,125
I wonder if you're a male or female cat.

393
00:23:55,415 --> 00:23:56,389
Sister Zhang.

394
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:00,786
-What's the matter?
-I want to ask you something.

395
00:24:00,866 --> 00:24:02,466
Is this a male or a female cat?

396
00:24:02,546 --> 00:24:03,822
This is a male cat.

397
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:05,551
-A male cat?
-Yes.

398
00:24:05,631 --> 00:24:06,827
He's a godsend indeed.

399
00:24:06,907 --> 00:24:08,020
Is it for sale?

400
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,502
We can negotiate the price.

401
00:24:10,042 --> 00:24:12,727
This cat belongs to someone else.

402
00:24:12,807 --> 00:24:15,988
Do you know if its owner
wishes to let it breed?

403
00:24:16,068 --> 00:24:17,321
I don't know about that.

404
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,256
Sister Zhang, can you do me a favour?

405
00:24:20,336 --> 00:24:22,589
Momo is at its best breeding age.

406
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,592
I hope that it can produce
its own offspring.

407
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:25,975
Please?

408
00:24:26,055 --> 00:24:27,747
All right then.
I'll ask its owner for you.

409
00:24:27,827 --> 00:24:28,978
Thank you, Sister Zhang.

410
00:24:31,931 --> 00:24:33,652
Mimi, be a good boy, all right?

411
00:24:33,732 --> 00:24:35,412
That way,
you'll get yourself a girlfriend.

412
00:24:37,285 --> 00:24:39,080
Are you a lonely old cat?

413
00:24:40,195 --> 00:24:42,343
Come on, don't ignore me.
You're so cold towards me.

414
00:24:44,822 --> 00:24:46,669
I asked the owner. He said yes.

415
00:24:46,749 --> 00:24:48,737
I think you two can message each other.

416
00:24:48,817 --> 00:24:50,442
Really? This is great!

417
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:52,299
-Thank you, Sister Zhang.
-Don't mention it.

418
00:24:53,346 --> 00:24:54,892
My little prince, wait for me.

419
00:25:23,749 --> 00:25:24,863
Li.

420
00:25:24,943 --> 00:25:26,165
-Mum?
-We're here.

421
00:25:26,245 --> 00:25:27,144
Dad?

422
00:25:27,224 --> 00:25:28,831
Why are you guys here?

423
00:25:29,796 --> 00:25:32,457
You two always say that you're busy
when I ask you guys to visit us.

424
00:25:32,537 --> 00:25:34,941
Since you two are not visiting us,
we'll visit you two then.

425
00:25:35,021 --> 00:25:36,085
Dad, Mum.

426
00:25:36,591 --> 00:25:39,638
Li, your mother and I
made some cold dishes for you two.

427
00:25:39,718 --> 00:25:42,653
And I brought you two fresh sea bass.

428
00:25:43,701 --> 00:25:44,674
Dad,

429
00:25:44,754 --> 00:25:47,104
I don't know whether to put them
in the refrigerator or the freezer.

430
00:25:47,184 --> 00:25:48,499
Can you keep them for me?

431
00:25:48,579 --> 00:25:50,068
Sure. Where's the refrigerator?

432
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:51,423
It's over there.

433
00:25:52,156 --> 00:25:54,414
Look. This is the living room.

434
00:25:54,494 --> 00:25:55,470
Mum.

435
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,353
What? You scared me.

436
00:25:57,433 --> 00:25:58,583
I thought you were a ghost.

437
00:25:58,663 --> 00:26:00,305
-You scared me.
-This is your first time here.

438
00:26:00,385 --> 00:26:01,801
Let me bring you around.

439
00:26:02,297 --> 00:26:03,544
Sure.

440
00:26:03,624 --> 00:26:05,011
Let's visit the kitchen first.

441
00:26:05,091 --> 00:26:06,098
Be gentle.

442
00:26:06,178 --> 00:26:07,752
I almost fell, you know?

443
00:26:08,555 --> 00:26:10,896
This is the kitchen ventilator.
This is a pot.

444
00:26:10,976 --> 00:26:13,601
You don't have to say it.
I know what they are.

445
00:26:18,754 --> 00:26:19,868
Wait, Li.

446
00:26:19,948 --> 00:26:21,955
Why isn't there anything
in your refrigerator?

447
00:26:22,035 --> 00:26:23,152
Don't you guys cook?

448
00:26:23,904 --> 00:26:25,036
We cook occasionally.

449
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:26,971
Usually, we'll order deliveries.

450
00:26:27,401 --> 00:26:28,752
But you two are married, you know?

451
00:26:28,832 --> 00:26:30,798
You can't just call deliveries
for the rest of your life.

452
00:26:30,878 --> 00:26:33,020
It'll ruin your health, you know?

453
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,250
I know that.

454
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:36,917
Listen, the food they
cook outside is unhygienic.

455
00:26:36,997 --> 00:26:38,458
They're very salty and oily as well.

456
00:26:38,538 --> 00:26:40,858
If you eat too much of them,
your taste bud will be affected.

457
00:26:40,938 --> 00:26:42,294
Dad, aren't you exaggerating?

458
00:26:42,374 --> 00:26:43,914
He isn't exaggerating at all.

459
00:26:44,313 --> 00:26:47,058
If you guys are too lazy to cook,
you should come home to have your meals.

460
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:48,750
If that doesn't work, I'll ask your father
to send your meals to you.

461
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,170
Dad, Mum,

462
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:52,985
do you two want to visit our rooms?

463
00:26:53,602 --> 00:26:54,626
This...

464
00:26:54,706 --> 00:26:55,785
Sure.

465
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:56,811
Why not?

466
00:26:56,891 --> 00:26:57,909
Come.

467
00:26:57,989 --> 00:26:59,079
Darling, hurry up.

468
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,288
Come.

469
00:27:07,369 --> 00:27:08,758
It's pretty clean.

470
00:27:10,033 --> 00:27:11,493
Why is the room filled with men's stuff?

471
00:27:11,573 --> 00:27:13,295
Li, where's your stuff?

472
00:27:13,863 --> 00:27:15,959
We keep our stuff in the next room.

473
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:17,613
The next room?

474
00:27:17,693 --> 00:27:19,493
Are you guys sleeping in the next room
instead of the master bedroom?

475
00:27:19,573 --> 00:27:20,562
What were you guys up to?

476
00:27:20,642 --> 00:27:22,112
The next room is our bridal chamber.

477
00:27:22,192 --> 00:27:23,326
We're newlyweds.

478
00:27:23,406 --> 00:27:25,326
Of course we need to sleep
in the bridal chamber.

479
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,296
Dad, Mum, do you two
want to visit the next room?

480
00:27:27,376 --> 00:27:29,210
Of course. Let's go. Let's go.

481
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,198
Sure.

482
00:27:30,278 --> 00:27:31,745
Over here.

483
00:27:36,361 --> 00:27:38,655
This is our washroom.
But there's nothing noteworthy inside.

484
00:27:38,735 --> 00:27:40,060
-Let's go in.
-All right.

485
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,099
Let's go.

486
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:42,327
This room is huge.

487
00:27:42,407 --> 00:27:43,482
It's larger than the previous room.

488
00:27:43,562 --> 00:27:44,840
Yeah.

489
00:27:45,327 --> 00:27:46,925
Why is the room so messy?

490
00:27:47,005 --> 00:27:48,266
My goodness.

491
00:27:49,428 --> 00:27:52,323
Li, why is there only one pillow here?

492
00:27:53,904 --> 00:27:56,403
Jiang Yicheng drools when he sleeps.

493
00:27:56,483 --> 00:27:57,695
He dirtied the pillow.

494
00:27:57,775 --> 00:27:59,136
That's why I washed the other one.

495
00:27:59,915 --> 00:28:01,767
That's a sign of spleen deficiency.

496
00:28:02,063 --> 00:28:04,063
You need to consume more
Chinese yam and red beans.

497
00:28:04,143 --> 00:28:06,194
Next time,
I'll bring some barley water for you.

498
00:28:06,274 --> 00:28:08,517
You must drink it often, understood?

499
00:28:10,186 --> 00:28:12,465
There's not even a
Chinese paper cutting in the room.

500
00:28:12,545 --> 00:28:14,502
It doesn't feel like
a bridal chamber at all.

501
00:28:14,582 --> 00:28:17,345
People who don't know might think
that they're just housemates.

502
00:28:17,425 --> 00:28:18,466
My goodness.

503
00:28:18,546 --> 00:28:19,828
You're too...

504
00:28:22,572 --> 00:28:25,632
Why is there an electric toothbrush
on the bed?

505
00:28:37,872 --> 00:28:40,014
-Why don't we go to the living room?
-Sure.

506
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:42,691
-Let's go to the living room.
-Yeah.

507
00:28:49,504 --> 00:28:50,803
Li,

508
00:28:50,883 --> 00:28:52,707
although you two are
not holding your wedding,

509
00:28:52,787 --> 00:28:54,429
when will you two
take your wedding photos?

510
00:28:54,509 --> 00:28:56,384
Mum, we're quite busy lately.

511
00:28:56,785 --> 00:28:57,851
Busy?

512
00:28:57,931 --> 00:28:59,795
Even so, you still need to
eat and sleep, right?

513
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:02,697
Stop using work as your excuse.

514
00:29:02,777 --> 00:29:04,199
Mum is right.

515
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:06,439
We must take our wedding photos
no matter what.

516
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:08,612
We'll take them once we're done
with our latest project.

517
00:29:08,692 --> 00:29:10,954
Look, they know what to do.

518
00:29:11,034 --> 00:29:13,090
You should stop being anxious
for nothing.

519
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,575
What do you mean by that?

520
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:18,662
If I don't rush them, they'll take forever
to take their wedding photos.

521
00:29:18,742 --> 00:29:20,469
Fine. You're right.

522
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:22,820
It's almost dinnertime.
How about this? I'll go and cook.

523
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:24,910
I'll let them try my cooking.

524
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,392
Come back.

525
00:29:26,916 --> 00:29:28,714
I don't want to eat your cooking.

526
00:29:28,794 --> 00:29:29,961
I eat them every day.

527
00:29:30,797 --> 00:29:34,388
But I haven't tried
my son-in-law's cooking before.

528
00:29:35,979 --> 00:29:37,034
Mum,

529
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:39,987
Jiang Yicheng isn't good at cooking.

530
00:29:40,067 --> 00:29:41,576
That's fine.

531
00:29:42,078 --> 00:29:44,322
I'll eat them as long as they're cooked.

532
00:29:44,646 --> 00:29:48,262
I'm happy as long as he shows me
his cooking as his sign of appreciation.

533
00:29:50,524 --> 00:29:51,617
Let me help him then.

534
00:29:51,697 --> 00:29:52,984
Come back.

535
00:29:53,064 --> 00:29:54,365
Why are you trying to help him?

536
00:29:54,445 --> 00:29:56,605
I want to try my son-in-law's cooking.

537
00:29:56,685 --> 00:29:57,650
Come.

538
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,726
Let's enjoy some TV shows together.

539
00:29:59,806 --> 00:30:00,822
Let's go.

540
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:10,644
This is what every man must go through.

541
00:30:11,128 --> 00:30:12,268
You can do it.

542
00:30:19,316 --> 00:30:21,351
I haven't watched them before.

543
00:30:21,431 --> 00:30:22,629
Which show is better?

544
00:30:22,709 --> 00:30:25,047
Darling, which show is better?

545
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,355
Continue.

546
00:30:28,347 --> 00:30:29,712
I think that's all of it.

547
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,552
Choose this show then.

548
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,247
Hello, Mr. Ye. This is my cat, Momo.

549
00:31:05,327 --> 00:31:06,983
See if you like her.

550
00:31:07,063 --> 00:31:09,463
I do like your cat very much.

551
00:31:09,543 --> 00:31:11,871
I hope our cats can
develop a relationship.

552
00:31:24,545 --> 00:31:25,686
Hello, Ms. Gu.

553
00:31:25,766 --> 00:31:28,000
Momo is gorgeous. I like her very much.

554
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,497
I believe my son likes her as well.

555
00:31:29,577 --> 00:31:31,635
Momo, he likes you.

556
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,528
But I have been away on a business trip.

557
00:31:34,608 --> 00:31:37,469
I hope I can arrange a matchmaking
session for them when I'm back.

558
00:31:38,256 --> 00:31:39,146
All right.

559
00:31:39,226 --> 00:31:41,367
Remember to contact me
when you're back, all right?

560
00:31:44,118 --> 00:31:47,139
Momo, I've found a handsome cat for you.

561
00:31:47,219 --> 00:31:48,378
Are you excited?

562
00:31:51,141 --> 00:31:52,312
Are you not excited?

563
00:31:52,392 --> 00:31:54,006
I'll be excited on your behalf then.

564
00:31:54,893 --> 00:31:56,760
Mr. Handsome!

565
00:32:06,773 --> 00:32:09,697
Stir-fried carrots with tomatoes?

566
00:32:10,289 --> 00:32:12,270
This is something new.

567
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:15,747
They belong to the same color.

568
00:32:15,827 --> 00:32:17,968
Please try it. I think
they won't be that bad.

569
00:32:18,897 --> 00:32:19,894
Let's try it.

570
00:32:19,974 --> 00:32:21,128
All right.

571
00:32:21,868 --> 00:32:23,773
-Come.
-Let's give it a try.

572
00:32:31,411 --> 00:32:34,839
It's sweet and sour. It's not bad.

573
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:38,199
Yeah.

574
00:32:39,645 --> 00:32:43,623
Is this the fish
we brought here just now?

575
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:49,164
Yes. It's just that I didn't
control the fire well.

576
00:32:49,244 --> 00:32:50,491
Yeah.

577
00:32:50,571 --> 00:32:53,657
The outside may look burnt,
but the inside is edible.

578
00:32:53,737 --> 00:32:54,620
Come.

579
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,008
Have a try.

580
00:32:56,728 --> 00:32:58,877
Is this egg drop soup?

581
00:32:59,475 --> 00:33:00,385
Yicheng,

582
00:33:00,465 --> 00:33:03,209
how could you not beat the egg
before cooking it?

583
00:33:07,976 --> 00:33:09,641
Can we eat now?

584
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:12,007
I'll go and scoop the rice.

585
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,213
Mum, I told you that
he wasn't good at cooking.

586
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:22,261
In the end, we're the ones suffering.

587
00:33:23,004 --> 00:33:26,843
I didn't expect him
to be that bad at cooking.

588
00:33:28,267 --> 00:33:31,622
Initially, I just thought you couldn't
bear to let him do the chores.

589
00:33:32,632 --> 00:33:33,856
Listen,

590
00:33:34,306 --> 00:33:37,325
you must make your man work.

591
00:33:37,405 --> 00:33:38,433
You mustn't spoil him.

592
00:33:38,513 --> 00:33:40,617
The more you spoil him,
the lazier he gets.

593
00:33:40,697 --> 00:33:41,869
Really?

594
00:33:41,949 --> 00:33:43,133
Of course.

595
00:33:45,142 --> 00:33:47,055
Your father is the best proof.

596
00:33:47,135 --> 00:33:49,516
I did a good job of disciplining him.

597
00:33:51,515 --> 00:33:55,056
It's lucky that we have rice cookers now.

598
00:33:55,732 --> 00:33:58,520
I guess the rice won't be that bad.

599
00:34:01,777 --> 00:34:03,851
Yicheng, where's the rice?

600
00:34:05,203 --> 00:34:06,324
Coming.

601
00:34:11,803 --> 00:34:12,808
I...

602
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,917
I forgot to turn on the switch.

603
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,444
It's fine.

604
00:34:21,524 --> 00:34:22,803
We still have noodles at home.

605
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:24,214
Enough.

606
00:34:24,294 --> 00:34:25,932
Let me add something to the soup.

607
00:34:26,012 --> 00:34:27,220
Let me turn it into a broth.

608
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:32,426
I'll make some cold dishes.

609
00:34:36,439 --> 00:34:37,522
I told you already.

610
00:34:37,602 --> 00:34:39,789
You should let me do the cooking
in the first place.

611
00:34:43,064 --> 00:34:45,184
Don't tell me they'll ask me
to wash the dishes later?

612
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,263
Lu Li,

613
00:35:03,725 --> 00:35:08,593
I think asking the boss
to wash the dishes is a great idea.

614
00:35:09,477 --> 00:35:13,630
Sometimes, I wonder
if rich people like Mr. Jiang...

615
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:16,730
have ever done any chores before.

616
00:35:17,262 --> 00:35:18,514
They don't do chores.

617
00:35:18,594 --> 00:35:21,434
That's why I'll let him do
all the chores in the game.

618
00:35:21,909 --> 00:35:22,993
Good job.

619
00:35:26,529 --> 00:35:28,341
All right, I'm done.

620
00:35:28,421 --> 00:35:29,423
Are you done?

621
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:31,386
You finished it one day earlier
than the deadline.

622
00:35:31,466 --> 00:35:32,438
Yeah.

623
00:35:32,518 --> 00:35:35,681
I'm just a zombie
that only knows how to write codes.

624
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:37,205
You're an amazing zombie.

625
00:35:37,285 --> 00:35:39,632
Old Ape, Lu Li is done with her work.

626
00:35:44,455 --> 00:35:45,783
Don't you want to submit it yet?

627
00:35:45,863 --> 00:35:48,150
I just want to double-check it.
I'll submit it tomorrow.

628
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,538
Yeah, you should double-check it.

629
00:35:49,618 --> 00:35:52,419
Don't commit a silly mistake
like someone else.

630
00:35:52,499 --> 00:35:53,619
You!

631
00:35:53,699 --> 00:35:54,770
You're right.

632
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:57,289
If not, when you initiate the program,

633
00:35:57,369 --> 00:35:59,493
the system may fail to function
because of your error.

634
00:35:59,573 --> 00:36:01,670
It's fine. I saved it within the server.

635
00:36:06,271 --> 00:36:08,799
Leader Zhang, our new servers are here.

636
00:36:08,879 --> 00:36:10,543
Please send your men to take them.

637
00:36:16,486 --> 00:36:17,417
I'll follow you.

638
00:36:17,497 --> 00:36:18,576
Let's go.

639
00:36:21,399 --> 00:36:24,009
When she needs it,
she steals it from others.

640
00:36:24,089 --> 00:36:25,575
When she doesn't need it,

641
00:36:25,655 --> 00:36:26,953
she's actually asking us
to take them back.

642
00:36:27,033 --> 00:36:28,736
Humans are invincible
when they're shameless.

643
00:36:28,816 --> 00:36:29,972
Precisely.

644
00:36:30,782 --> 00:36:32,503
You better check it properly.

645
00:36:34,263 --> 00:36:35,856
Old Ape, your phone is ringing.

646
00:36:35,936 --> 00:36:37,688
Do I answer this call for him?
It's an unknown number.

647
00:36:37,768 --> 00:36:40,440
What has this got to do with you?
Just wait for Old Ape to return.

648
00:36:42,252 --> 00:36:43,195
Lu Li,

649
00:36:43,275 --> 00:36:45,158
I wish to be the first player
for your alpha testing.

650
00:36:45,238 --> 00:36:48,355
What do you mean?
This game was inspired by me, you know?

651
00:36:48,435 --> 00:36:50,276
Sorry, guys. I applied for it first.

652
00:36:50,356 --> 00:36:51,641
So, according to the principle
of first come, first served,

653
00:36:51,721 --> 00:36:52,949
I should be the first tester for
her alpha testing.

654
00:36:53,029 --> 00:36:54,405
Old Ape, your phone was ringing.

655
00:36:54,485 --> 00:36:55,424
Wait.

656
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,125
-Since when did you apply for it?
-You can ask Lu Li.

657
00:36:57,205 --> 00:36:58,732
-I applied for it long ago.
-Wait.

658
00:36:58,812 --> 00:37:00,374
Can you follow the procedures for once?

659
00:37:00,764 --> 00:37:02,196
That's devious of you.

660
00:37:02,276 --> 00:37:03,862
I'm just doing it for everyone's sake.

661
00:37:03,942 --> 00:37:05,271
It's a cold call.

662
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,621
This game was inspired by me.

663
00:37:08,701 --> 00:37:10,633
You need to discuss that with Mr. Jiang.

664
00:37:10,713 --> 00:37:12,887
Preparing You're so devious.

665
00:37:15,495 --> 00:37:16,919
Old Ape, we'll leave now.

666
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,546
-Take care.
-See you tomorrow.

667
00:37:31,152 --> 00:37:32,590
How dare you not answer my call?

668
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,271
What? Do you want to delay your payment?

669
00:37:35,539 --> 00:37:38,184
Brother Long,
I was in a meeting just now.

670
00:37:38,264 --> 00:37:40,148
I couldn't answer your call just now.
Sorry about that.

671
00:37:40,228 --> 00:37:42,470
Save your breath. Return me the money.

672
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:46,612
Brother Long, let's go somewhere else.

673
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:51,042
Brother Long, give me one week.

674
00:37:51,122 --> 00:37:53,687
I'll repay my debt within one week,
all right?

675
00:37:55,921 --> 00:37:58,289
Brother Long,
give me one week, all right?

676
00:37:58,369 --> 00:37:59,346
One week is enough.

677
00:37:59,426 --> 00:38:00,892
-Brother.
-Save your breath.

678
00:38:00,972 --> 00:38:02,609
Let's talk about this, okay?

679
00:38:02,689 --> 00:38:04,831
Just give me one week, okay?

680
00:38:13,973 --> 00:38:15,290
You have one more day.

681
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,530
If you can't repay your debt,

682
00:38:16,611 --> 00:38:19,241
we'll go to your office
and have a chat with your boss.

683
00:38:19,321 --> 00:38:20,452
Understood?

684
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:21,882
Understood.

685
00:38:21,962 --> 00:38:23,138
Did you hear me?

686
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:24,283
Yes!

687
00:38:24,363 --> 00:38:25,608
Let's go.

688
00:38:49,574 --> 00:38:50,698
Morning.

689
00:38:50,778 --> 00:38:51,877
Morning.

690
00:39:04,045 --> 00:39:05,413
I don't know what happened to me.

691
00:39:05,493 --> 00:39:07,341
I've been sneezing the entire morning.

692
00:39:07,421 --> 00:39:08,976
Does someone miss me?

693
00:39:09,832 --> 00:39:13,170
Your nasal mucosa and body
were irritated by environmental factors,

694
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,466
resulting in an upper respiratory
tract infection.

695
00:39:15,546 --> 00:39:18,193
To put it simply, you caught a cold.

696
00:39:18,722 --> 00:39:21,035
I'm still young and healthy, you know?

697
00:39:21,463 --> 00:39:24,643
I think something's going to happen.

698
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,460
(A Hundred Ways to Kill A Boss)

699
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,460
(There are no files
that match the search criteria)

700
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,940
(Server)

701
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,580
(Recycle Bin)

702
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:52,993
It's gone.

703
00:39:54,796 --> 00:39:56,005
Say that again.

704
00:39:56,871 --> 00:39:59,322
The source code of my game is gone.

705
00:39:59,402 --> 00:40:00,727
What do you mean by that?

706
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:03,305
I can't find it on my computer.

707
00:40:03,386 --> 00:40:05,316
Yicheng, calm down for now.

708
00:40:05,995 --> 00:40:08,858
Did you make any backup files
in other places besides the hard drives?

709
00:40:09,646 --> 00:40:11,767
I made a backup file on the server.

710
00:40:11,847 --> 00:40:13,239
But I can't find it.

711
00:40:13,319 --> 00:40:15,755
I've tried all kinds of ways
to restore my file.

712
00:40:15,835 --> 00:40:17,493
But all of them failed.

713
00:40:17,573 --> 00:40:19,094
Are you saying that
both the computer and server...

714
00:40:19,174 --> 00:40:21,713
have deleted the files
you were planning to upload?

715
00:40:21,793 --> 00:40:25,183
Although it sounds ridiculous,
that is the case.

716
00:40:26,374 --> 00:40:27,636
I'm sorry.

717
00:40:29,035 --> 00:40:30,736
Apologising to me won't work.

718
00:40:31,234 --> 00:40:32,720
Do you remember the promise
you made to me?

719
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,295
Now, are you telling me that it's gone?

720
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:36,135
Today is the submission deadline.

721
00:40:36,215 --> 00:40:37,587
You're telling me that
you ran out of bullets...

722
00:40:37,667 --> 00:40:39,399
just before you entered a battle?

723
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,679
Doesn't that mean we'll lose
without putting up a fight?

724
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:46,046
I remember that we can participate
in the competition as long as our demo...

725
00:40:46,126 --> 00:40:47,556
is at least 70 percent complete.

726
00:40:47,636 --> 00:40:49,805
I'll rewrite the codes immediately.

727
00:40:49,885 --> 00:40:51,434
The deadline is 8:00 PM.

728
00:40:51,514 --> 00:40:52,937
You can't even make it in time.

729
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:54,500
Even if you do make it in time,
will a demo that's 70 percent complete...

730
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,940
be able to win the first prize?

731
00:40:56,722 --> 00:40:58,161
Why were you so careless?

732
00:40:59,004 --> 00:41:00,194
You disappoint me.

733
00:41:05,272 --> 00:41:06,340
Sorry.

734
00:41:25,755 --> 00:41:27,342
You were too harsh to her.

735
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,224
She worked very hard to create the demo.

736
00:41:32,304 --> 00:41:34,225
Now, all of her efforts have
gone down the drain.

737
00:41:34,635 --> 00:41:35,969
This gives EG another reason...

738
00:41:36,049 --> 00:41:38,621
not to choose her as the lead programmer
of Xuan Zhong Ji.

739
00:41:40,366 --> 00:41:41,985
So, did you feel sorry for her?

740
00:41:42,065 --> 00:41:43,588
Why didn't you put it in a nice way?

741
00:41:44,131 --> 00:41:46,232
Nobody will feel sorry
for a dumb koala like her.

742
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,840
How does one even make
a computer file go missing?

743
00:41:49,694 --> 00:41:51,331
She doesn't want this to happen as well.

744
00:41:52,412 --> 00:41:54,367
I thought you were heading to
Chongqing this afternoon.

745
00:41:54,447 --> 00:41:56,456
But look at what happened to our company.

746
00:41:57,273 --> 00:41:58,223
Just leave this to me.

747
00:41:58,303 --> 00:41:59,474
You should head to Chongqing.

748
00:42:01,489 --> 00:42:02,510
I'll leave first then.

749
00:42:11,334 --> 00:42:13,200
-Yicheng.
-I'm busy. We'll talk later.

750
00:42:23,472 --> 00:42:26,725
Mr. Jiang, you have an appointment
with Mr. Shen at 3:00 PM tomorrow.

751
00:42:26,805 --> 00:42:29,388
Mr. Jiang, you have a signing
ceremony next Tuesday.

752
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:32,440
Mr. Jiang, regarding the real
estate project we discussed last time,

753
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,224
-we managed to buy the land.
-All right.

754
00:42:34,304 --> 00:42:35,708
You guys can resume your work.

755
00:42:35,788 --> 00:42:36,798
Goodbye, Mr. Jiang.

756
00:42:36,878 --> 00:42:38,002
Goodbye.

757
00:42:51,656 --> 00:42:53,864
It looks great, huh?

758
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:55,665
Mr. Jiang.

759
00:42:57,226 --> 00:42:58,264
Mr. Jiang.

760
00:42:58,765 --> 00:42:59,969
Why are you calling me
Mr. Jiang right now?

761
00:43:00,049 --> 00:43:02,092
I'm not used to it yet.

762
00:43:03,219 --> 00:43:05,415
Mr. Jiang, have some water.

763
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:09,805
It seems like
the sun is rising from the west.

764
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:12,790
I'm sure you need my help, right?

765
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:13,927
Tell me.

766
00:43:14,007 --> 00:43:16,483
Dad, you're being too realistic.

767
00:43:16,563 --> 00:43:20,180
I just want to tighten our bond
as father and son.

768
00:43:20,762 --> 00:43:22,089
Is that the case?

769
00:43:22,169 --> 00:43:23,867
Now, it's working hours.

770
00:43:23,947 --> 00:43:27,396
If you want to tighten our bond,
we can do it after work.

771
00:43:27,911 --> 00:43:29,789
Dad, chat with me.

772
00:43:29,869 --> 00:43:31,110
Just tell me.

773
00:43:31,961 --> 00:43:32,979
All right.

774
00:43:33,059 --> 00:43:34,117
I do need your help.

775
00:43:34,197 --> 00:43:35,314
Tell me then.

776
00:43:35,394 --> 00:43:39,088
You're friends with Mr. An
from Netfalse, right?

777
00:43:39,168 --> 00:43:40,110
Yeah.

778
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:41,235
What's wrong?

779
00:43:41,315 --> 00:43:43,642
-Do you need to find him?
-It's nothing huge.

780
00:43:43,722 --> 00:43:46,542
He was holding
a game design competition lately.

781
00:43:46,622 --> 00:43:47,656
I want you to do me a favour...

782
00:43:47,736 --> 00:43:50,025
and ask him to extend
the submission deadline.

783
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,036
I thought you hated to utilise
your connections for work purposes.

784
00:43:57,063 --> 00:43:59,803
It's all because
of the wife you found for me.

785
00:43:59,883 --> 00:44:01,082
She's extremely dumb.

786
00:44:01,548 --> 00:44:03,996
The demo of our game
went missing because of her.

787
00:44:06,829 --> 00:44:08,061
Why are you staring at me?

788
00:44:08,141 --> 00:44:09,555
You don't need to delay it
for a long time.

789
00:44:09,635 --> 00:44:11,115
Just delay it until tomorrow morning.

790
00:44:14,768 --> 00:44:16,038
Can't you do it?

791
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:18,972
If you can't do it,

792
00:44:19,781 --> 00:44:21,226
I can only sack her.

793
00:44:22,605 --> 00:44:24,061
And I'll tell my mother about it.

794
00:44:25,457 --> 00:44:26,559
You brat,

795
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:29,193
you always threaten me with your mother.

796
00:44:29,273 --> 00:44:31,069
Fine. This time,

797
00:44:31,149 --> 00:44:36,286
I'll plead An for your wife's behalf.

798
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,827
So, what reward will I get for this?

799
00:44:39,183 --> 00:44:41,972
I will surely praise you in front of Mum.

800
00:44:42,052 --> 00:44:43,882
That's the most basic thing
you need to do.

801
00:44:43,962 --> 00:44:46,523
It's the most basic and the hardest
thing to do at the same time.

802
00:44:47,749 --> 00:44:49,153
What else do you need me to do?

803
00:44:50,901 --> 00:44:52,630
I need to play golf later.

804
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:54,043
We lack a ball boy.

805
00:44:54,889 --> 00:44:56,660
Old Jiang, you're being too much.

806
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:57,882
What?

807
00:44:57,962 --> 00:45:01,425
Can't you even endure hardship
for your wife's sake?

808
00:45:02,301 --> 00:45:03,290
Forget about it then.

809
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:04,789
This conversation never took place.

810
00:45:05,806 --> 00:45:07,500
