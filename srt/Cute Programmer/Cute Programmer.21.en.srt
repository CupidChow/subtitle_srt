How's Lu Li?

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,080
Just some scratches.

23
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,599
She already returned from the hospital.

24
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:07,879
She got into an accident.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,360
Why did she tell you and not me?

26
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,000
Because you only
have your eyes on Li Man.

27
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,399
She's asleep.

28
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,000
Let's talk.

29
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,320
About what?

30
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,559
I know you two are just married in name.

31
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,880
Did she tell you that as well?

32
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:27,520
You need to make a stand.

33
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:30,160
If you do not sever ties with Li Man,

34
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,160
you'll put Lu Li in a tough spot.

35
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:33,919
Li Man called me because she got burned.

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,639
I then sent her to the hospital.
That's all.

37
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:38,800
You owe Lu Li an explanation.

38
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:42,839
She deserves a man
who will devote himself to her.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,639
If you can't promise that,

40
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,119
let her go.

41
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,440
What do you mean?

42
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,679
Why do you make it sound like
I'm at fault here?

43
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,960
Yiming.

44
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,720
You know very well there's nothing
between Li Man and me.

45
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,240
Even if it's just a random passerby,

46
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,039
you will intervene too, won't you?

47
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:57,960
I don't care if you

48
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,759
took pity on Li Man or whatever.

49
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,919
I just don't want Lu Li

50
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:03,320
to be the sacrificial lamb
in your messy relationship.

51
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,119
You care a lot about her.

52
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,559
Because I'm not just your friend.

53
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,720
I'm her friend too.

54
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,160
Check on her.

55
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,440
Bye.

56
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:13,479
You're awake.

57
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,079
How are you feeling?

58
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,880
I'm fine.

59
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,279
I didn't pick up the phone
yesterday because...

60
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,279
No need to explain.

61
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,320
Well,

62
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,480
we agreed

63
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:30,519
not to meddle
in each other's private life.

64
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,480
But you called me several times.

65
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:35,480
Was there something else?

66
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,359
I'm good.

67
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,320
I bought you some supplements.
Remember to take them.

68
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,239
Thanks.

69
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:46,720
But I don't need them.

70
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,239
Are you going out?

71
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:53,679
I'm heading out too.
Let me give you a ride.

72
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,359
It's fine. We don't take the same route.

73
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:16,920
The bride and groom
may exchange gifts now.

74
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:19,399
Done. To their new house!

75
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,920
Now that you two are husband and wife,

76
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:36,279
any comments from the wedding witnesses?

77
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,359
Even cats have a wedding ceremony
nowadays. I envy them.

78
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,119
Did you hear that?

79
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,119
You two are lucky
to have me as your owner.

80
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:45,359
Be nice to each other

81
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,839
(YE)
and bring me tons of cute kittens.

82
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,119
I'm pregnant.

83
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,679
What?

84
00:05:57,679 --> 00:05:59,600
When did Jiang Yicheng and you...

85
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,640
That day, he was drunk and...

86
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,799
But he has no memory of it.

87
00:06:06,239 --> 00:06:07,679
Is this a telenovela?

88
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,119
You need to tell him.

89
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,559
That night, he mistook me for Li Man.

90
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,679
I don't want to degrade myself further.

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,239
What a heartless man.

92
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,119
His atrocities deserve

93
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,839
to be publicized on the internet.

94
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:24,239
It was consensual.

95
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,600
My dear Li!

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,239
How can you be this dumb?

97
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,559
I know.

98
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:35,920
That's why

99
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,440
I want to wake up now.

100
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,320
Do you plan to give up on Jiang Yicheng?

101
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:45,160
Whenever I know that

102
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,040
he's with Li Man,

103
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,040
I feel sad.

104
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,519
But when he shows me
a tiny bit of kindness,

105
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,920
I'll forgive him straight away.

106
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,279
I always thought that he cared for me.

107
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,640
Until yesterday,

108
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,119
when I saw Li Man and him
in the hospital,

109
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,399
I suddenly realized

110
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,480
how delusional I was.

111
00:07:10,239 --> 00:07:11,640
Some people

112
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,679
or some feelings

113
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:17,440
cannot be erased by time.

114
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,720
I took a risk

115
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,880
and I lost.

116
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,600
I don't think you lost.

117
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,200
You just placed your bet
on the wrong person.

118
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,760
Jiang Yicheng doesn't deserve

119
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,239
your love.

120
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,720
Li.

121
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,760
I think giving up now
can cut the pain short.

122
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,959
Do you really think
I should give up on him?

123
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,640
Li,

124
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,279
whatever your decision is,

125
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:47,440
I'll support you.

126
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:49,959
Worst comes to worst,
we'll raise the child together.

127
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:57,679
Thanks, Xiaoqi.

128
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:20,040
You wandered around with an injury.

129
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,959
Do you not know that
a patient should rest?

130
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,559
Yes?

131
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,880
Where are you?

132
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,159
Do you want me to pick you up?

133
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,440
It's okay.

134
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,440
I'm with Xiaoqi now.

135
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,119
I'll crash at her place tonight.

136
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:52,000
Mr. Jiang.

137
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:53,200
You're a busy man.

138
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:54,559
No need to worry about Lu Li.

139
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:56,239
And also, please leave us alone.

140
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,719
Leave you alone?

141
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:08,080
What the heck?

142
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,880
It's okay.

143
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,119
Cheer up.

144
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,080
Come.

145
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:24,280
Try this.

146
00:09:24,359 --> 00:09:25,799
I think this one is pretty nice.

147
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,840
How do you know I like this?

148
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,239
I saw you searching for it last time.
Do you like it?

149
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,200
Yes.

150
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,479
Lu, you know me the best.

151
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:46,320
From now onwards,

152
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,599
they are my girlfriends.

153
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:48,799
No one can touch

154
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,280
nor peek at them.

155
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:52,640
This whale is...

156
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:54,239
It's squeezable.

157
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,359
When you're stressed,

158
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:57,159
just squeeze it
with all your might to vent.

159
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,840
It also serves as a mini night lamp.

160
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,320
You get to choose from seven colors.

161
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,520
I love it.

162
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,919
Did you spend all the money

163
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,200
Old Ape gave you?

164
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:06,200
No.

165
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,640
Don't worry about this.

166
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:09,239
It's just a small gift.

167
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,760
The lady boss is so generous.

168
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,719
Worry not, if you argue with our boss,

169
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,400
we'll take your side.

170
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:16,679
Mr. Jiang.

171
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,760
Mr. Jiang.

172
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,960
What are you guys doing?

173
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,440
Lu prepared some
Mid-Autumn Festival gifts for us.

174
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:24,239
Let's not show off.

175
00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:26,039
Mr. Jiang must have received
his gift already.

176
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,159
Mr. Jiang.

177
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,039
Does your gift look as good as mine?

178
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:30,760
Do you not have work to do?

179
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,719
Do your work.

180
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,840
Mr. Jiang.

181
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:43,479
I would like to take leave.

182
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:46,880
Mr. Chen is not here
so I have to come to you.

183
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:48,840
Why?

184
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:50,080
Some personal issues.

185
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,440
Is there anything else?

186
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,640
No.

187
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,799
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

188
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,799
What's the result?

189
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,840
As expected, first prize.

190
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:19,080
Lu Li will be over the mood
once she knows about it.

191
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,159
Don't tell her.

192
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:21,479
I'll do it myself.

193
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:23,000
Are you guys cool now?

194
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:24,640
Of course!

195
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,119
But she's been acting weird

196
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,200
these two days.

197
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,559
It must be due to the shock, I suppose.

198
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,239
Then, you should

199
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,719
explain to her why you took her

200
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,840
out of Xuan Zhong Ji.

201
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,119
Cheer her up a bit.

202
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,799
Worry about your Jiang Zitong.

203
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,119
I have my own plan.

204
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:49,520
Li.

205
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,280
How are your parents?

206
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,559
They are good.

207
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,239
When you head back next time,

208
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,719
bring Yicheng with you.

209
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,119
Make him spend more time with them

210
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,520
to improve their bond.

211
00:12:03,719 --> 00:12:04,479
Mother-in-law.

212
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,919
Done.

213
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:11,280
Li, you are very artistic.

214
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,440
You created a masterpiece
after a few tries.

215
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:16,960
You'll overtake me soon.

216
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,960
Mother-in-law.

217
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:22,719
I might let you down.

218
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:25,440
Thank you for looking after me.

219
00:12:25,719 --> 00:12:27,880
No need to be this formal with me.

220
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,719
Seeing you two happily together

221
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,960
is the greatest gift
I could ever ask for.

222
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,359
Now, hurry up

223
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:38,159
and give me a grandchild.

224
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:41,400
I'll be even happier.

225
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:43,840
Mother-in-law.

226
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,200
How would you name your grandchild?

227
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:48,719
Naming is a serious matter.

228
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:50,559
Let me think.

229
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,039
Oh, we have a book about names.

230
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:55,039
Let me take it out

231
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:56,679
and we'll discuss it together.

232
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:36,599
You're back.

233
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:39,239
I made dinner. Let's eat together.

234
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,640
You prepared prawns.

235
00:13:47,479 --> 00:13:49,239
Aren't you allergic to seafood?

236
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:50,559
But you love them.

237
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,799
Try some.

238
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,320
You've been promoted from
Bronze tier to Diamond tier.

239
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:07,760
I'm glad to hear that.

240
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,479
Finally, I did something right.

241
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,400
So did you learn to cook this for me?

242
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:18,640
Yes.

243
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:23,799
(When we first got married,)

244
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:25,640
(it was a bit rocky.)

245
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:28,359
(I wanted to be close to you)

246
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:32,200
(so I tried to make something
that you like.)

247
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,719
(I thought cooking your favorite dish)

248
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,640
(would pull us closer.)

249
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:43,799
There are many ways to impress someone

250
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:46,039
but you picked the most challenging one.

251
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:47,679
This is not dedication.

252
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,000
It's foolhardiness.

253
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:03,520
Yes, I am a fool.

254
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:08,039
Things shouldn't be like this
from the get-go.

255
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:10,760
You like seafood

256
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,400
but I'm allergic to them.

257
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:15,239
We're not on the same wavelength.

258
00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:17,960
This is the hard, cold truth

259
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,159
that I can never change
no matter how hard I try.

260
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:24,760
If you're allergic to them,
then don't prepare this dish.

261
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:27,000
I can always eat prawns somewhere.

262
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,679
Also, you're not a chef.

263
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,080
You're a programmer.

264
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,080
Indeed.

265
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,679
No need to console me.

266
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,880
I know I've caused you a few troubles
in the office too.

267
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:40,200
No, you did not.

268
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:44,239
By the way,

269
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:46,599
A Hundred Ways to Kill A Boss

270
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,200
got the first prize.

271
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:51,320
Not only will you be reinstated
into Xuan Zhong Ji,

272
00:15:51,479 --> 00:15:53,359
but you'll also be the Lead Programmer too.

273
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:56,840
That's great.

274
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,640
Our effort was not in vain.

275
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:04,559
Why do you react like this?

276
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,599
Aren't you supposed to be over the moon?

277
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,119
The person who I used to be
would be over the moon.

278
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,559
But now, it doesn't matter anymore.

279
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,840
Why?

280
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,599
Because I'm resigning.

281
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:29,239
Is this a joke?

282
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:34,080
Didn't you marry me

283
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,679
to keep your job?

284
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:43,799
Let's get a divorce.

285
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:51,560
Sorry

286
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,040
to bother you this late.

287
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,680
You couldn't even grab your dinner.

288
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,000
It's okay. I want to visit you anyway.

289
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,280
How are you feeling?

290
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,719
All is well.

291
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,319
That's good.

292
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:05,280
For you.

293
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,599
Just a small gift.

294
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,000
This is...

295
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,800
You weren't in the office during the day

296
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:12,079
and I can only give it to you now.

297
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,520
I love it.

298
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,959
But a gift is usually a reward.

299
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,680
Why do you reward me out of a sudden?

300
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:24,119
I just want to thank you.

301
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:25,880
You've been looking after me

302
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,479
ever since I started working here.

303
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:29,079
I don't understand why

304
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,880
you care so much about me either.

305
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:33,040
At first, it was just

306
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:35,520
for vanity purposes,
an idol looking after

307
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,719
his fans.

308
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:39,119
But in the end, you got me fooled.

309
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:42,640
So you are actually a fake fan of mine.

310
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,119
I'm sorry.

311
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,439
It's just a joke.

312
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:49,280
Yes, it was just
looking after my fan at first.

313
00:18:49,439 --> 00:18:51,640
But then, I slowly noticed that

314
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,160
you're smart, optimistic, kind,

315
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,359
and passionate about programming.

316
00:18:58,199 --> 00:18:58,920
Whenever I see you,

317
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:01,400
it reminds me of
when I just started out.

318
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,079
Your biggest selling point
is your commitment.

319
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,520
You're committed

320
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,079
to things and humans alike.

321
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,839
I envy you in this regard.

322
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:12,119
But

323
00:19:13,479 --> 00:19:15,119
when it comes to a relationship,

324
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,359
only a mutual commitment

325
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,839
can lead to love.

326
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,319
A one-sided commitment

327
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,280
is just a recipe for disaster.

328
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,839
Why are you so sentimental
out of a sudden?

329
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,439
I'm not sentimental.

330
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,839
It's just what I've learned so far.

331
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,880
Is Yicheng back home?

332
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:45,319
Boss won an award.

333
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,079
It's supposed to be good news.

334
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:48,959
Why do you look so down?

335
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:51,040
Did you two fight again?

336
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,520
Should I ask him to come here?

337
00:19:53,239 --> 00:19:54,239
No need.

338
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,920
We didn't fight.

339
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:57,599
We're just different.

340
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,680
Yicheng is smart when it comes to work

341
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:04,680
but he's like a child
when it comes to love.

342
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,160
If something happens between you two,

343
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,640
you should find a time

344
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,520
and communicate with him.

345
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:13,079
All right.

346
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,160
Order something.

347
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:15,479
You must be starving.

348
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,280
I'll order then.

349
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:54,000
Is that gift for Chen Yiming?

350
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,280
What?

351
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,239
I saw you enter his car.

352
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:06,000
Is that why you want a divorce?

353
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,280
If you really like him that much,

354
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,920
why did you come to me
with the compatibility chart

355
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:17,560
and say you want to

356
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,800
marry me?

357
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,959
You just want to toy

358
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:22,839
with our feelings.

359
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:30,520
Is this the conclusion you came up with
after thinking everything through?

360
00:21:30,719 --> 00:21:32,680
Because I can't find any other reasons!

361
00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:38,000
I didn't want to explain

362
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:39,880
but Mr. Chen is a kind soul.

363
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:41,000
I don't want you two

364
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:42,520
to fight because of me.

365
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:44,760
I'll say this the last time.

366
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:48,680
He and I are just friends.

367
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:49,719
That's all.

368
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:51,239
Then why are you asking for a divorce?

369
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,760
I have my own reasons.

370
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,079
What reasons?

371
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:56,479
Tell me.

372
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,359
There's no point.

373
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,719
Half past two tomorrow afternoon.

374
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:05,119
Meet at the Civil Affairs Bureau.

375
00:22:05,439 --> 00:22:06,640
Bring your household register,

376
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,439
marriage license, ID card,
and two passport photos.

377
00:22:09,959 --> 00:22:12,319
I have already prepped
the other documents for you.

378
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,000
If you have no other problems,

379
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,160
we'll get a divorce tomorrow.

380
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,640
I don't agree.

381
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,680
Why?

382
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,040
The contract we signed is for a year.

383
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,000
It's not one year yet.

384
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,520
You'll divorce me anyway.

385
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,680
Let's not waste each other's time.

Oh my god.

458
00:26:45,239 --> 00:26:46,920
Did I screw this up?

459
00:26:47,199 --> 00:26:48,760
Was I supposed to tell him earlier?

460
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:51,040
Perhaps I shouldn't have said anything!

461
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:53,400
Oh no.

462
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,920
Will Mr. Jiang hold grudges against me?

463
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:57,800
Are there no more promotions or pay rises?

464
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,560

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,079
(The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable.)

529
00:30:36,147 --> 00:30:39,060
(Sorry, the subscriber you dialed...)

530
00:30:51,239 --> 00:30:52,319
Did Lu Li come back here?

531
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,079
No.

532
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:53,800
But when she left,

533
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:55,280
she went to your office and...

534
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:02,239
Game over.

535
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,319
Do you have other solutions?

536
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,119
This question is out of our scope.

537
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:06,880
I can't answer.

538
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,239
If the game is over,

539
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:10,239
you restart the game.

540
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:33,300
(Divorce Settlement.
Husband: Jiang Yicheng. Wife: Lu Li)

00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,180
(Resignation Letter)

542
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:03,800
Mother-in-law.

543
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,880
Who is your mother-in-law?

544
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,319
I'm Jiang Yicheng.

545
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,920
Oh, Yicheng!

546
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:12,439
I was telling your father-in-law that

547
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,479
I'd bring you guys some food tomorrow.

548
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,160
Thanks.

549
00:32:17,439 --> 00:32:18,560
You're welcome.

550
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,800
Did Lu Li go back?

551
00:32:23,479 --> 00:32:25,040
Did she say she's coming home?

552
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,160
She didn't tell me.

553
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,479
But you two should come and visit.

554
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,680
You guys have been married

555
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,439
for a long time but we never see
the both of you together.

556
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,880
My neighbors are saying why

557
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:36,640
they have never seen my son-in-law.

558
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,760
Mother-in-law.

559
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:43,000
I'll visit you guys
once I'm done with my work.

560
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,640
Sure.

561
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,439
Anything else?

562
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,079
That's all.

563
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,439
All right then.

564
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,239
I'll hang up now.

565
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,920
I'm waiting for you two.

566
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,247
(Jiang Yicheng)

567
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,760
Is Lu Li with you?

568
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,640
Playboy!

569
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,300
(Block)

570
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:32,319
Are you still feeling nauseated, Li?

571
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,439
Have some fruit juice.

572
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:35,000
I'm much better now.

573
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:39,280
You sure you don't want to
tell Jiang Yicheng

574
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,920
that you're pregnant?

575
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,119
If I tell him,

576
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,160
he won't agree to the divorce.

577
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:52,719
He's a very responsible man.

578
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,160
He will stay in this marriage

579
00:33:55,439 --> 00:33:57,760
if he knows he is a father.

580
00:33:58,199 --> 00:34:00,520
You're still defending him.

581
00:34:02,719 --> 00:34:04,280
No, I'm not.

582
00:34:05,239 --> 00:34:07,920
Unrequited love is a lonely path.

583
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:11,280
Just because he won't walk with me

584
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:16,600
doesn't mean I can
demonize his good character.

585
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,600
Since you're expectant,

586
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:19,919
I shall not argue with you.

587
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,120
However, I reserve the right

588
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,879
to disagree.

589
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,159
Li,

590
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,399
are you sure you want to keep the baby?

591
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:29,919
You're still young.

592
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,360
You have an exciting life ahead of you.

593
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:38,959
Didn't they say that
every child is an angel

594
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,000
who picks his own parents?

595
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,560
Since he has chosen me,

596
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,600
I should take good care of him.

597
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,760
You also know that

598
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:51,399
I like kids, don't you?

599
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:54,040
Fine.

600
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,199
Having a baby early
means you'll recover earlier too.

601
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,560
Jiang Yicheng has good genes.

602
00:35:00,439 --> 00:35:02,800
Did you tell your parents?

603
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,959
I plan to tell them that we're divorced.

604
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,719
As for the pregnancy,

605
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:11,479
maybe later.

606
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:12,639
But you can't hide it

607
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,120
one way or another.

608
00:35:14,439 --> 00:35:16,040
I'm looking for jobs now.

609
00:35:16,399 --> 00:35:19,040
I want to move to Chongqing.

610
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,840
Chongqing?

611
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:22,320
No way!

612
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,040
You can't

613
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,080
move to somewhere so far alone.

614
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:25,239
I don't like your decision.

615
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,840
Our transport system
is so well-developed.

616
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,120
You can go anywhere in China
within a day.

617
00:35:31,399 --> 00:35:33,879
You can visit me whenever you miss me.

618
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:35,479
Li.

619
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:37,159
I know you need a change of environment,

620
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:38,600
and a change of moods.

621
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,760
But why did you choose
Chongqing of all places?

622
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:45,280
I traveled to Chongqing once
when I was studying at the university.

623
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,719
The people there were very nice.

624
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,719
There were tons of good food too.

625
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:51,719
It's a good place to live.

626
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,320
But you can't possibly
order takeouts every day.

627
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,879
I know how to cook now.

628
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,800
I can take care of myself.

629
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:00,760
Honestly,

630
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:02,719
as long as your feelings
are not involved,

631
00:36:02,879 --> 00:36:05,080
you are quite the planner.

632
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,239
So it's set in stone then.
No turning back?

633
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:15,760
I used to think you're just stubborn.

634
00:36:15,959 --> 00:36:18,639
Now, I feel like I'm talking to a wall.

635
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,760
When will you leave?

636
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,080
I've already bought the plane ticket
for the day after tomorrow.

637
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,639
What did I do to deserve this?

638
00:36:32,479 --> 00:36:33,360
I'll cook.

639
00:36:33,479 --> 00:36:34,879
You can only leave after dinner.

640
00:36:38,479 --> 00:36:39,320
Thank you,

641
00:36:39,479 --> 00:36:40,159
Xiaoqi.

642
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,399
Don't thank me.

643
00:36:41,479 --> 00:36:42,919
I'm still mad.

644
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:44,360
I'm doing this for my future

645
00:36:44,439 --> 00:36:45,959
goddaughter.

646
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,439
No.

647
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:48,840
Godson.

648
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:35,020
(You get blocked)
(Little Qi. Is Lu Li with you?)

649
00:37:39,919 --> 00:37:40,639
Hi, mister.

650
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,320
I'm Gu Xiaoqi from WeiBo.

651
00:37:42,439 --> 00:37:43,439
You're already here anyway.

652
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,560
Why not come in
and have a cup of milk tea?

653
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,280
Do you two live together?

654
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:54,560
Yicheng,

655
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:55,919
I heard Lu Li resigned.

656
00:37:55,919 --> 00:37:56,199
I...

657
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,199
I'll wait for you here.

658
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:19,427
(Divorce Settlement)

659
00:38:19,479 --> 00:38:19,879
This is...

660
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,780
(Wife's Thumbprint)

661
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:44,320
Yiming, are you aware that

662
00:38:44,439 --> 00:38:46,399
Yicheng and Lu Li are divorced?

663
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:52,040
Did you not know as well?

664
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,000
They divorced so suddenly.

665
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,360
It must be my brother's infidelity.

666
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,719
I already told him

667
00:38:55,879 --> 00:38:57,159
to stay away from Li Man.

668
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,679
But he's...

669
00:38:58,959 --> 00:39:00,399
Divorced?

670
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:02,560
When did they get married?

671
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,440
Hi.

672
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,439
What did you do that day?

673
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,800
Why did Yicheng and Lu Li get a divorce?

674
00:39:34,959 --> 00:39:36,879
Are you aware of this?

675
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,959
Whatever I did

676
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,159
will never implicate you.

677
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:42,280
Don't worry.

678
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:58,159
Everything

679
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,320
will be back to where it used to.

680
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:05,320
Oh no.

681
00:40:05,479 --> 00:40:06,120
I messed up.

682
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,919
Everyone will know now.

683
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:11,719
Did they really get a divorce?

684
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,959
Why would I joke
with this kind of thing?

685
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:17,479
I saw their divorce settlement
with my own eyes.

686
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,639
Lu Li already signed.

687
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,040
When it comes to a relationship,

688
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,320
only a mutual commitment

689
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:26,959
can lead to love.

690
00:40:27,919 --> 00:40:29,239
A one-sided commitment

691
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,120
is just a recipe for disaster.

692
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,439
So that's what she meant.

693
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,360
What?

694
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,560
Yiming, can you contact

695
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:40,320
my brother or Lu Li?

696
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:56,840
(Hi.)

697
00:40:57,199 --> 00:40:59,239
(The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable.)

698
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,080
Anything?

699
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,719
What should we do?

700
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,919
How am I supposed to explain to my mom?

701
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,719
Yiming,

702
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,040
is it possible

703
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,760
to salvage their marriage before

704
00:41:16,919 --> 00:41:18,439
my mom knows about this?

705
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:20,320
Lu Li is someone headstrong.

706
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,919
Once she has made up her mind,

707
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:23,439
she won't change it easily.

708
00:41:27,879 --> 00:41:29,679
Why do you know her so well?

709
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,560
I'm warning you.

710
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,919
Even if she's divorced,

711
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,040
you cannot have feelings towards her.

712
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,719
She is forever my sister-in-law.

713
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,239
What are you on about?

714
00:41:38,439 --> 00:41:40,439
Instead of being paranoid about this,

715
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:42,840
why don't you come up with
an explanation for your family?

716
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,000
Oh lord.

717
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,280
Why should a young damsel

718
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,719
like me worry about
the marriage of her brother?

719
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,679
Life is tough.

720
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,120
Life is so tough.

721
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:08,760
Are you leaving now?

722
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,520
Take good care of yourself.

723
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,520
I will do.

724
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:14,239
And you.

725
00:42:14,439 --> 00:42:15,719
Remember to eat on time.

726
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,000
All right. Get in the car.

727
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:26,679
Bye.

728
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,919
Bye.

729
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,560
Is anyone here?

730
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,120
Excuse me?

731
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,120
Excuse me?

732
00:43:00,879 --> 00:43:01,840
Why are you here?

733
00:43:01,919 --> 00:43:02,919
Where's Lu Li?

734
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:05,040
You two are divorced. Leave now!

735
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,639
We're not divorced yet.

736
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,719
How can you speak in such
a self-righteous tone?

737
00:43:09,919 --> 00:43:11,719
My first impression of you is right.

738
00:43:11,959 --> 00:43:12,919
You're just a playboy.

739
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:13,760
Miss Gu.

740
00:43:13,959 --> 00:43:15,320
I think you misjudged me.

741
00:43:15,479 --> 00:43:16,760
My lapse of judgment

742
00:43:16,919 --> 00:43:18,080
is believing Lu Li when she said

743
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:19,800
you were the best man in the world.

744
00:43:20,399 --> 00:43:21,320
Why did she ask for a divorce then?

745
00:43:21,439 --> 00:43:22,360
Because...

746
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:25,399
I can't tell you.

747
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,600
You know what?

748
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,439
If you don't leave now,

749
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,879
I'll publicize this scandal online.

750
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,439
This time, I won't delete the video.

751
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,879
Are you not leaving?

752
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,520
Fine. I'll call the police.

753
00:43:36,959 --> 00:43:38,000
Lu Li!

754
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,080
What are you doing?

755
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:40,080
You pervert!

756
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:40,800
She's not here.

757
00:43:40,879 --> 00:43:41,439
Where is she?

758
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,600
None of your business.

759
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,520
Won't you leave?

760
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,360
Okay.

761
00:43:44,439 --> 00:43:44,840
Tell me where...

762
00:43:44,919 --> 00:43:45,800
Leave now.

763
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,879
Leave!

764
00:43:48,919 --> 00:43:49,600

765
00:43:49,879 --> 00:43:51,520
