00:01:53,559 --> 00:01:54,879
So, were you fooling me?

23
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,120
I just wanted to help you revise

24
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,040
our cohabitation rules.

25
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,239
I want to see if you remember them.

26
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,040
Didn't you come to my room

27
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:02,040
and send me medicine
when I had an allergy last time?

28
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,360
You actually knew about that?

29
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,959
We're even now.

30
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,360
Make way for me.

31
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,000
The company has decided

32
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,479
to reconcile with Old Ape.

33
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,080
Really?

34
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:31,600
Why did you change your mind suddenly?

35
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,880
If I didn't do so,

36
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:36,080
I'm afraid someone would keep
abusing me emotionally.

37
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,639
Thank you.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,600
What's with that expression?

39
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,279
I thought this was the result
you wished for.

40
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,199
I'm just worried about Old Ape.

41
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,880
He has lost his job.

42
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,559
It'll be hard on his family's economy.

43
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,039
Old Ape is a grown man.

44
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:56,320
You don't need to worry about him.

45
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,160
Today is Mid-Autumn Festival.

46
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,399
Change your clothes.

47
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,800
Let's go out.

48
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,279
Hurry up.

49
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,720
Hey, are you done?

50
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,080
Why are you still inside?

51
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,160
Do you think your outfit
is too hideous for you?

52
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,639
Are you afraid that
I might tease you for it?

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,800
What's wrong?

54
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,720
Why are you putting your hand behind?

55
00:03:42,559 --> 00:03:43,479
My zip.

56
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:34,519
Done.

57
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,480
Do I look okay?

58
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,399
I do have great taste indeed.

59
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,040
You don't need to try the others.

60
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:49,119
Just take them all.

61
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,239
No need.

62
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,119
I don't wear
these kinds of outfits often.

63
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,359
You shouldn't waste your money.

64
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,679
Just one is enough for me.

65
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,640
If you think it's a waste of my money,

66
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,040
you should buy more of
your favourite outfits.

67
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,119
This shirt is an exclusive
couple t-shirt from our shop.

68
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:20,399
You guys may try it on

69
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,600
if you like them.

70
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:23,200
Can you sell them separately?

71
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,600
We can't do so.

72
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,160
It has a special design on it.

73
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,359
The love pattern on the t-shirt

74
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,239
will glow red

75
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:30,320
when the surrounding temperature
reaches 35°C.

76
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:32,519
So, we can't sell them separately.

77
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,000
Forget it then.

78
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,480
Go and try it on.

79
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,279
See if it does glow red.

80
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:42,720
I'll try it on then.

81
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,880
Why are you...

82
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:04,000
I was just curious.

83
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,239
Why is yours red?

84
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:13,040
I guess my body temperature
isn't high enough.

Yicheng,

120
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,119
a foreign investor I knew

121
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:49,239
will be staying here for one night.

122
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:51,000
I wish to introduce him to you.

123
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,160
Are you free now?

124
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:52,920
Sure.

125
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,440
Lu Li and I are outside right now.

126
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,239
Are you going to bring Lu Li with you?

127
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,799
Of course. Is there a problem?

128
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:03,720
Andrew is someone
who values his privacy.

129
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,279
And, this is an official matter.

130
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,359
I think he won't like it

131
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,239
when there are other people around.

132
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,160
Besides,

133
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:11,839
with Andrew around,

134
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,040
it doesn't count as a private meeting
between us, right?

135
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,640
(I guess)

136
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,200
(it doesn't count when
there are other people around.)

137
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,440
All right, send me his address.

138
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:20,600
All right.

139
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:21,880
I'll wait for you.

140
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,559
I need to meet an investor later.

141
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:32,880
I'll wait for your cab
together with you.

142
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,400
Let me join you.

143
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:35,799
No need.

144
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,880
You should accompany Dad and Mum.

145
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,239
I'll return before dinner.

146
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:48,239
Goodbye.

147
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:02,719
Mister, please follow the car
in front of us.

148
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,799
All right.

149
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,239
Yicheng, you're finally here.

150
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,719
Andrew is waiting for us inside.

151
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,239
Let's go.

152
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:22,760
All right.

153
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:47,960
Hello,

154
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:49,159
can you check which room

155
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,919
belongs to Mr. Jiang Yicheng?

156
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,280
I'm his friend.

157
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,239
Sorry, miss.

158
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,400
We can't leak our customers'
personal information.

159
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,599
Can you lend me a pen
and a piece of paper?

160
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,020
(Jiang Yicheng,
you better return early!)

161
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,200
Please pass this note to him.

162
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,599
All right, just a moment.

163
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,880
Let me check.

164
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:22,679
Mr. Jiang Yicheng hasn't
booked any room here.

165
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,159
Is that so? Can you check if
Li Man has booked a room here?

166
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,280
Li as in Paris,

167
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,119
Man as in comic.

168
00:10:29,239 --> 00:10:29,520
All right.

169
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,359
Please wait a moment.

170
00:10:32,239 --> 00:10:34,679
I can pass this note
to Miss Li Man for you.

171
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,159
No need.

172
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:37,919
Thanks.

173
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,119
You're here.

174
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,239
Surprise.

175
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,239
You have no way to hide now.

176
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,080
Why are you here?

177
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,479
Of course I'm here to celebrate
Mid-Autumn Festival with you.

178
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:15,280
I thought you were supposed to accompany
Uncle and Aunt at home?

179
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:17,400
My brother and sister-in-law
will accompany them.

180
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,719
But you have no one to accompany you.

181
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,840
That's why I'm here.

182
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,799
Guess what I had prepared for you?

183
00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:27,280
Mooncake?

184
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:29,320
Be more specific.

185
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,640
A very expensive mooncake.

186
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,400
You're wrong.

187
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,400
These are mooncakes I made personally.

188
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:39,599
Come and try them.

189
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,000
Did you make them?

190
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:46,080
Of course.

191
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,359
I spend the entire morning learning how
to make this from an expert.

192
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:49,719
Hurry and try it.

193
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,359
What do you think?

194
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,559
Is it nice?

195
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,599
It's not bad.

196
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,700
(Hsufuchi Foods)

197
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:05,280
Don't tell me you bought the entire shop

198
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,919
just because you wanted to learn
how to make mooncakes?

199
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,840
I guess I was too careless.

200
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,599
I forgot that their mooncakes
were imprinted with their logo.

201
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:16,080
But I never trusted you
in the first place.

202
00:12:16,359 --> 00:12:17,880
You don't even know
how to cook instant noodles,

203
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:19,239
not to mention making mooncakes.

204
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,479
Wait.

205
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:22,080
You can doubt my capability,

206
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:23,919
but you mustn't doubt my heart.

207
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:25,679
Although I don't know how to make them,

208
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,159
I can learn.

209
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,559
Buying them does
show your appreciation for me as well.

210
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,919
You don't necessarily
need to make them yourself.

211
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,400
I did make them.

212
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,359
It's just that they were too delicious.

213
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:37,000
I ate all of them.

214
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:39,400
What do you want to drink?

215
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,599
Maybe some soda water.

216
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,479
Wait!

217
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,679
What is this?

218
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:00,919
It's nothing.

219
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,719
What happened to your hand?

220
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,919
I scalded my hand
when I tried to make mooncakes.

221
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,640
You shouldn't overexert yourself
when you don't know how to make it.

222
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,239
It's the same if you buy them.

223
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,080
How could they be the same?

224
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:19,479
Isn't it more touching for you

225
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:20,679
to eat the mooncakes I made personally?

226
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,640
Let me see.

227
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,359
Have you treated your wound?

228
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,479
Not yet.

229
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,440
Come with me.

230
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:34,799
I'll get the medkit.

231
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,719
It might sting a little.

232
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,159
Does it hurt?

233
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,599
It won't hurt as long as you blow on it.

234
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,559
There are some residues of melanin
on your wound.

235
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:32,640
It'll turn black after some time.

236
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,119
But I think it'll disappear

237
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,520
once your wound heals.

238
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,440
Anyway, if it leaves a scar behind,

239
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:41,280
you need to be responsible for it.

240
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:47,919
Hold it.

241
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,679
Thank you for your mooncake.

242
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:02,679
Although it's slightly burnt,

243
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:04,320
the taste is not bad.

244
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,239
I'll try it later.

245
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,760
Yiming.

246
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,559
Can you tie a bow tie on it for me?

247
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,359
Hurry.

248
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,840
Tie a bow tie on it.

249
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,799
Don't you think
your outfit is too casual?

250
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:52,679
Lu Li chose it for me.

251
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,080
It's a couple t-shirt.

252
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,479
Only a little girl would do that.

253
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,320
Over here.

254
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:30,440
You must be anxious to get home.

255
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,719
I didn't expect

256
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,520
you two to chat for over two hours.

257
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:35,559
Seems like Andrew likes you.

258
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,599
Thanks.

259
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,080
If he does agree to our deal,

260
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:39,320
you'll be the number one contributor.

261
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,880
If you really want to thank me,

262
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,239
you should treat me to a meal.

263
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:44,119
Today is Mid-Autumn Festival.

264
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:45,440
I need to have a meal with my family.

265
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,760
Yeah.

266
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,320
Today was supposed to be a great day
for a family reunion.

267
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,159
It's a pity that I don't have
a family like yours.

268
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,239
Lu Li and I will treat you
to a meal next time.

269
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:02,520
I'll remember that.

270
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,839
You owe me a meal, all right?

271
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,839
Today is Mid-Autumn Festival.

272
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,119
Dear mums and dads, I wish you guys
a happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

273
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,880
I hope our family can stay united.

274
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,920
Cheers.

275
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,839
Cheers.

276
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,400
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

277
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,079
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

278
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,959
Thank you, Xiaoqi.

279
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,959
Mo.

280
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,000
All right, let's begin.

281
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,400
Xiaoqi, dig in.

282
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:30,800
All right.

283
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,160
Mo, dig in.

284
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,199
Godmother.

285
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:38,520
I love this dish.

286
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,959
Xiaoqi, did you
bully your brother again?

287
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:43,319
How am I bullying him?

288
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,079
Is it wrong for me to skip meat?

289
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,079
What's wrong with you two?

290
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,839
I made her angry.

291
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:51,040
I haven't managed to coax her yet.

292
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,520
I knew it was your fault.

293
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,959
Listen, your only task today

294
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,400
is to coax your little sister.

295
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,359
Everything's fine.

296
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,280
Dad,

297
00:17:58,439 --> 00:17:59,599
I don't know what to do either.

298
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,280
Why don't you

299
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,680
ask her for me?

300
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:02,640
This...

301
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:06,040
Xiaoqi,

302
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,359
you guys should do me a favour

303
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,439
and talk it through, all right?

304
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,719
Godfather,

305
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,199
please tell him

306
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:14,719
that I will never do so.

307
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,479
You guys spoil her too much.

308
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,599
She's completely spoiled.

309
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,760
You're right.

310
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:21,920
Our Mo is silent
and keeps everything to himself.

311
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,439
He has never tried
to coax a girl before.

312
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:24,640
I'm worried

313
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,079
that he can't get a wife in the future.

314
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,599
It's time for you to get a girlfriend.

315
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:31,079
Godmother, I have someone I like.

316
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,760
Since when?

317
00:18:34,959 --> 00:18:36,359
What kind of girl is she?

318
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,599
She's innocent and pure.

319
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,839
She's very beautiful as well.

320
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,880
She has a great family background.

321
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,040
She graduated from an elite school.

322
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,760
Anyway, in my eyes,

323
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,079
she's good in every aspect.

324
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,040
This is my first time

325
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,520
hearing my son praise a girl like that.

326
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,760
Seems like she's quite a good girl.

327
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:53,680
Mo won't be wrong with his taste.

328
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,880
Xiaoqi,

329
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:57,920
your brother has a target now.

330
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,160
You need to catch up with his pace.

331
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:00,719
No way.

332
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,079
Plenty of people are courting me.

333
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,000
Where are they?

334
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:06,040
Over here.

335
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,119
They're all over the place.

336
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:08,119
"They're all over the place."

337
00:19:08,199 --> 00:19:08,640
Come.

338
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,760
Tell me.

339
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:12,359
Xiaoqi, what kind of man do you like?

340
00:19:13,479 --> 00:19:15,239
Of course I like men who appear
immediately when I summon them.

341
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,479
I like men who reply
to messages instantly.

342
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,560
He must be humorous,

343
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,800
kind and thoughtful.

344
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:19,359
It's the best

345
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,119
if he can take care of Momo as well.

346
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,439
The most important thing

347
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:23,760
is that he must be handsome.

348
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:27,719
Godmother,

349
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,719
you are planning
to buy mooncakes, right?

350
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:30,719
I'll buy them on your behalf.

351
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:32,000
Sure.

352
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:32,839
Xiaoqi,

353
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:34,479
you should join your brother later.

354
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,680
No, I won't.

355
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,920
Can you bear to let him
do the task alone?

356
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,920
I can't bear for him to do so.

357
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,239
Godmother.

358
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,160
Come.

359
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,040
Let's have a toast.

360
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:49,319
Cheers.

361
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,040
Thank you.

362
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:57,119
Put them on the same bill.

363
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,599
Separate them.

364
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,439
Mister, what about your items?

365
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:06,280
Hurry.

366
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,520
Hello.

367
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,760
Excuse me, how much is this?

368
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,920
This costs 150 yuan.

369
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,280
One hundred and fifty yuan?

370
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,359
Is it that expensive?

371
00:20:34,479 --> 00:20:35,880
I think 15 yuan is
more appropriate for this.

372
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:36,719
Lady,

373
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,280
our shop only sells products
that are imported from Korea.

374
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:40,920
Can you lower the price?

375
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,199
How about 50 yuan?

376
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:45,640
I'll take it.

377
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:46,880
All right.

378
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,199
I'll wrap it up for you.

379
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,839
Listen,

380
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,719
I'm not the little girl I was anymore.

381
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:55,839
You won't be able to coax me
with a hair clip.

382
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:57,520
Who said I was buying it for you?

383
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,760
I'm buying it for my girlfriend.

384
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:16,680
Mum.

385
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,800
Where's Lu Li?

386
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:19,400
She didn't come back.

387
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,520
I thought you two went out
to buy things together.

388
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,359
I had something to do

389
00:21:22,479 --> 00:21:23,479
and I told her to return first.

390
00:21:29,239 --> 00:21:29,839
What is she doing?

391
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,040
She's not answering her phone.

392
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,000
My son,

393
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,880
did you make
my daughter-in-law angry again?

394
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:36,800
I didn't.

395
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,000
We were doing so well.

396
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:39,400
I'll look for her.

397
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,000
Where did you go?

398
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:46,439
You didn't return home

399
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,439
and you didn't answer your phone.

400
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:50,040
I couldn't do so as
I was carrying too much stuff.

401
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,640
Mum, I'm back.

402
00:21:55,719 --> 00:21:57,280
I thought she was in a good mood
this morning.

403
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,719
Women are strange indeed.

404
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,839
They're more fickle than the weather.

405
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:02,119
They're harder to read
than complex codes.

406
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,280
Are you two wearing couple t-shirts?

407
00:22:15,439 --> 00:22:17,199
Li, did you buy it?

408
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,880
No.

409
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,920
Do you need to give us
such a big reaction?

410
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,560
It's just a new t-shirt.

411
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,199
Before this, you told me that
wearing couple t-shirts

412
00:22:25,479 --> 00:22:28,400
was the lowliest way
to show off your relationship.

413
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:29,680
So, you...

414
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,760
That's not it.

415
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:31,239
Mum,

416
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:32,199
you don't understand.

417
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,359
This is

418
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:34,719
a piece of new technology.

419
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,160
Its colour will change

420
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:37,599
when it reaches a certain temperature.

421
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:39,400
Is that so?

422
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,239
Youngsters do know
how to have fun indeed.

423
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,479
Hubby,

424
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,839
let's buy the same
couple t-shirts as well.

425
00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:49,239
Do you know how old we are?

426
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,560
It's inappropriate for us
to wear t-shirts like that.

427
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,680
But I feel like wearing it.

428
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,239
All right.

429
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:56,560
You can wear them all you like.

430
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,800
I'll buy them for you.

431
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,880
Let's wear the couple t-shirts together

432
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,479
after I buy them, okay?

433
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,880
Hurry and buy them for us.

434
00:23:03,199 --> 00:23:04,839
I'm back.

435
00:23:05,439 --> 00:23:06,000
Tong,

436
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,599
why are you late today?

437
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:09,199
I went to make some mooncakes.

438
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:12,040
Did you scald your hand?

439
00:23:12,199 --> 00:23:13,199
I'm fine.

440
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,199
Look, I'm so lucky that
I scalded my hand.

441
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,160
Enough already.

442
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,920
I guess you had your fill, right?

443
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:22,640
Go upstairs then.

444
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,079
We don't have enough dishes here.

445
00:23:29,719 --> 00:23:31,520
Mum, forget about her. Let's continue.

446
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:35,959
The pain must've shocked her.

447
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,680
Why do you look distracted?

448
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:50,000
Yicheng,

449
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:54,839
were you contacting
the investors lately?

450
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:55,680
Dad,

451
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,760
I guess you have too much free time
on your hands.

452
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,000
Where did you get the time
to meddle with my affair?

453
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,880
I'm the number one shareholder
of the company.

454
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,920
What's wrong with me

455
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:04,199
being concerned about my own company?

456
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,000
You should retire

457
00:24:06,199 --> 00:24:07,680
once I find a new investor
to replace you.

458
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,560
Enough.

459
00:24:08,719 --> 00:24:10,880
No one should discuss official matters
when they're at home.

460
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:11,479
Li,

461
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,359
come.

462
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Eat up.

463
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,959
Maybe you two will have some
good news for us soon.

464
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,280
Thank you, Mum.

465
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:19,640
What good news?

466
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:21,079
What about a baby?

467
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,000
Both of us are busy.

468
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,359
We're not in a hurry to get a child.

469
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,719
Being busy isn't an excuse.

470
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,319
If you guys are too tired
to take care of your child,

471
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,719
I can take care of them for you.

472
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,439
Lu Li is still young.

473
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,760
There's no need to rush.

474
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:35,520
Yeah. He's right.

475
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,239
Men should put their careers
as their priority.

476
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,040
But

477
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:46,079
you can take care of your career

478
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:48,239
and your family at the same time.

479
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:49,479
Both of them are equally important.

480
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,760
Understood?

481
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,800
It's rare for all of us
to gather here today.

482
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,880
How about this?

483
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,520
You two should stay here tonight.

484
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,359
Mum, I think we should...

485
00:25:01,479 --> 00:25:02,160
Sure.

486
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:21,839
Why did you say yes?

487
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,199
I didn't want my mother to nag me.

488
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:25,280
She'll say that she has
a headache and so on.

489
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:26,400
She's a nuisance.

490
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,520
What are you doing?

491
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,599
I'm sleeping on the floor.

492
00:26:02,239 --> 00:26:03,319
This isn't the first time
we're sleeping together.

493
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:04,760
Why are you doing this?

494
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,640
I can't sleep beside you.

495
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,280
You can't sleep beside me?

496
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:10,760
I haven't complained about you
for stealing my blanket.

497
00:26:11,479 --> 00:26:12,520
I'll sleep now.

498
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,160
Something's wrong with you today.

499
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:24,000
Don't you want to tell me?

500
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,239
You won't get to sleep
if you don't tell me.

501
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:33,640
Did you go and see Li Man

502
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,800
this afternoon?

503
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,800
I did.

504
00:26:37,719 --> 00:26:38,920
You finally admitted it.

505
00:26:39,719 --> 00:26:41,000
How did you know?

506
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:42,640
That's not the point.

507
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,000
There's really nothing between us.

508
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,040
I'll be honest with you.

509
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:47,760
Li Man and I...

510
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:48,760
I don't wish to know.

511
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:49,800
We made a promise

512
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,520
that we would not meddle with
each other's personal affairs.

513
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,839
You don't need to tell me about it.

514
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:54,959
Wait, I'm telling you

515
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:56,640
because you wanted to listen to me.

516
00:26:57,719 --> 00:26:59,239
I'm not ready yet.

517
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,880
Go to sleep.

518
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,719
Fine then.

519
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:10,119
Do you think I want to tell you?

520
00:27:10,719 --> 00:27:11,880
I'll go to sleep.

521
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,520
So ridiculous.

522
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:03,359
You're better at controlling
the flame now.

523
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,040
Our Li is getting more and more capable.

524
00:28:06,479 --> 00:28:07,839
Mum, it's because you're a good mentor.

525
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,160
(You should eat more.)

526
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:21,319
(Eat up.)

527
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,520
(Maybe you two will
have some good news for us.)

528
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,959
Li, what's wrong?

529
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,079
Mum, it's nothing.

530
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:37,400
Mum, I wish to visit my parents today.

531
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,520
Of course.

532
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,880
Let me wake Yicheng up

533
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,079
and ask him to join you.

534
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:43,199
Leave him be. He finally can
get some rest today.

535
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,760
Let him sleep for a little longer.

536
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,599
How is my son so fortunate?

537
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,880
He has such a great wife.

538
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,820
(Outpatient)

539
00:30:09,199 --> 00:30:12,239
Doctor, am I truly pregnant?

540
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:13,040
Congratulations.

541
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,439
You're six-week pregnant.

542
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,760
Where's your husband?

543
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,640
I still don't know
how to break it to him.

544
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,599
I guess you wish to give him a surprise.

545
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,839
I wonder if it's a surprise or a shock.

546
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,680
Children

547
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:34,560
are God's gift to parents.

548
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:36,880
I'm sure your husband
will be happy about it.

549
00:30:37,479 --> 00:30:39,119
But we aren't ready

550
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,040
to accept our child's existence yet.

551
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,880
All expecting mothers

552
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,760
worry about the same thing
during early pregnancy.

553
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,040
You guys need to
be confident in yourselves.

554
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,599
It's best for you to communicate
with your husband.

555
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:51,479
Don't do anything that
you might regret for life.

556
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,520
Thank you, doctor.

557
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,959
I will remember that.

558
00:30:57,479 --> 00:31:00,160
So, what else do I need to take note of?

559
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,479
During early pregnancy,

560
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,000
you must take good care of your body
during the first three months.

561
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:06,319
Avoid smoking, drinking,
and sexual intercourse.

562
00:31:07,719 --> 00:31:09,479
All right, I will take note of it.

563
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:10,479
Thank you.

564
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,160
Doctor,

565
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:37,439
what happened to that girl?

566
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,520
Who are you?

567
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,560
I'm her father.

568
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,599
I told her everything I needed to.

569
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,439
She needs to be careful during
the first three months of her pregnancy.

570
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,040
I think that's all.

571
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,479
Thank you.

572
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:02,719
(Children are God's gift to parents.)

573
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,959
(I'm sure your husband
will be happy about it.)

574
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,880
(Will he be happy about it?)

575
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
He's adorable.

576
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,079
Yeah.

577
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:24,359
He's moving.

578
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,160
Look.

579
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,400
Does he resemble you or me?

580
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,319
His nose resembles you.

581
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,439
His eyes resemble me.

582
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,180
(Li Houcai)

583
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:57,199
Didn't I tell you not to
contact me any longer?

584
00:32:58,119 --> 00:32:59,560
I just want to ask you this.

585
00:32:59,719 --> 00:33:01,359
Do you still want

586
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,839
to be together with Jiang Yicheng?

587
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,439
What do you think?

588
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,719
We wouldn't have broken up

589
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,920
in the first place
if it weren't for you.

590
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,079
If you wish to be together with him,

591
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,239
just try to steal him back.

592
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,359
I will help you

593
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,719
with the rest.

594
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,719
I must steal him back.

595
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:04,000
I'll give you one last chance.

596
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,959
If you don't answer my call, I'll...

597
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,919
Why didn't you answer my call?

598
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,840
Yicheng, can you come and help me?

599
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,159
Li Man?

600
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,479
What's wrong?

601
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,959
I scalded myself by accident.

602
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,479
I think it's quite serious.

603
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,800
I'll be there immediately.

604
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:33,100
(Diagnostic Imaging Result)

605
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,760
Lu Li?

606
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:07,439
Old Ape?

607
00:35:09,479 --> 00:35:11,159
What a coincidence.

608
00:35:11,479 --> 00:35:11,800
You...

609
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:13,560
Come here.

610
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:14,719
What a coincidence.

611
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,600
Why are you here?

612
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:17,120
I...

613
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:18,320
You see,

614
00:35:18,439 --> 00:35:19,360
my wife...

615
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,639
Is your wife staying in this hospital?

616
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:22,479
That's right.

617
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:23,679
How is she?

618
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,560
She's doing well for now.

619
00:35:25,879 --> 00:35:27,520
We're waiting for the hospital
to arrange her surgery.

620
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,199
Why are you here then?

621
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,959
I'm here to get some medicine.

622
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,479
Great timing.

623
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Since you're here,

624
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:40,000
I don't need to make another trip.

625
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,320
Help me

626
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,719
return the money in this card

627
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,280
to everyone else.

628
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,560
You don't need to do this.

629
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:49,679
Take your time.

630
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:51,040
Mr. Jiang

631
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:53,040
has lent me enough money to pay for
the surgery and chemotherapy.

632
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,280
I have enough money now.

633
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,560
You should return
the money to the others.

634
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,199
Take them.

635
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,239
Did he lend you money?

636
00:36:05,439 --> 00:36:07,199
Didn't Mr. Jiang tell you about it?

637
00:36:07,919 --> 00:36:09,840
He even introduced a new job to me.

638
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,719
Don't tell me you don't know?

639
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,560
Mr. Jiang

640
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,360
always does kind deeds

641
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,760
without leaving his name.

642
00:36:19,919 --> 00:36:21,479
But he has always been like this.

643
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,760
Last time, when you stayed up late
to complete your demo,

644
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:26,399
he wrote the codes for you

645
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,199
when you were sleeping.

646
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:30,560
So,

647
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:32,919
why did he help me?

648
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,239
Silly girl, he did so
because he cared about you.

649
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:40,320
From a man's perspective,

650
00:36:40,479 --> 00:36:43,639
Mr. Jiang is a great man.

651
00:36:44,399 --> 00:36:45,800
You must hold on to him.

652
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,719
But I can't make him mine.

653
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,719
How could that be?

654
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:52,520
You see,

655
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:55,719
Mr. Jiang went against his principles
numerous times because of you.

656
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,600
It's obvious

657
00:36:57,879 --> 00:36:59,360
that he's sincere towards you.

658
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:01,919
Really?

659
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:04,360
Don't you believe me?

660
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,840
I'm a veteran.

661
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,399
Mr. Jiang

662
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:10,800
is a prideful person.

663
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,080
Although he may seem like
he's stubborn and hard to deal with,

664
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,520
he's a kind person.

665
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:17,080
So, you mustn't

666
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,639
judge a book by its cover.

667
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,199
This is a piece of loyal advice

668
00:37:22,919 --> 00:37:24,840
coming from a middle-aged man.

669
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,239
I'll go now.

670
00:37:29,399 --> 00:37:30,360
Please go ahead.

671
00:37:30,439 --> 00:37:31,320
All right.

672
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:31,959
Bye.

673
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,040
Bye.

674
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,159
(Did I misunderstand him?)

675
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,760
It'll sting when I apply the medication.

676
00:37:53,879 --> 00:37:54,479
You must be her boyfriend.

677
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,600
Come and hold her.

678
00:37:55,879 --> 00:37:56,959
I'm not her boyfriend.

679
00:37:57,719 --> 00:37:58,600
Sorry about that.

680
00:38:05,439 --> 00:38:06,719
Endure the pain. It'll be fine.

681
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:10,679
Doctor, this won't leave a scar, right?

682
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,320
Your condition isn't too serious.

683
00:38:13,479 --> 00:38:16,080
It won't leave a scar unless
you have a genetic disorder.

684
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,280
But you must take good care of it.

685
00:38:18,479 --> 00:38:20,919
It'll be hard for it to heal
if your wound gets infected.

686
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,080
Do I need to change
my dressing periodically?

687
00:38:25,399 --> 00:38:25,719
You do.

688
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,120
You need to be here for us
to change your dressing.

689
00:38:27,399 --> 00:38:29,159
Later, I'll give you some painkillers.

690
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,600
You can take them when it hurts.

691
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,959
Okay, I'll prescribe
some medication for you.

692
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,800
Later, you need to bandage your wound.

693
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:35,679
Wait here.

694
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,520
Thank you.

695
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,520
Don't mention it.

696
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,919
Sorry about this.

697
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:53,919
Did I hinder you
from accompanying Lu Li?

698
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,239
I can call her

699
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,679
and explain the situation to her.

700
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,479
She has nothing to be angry about.

701
00:38:58,639 --> 00:38:59,560
She didn't even answer my call.

702
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,199
They haven't bandaged your wound yet.

703
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,239
I'll get you the medication.

704
00:39:03,479 --> 00:39:04,479
Thanks.

705
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,639
Don't tell me he's angry at me

706
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:31,360
because I didn't answer his call?

707
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,660
(Lu Li)

708
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,919
Jiang Yicheng!

709
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,560
Jiang Yicheng! Hurry and answer my call!

710
00:40:26,439 --> 00:40:27,280
Jiang Yicheng!

711
00:40:27,399 --> 00:40:28,760
Someone is following me!

712
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:30,320
It's me.

713
00:40:30,479 --> 00:40:31,760
Yicheng is by my side right now.

714
00:40:31,879 --> 00:40:33,360
Do you need anything?

715
00:41:35,959 --> 00:41:37,159
How do you feel?

716
00:41:37,479 --> 00:41:38,320
Doctor,

717
00:41:39,399 --> 00:41:40,000
my child...

718
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,159
Don't worry. Your child is fine.

719
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,879
Luckily, you used your arms

720
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,439
to cushion your fall.

721
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,280
If not, it would've been terrible.

722
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:50,080
You must be extra careful in the future.

723
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:52,199
Thank you, doctor.

724
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,320
I will take good care of my baby.

725
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,719
By the way,

726
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,360
the driver who bumped into you
told me to hand this to you.

727
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,479
A man was calling you just now.

728
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:02,879
He was pretty worried when he heard
that you were caught in an accident.

729
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,280
He said he'd be here immediately.

730
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,679
All right. Thank you, doctor.

731
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:11,000
Doctor,

732
00:42:11,399 --> 00:42:13,840
did you tell anyone else
about my pregnancy?

733
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,800
Can you keep this a secret?

734
00:42:15,919 --> 00:42:16,800
I can.

735
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,879
If you feel uncomfortable
for the next few days,

736
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,280
you must come here, all right?

737
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:23,199
And, remember to stay optimistic.

738
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,560
Thank you, doctor.

739
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:26,639
Rest well.

740
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,280
Sorry.

741
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,239
I'm sorry.

742
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,560
It's fine.

743
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,320
It hurts.

744
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:55,239
I wonder if it affected my blisters.

745
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,000
How are you?

746
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,439
Were you hurt anywhere else

747
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,959
besides your arms?

748
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,520
I'm fine.

749
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:01,840
It's just a scratch.

750
00:44:02,679 --> 00:44:03,679
So, why did you call me

751
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,840
just now?

752
00:44:05,879 --> 00:44:06,639
Initially, I wanted

753
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,399
to ask you something
regarding the game design competition.

754
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,600
But when I called you,

755
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,560
the nurse told me that you were
caught in an accident.

756
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,959
That scared me.

757
00:44:13,879 --> 00:44:16,159
Just now, when I met the driver
who bumped into you,

758
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,360
he said you were
chased by a man outside.

759
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,639
What's going on?

760
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:25,199
I met a thug on my way home.

761
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,600
Where's Yicheng?
Hasn't he been here yet?

762
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,479
He...

763
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:34,879
I guess he's busy.

764
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,840
Nothing is more important than you.

765
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:43,760
Let me call him.

766
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
No need.

767
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:46,760
It's just a scratch.

768
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,280
You don't need to call him.

769
00:44:48,959 --> 00:44:50,040
The most important thing right now

770
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:51,479
is for me to make a police report.

771
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:52,800
Can you send me there?

772
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,320
We're here.

773
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:09,159
It's getting late.

774
00:45:09,399 --> 00:45:10,399
I'll leave then.

775
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,199
You've been helping me
throughout the entire day.

776
00:45:13,399 --> 00:45:14,639
You didn't even have dinner.

777
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:15,520
Let me call some deliveries.

778
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:16,600
Let's have dinner together.

779
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:18,280
It's getting late. I think it's
inconvenient for us to eat together.

780
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:24,239
You still care about me, right?

781
00:45:24,439 --> 00:45:26,159
I'm doing this out of courtesy,

782
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,679
as we're still friends
and business partners.

783
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,760
But my feelings for you haven't changed.

784
00:45:29,959 --> 00:45:31,840
I didn't even change my passwords.

785
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,639
My passwords are still
our anniversary date.

786
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,800
You should change them.

787
00:45:35,439 --> 00:45:37,000
If you keep dwelling on the past,

788
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,280
I'll sever my tie with you as a friend.

789
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,719
Sorry, I was being too much just now.

790
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,159
You took care of me
throughout the entire day.

791
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,000
It reminds me of the past.

792
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,879
Rest early.

793
00:46:07,719 --> 00:46:09,080
You finally answered my call.

794
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:10,639
It's me.

795
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,239
Yiming?

796
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:14,639
Why are you still together with Lu Li
when it's this late?

797
00:46:14,959 --> 00:46:16,159
Lu Li was caught in an accident.

798
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:17,719
What did you say?

799
00:46:18,959 --> 00:46:23,080
(When the opposite party's system
gives you no response,)

800
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:25,199
(instead of waiting,)

00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:28,679
