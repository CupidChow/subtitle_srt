00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,760
Start.

23
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,039
Wasn't he afraid of heights?

24
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,919
(Don't look down. Just keep looking up.)

25
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,119
(I can do this.)

26
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,839
Sorry.

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,039
I got the star.

28
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:07,160
You passed the test.

29
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,039
You didn't want to go on blind dates.

30
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,880
Are you not anxious to get a girlfriend?

31
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:44,080
Why would I?

32
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,360
Only the mediocre

33
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:47,639
need to get rid
of their status quo in a hurry.

34
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,360
But I don't need to.

35
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:55,160
Then what sort of woman
would make you anxious?

36
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,479
That Miss Jin.

37
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:05,279
She has been holding me up

38
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,440
for an hour and 20 minutes.

39
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,119
Thank goodness
you got rid of her for me.

40
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:27,200
Mr. Jiang!

41
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,000
Mr. Jiang, are you all right?

42
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,160
Mr. Jiang!

43
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,079
Mr. Jiang, if you're afraid,

44
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,320
close your eyes, and I'll help you
get over to the other side.

45
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:57,200
I can let you join our company.

46
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,359
Really?

47
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,519
On one condition.

48
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,519
Name it.

49
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,480
Deal with my blind dates for me.

50
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,079
Even a hacker may sometimes

51
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,160
fail to break through firewalls
and anti-virus programs.

52
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,920
It's not a hundred percent guaranteed.

53
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,600
But I now have a master key.

54
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,380
(Zero)
(Today, I finally...)

55
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:46,160
(Today, I finally took
another step closer to you.)

56
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,720
Wake up.

57
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,959
Wake up.

58
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,399
Surprise!

59
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:13,839
I would feel more surprised

60
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,200
without the surprise.

61
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,760
That won't do.
It's your first day of work.

62
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,200
It needs to be special.

63
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:21,640
But it might be my last too.

64
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:24,000
Shoo. All of that nonsense now.

65
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,399
After my training,

66
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,559
no one will be able to tell.

67
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,000
Come on. Take a few steps.

68
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,519
You look handsome.

69
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,399
Do you think my lashes are too long?

70
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:37,359
Should I get rid of them?

71
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,279
And my eyebrows.

72
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,079
Are they too thin?

73
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,279
Should they be thicker?

74
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,279
Oh, please.

75
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:44,239
There are lots of guys
with longer lashes than girls nowadays.

76
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:45,359
Look at those idols.

77
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,760
All of them have even better-kept
appearances than you do.

78
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,799
Besides, it's the 21st century.

79
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,640
Who says that one must dress
according to their gender?

80
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:53,679
Who decided that guys

81
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,000
have to be rough and masculine

82
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,399
and not neat and tidy?

83
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,320
That's true.

84
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,359
But I'm still worried.

85
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:02,760
Don't worry. A lot of straight guys

86
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:04,079
won't even be able to tell.

87
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,399
If you're that worried,

88
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,200
I'll teach you a way to deal with them.

89
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,359
What is it?

90
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:11,720
If they question your gender,

91
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:12,640
just tell them

92
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,200
that they're insulting your character

93
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:16,839
and play the victim.

94
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:20,000
All right. I got it.

95
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,880
Show some confidence.

96
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,359
Remember the way
I taught you to say hello.

97
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,920
Can't I just say "hello"?

98
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,799
No.

99
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,640
You have to trust my years
of experience in watching films, okay?

100
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:33,559
Go on now. Do your best, my dear Li!

101
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,420
(I'm Momo)

102
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,980
(Checkers x2 Checkers x3)

103
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,340
(Checkers x4)

104
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,119
(Checkers x5)
All right. I'll pick you up.

105
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,420
(Checkers x6)

106

(Checkers x7 Checkers x8)

107
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,180
(The checkered shirts
that all the programmers are wearing)

108
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,380
(Payment success)

109
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:57,000
(Programming Department)

110
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,280
- It's so...
- It's so beautiful.

111
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,719
Is that what you wanted to say?

112
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,520
Lu Li, right?

113
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:19,919
Hello.

114
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:23,200
Remember the way
I taught you to say hello.

115
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:25,159
Hey, brother!

116
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:28,359
You're strong, brother.

117
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:30,799
He doesn't fit it, all right.

118
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:32,080
He means

119
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,080
that you aren't
wearing a checkered shirt.

120
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:35,400
So you stand out.

121
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,239
I've already placed an order.

122
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:40,280
You're so forthright. He's just joking.

123
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,840
I am Zhang Zhiyuan,
leader of the programming team A.

124
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,640
You can call me Old Ape.

125
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,000
Old Ape?

126
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,393
(Old Ape)
Yes. That ape.

127
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:52,359
We're programmers, after all.

128
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:53,840
The guy joking

129
00:10:53,841 --> 00:10:55,540
(Lin Shutian)
with you earlier is Lin Shutian.

130
00:10:55,599 --> 00:10:58,440
He's only 20. He's just like my son.

131
00:10:58,599 --> 00:11:00,119
He still throws childish tantrums.

132
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:01,359
Don't mind him, all right?

133
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,599
Hey, Old Ape, I'm saying this again.

134
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:06,119
Don't call me a kid.

135
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,840
Besides, he's much shorter than me.

136
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:11,919
Being short is good.

137
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,000
How so?

138
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,960
You will never be able

139
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,400
to hold your head up in front of me.

140
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,039
Fine. I won't bother.

141
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:22,479
Come on, Lu Li.
I'll introduce you to others.

142
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,827
(Brother Lei)
Brother Lei, we got a new member.

143
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,479
- This is Brother Lei.
- If it was locked,

144
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:30,200
why didn't I notice it?

145
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,960
It doesn't make sense.

146
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,400
There he goes again.

147
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,280
Say, if I didn't lock the door,

148
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,080
I wouldn't go to the administration
department to return the key.

149
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,880
If I don't go
to the administration department,

150
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:42,679
I won't be able to get coffee
from the art department.

151
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,239
Right?

152
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:44,280
Yes.

153
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,799
Why do you have to get coffee
from the art department?

154
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,280
That's not the point.

155
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,039
I've tried all the coffee machines

156
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,080
in the company.

157
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,359
Considering the impact
of the different water pressure

158
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,760
and the degree of wear and tear
of the machines,

159
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,400
the coffee machine in the art department

160
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,080
must make the best coffee.

161
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,640
You can try
the administration department.

162
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,799
The administration department?

163
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,400
You're right.

164
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,599
Amazing.

165
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,320
You managed to distract him with that.

166
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,440
How do you guys usually deal with that?

167
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:16,840
We bear with it.

168
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,159
Come on, Lu Li.

169
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,679
This is your workstation.

170
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,440
Lu Li.
Let me give you a formal introduction.

171
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,239
(Da Huang)
This is our company's Ju Shihuang.

172
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,679
Da Huang.

173
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,200
Get over here.

174
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,239
Just call me
if you need anything, Lu Li.

175
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,200
Oh, this guy.

176
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:40,080
Hello.

177
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,400
Welcome to our ace team.

178
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,880
We'll be colleagues from now on.

179
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:44,919
Hello.

180
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,080
Hello.

181
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,400
Hey, brother.

182
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,840
What was that?

183
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:53,320
You're quite strong.

184
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:55,080
If you have any questions,

185
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,359
you can always come to me.

186
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:59,280
Why are you guys
all wearing checkered shirts?

187
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,239
Because of the bug.

188
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:05,080
Checkered shirts
can reduce the number of bugs.

189
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:07,400
Just like my screen name.

190
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:08,719
What's your screen name?

191
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,919
Yongzheng.

192
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,400
Do you know why?

193
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:19,479
Yongzheng specializes in fixing "bug".
[*Bug sounds like the eighth prince of Kangxi]

194
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:20,280
Nice.

195
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,440
I guess childishness does not
distinguish between professions.

196
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:25,840
No. I'm just kidding.

197
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:28,760
Checkered shirts just match easily
with everything else.

198
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,400
See. No one will be able to tell

199
00:13:30,479 --> 00:13:33,239
how many days
someone hasn't changed his clothes.

200
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,080
But they can smell it.

201
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:40,679
Right.

202
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,359
I have another question.

203
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,039
Why aren't there
any female programmers in the team?

204
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:48,320
I heard Mr. Jiang was badly hurt

205
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,760
by a female programmer before.

206
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,799
So that's how

207
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:53,119
this place gradually became a temple.

208
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,200
But I think it actually

209
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,919
might be a kind of
post-traumatic stress reaction of love.

210
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,159
And?

211
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:04,359
You only just came.
Why are you so interested in the gossip?

212
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,200
I'm not sure either.

213
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,599
A female programmer?

214
00:14:11,119 --> 00:14:11,919
Lu Li.

215
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,440
Your employee ID card is ready.

216
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,400
However, you still need
to go to the administration department

217
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,039
to go through the duty formalities.

218
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:21,799
Welcome to the team.

219
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,320
Thank you.

220
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:28,239
Oh, right. Friendly reminder.

221
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,159
We don't actually wear

222
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,919
checkered shirts every day.

223
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,159
We only wear it

224
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,239
on big occasions.

225
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,440
Like welcoming you on your first day.

226
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,039
Are you done?

227
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,919
Get to work.

228
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:07,020
(Lu Li, Programming Team)

229
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,840
Hello.

230
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,840
Are you the one who can help me
with the duty formalities?

231
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,840
Hang on.

232
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,719
So you watch dramas
during work hours, huh?

233
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,760
You...

234
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,919
(Dark and dense hair.)

235
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,960
(Fair and smooth skin.)

236
00:15:37,359 --> 00:15:39,400
(A refreshing scent.)

237
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,520
(This must be)

238
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:42,799
(a boyfriend heaven sent me.)

239
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,719
Are you new here, handsome?

240
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:50,719
What's your name?

241
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,239
Lu Li.

242
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:54,719
Lu Li.

243
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,640
(Our children will have the surname Lu.)

244
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,640
(It sounds so nice.)

245
00:15:58,119 --> 00:15:59,400
What's your horoscope?

246
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,239
Virgo.

247
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,000
(Me too!)

248
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,320
Does...
Does that have anything to do with work?

249
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,000
It has something to do with me.

250
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:10,760
Which university did you graduate from?

251
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,080
Xinhai University.

252
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:13,320
Did you bring
your graduation certificate?

253
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:14,440
No.

254
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,880
No worries. Just bring it over next time

255
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,159
so that I can make a photocopy of it.

256
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:23,159
You have your ID card with you, right?

257
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,000
If you didn't,

258
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:27,840
your household register would do too.

259
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:30,000
Do you need it now?

260
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,960
I just have to take a look at it.

261
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,700
(People's Republic of China
Resident Identity Card)

262
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,640
Here. Have a look.

263
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:52,280
Oh, you.

264
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:55,799
I'm not as strong.

265
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,119
Your hands

266
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,520
are so soft.

267
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:12,239
Oh, you.

268
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,000
People might see.

269
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,479
My ID card is expired.

270
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,199
I'll bring it to you
when I get it replaced.

271
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,079
All right. I'll be waiting for you.

272
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:39,000
I've never dated this type before.

273
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:41,319
Good morning, Mr. Jiang.

274
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,520
Hold on.

275
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:48,400
What's that in your hand?

276
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:49,560
My ID...

277
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,479
card.

278
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,560
Let me see it.

279
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,880
I caught a glimpse

280
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:06,560
of the photo on your ID just now.

281
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,239
Is it ugly?

282
00:18:14,479 --> 00:18:16,959
Yes. My ID photo was the ugliest photo

283
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:19,119
I ever took in my life.

284
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,000
It made me look like a girl.

285
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,599
Do you think you look like a guy?

286
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:25,232
But that's normal.

287
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:27,840
(Lu Li, Gender: Female)
Only 6.3 percent of people

288
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,680
(Lu Li, Gender: Female)
in this world are good-looking.

289
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:30,040
There aren't many people

290
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:32,319
who look as good as I do,
both in ID photos and real life.

291
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,719
You're right.

292
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,880
I think you look even better in person.

293
00:18:36,439 --> 00:18:37,880
Everyone thinks so too.

294
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,839
Then do you know what a precursor

295
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:40,640
of a company's fall is?

296
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,400
Customer loss?

297
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:42,920
No. Employees have nothing to do.

You're wandering around leisurely
on your first day of work.

You can do it, Huang.

You're wearing a wig, aren't you?

327

I just have
excess sebum production on my scalp.

You don't have to explain.

00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,239
I understand.

Are you suffering from hair loss too?

335

It's an occupational disease for us.

way too early.

00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:31,119
Hereditary hair loss, right?

339
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,719
Don't worry. I'll send you a few links

340
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,800
to some anti-hair loss shampoo.

341
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,800
The earlier you detect it,
the sooner you can get it treated.

342
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,640
Pull it.

343
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:50,560
Pull harder.

344
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:55,239
You actually pulled.

345
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,760
I spent money and got a hair transplant.

346
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:02,119
Work hard and make money.

347
00:23:02,199 --> 00:23:03,119
You'll be able to do the same.

348
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,680
I'll keep your secret safe.

349
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:09,760
Gather around, kids.

350
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,760
Kids!

351
00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:13,199
What's going on?

352
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:13,760
What is it?

353
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:15,359
To welcome our new member,

354
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,079
I've decided that we will give him
the highest level of welcome.

355
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,199
That's great!

356
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,400
It's fine.
You guys don't have to do that.

357
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,599
- We must!
- We have to!

358
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,640
Quiet.

359
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,599
We have to.

360
00:23:34,239 --> 00:23:35,319
(Sufeng E-sports Gaming Center)
Work with me today.

361
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,640
We'll get all of them today.

362
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,439
I'll cover for you.

363
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,359
Okay.

364
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,880
So your highest level of welcome for me

365
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,199
is gaming.

366
00:23:46,439 --> 00:23:47,280
- Can't you tell?
- Of course!

367
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:48,920
Hurry up and put on your headphones!

368
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:49,680
Hurry up!

369
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:50,280
Coming!

370
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:50,520
Come on.

371
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,959
The first room, guys.

372
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:54,640
The first room?

373
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,599
The first room.

374
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,680
I'm here.

375
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,100
(Crossfire)

376
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,319
We won!

377
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,079
That was a good shot I made, wasn't it?

378
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:48,880
I did a good job
covering for you guys, too, right?

379
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:50,280
Let's go again.

380
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:51,760
Again?

381
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,359
It's fine if we were evenly matched,

382
00:24:53,439 --> 00:24:55,079
but it's no fun if we're just
pummeling you guys one-sidedly.

383
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:56,160
It won't be fun even if we win.

384
00:24:56,239 --> 00:24:57,040
What do you mean?

385
00:24:57,119 --> 00:24:58,000
Are you looking down on us?

386
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,040
What? What do you mean by that?

387
00:24:59,119 --> 00:24:59,920
Fine. We'll play if you want.

388
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:02,119
Don't fight. You guys go ahead first.

389
00:25:02,199 --> 00:25:03,880
I need to use the washroom.

390
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:08,439
Come on.

391
00:25:08,439 --> 00:25:09,160
Let's play another round.

392
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:09,760
I'm in.

393
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:12,560
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

394
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,239
I didn't bump into it.

395
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:16,119
If you didn't,

396
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:17,640
are you implying that I threw it?

397
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,439
I'm not implying. I know it.

398
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,560
You threw it on the floor.

399
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:22,160
Stop.

400
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:24,439
You...

401
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,400
Say that again if you dare.

402
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:26,800
What's going on?

403
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,920
What's going on?

404
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,280
What's going on with you guys?

405
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:32,560
Say that again if you dare.

406
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:34,280
Fine! Say it then!

407
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:35,040
What are you doing?

408
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:35,719
What's the matter with him?

409
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:36,640
Don't be hasty.

410
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:40,040
ctrl+v.

411
00:25:43,239 --> 00:25:44,439
ctrl+v.

412
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:45,199
They don't understand.

413
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,800
Also,

414
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:49,000
hand tremor
is an early symptom of Parkinson's.

415
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:51,400
I suggest you get that checked out.

416
00:25:53,479 --> 00:25:55,079
You sissy.

417
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,479
You were messing with me, weren't you?

418
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:57,800
How dare you fool me...

419
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,839
Let go. This has nothing to do with you.

420
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:32,479
He's one of mine.

421
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,880
His business is my business.

422
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:37,319
Apologize to him.

423
00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:38,719
Why should I?

424
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,920
Ow, let go. Let go of my hand.

425
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:43,239
Apologize.

426
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,760
S... Sorry.

427
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,199
Get him!

428
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,520
Wait.

429
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,599
I should also warn you

430
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,959
that I have superpowers.

431
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,079
Think twice before you act.

432
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,359
Superpowers?

433
00:26:57,839 --> 00:26:59,160
What sort of powers?

434
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,319
What nonsense is he saying?

435
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,479
I'm super rich.

436
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:03,680
Right.

437
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,040
If you even get a tiny scratch on me,

438
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,160
I'll hire the best team of lawyers

439
00:27:08,199 --> 00:27:09,319
and sue you.

440
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:10,839
Also, here, there,

441
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,199
there, and there.

442
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,359
There are cameras everywhere.
360 degrees.

443
00:27:14,719 --> 00:27:15,719
You can go ahead if you dare.

444
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,560
Let's go.

445
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,280
Go back and brush up on your skills.

446
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:29,599
We have the place
all to ourselves for tonight.

447
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:30,680
My treat.

448
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,760
Come on!

449
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,079
Let's go!

450
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,119
I'm going in first.

451
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:36,280
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

452
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:36,719
Hurry up.

453
00:27:36,719 --> 00:27:37,000
We're waiting for you.

454
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:37,439
Coming.

455
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,160
Come on. Get ready.

456
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:40,719
Why do you always get into trouble?

457
00:27:41,719 --> 00:27:43,959
He called me a sissy first.

458
00:27:45,959 --> 00:27:48,199
Who says that a guy has to be manly?

459
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:49,280
But...

460
00:27:52,199 --> 00:27:55,520
You are a bit too unmanly.

461
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,280
It's the 21st century.

462
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,199
Why should we still judge
a man or a woman by their appearance?

463
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:03,520
Right?

464
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:06,959
But I just noticed...

465
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,040
I'm back.

466
00:28:51,719 --> 00:28:53,719
Li, you're finally home!

467
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,599
Are you not getting
your beauty sleep today?

468
00:28:57,239 --> 00:28:59,280
I want to know your latest progress.

469
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,439
How did it go?

470
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:04,439
I'm doomed.

471
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,199
Don't you have Adam's apple?

472
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:11,199
(He asked you that?)

473
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,599
(What was your reply?)

474
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,439
I've always had less androgen in me.

475
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,880
And I have throat inflammation too.

476
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,160
So my thyroid cartilage
isn't as distinct.

477
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:25,479
That's why I don't have Adam's apple.

478
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,040
You don't have
to feel insecure about that.

479
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,719
His Adam's apple
does not determine a real man.

480
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,040
One should not
be afraid of educated liars

481
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:50,680
but afraid of a genius liar!

482
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,319
My dear Li, you're amazing!

483
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,479
But he is already suspecting me.

484
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:57,959
My knowledge reserves

485
00:29:58,119 --> 00:29:59,680
are only enough to get me through today.

486
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,920
I have a way
to get rid of his suspicions.

487
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:05,479
Just leave it to me.

488
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,640
She's my ideal type.

489
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,880
I seem to have fallen in love
for the 57th time.

490
00:30:54,959 --> 00:30:55,800
(Time to start acting.)

491
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,400
My dear Li!

492
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:06,560
Stop. Don't move.

493
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,199
Why didn't you answer my calls?

494
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,719
I missed you so much.

495
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:13,479
We're in public. Let go of me.

496
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,359
Stand straight.

497
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:18,560
Do you not like me anymore?

498
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,000
If I did something

499
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,280
that made you unhappy,

500
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:22,160
you could tell me.

501
00:31:22,239 --> 00:31:23,520
I can change.

502
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,839
But don't ignore me.

503
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,560
Your actions today made me very unhappy.

504
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,760
Don't come to my company again, got it?

505
00:31:30,959 --> 00:31:33,319
But I really miss you.

506
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:35,239
Don't ignore me.

507
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:37,640
Why don't we
have dinner together tonight?

508
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,560
We'll talk about that later.
Go back now.

509
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,880
Won't you do as I say?

510
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:48,880
Fine. If you don't leave, I'll leave.

511
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,880
Li.

512
00:31:51,199 --> 00:31:51,920
That was so manly.

513
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,880
My goodness.

514
00:32:04,439 --> 00:32:05,520
Lu Li! Lu Li!

515
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:06,839
Lu Li, I have some questions for you.

516
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,280
How did you feel just now?

517
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,000
What made you do what you did earlier?

518
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:11,000
That's right.

519
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,760
She's too clingy. It can't be helped.

520
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,719
"It can't be helped."

521
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,880
Listen and learn, boys.

522
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,239
You can't judge a person by appearance.

523
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:20,560
You're on top of the programmers'
chain of contempt now!

524
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,400
Right.

525
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,560
What chain of contempt?

526
00:32:22,719 --> 00:32:24,199
Those with wives
look down on those without.

527
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:25,479
Those without a wife
but have a girlfriend

528
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,439
look down on those who are single.

529
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:27,040
Right.

530
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:29,839
Then among the singles,
the computer language editors

531
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,160
and operating systems look down
on each other.

532
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,959
Does your girlfriend have a friend

533
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,760
or a cousin or someone that she can

534
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,640
introduce to us?

535
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,640
She might...

536
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,719
Lu Li.

537
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,560
Let's go.

538
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,000
I was away on business yesterday.

539
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:46,000
So I couldn't join
the welcoming party for you.

540
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,560
Let's have lunch together.

541
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,359
Mr. Chen, that's not necessary.

542
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:51,400
Nonsense. I'm hungry.

543
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,640
Let's go.

544
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,359
Let go of me! Why are you here?

545
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:04,160
I work here.

546
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,620
(Gu Mo, Art Director)

547
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,359
Do you work at Enchant?

548
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:13,280
You wouldn't be so surprised about this

549
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:14,439
if you paid a little more
attention to me.

550
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:16,160
Let me ask you this.

551
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,760
Who was that girly man just now?

552
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:22,280
My boyfriend.

553
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:24,160
He happens to work here too.

554
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:26,439
You better look after
your brother-in-law from now on.

555
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,800
I disapprove. Break up with him.

556
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,239
What has that got to do with you?

557
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:31,479
I'm your brother.

558
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,839
Godbrother, all right?

559
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,640
Even my own parents have never
tried to control me so much.

560
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,560
Mind your own business.

561
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,800
Gu Xiaoqi.

562
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:42,520
Was that your girlfriend just now?

563
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,160
Is there something wrong with her eye?

564
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:48,160
No, she has good eyesight.

565
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,199
She has 5.0 in both eyes.

566
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,599
Lu Li, I remember your resume
stated that you graduated

567
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,839
from Xinhai University
with a degree in Computer Science.

568
00:33:59,719 --> 00:34:01,599
That makes you our junior
from the same university and major.

569
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,920
You guys are famous in the university.

570
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,800
How famous?

571
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,679
A lot of people think...

572
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,520
A lot of people idolize you guys.

573
00:34:19,479 --> 00:34:20,320
What about you?

574
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:26,159
My idol is Ada Lovelace.

575
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,760
The founder of computer programs.

576
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,120
Don't you have an idol that's alive?

577
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:37,040
(I do. It's you.)

578
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,360
No wonder you were
so eager to join our company.

579
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,800
So your idol is...

580
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:45,760
Mr. Chen,

581
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,479
I attended the lecture

582
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,679
you gave at my university.

583
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,479
Chen Yiming?

584
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,040
It's an honor.

585
00:34:57,919 --> 00:34:59,080
Don't talk during a meal.

586
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,439
What? Are you a neat freak?

587
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:55,159
Lu Li.

588
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,280
Come to my office.

589
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:08,000
Mr. Chen, is there something you need?

590
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:12,176
(Mometasone Furoate Gel)

591
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:13,120
This is for external use.

592
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:14,399
It'll help stop the itches for now.

593
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,639
You can just tell us
if you have a seafood allergy.

594
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:18,080
Mr. Jiang won't mind.

595
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:20,239
I know he won't.

596
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:21,959
Then why did you still eat it?

597
00:36:22,439 --> 00:36:25,560
(Because that was the first time
he had picked up food for me.)

598
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,080
I... I thought
it would be fine if I only ate one.

599
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:35,439
But I ended up eating another.

600
00:36:37,399 --> 00:36:38,479
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

601
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:39,639
You're welcome.

602
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,800
I have to do something as your idol.

603
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,879
Go get busy.

604
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,159
I'll get back to work now.

605
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:50,239
Does it make a difference
if you eat one or two prawns?

606
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,360
Come in.

607
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:32,679
Um... Mr. Jiang.

608
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:34,639
Do you know how to debug?

609
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,159
Get this done
before you get off the clock.

610
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,159
Okay.

611
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,360
What are you waiting for?
For me to give you an award?

612
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,280
Be serious.

613
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:38,919
I'm done.

614
00:39:00,399 --> 00:39:01,800
I know beautiful things

615
00:39:01,879 --> 00:39:03,679
can be very attractive.

616
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,040
But please be serious when you work.

617
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:33,040
Sorry, Mr. Jiang!

618
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,120
I've debugged everything.

619
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:38,719
If there's nothing else,
I'm going back to work.

620
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:43,399
What's wrong with him?

621
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,000
A guy that likes
to touch another guy's face?

622
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:00,360
I'm getting off work!

623
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,919
You're done?

624
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,840
Yes.

625
00:40:04,479 --> 00:40:05,679
Did you check it?

626
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,919
It's fine. There are no problems.

627
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,760
Young people.

628
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,959
Are you guys working overtime today?

629
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,439
What else? Endless codes,

630
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,719
endless bugs to fix,
and endless hours of overtime.

631
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,360
That's the norm for us.

632
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,439
Lu, I've sent you the link.

633
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,719
There's a sale right now.

634
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,120
You can get
the second one for half price.

635
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:26,040
Hurry up and get it!

636
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,000
Get what?

637
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:28,639
Just some daily necessities.

638
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,040
Do you need any?

639
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,280
No.

640
00:40:32,399 --> 00:40:34,280
Aren't you going to see your girlfriend?

641
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,800
It's fine even if I don't.

642
00:40:35,879 --> 00:40:37,439
She'll understand.

643
00:40:38,439 --> 00:40:39,360
What gives?

644
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,719
Even a guy like him
with such a consciousness

645
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,159
can get a girlfriend.

646
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,679
Why can't I?

647
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:46,919
It's fine if you don't.

648
00:40:47,439 --> 00:40:48,239
You can construct a new one.

649
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,080
Construct?

650
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:50,439
Make one of your own.

651
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,199
Then, I'll make one.

652
00:40:52,439 --> 00:40:53,560
All right. You guys do that.

653
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:54,639
I'm off.

654
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,639
Bye.

655
00:40:55,879 --> 00:40:56,639
Did you check your work too?

656
00:40:56,719 --> 00:40:58,199
- Bye.
- Bye.

657
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,920
(Mose)

658
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,960
(Mose Time)

659
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,040
Li, you're finally back!

660
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:09,280
Quick. Have a seat.

661
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,360
Were you waiting for me?

662
00:41:10,439 --> 00:41:11,159
Yes.

663
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:12,080
Now hurry up and tell me

664
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:13,399
if our act was a success today.

665
00:41:13,479 --> 00:41:14,479
Did they buy it?

666
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,879
Not only did they buy it,

667
00:41:15,959 --> 00:41:19,040
but they're also
envious, jealous, and spiteful.

668
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:21,439
That's good. That means

669
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,879
it'll be fine even if a little accident

670
00:41:22,959 --> 00:41:24,159
happens.

671
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,679
What accident?

672
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,560
That's what happened.

673
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:31,639
I didn't know Gu Mo would be at Enchant

674
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:34,600
and that I would even
run into him today.

675
00:41:34,641 --> 00:41:38,047
Didn't you say your brother
passed away a long time ago?

676
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,919
It's fine.

677
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,639
I'll just try to avoid him

678
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:47,280
in the company.

679
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,919
You don't know what he's like.

680
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,399
He loves to put his nose
into other people's businesses.

681
00:41:50,479 --> 00:41:51,919
And he's full of bad ideas.

682
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,760
If he knew about our relationship,

683
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,479
he would definitely bully you.

684
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:57,879
But if he does, don't worry,

685
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,959
I'll have my godparents
take care of him!

686
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,360
We'll go with the flow
and adapt accordingly. Don't worry.

687
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,639
Wait.

688
00:42:05,479 --> 00:42:05,919
Oh, right.

689
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,000
I'll be out-of-town
to attend an anime exhibition.

690
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,360
I might be away for a few days.

691
00:42:10,479 --> 00:42:11,479
Take care of yourself then.

692
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:13,320
Don't worry. Make sure you don't slip up

693
00:42:13,399 --> 00:42:14,600
while I'm away.

694
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:15,479
I'll hear your report when I come back.

695
00:42:15,479 --> 00:42:17,080
Okay. Don't worry.

696
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,000
(Liking you)

697
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,320
(is not a bug.)

698
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:26,639
(So there's no need to debug it.)
