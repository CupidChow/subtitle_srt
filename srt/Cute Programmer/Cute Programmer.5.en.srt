21
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:51,760
Where were you?

22
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,160
I went looking for you.

23
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,160
Where were you?

24
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,199
I met a strange person.

25
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,319
By the way,

26
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,559
if a woman you don't know

27
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,639
runs away when she sees you,

28
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,639
what could be the reason?

29
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,959
Do you want the answer rendered

30
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,120
or not rendered?

31
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:07,400
Is there a difference?

32
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,199
The rendered answer would be

33
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,440
you're too handsome.

34
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,600
She was too embarrassed to see you.

35
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:12,639
The unrendered answer would be,

36
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:14,279
you are chasing after her as a stranger,

37
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,559
of course she would run away.

38
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,679
You...

39
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,759
Have some fried chicken.

40
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,160
Eat it before it gets cold.

41
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,080
Was it Jiang Zitong?

42
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:31,880
You are out here with me,

43
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:33,479
let's not invite her.

44
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,327
(From: Lu Li)

45
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,119
(Could I see you tonight?)

46
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,479
Sorry.

47
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,759
There was a traffic jam.

48
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:01,759
It's all right.

49
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,520
I'm sorry you have to
come all the way here.

50
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:07,559
So this is how you really look.

51
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,479
Long hair suits you better.

52
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:13,520
Here.

53
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:16,039
Thanks.

54
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,039
The coffee tastes like
the one you brewed.

55
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,039
Try it out.

56
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:26,440
It's on the sweeter side.

57
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,279
Girls would like it.

58
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,039
So was it you who helped me out

59
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,960
in the fitting room?

60
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:43,360
Hello.

61
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:44,639
I need a favor from you.

62
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,759
Sure.

63
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:49,360
Had you not helped,

64
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,360
things would get out of hand

65
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,320
if Mr. Jiang found me.

66
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,000
It wasn't a coincidence.

67
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,080
You knew it all along?

68
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:02,880
At the hot spring...

69
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,360
Sorry.

70
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:05,960
It was a coincidence that I found out.

71
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,320
So why didn't you expose me?

72
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,479
I believe you have your reasons

73
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,200
to make this choice.

74
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:18,000
Not to mention I already admired
your qualities

75
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,200
when you came for the interview.

76
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,600
Your gender won't change my opinion

77
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,880
about you.

78
00:04:28,239 --> 00:04:31,959
Thank you for keeping a secret for me.

79
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:36,040
It's not entirely because of you.

80
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:37,640
As you know, there is no

81
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,239
female programmer in our company.

82
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:42,160
I tried talking to Yicheng,

83
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:44,160
but his mind is set.

84
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:45,359
It's hard to persuade him.

85
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,920
I hope that you

86
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,040
can become the exemplar
to prove him wrong

87
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,679
and bring some changes to our company.

88
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,679
Was Mr. Jiang

89
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,519
hurt by another female programmer?

90
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,000
Is that why he acts this way?

91
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,079
That concerns his private life.

92
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:02,559
I'm not at liberty to say.

93
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,920
But I must confirm something with you.

94
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,640
Are you working in our company
just for me?

95
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,200
I hope I'm not the idol you admire.

96
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,720
You are everything I strive to be
from the professional perspective.

97
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:16,959
You have my word.

98
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:20,920
I work there because

99
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,440
I like the place.

100
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,920
Don't get so nervous.

101
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,640
As long as you're not causing
our company any damage,

102
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,480
your secret will be safe with me.

103
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:31,200
But judging by the look of it,

104
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:34,480
there's been a huge error
in our company's administration.

105
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:35,760
No.

106
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,320
Miss Yezi asked

107
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,679
for my certificate and ID,

108
00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:40,720
but I got past her
with all kinds of excuses.

109
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,000
It's not her fault.

110
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,559
You look terrified.

111
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:45,760
Don't worry.

112
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,760
I have no right to interfere
with the administration.

113
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,519
And speaking of responsibility,

114
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,799
I should be held accountable
for not exposing you

115
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,200
as your superior.

116
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:57,679
Mr. Chen.

117
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,200
I could help you with anything

118
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,359
if you ever need help.

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,399
I could make your coffee every day.

120
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,959
I could wash your cups too.

121
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,119
Then do me a favor

122
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,519
and be my friend.

123
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,799
Friends shouldn't be so calculating.

124
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:13,160
Mr. Chen.

125
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,320
Now I understand why Mr. Jiang
is so fond of you.

126
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:22,760
You must be one of the caring men
people would love to know.

127
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm merely doing what I can

128
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:29,200
to help everyone.

129
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:32,239
But your courage

130
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,200
impressed me.

131
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:53,799
Hello.

132
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,239
I need to freshen up a little.

133
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,320
Why do I think about him?

134
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,480
Calm down.

135
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:35,920
No.

136
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,860
(How much of a straight guy are you?)

137
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,420
(Which of the products is used
by a girl after she wakes up?)

138
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,660
(Result: Overtly straight)

139
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,100
(Emergency)

140
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,140
(Neurology)

141
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,720
Lately, I've been spacing out

142
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,600
and unable to focus.

143
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:16,440
And

144
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,320
I feel frustrated.

145
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:20,239
Are there any unusual symptoms?

146
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:25,519
I keep thinking about someone
from time to time.

147
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:26,519
I'd even mistaken a stranger

148
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,760
for him.

149
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,880
Am I suffering from

150
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,880
(Neurology)
some sort of mental disorder?

151
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,640
(Neurology)
Have you had any trauma

152
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,919
or did you get angry easily?

153
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:39,719
That person does make me angry
very often.

154
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,479
Are you experiencing
headaches, dizziness,

155
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,440
or any sign of fatigue?

156
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,679
No.

157
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,679
Are your symptoms related

158
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,080
to this person?

159
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,080
You can put it that way.

160
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:56,840
Are you married?

161
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,599
No.

162
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,719
Do you have a girlfriend?

163
00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:01,200
How is that related to my condition?

164
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:03,840
Those are signs of having a crush
on someone.

165
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,320
That's something I can't cure.

166
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:06,640
Only that special someone can.

167
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,919
Impossible!

168
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:13,400
I think you

169
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,640
should study harder!

170
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,919
Where is she?

171
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,919
Stop dawdling.

172
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:27,799
It's time for breakfast!

173
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:28,559
Hurry up.

174
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,239
Okay, Mom.

175
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,919
Here they come.

176
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I fried two eggs for you.

177
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:43,960
Here they come.

178
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,440
Have some eggs for the nutrients.

179
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,119
Come.

180
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,080
Hurry up and eat.

181
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,799
You need to eat more.

182
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:49,679
You're too skinny.

183
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,919
Even your dad can tell.

184
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:53,479
Are you that busy at work?

185
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,000
I heard that programmers

186
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,479
always work overtime.

187
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,320
Not at all.

188
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,559
Don't worry, Mom.

189
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:01,679
Our company prefers work-life balance.

190
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,000
We even have a fashion consultant
to give us fashion lessons.

191
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,359
It makes the office more lively.

192
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,039
That doesn't sound
like a normal company.

193
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,039
Do you have a cafeteria for the workers?

194
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:16,559
No.

195
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:19,080
But I always have lunch
with my colleagues.

196
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:20,239
We can order a lot

197
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:21,760
but pay less for each portion.

198
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,559
You can't always eat outside.

199
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,400
The food is either unhealthy or dirty.

200
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,719
Why don't you come home?

201
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:32,239
Mom, the office is too far from here.

202
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:32,960
And

203
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,239
Xiaoqi needs my company.

204
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:39,239
Mom, enough about that.

205
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,599
I'll visit you this weekend.

206
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:41,239
You're leaving already?

207
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,239
Finish your food!

208
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,400
What's inside the backpack?

209
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:45,400
Is it something heavy?

210
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,559
Slow down a little.

211
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:48,239
You don't behave like a girl at all.

212
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,440
Mom, see you.

213
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:51,840
Look at the leftover.

214
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:06,119
Good morning, Mr. Jiang.

215
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,960
Stop.

216
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:09,679
Mr. Jiang.

217
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,479
Morning.

218
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:11,960
Did you have your breakfast?

219
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:13,479
Where were you yesterday?

220
00:11:14,359 --> 00:11:15,440
I was at home.

221
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,400
What did you do at home?

222
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:18,039
Eating, sleeping, and gaming.

223
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
Eating,

224
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,239
sleeping,

225
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:23,919
and gaming?

226
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:28,880
If there's nothing else,

227
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,080
I should get to work now.

228
00:11:34,479 --> 00:11:35,840
I didn't say you could leave.

229
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,039
Yicheng.

230
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:41,760
Mr. Chen.

231
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,119
Did my team member do something?

232
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:46,280
Are you punishing him?

233
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:47,760
His look annoys me.

234
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,599
Lu Li.

235
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,840
I bought some new coffee beans.

236
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:51,640
Care to try them out?

237
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,159
Sure.

238
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,280
I'll wash the cups.

239
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,280
I want some too.

240
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:58,400
Let's go.

241
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:04,400
It's hot.

242
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:05,760
Thanks, Mr. Chen.

243
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:10,080
Why did you two get so intimate?

244
00:12:11,119 --> 00:12:12,719
We have a shared secret.

245
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,960
It's secret if only a person knows it.

246
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,359
When two know it, it's gossip.

247
00:12:15,479 --> 00:12:16,640
Everyone will know eventually.

248
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,119
Do you know what that'd be?

249
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,359
It's called "going viral."

250
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,119
Did someone step on your toe?

251
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,799
Were you forced to
get another blind date?

252
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:24,840
No.

253
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,280
Mr. Chen,

254
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,200
the coffee is even more aromatic
than the other day.

255
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,479
I added some sugar.

256
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,760
It's bitter.

257
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:38,239
I didn't pay you to drink coffee here.

258
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:39,400
Get back to work.

259
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,440
Mr. Chen.

260
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,479
The coffee tastes great.

261
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:44,400
I'll return the cup later.

262
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:46,719
Stay.

263
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:48,200
I have some tasks for you.

264
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:52,159
Mr. Jiang, do you
have any orders for him?

265
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,227
(Gamer)

266
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,559
Latte art?

267
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:10,200
Mr. Chen.

268
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,840
What are the tasks?

269
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,440
Nothing.

270
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,080
Finish the coffee before you leave.

271
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,960
Okay.

272
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:33,520
(He looks silly.)

273
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,960
But he's good at socializing.

274
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:41,520
Y and C?

275
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,880
This isn't the name of his girlfriend.

276
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,960
Womanizer!

277
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,159
Could it be someone in our office?

278
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,599
Surnames that start with Y...

279
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:01,559
Yang? Yuan? Yan? Yi?

280
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:04,719
Name that starts with C...

281
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:09,640
Chan, Chen, Ci, Chun, Cheng?

282
00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:14,000
What kind of lousy name is that?

283
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:17,960
Y and C...

284
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,479
Yicheng?

285
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,640
Yicheng!

286
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:34,840
I'm losing my mind.

287
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:36,039
I am going insane.

288
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:37,960
That's because he looks like a girl!

289
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,520
Dad.

290
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,960
You haven't reported on the work.

291
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:49,840
Dad, if I ever lose my mind,

292
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,400
do not cut the funding to our company.

293
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,080
And do not

294
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:53,719
let Zitong inherit your wealth!

295
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,000
She will spend it all

296
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,320
or get tricked into some scams.

297
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,159
You sound like a mad man.

298
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,000
Such a mess.

299
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,919
Seriously?

300
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,047
(Lu Li, Programming Department)

301
00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:16,640
Isn't this her employee ID card?

302
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:19,000
She's always so careless.

303
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:28,719
Mom?

304
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,919
I'm right outside the building.

305
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,640
Which floor is the office on?

306
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:35,719
How did you find our office?

307
00:15:36,599 --> 00:15:37,880
Wait outside.

308
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,359
I'll go downstairs.

309
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:50,719
What is the meaning of this?

310
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,039
Is he rage-quitting because his client
keeps asking

311
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:55,640
to make changes?

312
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,080
It's hard to tell.

313
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,520
Maybe your lousy codes from last year
left a mess for him.

314
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,119
Where is Lu Li?

315
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:07,919
He just left.

316
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:09,440
Precisely speaking,

317
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,200
he took off carrying his backpack.

318
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:22,159
Hello.

319
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,679
I need to freshen up.

320
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,320
But...

321
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,520
Where is she going?

322
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:31,280
Mom.

323
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:33,239
Do you know the name
of your classmate's daughter

324
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:34,960
who attended the opening ceremony?

325
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:36,400
I don't remember.

326
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,919
Son.

327
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:40,640
Are you really in love with her?

328
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,880
Does your classmate have a son

329
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,599
who studied in my school
in the same major?

330
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:45,760
I never heard about that.

331
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,840
Why do you ask?

332
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,440
If you want to know so badly,

333
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:51,919
I could ask around for you.

334
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:52,799
It's all right.

335
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,599
I'm hanging up.

336
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:58,440
This kid has been acting strange lately.

337
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:01,359
At this rate,

338
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:03,880
he might never get married.

339
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,359
Another new series by
Director Yu Zhongzhong?

340
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,719
Mr. Jiang.

341
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:15,680
I need Lu Li's certificates
of qualifications.

342
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,920
He always forgot to
bring his certificate,

343
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,479
and his ID expired.

344
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,800
I'll get them from him now.

345
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:21,719
Don't bother.

346
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,920
He won't hand it to you.

347
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,199
Seeing you're always watching dramas
in the pantry,

348
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,599
I assume you don't need the office.

349
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:30,119
No, Mr. Jiang.

350
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:36,680
This is even more terrifying
than a horror movie.

351
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:40,479
Did Lu Li fabricate

352
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:42,319
his qualifications?

353
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:44,479
This looks nice.

354
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,599
Mom.

355
00:17:49,719 --> 00:17:50,520
What brings you here?

356
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:52,119
Stop dragging me.

357
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,319
Am I embarrassing you?

358
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,239
No.

359
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,959
But why are you here?

360
00:17:57,239 --> 00:17:58,280
I brought you lunch.

361
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,280
I also want to

362
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,640
check out your office.

363
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,079
If you can't handle the work here,
get the civil servant test.

364
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,319
Mom.

365
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,839
Everyone is working at this hour.

366
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:09,040
You'd disturb everyone
if you went there now.

367
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:10,319
But...

368
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:12,439
I just want to see the environment.

369
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,839
I'm not going in.

370
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,000
Outsiders are not allowed to enter.

371
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,119
If you want to see the inside,
I'll get you videos.

372
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,959
Mom, thank you for lunch.

373
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,920
I have work to do.

374
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,319
I need to go now.

375
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,199
Come back here!

376
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:26,079
Why are you running?

377
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,439
Mr. Jiang.

378
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,239
Have you seen Lu Li
from the Programming Department?

379
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,439
No.

380
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,079
Do you know where he is?

381
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:32,959
No idea.

382
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,239
I haven't seen him.

383
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:04,719
Have you seen Lu Li?

384
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:05,479
No.

385
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,319
Have you seen a girl in a dress?

386
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,520
No.

387
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:14,880
Where are you?

388
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,839
Is it something urgent?

389
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:22,439
When did you come here?

390
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,839
I've been here for a while.

391
00:19:26,439 --> 00:19:26,920
Mr. Jiang.

392
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,479
Do you need some water or coffee?

393
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,439
Yicheng.

394
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,439
I'm checking on the codes he writes.

395
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,079
Would you care to enlighten him?

396
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,319
Why didn't you answer my call?

397
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:41,839
I put my phone on silent mode.

398
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,040
It seems you two are closer

399
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:48,640
than I previously expected.

400
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:02,719
Mr. Chen, thanks.

401
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:04,319
You saved my neck yet again.

402
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,160
If you want to thank me,

403
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:08,479
give me half of your lunch.

404
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,719
Sure.

405
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,000
You can have it all.

406
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,560
Thanks.

407
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,439
Hello, madam.

408
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,640
How may I help you?

409
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,199
Which floor is the
Programming Department on?

410
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,800
May I know what this is about?

411
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,680
It's nothing.

412
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,239
This is my daughter's work pass.

413
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:54,119
She forgot to bring it.

414
00:20:54,239 --> 00:20:55,239
I came to give it to her.

415
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:56,199
Your daughter?

416
00:20:57,199 --> 00:20:58,359
You must be mistaken.

417
00:20:58,439 --> 00:21:00,920
There is no girl
in our Programming Department.

418
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:02,640
That can't be right.

419
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,000
See?

420
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:04,839
Check your records.

421
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:07,119
In a moment.

422
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,160
Well?

423
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:12,920
Did you get it?

424
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:15,719
(Lu Li, male, Programming Department)
Yes, it's Lu Li.

425
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,959
But...

426
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,640
A man?

427
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,360
(Lu Li, male)

428
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,560
Mom, I just got off work.

429
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,040
Why do you want me home?

430
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,680
Enjoy the soup.

431
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:50,199
There's another dish coming up.

432
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,000
Be patient.

433
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,599
Mom, what's wrong?

434
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:01,680
Why can't you tell me over the phone?

435
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:05,880
Dad, did you make Mom upset again?

436
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:06,760
I...

437
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,359
(Lu Li)
You forgot to take this to work.

438
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:14,959
Wait.

439
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,160
I have good news for you.

440
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:20,280
I just unlocked a new skill.

441
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:22,040
I've learned how to scan a QR code.

442
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:23,280
See?

443
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,580
(Employee's information)

444
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:30,839
This man looks exactly like you.

445
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,439
He even has the same name.

446
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:34,760
When did your company
hire a man like him?

447
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,959
I don't remember giving birth to a son.

448
00:22:41,719 --> 00:22:43,959
This must be some kind of error.

449
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,040
Don't lie to me.

450
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,640
That's right.

451
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,560
I want you to

452
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,160
reflect on your mistake.

453
00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:52,959
Eat your dinner.

454
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,719
We'll talk after this.

455
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:54,520
Don't help her out.

456
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:55,439
Forget about dinner.

457
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,160
Come here.

458
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,000
What's inside the bag?

459
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:57,719
Show me!

460
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:58,280
Wait!

461
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,040
Let go, Mom!

462
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:01,319
Stop dragging!

463
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,839
Why won't you show me?

464
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,560
Stop it!

465
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,439
Let go!

466
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,520
How witty of you to disguise as a man.

467
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,560
Had I not been to your office,

468
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,800
I bet you would keep us
in the dark forever.

469
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:26,920
That's right.

470
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:29,000
What kind of company is that?

471
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,479
Why must you disguise
as a man to work there?

472
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,160
It's easier to pass the interview
if I were a guy.

473
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,160
I didn't tell you because

474
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:38,760
you might disagree with it.

475
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,000
But you passed the interview.

476
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:41,479
You can be yourself again.

477
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:43,920
They all think I am a man.

478
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,920
If I did that,

479
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:47,160
it'd prove to them I had been lying.

480
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,359
She has a point.

481
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:49,359
Then hand in your resignation.

482
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,599
This isn't the only game company around.

483
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:54,079
Mom, I'm sorry.

484
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,239
I really like working there.

485
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:56,439
Do not argue with me.

486
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,800
If you still respect me as your mom,

487
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,400
make the phone call now

488
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,439
and quit.

489
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,359
Quit.

490
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:09,520
However,

491
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,439
I think everyone has
already got off work.

492
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,959
Whose side are you on?

493
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,479
Call them!

494
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:18,319
Call the office.

495
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,199
Go on.

496
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:19,800
Mom...

497
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,719
I like working there.

498
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,520
Stop.

499
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,599
Spare me your excuses.

500
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,959
You're not calling them.

501
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:27,239
Fine, I will.

502
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:28,680
Come on.

503
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,239
The password.

504
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:30,040
I'm not quitting.

505
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:31,800
Tell us your password!

506
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:33,079
Mind your hip!

507
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,359
Tell us the password.

508
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,800
What is the password?

509
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:40,760
Do you think I know

510
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,640
the password?

511
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,719
You're useless.

512
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:44,760
But...

513
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:46,199
Listen up.

514
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,800
If you don't quit now,

515
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,599
I'll go to your office myself.

516
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,920
I'll do it for you.

517
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,000
No, I must calm down.

518
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:56,880
The program hasn't crashed.

519
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,359
Exception handling is still an option.

520
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,319
No.

521
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,880
My top priority

522
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,560
is to prevent my mom's rage

523
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,760
from reaching Yicheng.

524
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,119
Otherwise, my hard work
would be for nothing.

525
00:25:07,199 --> 00:25:08,760
You could have calmed down a little.

526
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:10,599
Be careful with your hip.

527
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,760
See?

528
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,359
Finish your dinner!

529
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:15,719
Yes.

530
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:16,439
Let's eat.

531
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,680
Your hip...

532
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:26,560
Dinner time.

533
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,760
Finish yours.

534
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,400
But she is starving.

535
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:40,400
I'll send her the food.

536
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,719
You spoiled her.

537
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,880
She insisted on majoring
in computer science,

538
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,479
she refused to take
the Postgraduate Admission Test.

539
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Now look at what she's become.

540
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,160
She changed her gender
anytime she wanted.

541
00:25:49,719 --> 00:25:50,640
At this rate,

542
00:25:50,719 --> 00:25:52,479
we'll mean nothing to her!

543
00:25:53,439 --> 00:25:54,319
Say,

544
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,359
you can't lock her up

545
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,839
for the rest of her life.

546
00:25:58,119 --> 00:25:58,920
Right?

547
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:00,479
She is an adult now.

548
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,880
We shouldn't interfere with her life.

549
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,000
Furthermore,

550
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:08,199
our daughter

551
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:10,239
will understand your concern

552
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:13,239
if you're willing to talk to her.
Am I right?

553
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:15,199
Yes!

554
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,560
Come out, Li.

555
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,119
Explain to your mom.

556
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,680
Okay.

557
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:21,239
I'm coming.

558
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,119
Mom, Dad.

559
00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:25,160
I've made up my mind.

560
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,640
I should resign.

561
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,640
See?

562
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:30,079
Our daughter is a sensible person.

563
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,040
Come on.

564
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:32,920
Have your dinner.

565
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,640
Mom.

566
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,079
I'm sorry.

567
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:37,400
Does your hip still hurt?

568
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,520
Let me give you a massage.

569
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:40,400
Fine.

570
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,199
Be careful.

571
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,560
Slowly.

572
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,479
Let's enjoy dinner.

573
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,119
Mom.

574
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,160
Have some meat.

575
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:54,239
Don't you fawn all over me.

576
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,079
I want you to quit tomorrow.

577
00:26:58,719 --> 00:26:59,599
Mom.

578
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,079
Do you remember

579
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:03,560
when I was taking badminton lessons
from Mr. Li?

580
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:05,239
Sure.

581
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:06,760
Mr. Li

582
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:08,800
is a professional player.

583
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,640
And you?

584
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,920
You quit

585
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,160
in less than a month.

586
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,280
Yeah.

587
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:16,479
You scolded me for it.

588
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,040
You said I shouldn't give up halfway,

589
00:27:19,239 --> 00:27:20,439
that I must finish what I started.

590
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,239
Yes.

591
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,760
Your badminton lessons and your job

592
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:31,319
are two different matters.

593
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:35,680
Did you come out just
to play tricks on us?

594
00:27:36,719 --> 00:27:37,599
No.

595
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,280
Mom.

596
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,959
Just give me one week.

597
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,640
This is the first job I've ever had.

598
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,800
I want to finish my work before I quit.

599
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,040
You wouldn't

600
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,359
want me to be known
as an irresponsible person.

601
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,199
Of course.

602
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,880
We must never cause trouble to others

603
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,599
because of our own issues.

604
00:27:56,719 --> 00:27:57,199
Right?

605
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,640
In this regard, I support you.

606
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:01,400
Dad, dig in.

607
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,520
Okay.

608
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,640
Eat your dinner.

609
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:08,839
Here.

610
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,359
For you, Mom.

611

613
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:42,260
(Lu Li, male, Programming Department)

614
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,540
(Professor Li)

615
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,160
Why are you calling me?

616
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,000
Professor.

617
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,239
Do you know a student named Lu Li

618
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:03,640
from this batch of graduates?

619
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,239
Yes.

620
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:07,040
She was the junior

621
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,839
I introduced you to at the teahouse.

622
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,359
What's wrong?

623
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,959
Where does she work now?

624
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,439
I don't know about that.

625
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:18,359
But I was hoping she'd
further her study as a postgraduate.

626
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,319
But she told me she had other plans.

627
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:23,760
Okay. I'll visit you next time.

628
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:29,940
(Lu Li, male, Programming Department)

629
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,359
Let's see how long
you can keep this up.

630
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,680
Lu Li.

631
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,520
Are you all right?

632
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:48,599
You could tell us.

633
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,640
We are here for you.

634
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:51,560
Tell us, don't make us worried.

635
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,680
What's wrong?

636
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,199
What is it?

637
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,359
If your parents were
against your decision,

638
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:01,880
but you must do it nonetheless,

639
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,160
what would you do?

640
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:04,199
I get it now.

641
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,680
I get it.

642
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:06,719
Enlighten me.

643
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:09,839
Your parents don't like your girlfriend.

644
00:30:10,479 --> 00:30:11,119
No.

645
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,239
Stop pretending.

646
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:13,199
Drop the act.

647
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:14,640
I had the experience.

648
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,760
I know how it works.

649
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,640
Oh my.

650
00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:17,479
Listen.

651
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:18,839
My mom didn't approve

652
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,199
of my relationship with my wife.

653
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,680
But I used reason and love
to change her mind.

654
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,560
I used any means necessary.

655
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,680
I managed to persuade my mom.

656
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,839
My wife and I

657
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:28,119
are leading a happy life.

658
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,680
Old Ape,

659
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,599
not every woman has the patience
of your wife

660
00:30:31,719 --> 00:30:33,680
to squabble with parents for years.

661
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,680
(Plan A: swaying her emotionally.)
Do you realize that?

662
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,319
(Viability: 10%)
But I got it to work.

663
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,680
Then you should cherish it.

664
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,800
I do cherish her.

665
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,599
Yes.

666
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,040
I'm running out of time.

667
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:42,520
I need a shortcut.

668
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:44,239
Young man,

669
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:45,319
have some patience.

670
00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:46,920
It takes five minutes
to cook instant noodles.

671
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,680
It takes eight minutes to boil an egg.

672
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,920
If you find the right person,

673
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,079
you must be patient.

674
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:52,359
Am I right, Old Ape?

675
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,040
What's the fuss about?

676
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:55,959
Ask the parent who supports

677
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,000
to help you out.

678
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:59,400
If that doesn't work,
go to your grandparents.

679
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:01,719
If the whole family isn't on your side,

680
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,719
you're probably adopted.

681
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,920
I bet you tricked your parents

682
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:06,359
into giving you everything.

683
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:08,040
That's what I do whenever

684
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,119
I need new equipment.

685
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:10,199
It always works.

686
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:11,000
Smart.

687
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:13,319
For the sake of your future...

688
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:14,959
What's wrong?

689
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,580
(Plan B: Ally with the father.
Viability: 20%)

690
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,359
Is there any other solution?

00:31:22,439 --> 00:31:23,319
Let's hear it.

692
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,680
What solution do you need?

693
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:31,439
Mr. Jiang.

694
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:33,959
Show me what you wrote.

695
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:36,040
Some failed codes.

696
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:37,439
It's nothing.

697
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,760
Mr. Chen, you asked for me.

698
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:52,560
Sit.

699
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:57,680
You didn't have your lunch.

700
00:31:58,319 --> 00:31:59,959
I was going to ask you out.

701
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:01,520
But you went ahead with the others.

702
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,040
Sorry.

703
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,400
I'll buy your lunch tomorrow.

704
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,839
You kept helping me out,

705
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,160
I want to express my gratitude.

706
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,920
Deal.

707
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,239
Did you not sleep well last night?

708
00:32:36,199 --> 00:32:37,920
You look a little distressed.

709
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,680
Are you in trouble?

710
00:32:40,439 --> 00:32:42,160
You could tell me if you feel like it.

711
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,280
I might be able to help.

712
00:32:47,479 --> 00:32:50,640
My parents know I've been
disguising myself as a man.

713
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,079
They want me to resign.

714
00:32:54,479 --> 00:32:55,680
I see.

715
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:58,479
What is your plan?

716
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,880
It had been my dream
to work in Enchant Technology.

717
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,880
I like working here.

718
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,560
I like the people here.

719
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:11,479
I don't want to leave.

720
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:14,400
If you want to stay,

721
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,680
then stay.

722
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,760
Mr. Chen.

723
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,439
When you came to our school
to give your speech,

724
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,760
I was there too.

725
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:28,199
Chen Yiming?

726
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,800
It's my honor.

727
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,479
Mr. Jiang.

728
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:53,599
Were you enjoying your coffee again?

729
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:54,760
No.

730
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,839
Where were you?

731
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:01,719
Mr. Jiang.

732
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,680
Are you in a bad mood?

733
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,760
Answer me.

734
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,719
We talked a little.

735
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,719
What did you talk about?

736
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:12,800
Don't you have work to do?

737
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,000
Come with me.

738
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,760
Do I have to carry all of them
to the storeroom?

739
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:27,600
Yes.

740
00:34:28,959 --> 00:34:29,879
I'll get everyone here.

741
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,800
That's faster.

742
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,360
No. This is your job now.

743
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,239
Come on.

744
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,520
Is it heavy?

745
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,679
Not at all.

746
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,919
How about another one?

747
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:48,199
Get working.

748
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,439
After you unload this van,

749
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,520
there's another to unload.

750
00:35:10,479 --> 00:35:12,760
Sort them based on their categories.

751
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,159
Just speak your mind.

752
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:27,520
Mr. Jiang.

753
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,439
Did I do something silly

754
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:32,159
that upset you?

755
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,760
What do you think you did wrong?

756
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,360
Was the coffee too awful?

757
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,399
No.

758
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,439
The codes I wrote were too complex.

759
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,719
I shouldn't have entered your office.

760
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,760
Anything else?

761
00:36:22,399 --> 00:36:24,000
I'll let it slide today.

762
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:31,919
It's done.

763
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:33,399
Congratulations.

764
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,399
It's time to go home.

765
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,199
Mr. Chen.

766
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,479
Thank you for the help.

767
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,479
Otherwise, it would have taken me
another three hours.

768
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,360
Let's go.

769
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,080
We have another problem to solve.

770
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,520
What's the problem?

771
00:36:57,719 --> 00:36:59,879
(She couldn't have
finished it so quickly.)

772
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,239
(Did she get help from someone?)

773
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:32,679
Get rid of your wig.

774
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,919
It gets on my nerve.

775
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:42,000
Have some tea.

776
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,679
Thank you, madam.

777
00:37:49,479 --> 00:37:50,280
It's nice to meet you.

778
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,959
I am Lu Li's colleague.

779
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,360
This is my business card.

780
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,719
Okay.

781
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,353
(Chen Yiming)

782
00:37:59,399 --> 00:38:00,479
Director Chen?

783
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,159
Mr. Chen, may I know

784
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:07,600
you're visiting?

785
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,360
I'm here

786
00:38:09,439 --> 00:38:11,560
to negotiate for the company's interest.

787
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,040
Lu Li is an outstanding programmer.

788
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:16,360
We don't want to lose a talent like herself.

789
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,760
Thank you for recognizing her talent.

790
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:22,199
However,

791
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,479
I will not allow my daughter

792
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,919
to dress as a man only to get a job.

793
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:26,959
Madam.

794
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,840
The situation is only temporary.

795
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,439
I will persuade my superior
and resolve the issue.

796
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:34,040
Don't bother.

797
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:36,040
I didn't want her to be a programmer.

798
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:38,600
This is the perfect timing for her
to get a new job.

799
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,120
Madam.

800
00:38:41,479 --> 00:38:42,560
Are you worried the workplace

801
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:44,199
might be inconvenient for Lu Li?

802
00:38:44,479 --> 00:38:46,959
You have my word
I will take good care of her.

803
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:48,479
Wait.

804
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,679
Why would you do that?

805
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,320
Didn't she tell you?

806
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:57,399
She was a junior in the same major.

807
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:02,760
Are you pulling strings for her

808
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,719
only because you know her?

809
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,000
You got it all wrong.

810
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,239
The truth is,

811
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,000
I'm doing this with the company's
long-term interest in mind.

812
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:13,719
But I do have my personal reason.

813
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:16,000
I wish to work with her.

814
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:21,159
Not bad.

815
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,320
By the way,

816
00:39:24,439 --> 00:39:25,399
young man,

817
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,479
how old are you?

818
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,840
Do you have a girlfriend?

819
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:31,840
Mom!

820
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:33,520
Don't pry so hard!

821
00:39:34,919 --> 00:39:35,719
It's all right.

822
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:36,959
Madam.

823
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:38,879
I am 28 and currently single.

824
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,040
Where are you from?

825
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,040
I'm a local.

826
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,959
Great.

827
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,199
Indeed!

828
00:39:46,879 --> 00:39:48,760
Mr. Chen, I'm sorry.

829
00:39:48,879 --> 00:39:50,760
I think you just wasted
your time coming here.

830
00:39:50,959 --> 00:39:53,120
Perhaps you should go home
and get some rest.

831
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:55,879
Sir, madam,

832
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,239
I should get going.

833
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,719
I hope you reconsider

834
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,199
Lu Li's resignation.

835
00:40:00,919 --> 00:40:02,639
Feel free to call me for inquiries.

836
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,520
Mr. Chen,

837
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,600
even if it's not about work,

838
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,800
feel free to visit us anytime.

839
00:40:09,439 --> 00:40:10,120
Yeah!

840
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,560
You are welcome here.

841
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:12,280
Yes.

842
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,159
Thank you, madam.

843
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,639
I must go now.

844
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,199
I'll see you off.

845
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:17,919
Lu Li, come.

846
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,320
Yes.

847
00:40:18,399 --> 00:40:19,159
Okay.

848
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,520
Goodbye.

849
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,080
- Bye.
- See you.

850
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,719
Come again.

851
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,679
Stay safe.

852
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,320
Goodbye, Mr. Chen.

853
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,080
You talked about resigning,

854
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:36,360
then you brought your boss home
to persuade us.

855
00:40:39,399 --> 00:40:40,800
I have something for you.

856
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,520
What is she up to?

857
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,840
Who knows?

858
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,159
How should I know?

859
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:47,600
Mom.

860
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:48,479
What is this?

861
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,239
I picked this speaker for you.

862
00:40:50,399 --> 00:40:51,679
It's loud enough to cover wide areas.

863
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,840
A whole crowd can dance to its music.

864
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,439
See? It's cool and fashionable.

865
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,760
Those basketball brats

866
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,600
wouldn't dare to step on your turf
while you're square dancing.

867
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,000
This does look intimidating.

868
00:41:03,479 --> 00:41:06,479
It's much cooler than
the one our instructor uses.

869
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:07,639
Look at this.

870
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,360
It's pretty and cool.

871
00:41:18,439 --> 00:41:19,199
Sorry.

872
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,919
If you're trying to bribe me,

873
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:22,959
it won't work.

874
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,000
Take it back.

875
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,239
Take it.

876
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,520
Dad.

877
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:33,560
Wait,

878
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:35,159
you want me to have this?

879
00:41:36,479 --> 00:41:37,280
I...

880
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:42,399
Fine.

881
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,000
I'll safekeep it for your mom.

882
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,520
What a surprise.

883
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,199
Thanks.

884
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,320
It's still early.

885
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,439
How did you get so hungry?

886
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:09,159
I didn't have my dinner.

887
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,520
Where were you?

888
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:11,719
Why did you skip your meal?

889
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,239
Where were you?

890
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,080
Why were you

891
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,120
wandering around at night?

892
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,679
I had some official and
personal matters to see to.

893
00:42:23,399 --> 00:42:24,639
You've changed a lot.

894
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:27,080
Is it good or bad?

895
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,520
You've become very nosy.

896
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:35,199
Am I?

897
00:42:35,919 --> 00:42:36,639
Now

898
00:42:37,399 --> 00:42:40,520
you have the leisure to teach
your worker how to brew coffee.

899
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:46,199
I think you have some prejudice
against Lu Li.

900
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:51,040
You've known Lu Li for a long time.

901
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:52,280
Don't you think

902
00:42:52,959 --> 00:42:53,959
something is wrong with him?

903
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,639
Everyone has their own problems.

904
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,159
Lin Shutian is too arrogant.

905
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,399
Huang Renxun craves love.

906
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:01,080
Zhang Zhiyuan only cares about his hair.

907
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,679
Brother Lei has OCD.

908
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:04,639
Judging by the roster,

909
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,719
Lu Li is indeed different.

910
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,280
How so?

911
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,080
He has a clear train of logic.

912
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,760
Take this table for an example.

913
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:17,919
Normally,

914
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,159
Normally, we'd think
cypress furniture is durable.

915
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,760
But he would say

916
00:43:21,959 --> 00:43:24,639
the oil content is too high,
making the furniture flammable.

917
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,199
You seem to know him a lot.

918
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,919
Are you sure

919
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,479
you had never met him in school?

920
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:34,399
No.

921
00:43:34,919 --> 00:43:36,879
I only met him for the first time
during the interview.

922
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:40,800
Have a drink.

923
00:43:41,959 --> 00:43:43,639
This is tea, not wine.

924
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,120
(Computers never lie.)

925
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,199
(The human heart is
the same in this regard.)

926
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,520
(It doesn't lie.)

927
00:43:57,719 --> 00:43:59,520
(But people often overlook)

928
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,840
(the true thoughts that are
hidden deep in their hearts.)
