Run back.

24
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:58,080
Dad, are you not done yet?

25
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,239
Are we going to keep doing this?

26
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:00,519
I'm not done yet.

27
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:01,720
Keep going.

28
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:05,400
You've been practicing badminton
for ten years.

29
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:06,599
Why are you practicing serving

30
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,959
on a whim?

31
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:10,000
Yes. Can't I do this

32
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:11,199
on a whim?

33
00:02:11,559 --> 00:02:12,279
Sure.

34
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,800
You know what.

35
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,279
What you're doing today

36
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:18,679
is for your wife's sake.

37
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,080
Don't you think

38
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,039
it's worth it?

39
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,520
Yes. It's worth it.

40
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,320
I don't want you to overtire yourself,

41
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:29,800
causing your previous injury to recur.

42
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,559
Talking about my injury,

43
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,960
you know what.

44
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:42,520
Back then

45
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:45,600
your mom was obsessed with
playing the piano.

46
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,559
To win your mom's heart,

47
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,679
I put in an insane effort
to practice the piano too.

48
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:53,080
Eventually, I was diagnosed
with tenosynovitis.

49
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,839
Did you really have to do that?

50
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,360
That's nothing.

51
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,199
Let me tell you something worse.

52
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,520
Back then, there wasn't
a badminton hall like this.

53
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:02,119
Your mom and I used to play
badminton outdoor.

54
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:03,080
One day,

55
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,520
your mom got the shuttlecock
stuck on the tree.

56
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:07,520
I climbed up the tree
to retrieve the shuttlecock.

57
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Guess what happened.

58
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:10,279
I fell down from the tree

59
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,800
and fractured my right leg.

60
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,639
You need 100 days to recover
from a bone injury.

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,119
I was bedridden in the hospital for
a long time before I fully recovered.

62
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,759
Let me tell you.

63
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,240
Those are not injuries.

64
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,759
Do you know what they are?

65
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,960
These are the medals of love.

66
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,440
You still have a long way to go.

67
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,800
You haven't reached this stage yet.

68
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,320
You'll understand this after
you've picked up enough shuttlecocks.

69
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,919
Keep going.

70
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,559
Medals.

71
00:03:32,096 --> 00:03:33,639
(Jinling Sports)
Over there.

72
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,119
Yes.

73
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:35,520
You dropped it.

74
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,039
You threw away the others

75
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,559
just to pick up this one.

76
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,440
I told you.

77
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,839
The sneeze

78
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,320
has an ominous significance.

79
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,679
This is all your fault.

80
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,399
You said the system would crash.

81
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,960
All right. It's my fault.

82
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,440
This all happened because of me.

83
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,600
I should've expected this to happen

84
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,399
and prepared a contingency plan.

85
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,039
However,

86
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,399
when we upload something to the server,

87
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,080
it won't disappear

88
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,520
unless we delete it manually.

89
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,520
Lu.

90
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,119
What are you going to do next?

91
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:17,239
I still remember the codes.

92
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,519
I intend to rewrite them.

93
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,160
I'm afraid it's too late now.

94
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:25,320
That was what Mr. Jiang said too.

95
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,040
Mr. Jiang.

96
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,760
The competition is due

97
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,519
tomorrow at 8 AM.

98
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:41,239
Isn't it supposed to be 8 PM today?

99
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:43,119
This is your final chance.

100
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:48,279
Sure.

101
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:50,359
I'll be sure to finish it on time.

102
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,959
Thanks.

103
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,279
Koala Lu.

104
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,720
Don't let me down.

105
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:08,720
Lu Li, we're at your disposal.

106
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,559
What do you need from us?

107
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:12,679
You...

108
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,760
You helped me the last time.

109
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,720
It's finally my turn
to return the favor.

110
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:16,839
Lu.

111
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,399
I'll take care of the logistics.

112
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:20,920
I'm not trying to help you.

113
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:23,399
I'm only doing this for the others.

114
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,519
Great.

115
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,600
Let's fight

116
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,119
till dawn.

117
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,480
Get to work now.

118
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,279
Hurry up. We're running out of time.

119
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,279
Yes.

120
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,700
(Orange of successful coding)

121
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,460

(Orange of successful coding)

123
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,000
Are you done with work?

124
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:55,760
What's up?

125
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:58,519
I want to invite Mr. Jiang for dinner.

126
00:05:58,799 --> 00:05:59,959
I have to work overtime.

127
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:01,880
In fact, I need to work overtime too.

128
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:04,279
I hope Mr. Jiang can make an exception

129
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,320
and allow us to have a meeting
over dinner.

130
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,760
Is it about "Xuan Zhong Ji"?

131
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,600
Yes.

132
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,000
We can discuss it over dinner.

133
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,440
It won't disturb our work progress.

134
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,239
Let's go.

135
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,440
Shutian.

136
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,079
I'm done with the class and interface.

137
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:28,600
You can bundle
the animation of the characters.

138
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:29,839
No problem.

139
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:31,399
Lu.

140
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:32,359
I have something on.

141
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,279
I'll be right back.

142
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,119
Old Ape.

143
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,399
You don't have to come back for me.

144
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,200
How can I leave you alone?

145
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,519
We promised to fight together.

146
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,760
Wait for me.

147
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,600
Da Huang, I'll leave
the sound effect to you.

148
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,799
Don't worry.

149
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,720
Brother Lei.

150
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:44,519
I'll visit the Art Department.

151
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,200
Sure.

152
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:46,480
I heard that

153
00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:48,040
they have just opened a nice Italian
restaurant somewhere nearby.

154
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,399
Let's go there.

155
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:56,559
Lu.

156
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,320
Lu.

157
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,279
What stopped you dead in your tracks?

158
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,880
Nothing.

159
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,079
I'm going to the Art Department.

160
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:09,519
The headquarter wants us to
shorten the development time,

161
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,440
so that "Xuan Zhong Ji"

162
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,000
can be launched as soon as possible.

163
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:14,160
This is the best I can do.

164
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,480
I won't sacrifice the game's quality

165
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,760
for commercial profit.

166
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,160
I understood.

167
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,079
Therefore, I am all prepared

168
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,920
to handle the pressure on your behalf.

169
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,880
Thanks.

170
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:24,200
Anything else you want to say?

171
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:26,760
That's all for now.

172
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,679
Since we're done talking about work,

173
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,760
I'll get going.

174
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,959
Aren't we going to have dinner together?

175
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:34,320
I have some more work to do.

176
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,200
I'll just buy something
and eat it in the office.

177
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,880
Are you worried about Lu Li?

178
00:07:38,679 --> 00:07:40,440
I don't want her to cause me
any more trouble.

179
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,279
Therefore, I need to
supervise her myself.

180
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,119
You put in so much effort
to buy her more time.

181
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,480
What if she doesn't get the first place?

182
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,399
I approved her idea.

183
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,959
I have confidence in myself.

184
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:54,200
I have confidence in her too.

185
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:54,760
Besides...

186
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:55,399
What?

187
00:07:56,679 --> 00:07:59,000
Although Lu Li is still a fresh grad,

188
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:00,480
I see a lot of potential

189
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:02,079
in her.

190
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,399
I believe that

191
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,799
she'll definitely become
an excellent female programmer

192
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,239
in the future.

193
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,320
It's hard to hear you
speak so highly of someone.

194
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:12,119
If you are to compare the two of us,

195
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,799
who's better?

196
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:15,959
Your job focuses on management,

197
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:17,000
and she's a technical staff.

198
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,440
You can't compare apple with orange.

199
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,799
However, if you're talking
about dialectical thinking

200
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,799
and problem-solving skills,

201
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,040
she's better than you.

202
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:42,359
Take a break.

203
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,280
I brought you some food.

204
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:45,000
Take a break.

205
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:46,119
Here.

206
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,280
Let's go.

207
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,799
Eat something.

208
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,200
Thanks. I'm not hungry.

209
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:55,559
Since when did the Administration
Department supply overtime meals?

210
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:56,719
That's not what happened.

211
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,520
Our boss is worried about his lady boss.

212
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:00,239
He sent this especially for her.

213
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,719
You owe it to her.

214
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,960
Our lady boss is giving us
so much benefit.

215
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:05,840
Lu Li, eat some.

216
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,640
Thanks.

217
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,725
(Alarm)

218
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,520
How did I fall asleep?

219
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,799
Old Ape.

220
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,000
You're back.

221
00:13:33,119 --> 00:13:35,039
You were quite efficient.

222
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:36,679
You are almost done.

223
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,679
With my help, it's just a piece of cake.

224
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:40,520
Keep working.

225
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:42,039
I'll buy you breakfast.

226
00:13:42,359 --> 00:13:43,679
Thanks, Old Ape.

227
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,520
Did I manage to complete so much?

228
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:49,159
Did anyone of you help me with the code?

229
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,359
I guessed I helped you in my dream.

230
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,119
We all fell asleep.

231
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,479
I suppose it was Old Ape.

232
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,200
Judging from our progress,

233
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,919
we'll be able to finish it by 8 AM.

234
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,559
What are you waiting for?

235
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,520
Brothers,

236
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,080
let's get on it.

237
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,159
Come on!

238
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:09,719
Come on!

239
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,520
Come on!

240
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,119
Come on!

241
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,960
(A Hundred Ways to Kill A Boss)
One more minute.

242
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,000
Five.

243
00:14:48,239 --> 00:14:49,200
Four.

244
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:51,373
(Confirm)
Three.

245
00:14:52,119 --> 00:14:53,080
Two.

246
00:14:53,906 --> 00:14:54,613
(Send)
One.

247
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,460
(Your mail has been delivered)

248
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,119
Let's celebrate!

249
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,679
Let's celebrate Lu's victory!

250
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:04,039
Team A

251
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:09,039
always produces the best!

252
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,000
- That's great.
- I was surprised.

253
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,159
Mr. Jiang.

254
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:14,599
Mr. Jiang.

255
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,919
Mr. Jiang, you're early today.

256
00:15:17,239 --> 00:15:18,760
You made me worried.

257
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:19,799
Have you submitted the demo yet?

258
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,320
Yes, we have.

259
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,080
Mr. Jiang.

260
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:24,080
I tried my best

261
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:25,400
to keep my words.

262
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:26,640
I didn't break my promise.

263
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,479
Without their help,

264
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,239
you won't be able to do this alone.

265
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,159
I know.

266
00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:33,640
Mr. Jiang, we are a team.

267
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:34,080
Team.

268
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:34,960
We should share each other's burdens.

269
00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:36,320
We're just doing our job.

270
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,440
Well done, guys.

271
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:39,159
I'll give everyone a day off today.

272
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:40,000
Take a good rest.

273
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:41,960
Thanks, Mr. Jiang.

274
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:42,679
What do you know?

275
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:44,840
Mr. Jiang is worried
about his girlfriend.

276
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:48,080
Shut it.

277
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,799
This is my first time working overnight.

278
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:58,400
How are you going
to show your gratitude?

279
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,520
Thanks for your help.

280
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:01,880
I'll buy all of you a meal.

281
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,760
Great.

282
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:04,919
I want Japanese food.

283
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,280
I've been

284
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,400
craving sashimi.

285
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,840
We stayed up all night.

286
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,239
It's not good

287
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,719
to eat anything raw now.

288
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,280
How about hotpot?

289
00:16:15,352 --> 00:16:16,674
(I've transferred the money.)
Hotpot can be as expensive

290
00:16:16,698 --> 00:16:18,472
(When can I get the diamonds?)
as Japanese cuisine too.

291
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,440
I'm okay with either.

292
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,799
Guys.

293
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:22,359
I will skip this.

294
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:23,320
I need to run some errands.

295
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,320
I won't be joining you this time.

296
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,359
Old Ape, what's wrong with you?

297
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:26,719
Let's do this on some other day,

298
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,599
when everyone is around.

299
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,640
Please don't.

300
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,960
Don't let my absence ruin the fun.

301
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:32,159
Enjoy yourself.

302
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,880
Eat my share too.

303
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,320
Sure.

304
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,159
Leave it to me.

305
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,719
There's another problem.

306
00:16:41,119 --> 00:16:44,520
The hot spot restaurant is not open yet.

307
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:47,679
Brother Lei, don't stop
taking your medicine.

308
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,119
You can buy the ingredients home, right?

309
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,159
It's an economical choice.

310
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,159
Isn't it a good idea?

311
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:53,039
Yes.

312
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:54,840
Lu Li.

313
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,679
I didn't know you are this rich.

314
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:57,599
This size,

315
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,919
this location.

316
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,039
There must be
a huge amount of money behind this.

317
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:03,799
This is not my house.

318
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,319
I'm only living here temporarily.

319
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,280
You must have been
to Mr. Jiang's house before.

320
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,520
Is it a big house?

321
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,079
Why are you asking?

322
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,160
I hope

323
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,119
I can have what Mr. Jiang has

324
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,319
in the future.

325
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,760
If that's what you think,

326
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,640
you won't live to see tomorrow.

327
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,239
Can't you say something nice?

328
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,119
It's boiling.

329
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:27,119
Let's eat.

330
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,079
Shall we open a bottle of wine?

331
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:30,599
Let's eat something first.

332
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,400
The meat is getting overcooked.

333
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,040
Here.

334
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,160
Meat.

335
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,839
Five.

336
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:42,520
Four.

337
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:44,239
Three.

338
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,880
Two.

339
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,280
One.

340
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:47,920
Okay!

341
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:48,920
What are you doing?

342
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,199
So noisy.

343
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,079
Aren't you at the office?

344
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,800
I worked overtime yesterday.

345
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,280
I came back to pay off my sleep debt.

346
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,040
Brother Lei and Da Huang

347
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,959
want to eat hotpot.

348
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:23,520
What's so nice about hotpot?

349
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,119
I can't take spicy food.

350
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:27,040
I told you.

351
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,640
Soy milk and fried breadstick
are the best combos.

352
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,359
It's best if I can get another tea egg.

353
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:30,680
Yes.

354
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,520
As long as it's not spicy.

355
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:32,640
You...

356
00:18:38,479 --> 00:18:40,719
This is Mr. Jiang's house.

357
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:42,599
The most important thing is

358
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,880
Mr. Jiang and Lu Li live together.

359
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,680
We saw the forbidden.

360
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:49,119
Will he hunt us down?

361
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,800
I don't think so.

362
00:18:52,439 --> 00:18:52,920
It's okay.

363
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,760
We'll just put the blame on Da Huang.

364
00:18:53,959 --> 00:18:54,719
It all happened because he didn't
have a pot at home.

365
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,400
It has nothing to do with us.

366
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,000
Yes.

367
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:56,439
It's your fault.

368
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:56,920
No.

369
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,640
If that's the case,

370
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,280
Shutian was the one who suggested it.

371
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:00,040
How can you?

372
00:19:00,199 --> 00:19:01,239
You don't have a pot at home.

373
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,400
How can you blame me for this?

374
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,040
Yes. We're going to blame you.

375
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,000
If you had a pot,
this wouldn't have happened.

376
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,560
Why am I at fault?

377
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,760
Stop it.

378
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,000
You are blaming me
just because I don't have a pot.

379
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:15,640
Shouldn't you explain

380
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,359
why they are here?

381
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,880
There's no restaurant
available at this hour.

382
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,040
This is so spicy.

383
00:19:34,719 --> 00:19:36,239
How can your stomach take this?

384
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,719
I have medication for gastric pain.

385
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,239
I won't bother you with this.

386
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,719
Besides, I added in some vinegar
to neutralize the spiciness too.

387
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,199
Are you doing this deliberately?

388
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,520
I worked until 4 AM,

389
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:48,599
and I'm close to getting neck pain.

390
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:52,280
Did you have dinner

391
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,000
with Li Man yesterday?

392
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,599
What made you say that?

393
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,160
I will fulfill

394
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:58,839
my promises to you.

395
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,319
I know

396
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:07,839
this relationship may wear you out.

397
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:09,959
However, I hope that you can
fulfill your promises

398
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,680
as long as the contract is still valid.

399
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:14,000
After all, we are married.

400
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,400
What are you thinking?

401
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,439
Here. Have a bite.

402
00:20:20,439 --> 00:20:21,040
You can have it.

403
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,000
I'll go to sleep.

404
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,199
What's wrong with her?

405
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:31,280
I worked overtime to write
the codes for you.

406
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,280
I'm so tired.

407
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:46,359
Li.

408
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,760
Are you done with work?

409
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,319
You're done.

410
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:00,359
I dared not disturb you
for the past few days.

411
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,760
I just pulled an all-nighter,

412
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:05,160
and only managed to submit
the demo this morning.

413
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,560
I feel so sorry for you.

414
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,000
Who did this?

415
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,439
I'll tell Gu Mo to...

416
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,040
No. Gu Mo and I are no longer friends.

417
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,920
Let Jiang Yicheng find out
who's the culprit.

418
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:17,760
Jiang Yicheng has to
first believe what I said.

419
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:20,959
How has the fight between
you and Li Man been?

420
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,040
My mom told me that

421
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,479
in love,

422
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,880
we don't always get how much we give.

423
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:30,560
Now, I finally understood
my mom's words.

424
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:32,239
I won myself more time,

425
00:21:32,439 --> 00:21:33,880
but I couldn't win his attention.

426
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,280
How are you and Jiang Yicheng doing?

427
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,079
He left the office
with Li Man yesterday,

428
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,000
but he lied to me

429
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:44,040
and said that they weren't together.

430
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:47,079
Perhaps, they simply left work together.

431
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:50,079
I overheard that they were
going to have dinner together.

432
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,119
It was probably for work.

433
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:53,839
Forget it.

434
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,439
I don't even believe myself.

435
00:21:57,199 --> 00:21:58,800
Sometimes, I thought

436
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:01,119
if I weren't around,

437
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:03,640
they would probably have been
married to each other.

438
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,880
How can you tolerate this?

439
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:08,640
If someone's provoking me
in the office every day,

440
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,560
I'll definitely beat her up.

441
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,520
She is our company's investor.

442
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,400
For the company's sake,

443
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,479
I can't make it look too obvious.

444
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,079
Why do you still care about the company?

445
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,640
If you and Jiang Yicheng don't work out,

446
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,719
you'll be the first one
to get dismissed.

447
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:25,479
Even if I have to leave,
I have to clear my name before that.

448
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,959
I must find out

449
00:22:26,959 --> 00:22:28,199
who's the person that deletes my demo.

450
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,959
I can't be having bad luck

451
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:32,319
in both my career and my relationship.

452
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:33,719
Li.

453
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:35,359
Whatever decision you make,

454
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,160
I'll always back you up.

455
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:41,199
All right.

456
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,719
Let's not talk about all the sad things.

457
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:44,319
How is Momo doing?

458
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,920
Have you found it a boyfriend?

459
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,239
Yes, I have.

460
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:48,000
It was placed temporarily

461
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,959
at a pet shop in my area.

462
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,760
Its owner is out on an extended
business trip.

463
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:54,079
Therefore, I brought it home.

464
00:22:54,479 --> 00:22:55,599
That was really fast.

465
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,800
I'll pay them a visit when I'm free.

466
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,839
All right. I've got to go.

467
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:00,959
Take a good rest.

468
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,160
Don't overthink.

469
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,280
Bye.

470
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:04,599
Bye.

471
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:21,000
Momo.

472
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:23,359
Momo.

473
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,479
Mom has found you a boyfriend.

474
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,439
Isn't he handsome? Do you like him?

475
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,839
I have no idea what its name is.

476
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:36,359
Wait a minute.

477
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:51,599
(We are home, safe and sound.)

478
00:23:51,719 --> 00:23:53,719
(What's my son-in-law's name?)

479
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,880
(Tian Qi.)

480
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,239
(Please take good care of him.)

481
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,640
Momo.

482
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,119
Your boyfriend is called Tian Qi.

483
00:24:05,239 --> 00:24:07,000
Don't bully it, okay?

484
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:11,199
(Can you give me your address?)

485
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,520
(I need to send some dowry
for my daughter-in-law.)

486
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,640
Look.

487
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,280
I've found you a great husband.

488
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:18,839
From now on,

489
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,160
just enjoy your married life.

490
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:26,239
Be nice to each other.

491
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:02,520
Hi, this is my employee ID card.

492
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,680
I'd like to check
the surveillance footage.

493
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,680
Have you gotten approval
from your superior?

494
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:08,680
No, I haven't.

495
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:09,599
Then, I can't allow this.

496
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,079
The normal staff has no right
to check the surveillance footage.

497
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,880
Can you make an exception?

498
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:18,920
The Programming Department

499
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,079
has lost a very important document.

500
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,280
I only need to see the footage
at the entrance of our department.

501
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:25,760
Programming Department?

502
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:28,839
You are Miss Lu.

503
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,520
What's the date of the footage you want?

504
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,680
I'll get it for you.

505
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:33,119
Can I see it?

506
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:35,079
You are Mr. Jiang's girlfriend.

507
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:37,239
Of course, you're not
just any other staff.

508
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:39,479
Thank you.

509
00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:41,319
I want to check the footage
at our department's door

510
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:43,239
two and three days ago.

511
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:45,119
You know what.

512
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:47,160
You do share a tacit understanding
with Mr. Jiang.

513
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,359
He was here yesterday,

514
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,560
but he didn't get to see the footage.

515
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,479
Why?

516
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:52,599
The surveillance camera
stopped working two days ago.

517
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,839
It lost all the past footage.

518
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,160
Do you remember
who was working overtime

519
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,839
three days ago?

520
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:04,680
I can remember a few of them,

521
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,959
but not all.

522
00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:07,719
Tell me the names you remember.

523
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:08,640
Aunt Wang.

524
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:10,640
Have you seen anyone
entering our department

525
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:11,280
two days ago

526
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:13,520
when you were cleaning up the place?

527
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,439
I did.

528
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:17,560
It was a pretty young lady.

529
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:19,560
Which department is she from?

530
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,640
Do you know her?

531
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,439
I don't think I've seen her before.

532
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,880
She must be a newcomer.

533
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,359
Was it

534
00:26:28,479 --> 00:26:29,359
this girl?

535
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:29,920
Yes.

536
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,760
It was her.

537
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:32,800
Can you please take a closer look?

538
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:34,119
This is an important matter.

539
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:35,239
Yes.

540
00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:36,160
I found her unfamiliar,

541
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:38,280
so I sneaked a few glances at her.

542
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:40,640
Thanks, aunt.

543
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,520
Sure.

544
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,079
Yicheng,

545
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,199
have you signed the contract yet?

546
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:11,000
The orange has dried up.

547
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:12,119
Why haven't you thrown it out yet?

548
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:13,760
This is my lucky charm.

549
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:14,719
I can't throw it away.

550
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,760
Since when did you become
so superstitious?

551
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,320
(Orange of successful coding)

552
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:20,560
Lu Li made this.

553
00:27:32,199 --> 00:27:34,119
How could you just barge in like this?

554
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:35,000
You didn't even knock.

555
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:38,239
Is there something I shouldn't see?

556
00:27:38,439 --> 00:27:39,400
This is an office.

557
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,839
What are you talking about?

558
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:42,680
Since Miss Li is here,

559
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:44,079
I have a question for you.

560
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:46,479
Why did you delete my demo?

561
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,239
Why did you say so?

562
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:51,719
Someone saw

563
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,400
that you came to our department's office

564
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,439
the night before the submission.

565
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:01,959
I happened to pass by your office.

566
00:28:02,199 --> 00:28:03,160
I saw that your lights were still on

567
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,839
and went to turn it off.

568
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,160
Why?

569
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,760
Brother Lei has
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

570
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:09,079
He is in charge of switching
off the lights every day.

571
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:10,359
He has never missed a day.

572
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:12,560
We forgot to switch off the lights

573
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:15,079
and the surveillance camera
stopped working on the same day.

574
00:28:15,199 --> 00:28:16,800
This is too much to be called
a coincidence.

575
00:28:19,479 --> 00:28:21,839
You must hate to admit

576
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:23,079
that you made a mistake
and lost the demo.

577
00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:24,239
Hence, you started doubting

578
00:28:24,439 --> 00:28:25,959
all the coincidences.

579
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,319
However, you have definitely wronged me.

580
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,479
If there's any misunderstanding
between us

581
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:32,800
because of Yicheng,

582
00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:34,800
I can apologize to you now.

583
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:36,839
Stop trying to change the subject.

584
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:39,119
I know how to separate
work from my personal life.

585
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,560
We are talking about work now.

586
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,880
This has nothing to do
with my personal relationship.

587
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,079
Do you have any other evidence?

588
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:47,160
That's all I have for now.

589
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,160
How can you make such an accusation

590
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:52,239
before you investigate
the issue thoroughly?

591
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,239
I suppose you owe me an apology.

592
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,479
You're the main person
involved in this incident.

593
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,000
You are one of the suspects too.

594
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,800
I can also say that
she deleted the demo on purpose.

595
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:03,280
Shouldn't you be suspended
and pending an investigation?

596
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:08,479
Lu Li.

597
00:29:09,439 --> 00:29:10,479
Apologize to her.

598
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:17,920
What?

599
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:19,959
You left your work behind
during working hours

600
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:22,079
and barged into the boss's office
to question our partner.

601
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:23,640
Shouldn't you apologize to her?

602
00:29:26,439 --> 00:29:27,280
Fine.

603
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,439
It was my fault that
I acted impulsively,

604
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,199
but what I said was the truth.

605
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,400
Before you have any conclusive evidence,

606
00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:35,199
whatever you do
will look merely ridiculous.

607
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,479
For you,

608
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:41,719
she is always a trustworthy person.

609
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,280
We spend days and nights together,

610
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,079
and I am just the ridiculous one.

611
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,520
Lu Li.

612
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:48,959
Yicheng.

613
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,160
You saw what Lu Li did.

614
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:52,439
Although she is your wife,

615
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,319
she's certainly not fit

616
00:29:53,439 --> 00:29:54,760
to be the lead programmer
of "Xuan Zhong Ji".

617
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,160
We've reached a consensus.

618
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:57,400
We haven't got
the result of the contest yet.

619
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,880
Are you going to
break your promise already?

620
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,199
Fine.

621
00:30:01,479 --> 00:30:03,359
We'll decide
after the result is released.

622
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,000
However, Lu Li needs to be held
responsible for what she did today.

623
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:08,800
Were you involved

624
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:10,119
in the missing of the demo?

625
00:30:10,239 --> 00:30:11,119
No.

626
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:13,160
Good.

627
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:16,839
Then, I'll apologize on her behalf.

628
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:18,160
Is that okay?

629
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:21,359
Yicheng.

630
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,239
You know what I want is not an apology.

631
00:30:24,439 --> 00:30:26,920
Lu Li was really immature today.

632
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:29,079
Are you going to keep spoiling her?

633
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,199
She is mine.

634
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,000
I always protect her.

635
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:52,400
Mr. Jiang, are you looking for Lu?

636
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,560
Where is she?

637
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,119
She left two minutes ago.

638
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:57,160
Go back to work.

I don't know why Mr. Jiang likes you.

677
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,920
Do you think the surveillance camera

678
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,719
can capture my spot?

679
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,640
Whether it can capture your spot...

680
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:38,000
Why don't you
pay the surveillance room a visit?

681
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,839
Mr. Jiang ordered me

682
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,959
not to get involved in the investigation
of the missing demo.

683
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,160
After all, your inquiry is to no avail.

684
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:48,199
Stop embarrassing yourself.

685
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,280
Where is Old Ape?

686
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,280
Is he on leave again?

687
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,280
Mr. Jiang called for him
right after he arrived at the office.

688
00:33:55,439 --> 00:33:57,079
Oh, no.

689
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:57,760
What happened?

690
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:58,319
Keep your voice down.

691
00:33:58,439 --> 00:33:59,000
Can you be considerate of the patient?

692
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,479
You almost gave me an attack.

693
00:34:00,959 --> 00:34:01,920
Something happened to Old Ape.

694
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:03,280
The company wants to dismiss him.

695
00:34:03,439 --> 00:34:04,280
Why?

696
00:34:04,439 --> 00:34:07,000
It seems that Old Ape
used the name of the operation,

697
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,399
and did an offline transaction.

698
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,120
He bought diamonds
for the players under the table.

699
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,239
Why would he do that?

700
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,159
Have you cleared things up?

701
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,520
Old Ape won't do things like these.

702
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,520
I'm pretty sure about it.

703
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,600
Why...

704
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,399
Old Ape.

705
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,120
I did it.

706
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,199
What happened?

707
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,560
I'm too ashamed to talk to you guys.

708
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,479
I owe the company an apology.

709
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,560
Old Ape, tell us what happened.

710
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,280
We're waiting for your explanation.

711
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,199
Tell us.

712
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,919
My wife has been hospitalized

713
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,600
and is in dire need of money.

714
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,520
I tried

715
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,520
to invest in Bitcoin,

716
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:52,080
but I lost all my capital.

717
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,040
I borrowed money from the loan sharks.

718
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,760
Then, the debt collector came to me
once every few days.

719
00:34:58,639 --> 00:34:59,719
I genuinely

720
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:02,439
had no other choice,

721
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:04,239
before I resorted to doing this.

722
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:05,399
Old Ape.

723
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:06,800
An under-table trade with the player

724
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:08,760
will put you
on the industry's blacklist.

725
00:35:08,919 --> 00:35:11,560
You'll have to bear the corresponding
criminal responsibility.

726
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:12,560
Old Ape.

727
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:14,239
You could've let us know

728
00:35:14,439 --> 00:35:16,000
that you needed help.

729
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,879
Da Huang.

730
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:18,800
Both you and Lu spend
all of your monthly salaries.

731
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:20,879
Brother Lei has
to pay his mortgage loan,

732
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:22,560
and his medical bills.

733
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,280
You guys are already
pretty tight on money.

734
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,439
How can I bother you with this?

735
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:30,800
I've settled everything else,

736
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,239
except I have no idea

737
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,719
how to deal with

738
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,600
my wife's condition.

739
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,120
What's wrong?

740
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,159
We have our lady boss here.

741
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,800
Lu Li.

742
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,760
Can you interfere with the boss

743
00:35:55,919 --> 00:35:57,719
on behalf of Old Ape?

744
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,679
Please.

745
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,919
I only upset him yesterday.

746
00:36:02,919 --> 00:36:04,280
Don't be too hopeful,

747
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,639
but I'll try my best.

748
00:36:05,919 --> 00:36:06,560
Give it a try.

749
00:36:06,879 --> 00:36:07,639
Give it a try.

750
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:26,399
Come in.

751
00:36:32,439 --> 00:36:33,280
Mr. Jiang.

752
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,159
I have something to discuss with you.

753
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,000
Aren't you avoiding me?

754
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,479
It's about Old Ape.

755
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:42,000
Can you let him off?

756
00:36:42,479 --> 00:36:43,840
He is one of the seniors of the company,

757
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,120
and has been working diligently
for the company.

758
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,800
He has also made much contributions.

759
00:36:48,479 --> 00:36:49,560
He made this mistake

760
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,399
because of the emergencies at home.

761
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,159
Everyone has a fool in his sleeve...

762
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,360
Mr. Jiang.

763
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,879
This is his first time making a mistake.

764
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:00,760
Can you allow him to compensate
for the financial loss

765
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,320
and handle the issue internally?

766
00:37:04,959 --> 00:37:06,600
You are in a lawsuit yourself.

767
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,399
Yet you're helping someone else.

768
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:11,679
I think that's the best way

769
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,080
to solve this issue.

770
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,719
If we involve the police,

771
00:37:15,879 --> 00:37:16,879
it will affect the company's reputation.

772
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,080
It's not worth the loss.

773
00:37:18,479 --> 00:37:19,719
If we can resolve this in private,

774
00:37:19,919 --> 00:37:22,239
it'd be best for both Old Ape
and the company.

775
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,800
I disagree.

776
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:28,879
If we spare everyone
who makes a mistake,

777
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,840
there'd be no rules in this company.

778
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,600
Lu Li.

779
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:33,879
In your current position,

780
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:35,439
you should consider this issue

781
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,600
from Yicheng's point of view.

782
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,959
You shouldn't side with the man
who made a mistake,

783
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,560
and go against Yicheng.

784
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,840
Miss. Li. You're only a partner.

785
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,600
You have no right to interfere
with our company's decision.

786
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,639
If this is regarding work,

787
00:37:47,919 --> 00:37:48,840
I certainly have the right

788
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,879
to evaluate all members of the team.

789
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:53,360
For an unprofessional person
like Zhang Zhiyuan,

790
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:55,520
not only do I want to put him
on the industry's blacklist,

791
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:57,679
but I'll also hand him to the police.

792
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,719
He didn't make any mistakes
when he was working on your project.

793
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,199
Even if you want to kick him out,

794
00:38:01,439 --> 00:38:03,320
you don't have the right
to take any other actions.

795
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,800
If I don't have the right to do so,

796
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,959
you, as the staff of the company,

797
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:10,159
are certainly in no place

798
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,800
to interfere with
the company's decision.

799
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:13,479
Just because

800
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,159
I didn't take any action
against you yesterday,

801
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,280
that doesn't give you the right to
trouble Yicheng again today.

802
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,600
They are two different matters.

803
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,719
Are you done?

804
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:24,919
You're here to work for me,

805
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,360
not for someone else.

806
00:38:26,439 --> 00:38:27,520
Do you understand?

807
00:38:28,399 --> 00:38:30,199
Mr. Jiang, about Old Ape...

808
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,760
I'll decide what to do.

809
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,199
Get back to work.

810
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,360
Lu Li is too emotional.

811
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,800
Zhang Zhiyuan made such a big mistake.

812
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:43,120
How dare she side with him?

813
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,120
You've changed.

814
00:38:45,479 --> 00:38:46,639
What did I do?

815
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:50,360
How did it go?

816
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,479
Did you do it?

817
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,280
Don't feel too bad.

818
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:59,520
This is a serious matter.

819
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:02,479
Has Old Ape left yet?

820
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:03,879
Not yet.

821
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:05,120
He's waiting for you.

822
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,360
We plan to raise some money for him.

823
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,719
How much?

824
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,520
We don't have much money.

825
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:12,959
Each one of us will take out 5,000 yuan.

826
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:14,679
We don't expect him to pay us back soon.

827
00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:26,760
Zhang Zhiyuan had no other choice.

828
00:39:26,879 --> 00:39:28,000
It was just like what happened to you.

829
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:29,760
I thought you could think
in his shoes more easily.

830
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:33,959
I understood how he felt,

831
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:34,719
but

832
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,520
I think we should teach him a lesson.

833
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:38,080
This is our company's internal issue.

834
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:39,199
We don't need opinions from an outsider.

835
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,360
Why are you here?

836
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:43,399
Nothing.

837
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:00,320
Here.

838
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:00,879
What are you doing?

839
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,919
Why are you being all secretive?

840
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:04,080
I need your help.

841
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,600
Is my brother cheating on you?

842
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,719
No.

843
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,520
Can you lend me some money?

844
00:40:12,479 --> 00:40:14,000
Do you want to borrow money?

845
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:17,080
What are you doing
behind my brother's back?

846
00:40:17,439 --> 00:40:19,360
We're trying to raise a fund
for a colleague.

847
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:21,199
You can ask my brother.

848
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,000
Your brother is the one
who wants to dismiss him.

849
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,520
He'll never lend me that money.

850
00:40:26,479 --> 00:40:27,919
How much do you want?

851
00:40:29,479 --> 00:40:30,760
50,000 yuan? Sure.

852
00:40:32,439 --> 00:40:33,439
5,000 yuan.

853
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,360
Do you even not have 5,000 yuan?

854
00:40:37,479 --> 00:40:39,040
How did you survive?

855
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,800
We haven't got our pay this month yet.

856
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:45,280
Do you live on wages?

857
00:40:45,399 --> 00:40:46,639
Is my brother torturing you?

858
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,439
No.

859
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,560
Just transfer me the money.

860
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:49,919
I'll pay you back when I get my pay.

861
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,600
Sure.

862
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,560
I've transferred it to you.

863
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,399
Thanks.

864
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,959
Sister-in-law.

865
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:04,320
We should help each other.

866
00:41:04,919 --> 00:41:06,120
What do you want?

867
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,520
Where did Yiming actually go?

868
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:12,520
He's been avoiding me
for the past few days.

869
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,120
The only thing I can tell you

870
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,560
is that he'll be back
at the mid-autumn festival.

871
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:17,719
I've got to go.

872
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,040
Mid-autumn festival?

873
00:41:22,879 --> 00:41:24,479
Isn't that tomorrow?

874
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,380
(Xuan Zhong Ji)

875
00:41:40,439 --> 00:41:41,560
You don't have to try to please me.

876
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,600
I won't tell you where Chen Yiming is.

877
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:45,719
Jerk.

878
00:41:45,919 --> 00:41:48,000
No wonder your wife didn't go to you
even when she needed help.

879
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:49,560
What happened?

880
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,719
She borrowed money from me.

881
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:52,959
Reimburse me.

882
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,639
How much did she borrow?

883
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,600
5,000 yuan.

884
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,000
What for?

885
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,320
How dare you

886
00:41:59,479 --> 00:42:00,879
ask me about your own wife?

887
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,639
I'll give you 5,000 yuan more.

888
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:06,560
It involves another guy.

889
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:09,959
10,000 yuan.

890
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:11,280
Transfer it to me first.

891
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,900
(Jiang Yicheng)

892
00:42:20,959 --> 00:42:23,520
She's raising funds for her colleague.

893
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,639
Is that all I got
after I paid you 10,000 yuan?

894
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:28,479
Stand still.

895
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,120
What about this?

896
00:42:32,479 --> 00:42:33,600
You'll transfer
another 10,000 yuan to her.

897
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,159
Don't tell her I am the one
who gives her the money.

898
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,020
(Jiang Zitong)

899
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,980
(Jiang Yicheng)

900
00:42:43,959 --> 00:42:45,439
Without an angel like me,

901
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,560
how are you going to live your life?

902
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,679
Get it done.

903
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,260
(Xuan Zhong Ji)

904
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,280
That's fine.

905
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,520
You don't have to send me out.

906
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,639
Old Ape.

907
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,399
Sorry.

908
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:17,040
I couldn't be of any help.

909
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,239
Lu.

910
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,959
What are you talking about?

911
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,080
It was already very nice of you

912
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,560
to try to help me.

913
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,360
Besides,

914
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:27,239
don't be mad at Mr. Jiang

915
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,399
because of what I did.

916
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,719
Old Ape.

917
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,159
We collected some funds

918
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:35,919
for you.

919
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,040
We have limited capability.

920
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,320
However, if you encounter
any more trouble in the future,

921
00:43:40,479 --> 00:43:41,760
do let us know.

922
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:43,639
Don't carry the burden alone.

923
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,679
Sure.

924
00:43:49,479 --> 00:43:50,520
I'll keep this.

925
00:43:51,159 --> 00:43:52,679
When I have more money,

926
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,080
I'll return it to you.

927
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,000
Old Ape.

928
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,120
We are fine.

929
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,479
The most important thing now is to
take good care of your wife.

930
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,719
Son.

931
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:06,399
Men should live with their chins up.

932
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,000
After work,

933
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:09,239
go home early.

934
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:10,840
Don't stay up all night playing games.

935
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,399
You'll get bald.

936
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:18,120
I want to eat cookies made by your wife.

937
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:19,320
Sure.

938
00:44:19,479 --> 00:44:21,000
After she gets better,

939
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,399
I'll invite you over for dinner.

940
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,439
You can come to my place.

941
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,800
Brother Lei,
you're the most attentive person

942
00:44:27,919 --> 00:44:29,080
among the entire team.

943
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,800
Pay more attention

944
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:32,120
at work.

945
00:44:32,919 --> 00:44:34,879
However, you don't have to
put too much pressure on yourself too.

946
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,560
You can rest assured.

947
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,320
I'll take care of them.

948
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,919
Da Huang.

949
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,520
You're a decent guy,

950
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,320
but you should take care
of what you say.

951
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,000
Don't speak before you think.

952
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:53,479
Besides,

953
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,399
save up to buy a house.

954
00:44:55,639 --> 00:44:57,560
Otherwise, you'll not be able
to get yourself a wife.

955
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:02,679
This is my first time
enjoying your nagging.

956
00:45:05,399 --> 00:45:07,080
All right.

957
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,320
I wish you all success.

958
00:45:09,439 --> 00:45:10,479
Get bald...

959
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:14,360
Never get bald!

960
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,360
I'll get going.

961
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:21,919
Go back to work.

962
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:03,919
What's wrong?

963
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,520
I cut my hand.

964
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:07,520
There is gauze in my room.

965
00:46:07,719 --> 00:46:09,239
Wait.

966
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,800
I can't find any.

967
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,000
