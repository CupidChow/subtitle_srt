Look at what you did.

23
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:11,960
Darling.

24
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,000
Don't be mad.

25
00:02:13,119 --> 00:02:14,240
I'll send someone over tomorrow

26
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,520
to take back the building.

27
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,720
I'll take revenge on your behalf.

28
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,759
You can take back the building,

29
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:23,199
but can you bring me back
my daughter-in-law?

30
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:30,479
Brat.

31
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,199
What did I tell you before?

32
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,320
What did I tell you before?

33
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:35,000
As a man,

34
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,119
you need to be responsible,

35
00:02:36,279 --> 00:02:37,240
and hold accountable for what you did.

36
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,759
Did you manage to do that?

37
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,639
The scandal between you and Li Man

38
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:43,600
has spread across the company.

39
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:46,039
Is this how you treat your wife?

40
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,399
Did I give you a choice?

41
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,320
Did I give you a chance?

42
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:57,559
You didn't want me
to withdraw my investment,

43
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:59,039
and decided to get married.

44
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,279
Since you decided to get married,

45
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:03,119
you should respect your wife
and treat her well.

46
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,839
If you can't even do this,

47
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,399
how can you run a company in the future?

48
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,720
How are you going to run the company?

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,520
How are you going to run the company?

50
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,279
What are you doing?

51
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,360
He's a grown man.

52
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:11,800
You...

53
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,559
What are you doing?

54
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,320
Mom.

55
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,960
Come with me to Lu Li's house tomorrow.

56
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:26,759
Son,

57
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:30,039
you need to apologize to your in-laws.

58
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:33,119
They entrusted
their beloved daughter to us,

59
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:33,919
and...

60
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,199
I'll win Lu Li back.

61
00:03:36,679 --> 00:03:37,759
Really?

62
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,000
I've thought it through.

63
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,679
I like Lu Li.

64
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,000
She gave up so much for me,

65
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,479
and has never thought of backing out.

66
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,559
Now, I can do

67
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:53,800
what she did too.

68
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:55,919
Great.

69
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:56,960
That's great.

70
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:59,399
It's not too late
to change your mind now.

71
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,399
I believe

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,119
you'll definitely win Li back.

73
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,520
Son.

74
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:06,520
You hit the wall.

75
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:07,800
Does it hurt?

76
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,119
No.

77
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,399
I shall go upstairs.

78
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,640
What are you doing, darling?

79
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:30,799
I told you to lecture him.

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,040
Why did you have to resort to violence?

81
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,000
I didn't manage to control myself.

82
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,640
It was my fault.

83
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:44,959
Darling,

84
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,160
what are you doing?

85
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,720
I'm sure he hasn't taken his dinner yet.

86
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,119
How does it taste?

87
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:05,160
It's not bad.

88
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,200
Do come again.

89
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:06,720
Sure.

90
00:05:08,119 --> 00:05:09,279
Boss, I've transferred the money to you.

91
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,200
I've received it.

92
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:12,600
Boss.

93
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,760
A bowl of Chongqing noodles, please.

94
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,239
Sure.

95
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,160
Do you want the spiciness to be mild?

96
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,640
Medium.

97
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:19,640
Miss.

98
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:20,920
Judging from your accent,

99
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:22,239
I guess you're not a local.

100
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:24,480
I suggest you take the mild one.

101
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:26,160
I enjoy hot food.

102
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,760
Really?

103
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,000
Miss.

104
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,799
Listen to the boss.

105
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,799
He's being considerate of you.

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,760
The mild spiciness in Chongqing

107
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,200
is different from the one
you usually have.

108
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,399
Exactly.

109
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,640
Sure.

110
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,760
Mild then.

111
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,399
Sure.

112
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,760
I'll be right back.

113
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:45,760
Boss.

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
How much is it?

115
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,279
The noodles are here.

116
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:52,079
Your noodles and water.

117
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,440
I didn't order any drinks.

118
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,320
The handsome guy bought this for you.

119
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,720
He said it would be useful.

120
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,279
Enjoy your food.

121
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,600
You're welcome.

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,279
Weirdo.

123
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:18,880
Please leave.

124
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,239
Caixia.

125
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:19,720
Can we talk?

126
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,559
I have nothing to say.

127
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:22,760
Caixia,

128
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,760
I brought my son here

129
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,640
to apologize to you.

130
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,480
This is ridiculous.

131
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,040
Your first visit to our house
is to send your apologies.

132
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,040
I guess you owe your apology to Li,

133
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,359
not us.

134
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:37,799
Yes.

135
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,440
Yicheng knew that he made a mistake.

136
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,720
He will surely apologize to Li later.

137
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,040
Caixia,

138
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,359
as the saying goes,

139
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,440
you can destroy everything

140
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,640
but a marriage.

141
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,079
Besides, they are our children.

142
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,519
Here.

143
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,760
Let me tell you.

144
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,920
We are not the one
who destroyed the marriage.

145
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:55,920
It is him.

146
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,760
He is the culprit.

147
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,600
In-laws.

148
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,160
Please calm down.

149
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,079
Please calm down.

150
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:02,160
You can punish him however you want.

151
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,920
We only wish that,
after you vent your anger,

152
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:06,839
you can tell us where Li is now.

153
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,559
Let the young people
take care of their own problems.

154
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:10,559
Caixia, what do you think?

155
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,079
I...

156
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,799
Sorry.

157
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,920
We are busy.

158
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,679
Caixia.

159
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:14,040
Sorry.

160
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,640
Caixia.

161
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,079
Well.

162
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,160
What are you doing?

163
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,440
I know you too well.

164
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,320
Your bark is worse than your bite.

165
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:24,839
You were almost convinced by her words.

166
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,799
Do you want Li to get back together
with Jiang Yicheng?

167
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,440
No...

168
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:30,760
I...

169
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,279
It seems like

170
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:35,359
Jiang Yicheng is not completely
unconcerned about Li.

171
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,279
Son.

172
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:43,480
Do you want me to talk to them again?

173
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:44,600
Mom.

174
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:46,440
You shall go home.

175
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,799
Then...

176
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,000
They are having a fit of anger,

177
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,600
and I suppose they won't listen to
what we have to say.

178
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:54,720
Then, what should we do?

179
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,279
I'll stay here.

180
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,359
I'll wait here until

181
00:07:58,559 --> 00:07:59,880
they tell me where Lu Li is.

182
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:08,140
(Personal Resume, Lu Li)

183
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,239
You're great

184
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:13,079
and are apt for the job in every aspect.

185
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,359
Thanks.

186
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,320
Can I know

187
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,519
why did you choose to work in Chongqing?

188
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:21,799
You're from Xinhai

189
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,040
and you went to a college there too.

190
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,279
It's because of some personal issues
which I can't disclose.

191
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:30,160
I understood.

192
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:31,600
Then,

193
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,320
about the salary and benefits,

194
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:34,840
what do you expect from us?

195
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:37,080
I read your recruitment information.

196
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,919
I'm happy with the salary
you are offering.

197
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,080
However,

198
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,599
I have a presumptuous request.

199
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,039
What is it?

200
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,880
Can I not work overtime

201
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,880
unless it's necessary?

202
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:52,520
May I know the reason?

203
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:55,840
I'm pregnant.

204
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,359
Therefore...

205
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,200
Don't worry.

206
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,239
Other than not being able to
work overtime,

207
00:09:02,433 --> 00:09:04,873
I won't let this
affect my performance anyway.

208
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,599
About this...

209
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,400
I think

210
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,080
it'll be better if you can
take a good rest at home.

211
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:14,000
There's no need to rush
and find yourself a job.

212
00:09:14,479 --> 00:09:16,200
I just got pregnant and

213
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,520
I'm still fit to work.

214
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,159
Besides, you didn't state in
your recruitment information

215
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,080
that pregnant ladies are not welcomed.

216
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,960
Indeed.

217
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,320
By the way,

218
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,520
where's your resignation
confirmation letter?

219
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:32,200
Resignation confirmation letter?

220
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,400
The document that proves

221
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:36,880
your employment with your previous
employer has been officially terminated.

222
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,239
Do you not have it?

223
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,320
Then, we can't confirm

224
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:44,880
if you're still an employee
of another company.

225
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:46,719
Sorry.

226
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,119
We can't hire you.

227
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,559
I can get them to reissue it.

228
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,119
Yes, you can.

229
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,840
However, we won't
reserve this post for you.

230
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,239
Wait a minute.

231
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,760
Thanks.

232
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:40,159
Let me help you.

233
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,360
(Code Complete)

234
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,239
Where are you going?

235
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,400
21st floor.

236
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,919
Thanks.

237
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:03,440
Chongqing noodles?

238
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,719
Mineral water?

239
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,359
Yes, it's me.

240
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:11,280
Did you drink up the entire bottle?

241
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,799
No. The spiciness was just nice.

242
00:11:15,599 --> 00:11:16,960
You're pretty good with spicy food.

243
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,719
I've never met you before.
Did you just move in?

244
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,400
I'm Lu Jingwen.

245
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,880
Hi, neighbor.

246
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:32,000
I forgot to ask for your name.

247
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,679
Lu Li.

248
00:11:34,479 --> 00:11:35,679
Is your last name Lu too?

249
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,599
Which Lu?

250
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,840
Lu, the mainland.

251
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,799
Mine is Lu, the small alley.

252
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,159
Since the fate brought us together,
we should add each other on WeChat.

253
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,880
I left my phone behind.

254
00:11:47,599 --> 00:11:48,880
Just give me your WeChat ID.

255
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,280
I can't recall.

256
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,719
I've got to go.

257
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:55,760
Thanks.

258
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:04,520
Programmer?

259
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,640
I've never dated one before.

260
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:09,400
Interesting.

261
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,919
I was just about to call you.

262
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:22,679
Our hearts beat as one.

263
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,599
Are you feeling better?

264
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,159
Don't worry. I'm all good.

265
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,679
I got myself a new SIM card.

266
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,440
I'll send you the number later.

267
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,520
Sure.

268
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:35,479
By the way,

269
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,760
how did your interview go?

270
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:40,479
It started off quite well,

271
00:12:41,239 --> 00:12:43,239
until she heard that I was pregnant,

272
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:44,840
and changed her attitude immediately.

273
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:47,039
Because I didn't have
a resignation confirmation letter,

274
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,880
she used that as an excuse
to reject my application.

275
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,159
How could they do that?

276
00:12:50,359 --> 00:12:51,840
This is discrimination.

277
00:12:52,359 --> 00:12:53,599
Perhaps she thinks

278
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,799
that a pregnant woman can't generate
much profit for the company,

279
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,799
and gets to enjoy all the benefits.

280
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,080
Once they hire a pregnant lady,

281
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,320
they will have to bear
some unforeseeable risks.

282
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,559
Therefore...

283
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,880
Why is it so difficult
to be a working woman now?

284
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:08,520
Why don't men get pregnant too?

285
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,320
Why are we discriminated
just because we are married?

286
00:13:10,479 --> 00:13:12,599
Aren't they promoting gender equality?

287
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,679
No wonder people these days

288
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,280
are afraid of getting married
and pregnant.

289
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,359
Li.

290
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,760
When you attend another interview
in the future,

291
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,359
don't mention your pregnancy
unless you're asked.

292
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,760
I can't do that.

293
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,000
Isn't that deception?

294
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,239
How is that deception?

295
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,719
At best, you're only withholding
a piece of information.

296
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,679
I'm afraid that you won't be hired

297
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,039
if you are frank the whole time.

298
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,440
All right.

299
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:30,880
Let's talk about something happy.

300
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,239
What is it about?

301
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:36,719
Momo is going to be a mother soon.

302
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,880
Look.

303
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,760
That's really fast.

304
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,679
Yes.

305
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:42,960
I brought it to the vet yesterday.

306
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,440
It just got pregnant.

307
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:46,080
Then...

308
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,640
Is Tianqi still at your place?

309
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:48,799
Yes, it is.

310
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,239
Mr. Ye hasn't returned
from his business trip.

311
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,479
That's weird.

312
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,840
What's weird?

313
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,400
Who's there?

314
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,280
It's late at night.

315
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,679
I have no idea either.

316
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,280
I've got to go.

317
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,520
By the way,

318
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:04,640
can you go to the company

319
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,840
and get me
a resignation confirmation letter?

320
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,479
Sure.

321
00:14:07,719 --> 00:14:09,679
I'll go get it tomorrow. Don't worry.

322
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,559
Take care.

323
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:12,640
Bye.

324
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,159
Bye.

325
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,719
Who's there?

326
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,400
Lu Jingwen.

327
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:29,400
We met in the elevator yesterday.

328
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:38,239
How did you know that
I live in unit No. 2115?

329
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:39,919
Because I've knocked on
every door on this floor,

330
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:41,039
and none of them
who answered the door is you.

331
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,479
It's quite a coincidence.

332
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:44,239
I live right above you.

333
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
How can I help you?

334
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:47,960
Yes.

335
00:14:48,359 --> 00:14:49,559
You have a degree
in computer science, right?

336
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,000
I spilled water on my laptop.

337
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,080
There's an important document in it.

338
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,239
Can you fix it for me?

339
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:57,159
A computer science major
is not a computer technician.

340
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,400
I know,

341
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,719
but can't you fix this?

342
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,799
Then...

343
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,359
Come on in.

344
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:08,919
Thanks.

345
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,679
Shouldn't we blow dry it?

346
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,400
Why are you spraying more water on it?

347
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:43,760
This is alcohol.

348
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:56,440
How did you know that I'm
a computer science major?

349
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,719
No other professionals

350
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,760
read "Code Complete".

351
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,479
Didn't you say

352
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,799
that a computer science major
is not a computer technician?

353
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:08,559
You look quite skillful.

354
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,960
That's probably because
all my friends and family

355
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,880
like to place a glass of water
right next to their laptops.

356
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:21,159
Are you looking for a job?

357
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,100
(Personal Resume, Lu Li)

358
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,559
The University of Xinhai.

359
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,000
I thought you looked familiar

360
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:34,280
when I first saw you.

361
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,640
It turned out you're my junior.

362
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:38,400
Are you from the same university too?

363
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:39,559
Let me introduce myself again.

364
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,880
University of Xinhai, Creative and
Cultural Faculty, batch 2009.

365
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,559
Lu Jingwen.

366
00:16:42,719 --> 00:16:44,479
From now on, you can call me Senior Lu.

367
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,320
If you haven't found a job yet,

368
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:56,239
are you interested in
joining our company?

369
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,159
Are you hiring a programmer?

370
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,080
No.

371
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,440
We're hiring a network manager.

372
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:02,880
We are a film company.

373
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:04,959
What can I do there?

374
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,239
It's simple.

375
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,119
You're only responsible for the
maintenance of the company's equipment,

376
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,760
fix the broken computers,

377
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,079
and ensure network security.

378
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,359
There's no need to reject me
in such a hurry.

379
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,760
I'm not interested in
hiring just any programmer.

380
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,000
I saw that you were good
at fixing computers,

381
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,400
so I'm inviting you to join us.

382
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,239
The company is located somewhere nearby.

383
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,680
It's very convenient to
go to work from here.

384
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,319
Most importantly,

385
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,319
you'll get a decent salary.

386
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:31,359
Do I need to work overtime?

387
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:32,880
We have flexible working hours.

388
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,199
You can work whenever you want.

389
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,880
If you're efficient enough,

390
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:38,400
you don't have to work overtime.

391
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:43,199
However...

392
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,560
However...

393
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,000
(I'm afraid that you won't be hired)

394
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,439
(if you're frank the whole time.)

395
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,079
Why?

396
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:52,280
What other doubts do you have?

397
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,160
No.

398
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,119
I'd like to join your company.

399
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,920
Don't I

400
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,880
need to attend an interview
at the company?

401
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:05,079
This is the interview.

402
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,359
Congratulations!
You've passed the interview.

403
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:16,800
Why are you here?

404
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,640
Didn't you say that
you wouldn't be back for dinner?

405
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,439
There are some changes.

406
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,560
Where are mom and dad?

407
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:24,680
Dad brought mom out for a stroll.

408
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,359
I'm left at home
with this plate of crabs.

409
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:30,040
You're back just in time.

410
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,599
Can you tie my hair up for me?

411
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,839
I can't eat like this.

412
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:10,880
Why are you standing there in a daze?

413
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,199
Hurry up.

414
00:19:12,479 --> 00:19:13,880
Where did you get this hair tie?

415
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:17,040
If I remember correctly,

416
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,119
I bought it
when I went shopping with Lu Li.

417
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,000
We each bought one.

418
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:21,079
What's wrong?

419
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,119
Li Man.

420
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm Lu Li.

421
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,359
It wasn't a dream.

422
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,719
It was really her.

423
00:19:38,959 --> 00:19:40,199
Who?

424
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:41,359
What dream?

425
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:42,760
Hurry up and tie up my hair for me.

426
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,920
I can't eat like this.

427
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,839
Hurry up.

453
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,359
Good morning, Mr. Lu.

454
00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:53,680
Good morning.

455
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,160
Are you going to wear this to work?

456
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,359
What's wrong with this attire?

457
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,520
We are a film company,

458
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:05,280
and are different
from a sci-tech company.

459
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,560
Our staff has to be presentable.

460
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,680
Do you understand?

461
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,280
After all, I'm just a network manager.

462
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,760
A network manager is
a staff of the company too.

463
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,040
Your personal image reflects
the company's image.

464
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:16,760
Of course,

465
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,119
I'm not criticizing your image.

466
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:19,359
I'm simply saying

467
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,040
that your plain outfit

468
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,640
doesn't suit the company's culture.

469
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:24,439
Our company is after

470
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,920
exceptionality and uniqueness.

471
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,719
Come on.

472
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:28,239
Be more creative.

473
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,560
This is what I usually wear.

474
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,040
Don't worry.

475
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:35,400
I'll give you a makeover.

476
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:38,160
Mr. Lu.

477
00:22:38,439 --> 00:22:39,839
For me,

478
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,520
I prefer my attire to be clean and neat.

479
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,079
What I like

480
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,400
is more important than
what others think.

481
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:46,479
Of course,

482
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,239
if there's a special occasion,

483
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,719
I will compromise too.

484
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:50,719
However,

485
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,520
if you want me to
wear something uncomfortable,

486
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,560
I won't be happy at work.

487
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,680
You're saying...

488
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,920
If you insist on giving me a makeover,

489
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:08,239
I won't be able to
accept this job offer.

490
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,520
I'm sorry.

491
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,640
You're cool.

492
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:16,000
I like you.

493
00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:19,920
Let's go.

494
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,719
You'll be late if you don't hurry.

495
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:37,160
I'm really here

496
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,439
to get the resignation confirmation
letter for your staff.

497
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:40,000
Let me in, please.

498
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:41,199
Sorry.

499
00:23:41,439 --> 00:23:43,239
I can't let you in
unless you've made an appointment.

500
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,239
Why not?

501
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:45,680
I went in the last time.

502
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,800
That was probably because
I wasn't around,

503
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:50,640
but I'm here right now.

504
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,439
Therefore, you can only go in
if you have an appointment.

505
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,359
Gu.

506
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,359
I'm at your company's front desk.

507
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,239
Get here in ten seconds.

508
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,439
Xiaoqi.

509
00:24:17,479 --> 00:24:18,560
What took you so long?

510
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,199
I have something on.

511
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,599
You've finally unblocked me.

512
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,800
That is only temporary.

513
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,239
I'll block you again later.

514
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,800
Director Gu, she...

515
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,920
I know her.

516
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,920
Miss Yezi.

517
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,560
It's all done.

518
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:41,920
Great.

519
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:42,839
Thanks.

520
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,560
There's no need for thanks.
Family takes care of family.

521
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:47,280
Yes.

522
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,319
I'm telling you.

523
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:57,119
I'm no longer
the young girl from before.

524
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:59,199
You can't coax me with just a hairpin.

525
00:24:59,719 --> 00:25:01,280
I'm not buying this for you.

526
00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:02,959
This is for my girlfriend.

527
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,800
By the way, Xiaoqi,

528
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:08,439
if you don't have a plan later
in the afternoon,

529
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,000
let's have lunch together.

530
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,000
We're not on good terms.

531
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,000
That's not what I meant.

532
00:25:17,239 --> 00:25:19,520
I want to officially
introduce Yezi to you.

533
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,719
Director Gu,

534
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,760
you are too wise.

535
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:43,239
I'll bring someone here later.

536
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:44,079
Can you help me

537
00:25:44,199 --> 00:25:45,520
put on an act before her?

538
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,319
I feel so sorry for Xiaoqi.

539
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:10,959
Hi.

540
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,920
This way.

541
00:26:13,479 --> 00:26:13,839
Sorry.

542
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,199
I'm sorry.

543
00:26:14,719 --> 00:26:15,319
Sorry.

544
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:16,520
It's okay.

545
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,880
Man.

546
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,079
My daughter.

547
00:26:20,239 --> 00:26:20,520
She...

548
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,400
She is my daughter.

549
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,359
Can I just say a few words to her?

550
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:25,280
Why are you here?

551
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,319
They brought me here for a checkup.

552
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:32,439
I knew you wouldn't be released so soon.

553
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,880
Man.

554
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,119
Are you feeling unwell?

555
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:37,119
Stop pretending that you care about me.

556
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,000
It disgusts me.

557
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,400

00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,040
This is the one.

There were a couple.

595
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,920
The wife gave birth to a boy
the size of a thumb.

596
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:26,479
Therefore, she named him Thumb.

598

Thumb saw how tirelessly
his father worked

599
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:32,280
to get firewood
from the mountains every day.

600
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,959
He told his father,

601
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,040
"Father.

602
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,719
Allow me to tag along.

603
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,520
I'll help you."

604
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,239
Thumb told his father
to sit in the carriage,

605
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,000
and he climbed to
the horse's ears by himself.

00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:06,599

616
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,520
What's the matter?

617
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,439
I overheard mom
on the phone this morning.

618
00:31:12,719 --> 00:31:14,800
It seems like she's arranging
another blind date for you.

619
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,880
What?

620
00:31:16,199 --> 00:31:18,079
Is Aunt in such a hurry?

621
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,359
You don't know my mom at all.

622
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,719
If she wasn't in such a hurry,

623
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,400
my brother wouldn't have married
my sister-in-law.

624
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:26,880
What I meant is...

625
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,199
Don't underestimate

626
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:30,479
a middle-aged woman's executive ability.

627
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,800
Doesn't mom like Lu Li a lot?

628
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:34,160
Why is she arranging
another blind date for me?

629
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:35,280
Yicheng.

630
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:38,160
You've been working overtime every day.

631
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:38,959
Even I worry about you,

632
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,239
let alone mom.

633
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,719
Although mom likes Lu Li,

634
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:43,319
she cares for you even more.

635
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,640
Therefore, she will certainly
figure out a way

636
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,239
to divert your attention.

637
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,000
You can't be waiting for Lu Li forever.

638
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,680
I'm not attending the blind date.

639
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,000
You have to figure that out yourself.

640
00:31:54,239 --> 00:31:55,439
Anyway, I've already shared
the information with you.

641
00:31:55,719 --> 00:31:56,520
I'm telling you.

642
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,199
There's nothing mom can't do.

643
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,800
Perhaps,

644
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,800
you should figure out how to avoid this.

645
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,359
This...

646
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,719
He can't be hiding forever.

647
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,160
Even if he refuses to
answer the phone and go home,

648
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:12,479
he has to go to work too, right?

649
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,800
Why not you go on a business trip?

650
00:32:16,479 --> 00:32:17,280
A business trip?

651
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,520
Didn't I just tell you?

652
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:19,359
Lu Jingwen's company

653
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:20,920
has the intention to purchase
the broadcasting rights of "Boss".

654
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,319
I planned to pay him a visit.

655
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:23,520
Now...

656
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:24,920
I'll go.

657
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:36,680
Yiming.

658
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,680
When we work together, we are perfect,

659
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:42,000
impeccable and invincible.

660
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:44,319
I worry about your brother's health.

661
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:45,839
He should take a breather,

662
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,479
lest he gets stuck in a blind alley.

663
00:32:48,239 --> 00:32:50,359
If he knew what was going to happen,
he shouldn't have done what he did.

664
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,319
What's more foolish than Lu Li
having a crush on him for five years

665
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,400
is that they both had feelings
for each other.

666
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,439
In fact, it's a happy thing

667
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,800
to have someone to like.

668
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,640
Yes.

669
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,119
That's why I'm always happy.

670
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,280
Zitong.

671
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,520
Don't say anything,

672
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,680
if you're not going to say
what I want to hear.

673
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:16,359
Look.

674
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:18,079
My brother didn't cherish

675
00:33:18,239 --> 00:33:19,760
the things he had,

676
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,599
and regretted only after he lost it.

677
00:33:22,239 --> 00:33:24,040
If you don't cherish me,

678
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:25,599
you'll definitely regret it
in the future.

679
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,040
I cherish you,

680
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:28,479
but...

681
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:29,479
Promise me.

682
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,439
When you're finally ready
for a relationship,

683
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,119
I shall be your first choice.

684
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:17,600
This smells so good.

685
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:19,399
Do you mind if I join you?

686
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:22,080
You have meats and vegetables.
What a balanced diet.

687
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,439
It seems like you are a healthy person.

688
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,320
Do you have wine glasses?

689
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:26,639
I don't drink.

690
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,840
Then, I'll drink it by myself.

691
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:28,360
Take a seat.

692
00:34:28,439 --> 00:34:29,040
Let's eat.

693
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,239
Take a seat.

694
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:33,040
Fine wine, beauty,

695
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,000
and good food.

696
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,760
What a night.

697
00:34:42,959 --> 00:34:44,520
The night sky is really beautiful tonight.

698
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,760
Can you see the moon from here?

699
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:48,959
No.

700
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:49,679
That's why

701
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,360
we're going to the rooftop

702
00:34:51,479 --> 00:34:52,840
to enjoy the moonlight.

703
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,879
It's a crescent moon tonight.

704
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,600
The moon moves
from the east to the west.

705
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,399
At this point, you can't see
the moon from the rooftop.

706
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,760
Most importantly,
there are a lot of mosquitoes out there.

707
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,760
Junior,

708
00:35:04,919 --> 00:35:06,600
you're too unromantic.

709
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,679
I simply don't know what to say.

710
00:35:14,919 --> 00:35:16,239
A conversation

711
00:35:16,479 --> 00:35:18,600
needs the participation of both parties.

712
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,439
Am I right?

713
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,080
You can't kill the conversation
just like that.

714
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:22,439
That really embarrassed me.

715
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:23,679
I'll try my best.

716
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,560
It's been a while
since you joined our company.

717
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:34,639
You go to work and leave work
on time every day.

718
00:35:34,879 --> 00:35:36,320
You never join
your colleagues' gatherings.

719
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,800
You are too disciplined

720
00:35:37,919 --> 00:35:39,520
that you don't look like
other girls of your age.

721
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:46,520
I'm sure you have a story to tell.

722
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,919
Do you want to tell me about it?

723
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,919
I don't like telling stories.

724
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:56,760
Again.

725
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,840
It's so difficult to talk to you.

726
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,560
I had a crush on someone,

727
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,479
and it lasted for five years.

728
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,600
Really?

729
00:36:13,439 --> 00:36:14,560
Then?

730
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,560
Something happened and I gave up.

731
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,320
That's why I am here.

732
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,719
Oh, my God.

733
00:36:23,959 --> 00:36:26,159
You had a crush on a person
for five years.

734
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:27,840
You're truly a rare one.

735
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:29,199
I was right.

736
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:30,879
Tell me.

737
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,159
How is the person like?

738
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,360
Do you have his photo?

739
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,919
No.

740
00:36:44,439 --> 00:36:45,360
Hey, what's wrong?

741
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:49,239
He is coming.

742
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,280
I see.

743
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,360
Interesting.

744
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,000
Junior,

745
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,919
guess what.

746
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,760
The buddy I hated the most
when I was in college

747
00:37:05,399 --> 00:37:06,760
is paying our company a visit.

748
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:09,000
Then?

749
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,080
He'll be here soon.

750
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:22,840
Have you found out what went wrong?

751
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,639
Look.

752
00:37:24,959 --> 00:37:26,479
The fan is too dusty.

753
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,879
That's why you couldn't turn it on.

754
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,080
Clean this and it'll be all right.

755
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:31,040
You're so good at this.

756
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,320
You are a girl and you know
how to fix computers.

757
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,320
What's so great about this?

758
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,639
Isn't that a network manager's job?

759
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:38,719
Zhong Yao.

760
00:37:38,879 --> 00:37:40,199
Go prepare the tea.

761
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,600
Mr. Lu and the guest will be here soon.

762
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,399
I hope everyone can stay
at their own workstations.

763
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,959
Don't walk around.

764
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,520
Didn't you hear me?

765
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:54,040
Yes, Miss Gao.

766
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:03,760
Hi, Mr. Lu.

767
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,679
Hi, Mr. Lu.

768
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,159
Mr. Jiang.

769
00:38:06,919 --> 00:38:08,800
Welcome to Wenjing Film.

770
00:38:09,479 --> 00:38:10,439
Let me show you around.

771
00:38:10,672 --> 00:38:12,073
This is our Administration Department.

772
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,280
The Editing Department.

773
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,239
Gao Xi.

774
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,520
Follow me to the office.

775
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,800
This is our conference room

776
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:23,120
where we usually conduct our meetings.

777
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,639
I don't have other requests,

778
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,639
except I want to be Party A.

779
00:38:29,919 --> 00:38:31,840
You can keep the title to yourself.

780
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:33,479
I only care about the final results.

781
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,399
So many years have passed,

782
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,280
and you still never put yourself
at a disadvantage.

783
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,199
I'll leave the rest to Yiming later.

784
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,159
I won't be here anymore.

785
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,239
Sure.

786
00:38:43,399 --> 00:38:44,919
He is much friendlier than you.

787
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,120
Mr. Jiang,

788
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,199
do you have any requests for the hotel?

789
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,639
I will make a reservation for you.

790
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:51,280
There's no need to spend that money.

791
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:53,000
He'll be staying at my place tonight.

792
00:38:53,479 --> 00:38:54,919
Do you know why the persons you liked

793
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,360
didn't like you back?

794
00:38:57,879 --> 00:38:59,399
Because you're too stingy.

795
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,639
I'm being very polite

796
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,239
for not kicking you,
my rival in love, out of my house.

797
00:39:05,399 --> 00:39:07,120
Remember to bring a bottle of wine
when you check-in.

798
00:39:07,399 --> 00:39:10,840
Tonight, I'm going to reimburse
all the money you took from me.

799
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,560
Then, you'll have
stomach bleeding as well.

800
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:55,560
Wait a minute.

801
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,159
Thanks.

802
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,360
Why is he here?

803
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,959
Could it be that...

804
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:17,000
No way.

805
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:19,479
He couldn't have found out
that I'm here in Chongqing.

806
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:30,439
I'm not drinking.

807
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,600
We haven't seen each other for a very
long time. You have to drink some.

808
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,639
Pick one.

809
00:40:49,879 --> 00:40:50,560
Sure.

810
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,439
This is too boring.

811
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:55,479
When we were in college,

812
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,159
you were never interested
in entertainment.

813
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:00,000
You're always either developing
an application or a game.

814
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:01,679
How did those girls fall for you?

815
00:41:01,919 --> 00:41:04,399
They overlooked a gem like me
because of you.

816
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,040
Yes.

817
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,399
Why did they like me?

818
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,479
I sense gossip.

819
00:41:14,959 --> 00:41:15,639
What's wrong?

820
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,560
Have you finally got yourself
a girlfriend after three years?

821
00:41:17,919 --> 00:41:18,800
Girlfriend?

822
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,199
No.

823
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,639
I should've known.

824
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,320
You're always happy
accepting those women's attention.

825
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:26,919
Isn't our Gao Xi beautiful?

826
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,280
I saw her sneaking glances at you.

827
00:41:28,399 --> 00:41:29,760
Yet you didn't even bother
to look at her.

828
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,800
How did you see I was enjoying it?

829
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,320
With both of my eyes.

830
00:41:33,919 --> 00:41:34,760
Forget about everything else.

831
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,919
When we were in college,

832
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,679
the most beautiful girls in the foreign
language faculty and the finance school

833
00:41:38,919 --> 00:41:40,719
were my favorite girls,

834
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,919
and all of them were after you.

835
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,959
The worst thing was that
you ignored them.

836
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,439
I was really displeased.

837
00:41:47,919 --> 00:41:50,280
That's why I sow what I reap.

838
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,239
Coincidentally, a junior
from our university

839
00:41:57,479 --> 00:41:59,000
lives downstairs.

840
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:00,479
It's boring to drink by ourselves.

841
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:02,120
Shall I invite her over?

842
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:03,159
It won't be appropriate.

843
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,879
We're only going to have a chat.
How is that inappropriate?

844
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:08,679
I won't allow you

845
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,000
to have any thoughts on her.

846
00:42:10,439 --> 00:42:11,159
I have something to do tomorrow

847
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:11,919
and I need to get up early.

848
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:13,760
Don't leave yet.

849
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:15,719
We haven't done with the wine.

850
00:42:15,919 --> 00:42:16,959
Besides, I want to see

851
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,120
how you look like when you're drunk.

852
00:42:18,479 --> 00:42:19,520
Believe me.

853
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:21,000
You'll never want to find out.

854
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:26,719
I told someone
to buy you some local specialties.

855
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,000
Remember to bring it home tomorrow.

856
00:42:28,399 --> 00:42:29,439
Thanks.

857

859
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:20,320
(I guess he's here for a business trip.)

860
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,879
(I suppose)

861
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,560
(we won't run into each other again.)

862
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:42,919
Mr. Jiang.

863
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:43,879
Can I help you?

864
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,600
This is the surveillance footage
you told me to restore before.

865
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,280
The saboteur is definitely
a professional.

866
00:44:52,399 --> 00:44:54,399
I tried many methods
before I could finally restore it.

867
00:44:55,719 --> 00:44:57,879
Guess who I saw in the footage?

868
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,000
Li Man.

869
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,280
Exactly.

870
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,479
She stayed at our office
for ten minutes.

871
00:45:03,639 --> 00:45:05,439
The lights were off all the time.

872
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,959
How could she say that she was
just there to switch off the light?

873
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,399
Mr. Jiang.

874
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:11,120
Let's hand this over to EG.

875
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,040
We owe Lu Li an explanation.

876
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:14,879
I understood.

877
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:16,280
I will take care of this.

878
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:19,840
Mr. Jiang,

879
00:45:20,199 --> 00:45:21,719
will you clear Lu Li's name?

880
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,320
I will pay her back

881
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,239
what I owed her, bit by bit.
