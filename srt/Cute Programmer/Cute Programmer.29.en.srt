Keep this.

00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:58,839
Sure.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,760
Mr. Lu.

26
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,000
Morning.

27
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,080
My Junior's Female Programmer Salon
will be held in two days.

28
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:05,680
Do attend if you're free.

29
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:09,399
Whoever attends will get a bonus
at the end of the month.

30
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,540
(We need you to fix the bug)

31
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,380
(Female Programmer Salon)

32
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:17,919
All right.

33
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,839
That's all for today's
cosplay makeup tutorial.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,839
If there's any question you want to ask,

35
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,039
you can send me a DM on Weibo.

36
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:25,360
Gu Xiaoqi.

37
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,119
Why are you keeping
all of these expired things?

38
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:31,240
I'll throw it out for you.

39
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,880
(Fairy has a boyfriend.)

40
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:38,360
He's my brother.

41
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:38,880
Yes.

42
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,039
He has nothing but a nice voice.

43
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:40,559
In fact,

44
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:42,199
he's not even one-third
as good-looking as me.

45
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,600
By the way, commercial break.

46
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,039
My best friend is going to conduct
a Female Programmer Salon

47
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,720
at Chongqing.

48
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:48,559
Whoever is interested

49
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,279
can scan the QR code to join the group.

50
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,880
That's it for today's live stream.

51
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,320
Bye!

52
00:02:57,839 --> 00:02:58,960
Wait a minute.

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,119
What am I to you again?

54
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,600
You were my brother,

55
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,080
and now are my boyfriend.

56
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,479
I wasn't wrong.

57
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,240
Do you think I'm embarrassing you?

58
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,479
That's not the case.

59
00:03:11,679 --> 00:03:13,520
I don't want them to see
how handsome you are.

60
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,199
Although they are my fans,

61
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:17,440
I don't want to
share my boyfriend with them.

62
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,399
Xiaoqi.

63
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,479
Do you want to kiss me?

64
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,399
Do you want me to do it?

65
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,839
Don't you want to kiss me?

66
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,679
How did it feel?

67
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,759
It felt a little strange.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Strange?

69
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:47,880
Perhaps

70
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,960
because we're too familiar
with each other.

71
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,240
Do you want to try it again?

72
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:03,919
My mom is here.

73
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,720
Hide. Quick.

74
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,119
What's wrong with that?

75
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,440
She has no idea about our relationship.

76
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,800
She's probably here to send me food.

77
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,559
She'll leave soon. Hide first.

78
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:16,679
Welcome.

79
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,480
What's with the makeup?

80
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,799
What are you doing again?

81
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,279
I'm working.

82
00:04:22,119 --> 00:04:23,720
Your job is just fooling around.

83
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,239
Remember.

84
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:26,160
These dishes can only be stored

85
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,839
for no more than five days.

86
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,279
Eat them before they get rotten.

87
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:31,920
Sure.

88
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,880
This is weird.

89
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,679
Why is your place so clean today?

90
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,399
Mom.

91
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,679
I spent the whole morning
cleaning the place.

92
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:49,640
I was about to take a nap just now.

93
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:50,959
What nap?

94
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,200
I'm going shopping with your Godmother.
You're coming with us.

95
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,239
I think I'll skip this.

96
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,839
Where did all these kittens come from?

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,959
You can't even feed yourself.

98
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,720
How are you going to
take good care of them?

99
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,359
They are not mine. They belong to Gu Mo.

100
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:06,279
He left it here temporarily.

101
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,239
What a cute kitten.

102
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,959
Mom.

103
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,720
You can't touch a newborn kitten.

104
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,519
Mo's kitten is definitely of good breed.

105
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,399
Are you really my mom?

106
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,839
You should be grateful
for what you have.

107
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,640
I should've prayed more religiously
when I was pregnant.

108
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,279
If I did that, I might
have been able to give birth to

109
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:25,160
a handsome and mature boy like Mo.

110
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,600
Have you met his girlfriend before?

111
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,799
Yes, I have.

112
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,679
She's drop-dead gorgeous.

113
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,079
Look at you.

114
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,440
Can you learn from him?

115
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:38,239
I wonder what kind of son-in-law

116
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:39,519
will I get in the future.

117
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,519
Mom.

118
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:42,359
I'll bring home

119
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,720
someone like Gu Mo.

120
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,959
Please don't sabotage him.

121
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,239
He must be really unlucky
to have met you.

122
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,040
Let's go.

123
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:51,200
Mom, I'm not coming with you.

124
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,000
Hurry up.

125
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,920
Don't be late.

126
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,279
Here.

127
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,519
Mischievous girl.

128
00:05:57,679 --> 00:05:58,720
Remember to buy me some presents.

129
00:05:58,839 --> 00:05:59,640
Are you really not coming with us?

130
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,640
I'm tired. I'll join you another day.

131
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,279
Be good.

132
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:02,119
Don't worry.

133
00:06:02,119 --> 00:06:02,600
Bye.

134
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,320
Bye, mom.

135
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,440
You can come out now. My mom's gone.

136
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,040
Where did he go?

137
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,679
You're really making me speechless.

138
00:06:18,239 --> 00:06:19,799
When are you going to
make our relationship public?

139
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,079
Why should I?

140
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:23,279
Didn't you hear my mom?
She told me not to sabotage you.

141
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,359
I want you to sabotage me.

142
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,480
I haven't had enough.

143
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,079
Look here.

144
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,279
Be careful not to fall.

145
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,839
I want to take a photo
to commemorate this moment.

146
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,519
Why did you suddenly agree
to join me at the gym?

147
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,679
I have nothing else to do.

148
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:06,040
Can't you say that you're here for me?

149
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,519
I'd feel happy then.

150
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:08,920
I...

151
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,440
Fine.

152
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:12,000
I won't make it difficult for you.

153
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,760
I'm going to use the gym equipment.

154
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:19,119
Pretty girl. This drink's for you.

155
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,160
Here.

156
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,320
Let me help you.

157
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:21,640
All right.

158
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,359
The drink.

159
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:22,959
Thanks.

160
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,079
Fix this to the lowest
and it'll fit you just right.

161
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,959
You're in quite a good shape.

162
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,359
Do you come here often?

163
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,279
Not really.

164
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,200
Can we add each other on WeChat?

165
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,679
Let me recommend this to you.

166
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:38,079
This is a Female Programmer Salon
I find particularly good.

167
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,079
Really?

168
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:41,720
Sure.

169
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:43,640
Tong.

170
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:46,279
Come with me.

171
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:48,399
Wait a minute. I just made a new friend.

172
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:49,640
You're here to exercise,

173
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,200
not to make friends.

174
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,559
Why are you upset?

175
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,519
I'm not.

176
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,359
You didn't like seeing me
talking to another man,

177
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,640
and brought me away in such a hurry.

178
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,640
You don't know who
these people are at the gym.

179
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:10,200
You shouldn't add
a random stranger on WeChat.

180
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,679
I worry

181
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,239
that you will run into a bad guy.

182
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,440
I didn't add him on WeChat.

183
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,200
I saw it just now.

184
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:21,079
I made him scan the QR code

185
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,640
to join Lu Li's Female Programmer Salon.

186
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:28,519
I see.

187
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,399
I'll go train my back.

188
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:42,799
Yiming.

189
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,640
Were you jealous?

190
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,239
Don't worry.

191
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:53,200
You're the only person I like.

192
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:56,479
I'm not interested in any other men.

193
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,840
You should go change now.

194
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,359
I'll send you home later.

195
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,080
I'll go get changed now.

196
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,400
What's with the fast heart rate?

197
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,640
Lu Li.

198
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:45,960
Lu Li, wake up.

199
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,320
Lu Li.

200
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,159
You can reserve the venue tomorrow.

201
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,000
What did you just say?

202
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,960
You've achieved the target.

203
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,860
(Congratulations!
Your reservation has been confirmed.)

204
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,200
Did we make it?

205
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,880
We finally made it!

206
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:08,000
Thanks,

207
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,760
Jiang Yicheng.

208
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,840
Instead of thanks,

209
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,880
I'd prefer to hear
something else from you.

210
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:22,119
Let me think about it.

211
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,559
You keep watching this.

212
00:10:24,719 --> 00:10:26,039
I have to get back to work.

213
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:45,440
Why are your hands so cold?

214
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:47,840
I'm feeling a little nervous.

215
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,880
Take it easy.

216
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,159
By the way,

217
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,559
have you figured out
how to express your gratitude?

218
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,760
No one asks for appreciation like this.

219
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,119
If you can't decide,

220
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,119
I'll decide for you.

221
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:10,719
We're at the public.

222
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,159
What are you doing?

223
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:19,960
I'm leaving a mark,

224
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,440
so that you can always remember
I will be always by your side.

225
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:29,000
Are you still nervous?

226
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:45,760
Don't worry.

227
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,320
Let's go.

228
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,599
Hi, everyone.

229
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,320
(Female Programmer)
I'm the speaker of today's salon.

230
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:27,679
Lu Li.

231
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,919
(Female Programmer)
Today, I'm going to discuss

232
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:33,719
if a woman can be a programmer.

233
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,400
Isn't this about the game?

234
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,880
Why is she talking about
being a programmer?

235
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,320
Yes.

236
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,320
Did we mistake the time?

237
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,119
Let's go.

238
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:39,880
Let's go.

239
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:49,359
Here.

240
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,320
Miss Lu. Good luck!

241
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,719
All the best!

242
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:57,200
Miss Lu, good luck!

243
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:58,479
I want to sit here.

244
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:04,960
Miss Lu.

245
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,880
Good luck.

246
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
Good luck.

247
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:24,679
Good luck.

248
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,039
Sorry, Miss Lu.

249
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,880
We're late.

250
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,119
Hi, Miss Lu.

251
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,760
Miss Lu.

252
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,239
Miss Lu.

253
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:26,280
Hi, everyone.

254
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,960
I'm the speaker of today's salon,

255
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,400
Lu Li.

256
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,919
Today, I'm going to discuss

257
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:36,599
if a woman can be a programmer.

258
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:41,840
Many people think that
a woman can't be a programmer.

259
00:15:42,119 --> 00:15:45,119
This is not only the society's prejudice
against women,

260
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,880
but also an illusion
the entire industry created.

261
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,000
Some might say

262
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,520
that I'm not capable enough
to change the world.

263
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
That's right.

264
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,400
We can't change the world,

265
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,960
but at least we won't allow ourselves
to get affected by the world.

266
00:16:05,719 --> 00:16:06,599
Well said.

267
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,660
(Female Programmer)

268
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,200
Cheers.

269
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,799
Junior,

270
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,440
tell us how you feel.

271
00:16:49,119 --> 00:16:51,039
These happened
all thanks to Jiang Yicheng.

272
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:52,520
You should give this speech.

273
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:54,559
I did all of these for you.

274
00:16:54,719 --> 00:16:55,960
The limelight is yours.

275
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,080
Do it.

276
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,960
Then, I'll just say a few words.

277
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,200
Yes.

278
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,520
I didn't expect

279
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:09,680
to be able to reunite with you here.

280
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,920
I was extremely nervous
when it first started.

281
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,599
However,

282
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,199
your presence put me at ease.

283
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:19,400
The best feeling on earth

284
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,599
is to have someone supporting you.

285
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:24,160
Your presence here today

286
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,520
certainly boosted my morale.

287
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,520
I can now face my coming challenges

288
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,520
with higher levels of
confidence and motivation.

289
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,319
Here.

290
00:17:35,479 --> 00:17:36,359
For the programmers!

291
00:17:36,479 --> 00:17:36,839
Cheers.

292
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:39,160
For the programmers!

293
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:46,800
Lu.

294
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:48,479
How's Chongqing?

295
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,400
Is their hotpot spicy?

296
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:49,920
It's nice here.

297
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:50,760
Spicy.

298
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,280
Their barbecue tastes good.

299
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,599
They are delicious.

300
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,160
Both the barbecue
and the hotpot are spicy.

301
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,400
Zitong, why are you drinking on your own?

302
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,680
It suddenly hit me

303
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:04,599
that I'm quite envious

304
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,239
of others' achievements.

305
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,280
You'll find something
you're passionate about too.

306
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,280
I...

307
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,000
Something other than me.

308
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,119
I never thought about this before.

309
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,000
Do you think I'm getting old?

310
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:23,599
You're getting more mature.

311
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,359
Your heart feels empty.

312
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,400
Don't worry.

313
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,640
It doesn't matter how full my heart is.

314
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,640
There's always a place for you.

315
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:37,520
I'll borrow him for a moment.

316
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,400
Let's go.

317
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,880
What's the matter?

318
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,319
I told you not to go there.

319
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:45,880
Am I right?

320
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,680
Now I understand
where Mr. Jiang has been lately.

321
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,560
He has been visiting her frequently.

322
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,400
That's not true.

323
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:52,599
Women like to cause trouble.

324
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,319
Chendong is giving Mr. Jiang trouble.

325
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:55,920
She is giving Mr. Jiang trouble as well.

326
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:57,280
Are you working for Chendong?

327
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,400
How's the company doing?

328
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:04,839
Without Mr. Jiang at the office,

329
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,920
all the colleagues thought
that the company was going bankrupt.

330
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:10,000
Lu.

331
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:12,319
Since that you and Mr. Jiang
have already been reconciled,

332
00:19:12,479 --> 00:19:14,920
are you coming back to Xinhai?

333
00:19:16,199 --> 00:19:19,079
I haven't had any plan yet.

334
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,719
No plans yet?

335
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,079
Why are we talking about this?

336
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,760
Thanks for coming.

337
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:26,199
Junior can't take
any alcoholic drinks today.

338
00:19:26,439 --> 00:19:27,439
I'll drink on her behalf.

339
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:27,920
Wait a minute.

340
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,359
Wait.

341
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,920

347
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:43,239
I am the man who defeated Mr. Jiang.

348
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,439
You defeated Mr. Jiang.

349

350
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,439

358

He is the boss of the film company
you're collaborating with.

359
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,839
It doesn't matter who he is.

360

I won't allow him

361
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,640

00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:53,000
If you can find something
you truly like,

508
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:55,199
I'll reevaluate our relationship.

509
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:01,000
Really?

510
00:30:06,239 --> 00:30:07,319
Promise.

511
00:30:07,479 --> 00:30:09,560
I'm going to work hard for my love.

512
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:39,160
This lady looks very familiar.

513
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:45,680
This guy looks very familiar too.

514
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,319
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

515
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:01,400
Mr. Jiang, you traveled a thousand miles
to win your wife back.

516
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:03,239
I didn't expect a robot

517
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:06,479
to be this passionate.

518
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,160
Why didn't you tell me
anything about this?

519
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,920
You were already deeply troubled,

520
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,079
and I didn't want to
bother you with this.

521
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:19,400
Since when are you this thoughtful?

522
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,760
Fine.

523
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:25,760
I was feeling a little shy.

524
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Until today,

525
00:31:27,199 --> 00:31:28,680
I still can't believe
that I'm dating Gu Mo.

526
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,800
I'm too embarrassed

527
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:32,160
to tell anyone about this.

528
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,439
Does your family know about this?

529
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,280
I certainly don't dare
to tell them about this.

530
00:31:36,439 --> 00:31:37,400
If they ever find out about this,

531
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,959
they will tell us
to get married immediately.

532
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,319
I've wasted so many years of mine
not dating anyone.

533
00:31:41,479 --> 00:31:43,319
I have to enjoy the relationship now.

534
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,839
Good luck to you, then.

535
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,640
It's very difficult
to hide a relationship.

536
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,160
Is your family not supportive
of your reconciliation?

537
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,400
Lu Li, we're leaving.

538
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,079
I'm coming.

539
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,000
My back hurts.

540
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:26,000
Did someone order coffee?

541
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:26,839
Wrong order.

542
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,400
No one ordered coffee.

543
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:33,520
It says the F4 plus one
in programming team A ordered this.

544
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,680
Lu!

545
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,040
Lady Boss, you came back with our boss.

546
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,800
I'm only dropping by.

547
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:43,760
Where is Shutian?

548
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,160
He hasn't been to work since yesterday,
and he's not replying to our texts too.

549
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:48,800
Since you and Old Ape left,

550
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:50,520
it has been pretty quiet here.

551
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:52,560
You...

552
00:32:55,479 --> 00:32:56,640
You're here.

553
00:32:57,199 --> 00:32:58,760
What's with your expression?

554
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,160
Don't you want to see me?

555
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:01,839
Do you know that I'm leaving

556
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,599
and come here to take over
my high-end PC?

557
00:33:04,719 --> 00:33:05,119
You...

558
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,280
Shutian, what are you talking about?

559
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,680
Are you leaving too?

560
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,340
(Resignation Confirmation Letter)

561
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:21,439
You were doing a good job. Why did you
tender your resignation out of the blue?

562
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,400
How is this a good job?
I'm always working overtime.

563
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,439
I don't even have time
to play games anymore.

564
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,719
This is meaningless.

565
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,439
You...

566
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,599
Have you been under too much pressure?

567
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:31,119
I...

568
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:32,880
I can recommend my psychiatrist to you.

569
00:33:33,199 --> 00:33:35,599
Have you thought it through?

570
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:37,280
Does Jiang Yicheng know about this?

571
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,319
Yes, he does.

572
00:33:38,479 --> 00:33:39,719
Don't waste your time.

573
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,680
No one can stop me from leaving.

574
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:47,239
One came back,

575
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,290
(Lin Shutian)
and another one is leaving.

576
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,599
The glorious staircase F4 plus one

577
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:55,199
has now become F2 plus one,

578
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,400
plus another one.

579
00:34:06,239 --> 00:34:07,319
Yicheng.

580
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,719
Lin Shutian's sudden resignation

581
00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:10,360
has significantly affected
programming team A.

582
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,360
They have very low morale now.

583
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,919
If they have time to be sad,
they don't have enough work.

584
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,159
Assign all Lin Shutian's tasks

585
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,679
to all of them.

586
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:19,600
I'm sure they will get back
on their feet and start working again.

587
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,719
The boss talks, the staff works.

588
00:34:23,959 --> 00:34:25,040
Now I know why everyone enjoys playing

589
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,800
"A Hundred Ways to Kill A Boss".

590
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,360
Yiming.

591
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:31,199
Welcome back.

592
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,239
You owe me a meal.

593
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,600
Let's have a meal someday.

594
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,719
Sure.

595
00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:38,199
I'll get going.

596
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:50,679
Can I borrow two minutes of yours?

597
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,800
I can give you 20.

598
00:34:57,479 --> 00:35:00,320
Are you greatly affected
by Shutian's resignation?

599
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,840
I lost an excellent staff,

600
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,399
but I have to respect his decision too.

601
00:35:06,879 --> 00:35:10,439
I find his resignation
a little too sudden.

602
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:13,120
Is another company poaching him?

603
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,919
Why are you thinking about
another guy in front of me?

604
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,679
I worry about you.

605
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,080
You can comfort me in some other ways.

606
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,320
Let me pick up the call.

607
00:35:35,439 --> 00:35:36,479
Zitong.

608
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,159
Sister-in-law, help!

609
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,639
Stay calm. Tell me what's going on.

610
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:45,919
Come here. Quick!

611
00:35:46,959 --> 00:35:48,879
All right, I'll be right there.

612
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:51,159
Where are you going?

613
00:35:51,479 --> 00:35:54,080
Zitong said she couldn't find
anything she was passionate about.

614
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,360
She'll be okay
after she throws a tantrum.

615
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:00,080
I promised her that
we would have lunch together.

616
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,120
After all, I have nothing to do here.

617
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,840
Lady Boss, I want to eat lunch
with you too.

618
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,679
Be good, okay?

619
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,639
Fungal and pork trotter soup.

620
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,520
Stir-fried sliced yam.

621
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,120
Stir-fried garlic with potato,
but without the garlic.

622
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,120
Why didn't you order
their famous dishes?

623
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,000
I want the chicken bun
and marshmallow barbecued pork.

624
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,719
Don't take her order.

625
00:36:30,919 --> 00:36:33,560
One Crucian Carp in black bean sauce,
and a red date rice paste.

626
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:35,040
Reduce the oil and salt
in all of these dishes.

627
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,439
Sure. I'll be right back.

628
00:36:37,479 --> 00:36:38,639
Mr. Jiang.

629
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,120
Can you please look at
your one and only sister?

630
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,399
Am I not worth the two dishes?

631
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,639
I don't want to waste food.

632
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,439
If you're not happy,
you can sit at the next table.

633
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,840
Sister-in-law,

634
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,600
don't you like sour and spicy food?

635
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,199
Their steamed fish
with pickled cabbage is good too.

636
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,239
She can't eat that, so you can't too.

637
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,919
Zitong.

638
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,360
Why do you want to
find something to do all of a sudden?

639
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:14,639
Yiming said

640
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,840
that when I find a career
I'm passionate about,

641
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,120
he will consider dating me.

642
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:23,560
When I was in college,

643
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,760
I took your brother as my role model.

644
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,199
That was why I studied so hard.

645
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,000
What if you gave your all

646
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:34,199
and still didn't end up with my brother?

647
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,800
Of course, I wished that
I could win your brother's heart

648
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,600
as a reward for all my hard work.

649
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,520
However, if I couldn't win his heart,

650
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:43,360
it wouldn't leave me
with any regrets either,

651
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,719
because the process

652
00:37:45,879 --> 00:37:47,600
has already made me a better person.

653
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,360
I won't leave
the place empty-handed too.

654
00:37:49,439 --> 00:37:50,360
What do you think?

655
00:37:50,479 --> 00:37:51,159
However...

656
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,600
I haven't started to work yet.

657
00:37:54,399 --> 00:37:57,320
I haven't found anything I like.

658
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:01,199
List down all the things

659
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,479
you're interested in.

660
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:05,320
I'll analyze them for you one by one.

661
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:11,360
I like collecting makeup products
from different brands.

662
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,040
She likes products with nice packaging.

663
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:15,479
Skincare products too.

664
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:17,040
She only likes the expensive ones.

665
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:21,360
Then...

666
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:22,719
I recall

667
00:38:22,879 --> 00:38:24,800
your first day of work.

668
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,520
You matched an outfit for each one of us

669
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,320
according to our strength.

670
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,719
I think this is what you're best at.

671
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,239
That's for sure.

672
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:34,760
I have an innate fashion sense.

673
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,639
However,

674
00:38:37,879 --> 00:38:40,360
I can't be matching outfits
for others all days, right?

675
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,159
Now you know
how difficult she is to please.

676
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,800
I think

677
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,199
you can start by doing live streams
and short videos.

678
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:52,120
I have a friend named Xiaoqi.

679
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,479
She sells the clothes she made
through a live-streaming platform.

680
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,080
You're well-versed
with all the international brands.

681
00:38:57,199 --> 00:38:59,399
You know how to dress sharply
and love shopping too.

682
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,639
You can definitely make good use
of the internet

683
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,479
to do what you're best at.

684
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,239
I can do this.

685
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:06,959
Yes.

686
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:08,320
Why haven't I thought of this before?

687
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,040
I can turn my interest into my career.

688
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,919
Mr. Jiang.

689
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,760
How did you marry
such an excellent wife?

690
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,560
Excellent.

691
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:19,239
I need to record

692
00:39:19,439 --> 00:39:21,239
this glorious moment.

693
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,919
If the mommy koala is so smart,

694
00:39:24,479 --> 00:39:27,120
I'm sure the baby koala
will be very smart too.

695
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:29,360
Intelligence and talents

696
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,959
don't always get passed down genetically.

697
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:33,639
You're right.

698
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,280
There is

699
00:39:37,479 --> 00:39:39,399
a weirdo in the Jiang family.

700
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:41,000
Smile.

701
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:47,760
Juice.

702
00:39:47,879 --> 00:39:48,719
This is good.

703
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,520
You are not allowed
to eat fat choy anymore.

704
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,080
Yes.

705
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,040
Shrimp.

706
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,120
What's the matter with you?

707
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,639
Can't you do it yourself?

708
00:40:04,879 --> 00:40:06,399
Why do you always get Mo to help you?

709
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,080
I'm answering the buyers' queries.

710
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:10,320
They don't like to be kept waiting.

711
00:40:10,479 --> 00:40:11,800
Never mind, Godmother.

712
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,439
I'm almost done.

713
00:40:13,919 --> 00:40:14,560
Don't worry.

714
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:15,840
Just leave them alone.

715
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,600
A brother is supposed
to take care of his sister.

716
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,679
Besides, Xiaoqi is working so hard.

717
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,120
We have to be supportive of her.

718
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:22,320
Xiaoqi, eat up.

719
00:40:22,439 --> 00:40:23,560
Thanks, Godmother.

720
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:26,439
If you keep coddling her, she won't be
able to find a boyfriend in the future.

721
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:29,479
Dad, don't you know
how good your daughter is?

722
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,679
There's a long line of men
waiting to date me.

723
00:40:34,919 --> 00:40:35,840
Mo,

724
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:37,439
Xiaoqi told me

725
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,639
that your girlfriend
is drop-dead gorgeous.

726
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,439
When are you going to
introduce her to us?

727
00:40:42,479 --> 00:40:43,080
Sure.

728
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:44,280
Next time...

729
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,520
Godmother.

730
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:49,840
We have just started dating each other.

731
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,280
She is a shy girl.

732
00:40:51,479 --> 00:40:52,600
We'll see...

733
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,000
We'll see how it goes.

734
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,000
Don't drag your feet

735
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,399
and don't keep us waiting.

736
00:40:57,879 --> 00:40:59,399
Mo has already found someone.

737
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,800
That's really nice.

738
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,360
Look at you.

739
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,360
You're good at nothing.

740
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,840
When are you going to grow up?

741
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,360
How am I good at nothing?

742
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,360
Am I not working hard?

743
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:12,800
Xiaoqi is still young.

744
00:41:12,919 --> 00:41:13,879
She's in no hurry to find a boyfriend.

745
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,600
How is she young?

746
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,040
Her best friend,

747
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:18,520
Lu Li,

748
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:20,360
is already married and pregnant.

749
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,879
She obviously fell behind her friend.

750
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:22,959
You are right.

751
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:25,000
People these days get married young.

752
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,000
That's why I'm in such a hurry.

753
00:41:28,959 --> 00:41:30,000
Mr. He told me

754
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:32,159
that his son was returning from abroad.

755
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:35,639
He's about the age of Xiaoqi.

756
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:37,919
Yes.

757
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,840
The son of Gu's colleague, right?

758
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:41,439
That's right.

759
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,399
He is an architect.

760
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,399
He just finished his postgraduate course
and is an excellent guy.

761
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,199
We met his parents before
and they were really nice too.

762
00:41:46,479 --> 00:41:47,919
Do you want me to introduce him to you?

763
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:48,639
That sounds good.

764
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:49,000
Godmother.

765
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,600
Godmother,
I'm not going on a blind date.

766
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,040
What's wrong with a blind date?

767
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:53,879
You might not even be his type.

768
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:55,399
Regardless of
whether you like him or not,

769
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,360
you can take this chance
to make a new friend.

770
00:41:57,479 --> 00:41:58,199
Exactly.

771
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,120
Set a date and
we'll make sure to bring her there.

772
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:00,520
Nice.

773
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,840
You can't do that.

774
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,719
What did you just say?

775
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,760
I won't allow that to happen.

776
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:09,879
You won't allow that?

777
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,919
Why not?

778
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,560
Mo, do you know that guy?

779
00:42:13,959 --> 00:42:14,760
I don't know him.

780
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,919
Then, why?

781
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:17,439
Because...

782
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,719
Because
Xiaoqi is already dating someone.

783
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,719
Who's that?

784
00:42:26,479 --> 00:42:27,959
Dad. Mom.

785
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:29,320
Godmother. Godfather.

786
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:30,560
In fact,

787
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,879
my drop-dead gorgeous girlfriend

788
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,320
is none other than Xiaoqi.

789
00:42:38,959 --> 00:42:40,120
She is my girlfriend.

790
00:42:44,959 --> 00:42:45,760
What a nice match.

791
00:42:45,879 --> 00:42:47,360
You're a good match.

792
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,600
That's nice.

793
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,239
In-laws.

794
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,040
Am I right?

795
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:52,560
Yes.

796
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:52,879
In-laws.

797
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:53,919
Let's drink.

798
00:42:53,959 --> 00:42:54,520
Here.

799
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:55,679
Drink up.

800
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:57,360
This can save us some effort.

801
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,320
Here.

802
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,639
Sir, is there anything you like here?

803
00:43:01,919 --> 00:43:02,919
Give me some more time.

804
00:43:02,919 --> 00:43:03,159
Sure.

805
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,959
Do you know your girlfriend's ring size?

806
00:43:07,439 --> 00:43:08,399
Ok.

807
00:43:12,399 --> 00:43:13,239
Give me a minute.

808
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:14,320
Sure.

809
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:18,879
I told you that I have
something important to do.

810
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:19,959
I'm not going to the office.

811
00:43:19,959 --> 00:43:20,800
This is bad.

812
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,040
The game Chendong released this morning

813
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:27,159
has settings very similar
to that of "Xuan Zhong Ji".

814
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,719
They also specifically mentioned

815
00:43:28,919 --> 00:43:30,040
about the 64 square kilometers

816
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:31,639
super seamless world.

817
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:33,199
A MMORPG.

818
00:43:34,959 --> 00:43:37,719
They couldn't possibly invent
such a difficult technology

819
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,600
in such a short time frame.

820
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,439
Who has access

821
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,040
to this program's source code?

822
00:43:44,199 --> 00:43:45,439
Only the two of us
and a few other major programmers

823
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,679
have access to the complete code.

824
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,800
Investigate it.

825
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,159
Find out who leaked the source code,

826
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,520
then file a lawsuit
against Chendong immediately.

827
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,600
Before everything else,
we need to explain to EG Gaming.

828
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,800
Besides the compensation

829
00:43:58,959 --> 00:44:01,199
for the direct economic loss,

830
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,600
they also want us

831
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:07,760
to compensate for the opportunity cost
of the time lost.

832
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,719
Yicheng.

833
00:44:26,919 --> 00:44:27,840
Calm down.

834
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,520
Yicheng.

835
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,959
Let go.

836
00:44:57,479 --> 00:44:59,040
Xu Yuanzhi.

837
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:03,800
(We always prioritize what we want,)

838
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,879
(and neglect our parents'
emotional needs.)

839
00:45:07,159 --> 00:45:09,399
