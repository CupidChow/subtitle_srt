21
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:55,639
I think I got the gist.

22
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,680
By the way,

23
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,919
did anything happen yesterday night?

24
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:04,959
Can't you remember anything?

25
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,240
After I finished the beer,
I blacked out.

26
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,000
You have a really low
tolerance for alcohol.

27
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,119
I hope I didn't do anything weird.

28
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,360
No.

29
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:20,279
You fell asleep right after that.

30
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,559
So handsome...

31
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:52,320
Agreed.

32
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,479
So,

33
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,039
I heard that you only
started working here

34
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:00,240
because of Yiming.

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,639
Well?

36
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:02,839
What do you see in him?

37
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,559
It's not entirely because of him.

38
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:08,240
Maybe it was because

39
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,279
he guided me

40
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,559
like a ray of hope

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,039
when I felt lost.

42
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:20,119
I am now following that light.

43
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,399
Are you enjoying your chitchat?

44
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,720
Your fan here said

45
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,800
you were the guiding light in his life.

46
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:37,960
It's different for me.

47
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,399
You are my sun.

48
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,800
The light dims out,

49
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,479
but the sun will never stop shining.

50
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,199
Light and sun?

51
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:46,399
Do you even know how far the sun is?

52
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,479
It's time to go home.

53
00:03:59,279 --> 00:03:59,960
Mr. Jiang.

54
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,039
Bye, Mr. Jiang.

55
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,800
Let's go.

56
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,160
Hold it.

57
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,360
Okay.

58
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:07,199
What are you doing?

59
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,839
I thought you were waiting
for me to get in the car.

60
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:13,440
Do I look like I have the time for that?

61
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:17,200
Lu Li.

62
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,760
Where are you going?

63
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,760
I'm taking the company bus.

64
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,880
You could carpool with us.

65
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,079
Zitong drove her car here.

66
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:27,600
Stop standing there.

67
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:28,399
Get in the car.

68
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,600
Take my brother's car.

69
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,920
Yiming, let's go.

70
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:31,640
Come on.

71
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,079
Bye.

72
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,760
Bye.

73
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,640
Stay safe.

74
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:34,799
Bye.

75
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,640
I'm driving the car.

76
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:53,640
This is

77
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,480
a very lovely retro Lolita dress.

78
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,320
If you like it or are interested,

79
00:04:58,359 --> 00:05:00,160
click on the link in the description

80
00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:00,880
to make the purchase.

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,559
By the way,

82
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,279
this dress looks better

83
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,119
with a bustle.

84
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:05,679
That's all

85
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,880
for our live stream today.

86
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,079
See you next time.

87
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,720
Bye, I love you.

88
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,320
Li, I just finished my live stream!

89
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:16,839
What is taking you so long?

90
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:25,880
What's the matter?

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,239
Why the long face?

92
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:29,440
Tell me,

93
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:30,760
what has happened to you lately?

94
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,720
The man's mind still baffles me.

95
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:40,040
I have no idea what's going on
inside Jiang Yicheng's mind.

96
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,200
I think I know why he's been

97
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:45,119
behaving this way.

98
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,119
Why?

99
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,679
You're a man.

100
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,959
So?

101
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,880
You are too clingy.

102
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,079
You bought him medicine,

103
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,399
gave him a massage, and shared his bed.

104
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,200
Think about it.

105
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,040
He's a straight guy.

106
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:57,279
How can he handle that?

107
00:05:57,359 --> 00:05:59,000
So he's keeping his distance from you.

108
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,119
I see.

109
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:04,320
I get it now.

110
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,000
Xiaoqi, stand up.

111
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,359
What?

112
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,079
Get up.

113
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,799
Turn around.

114
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,920
The company wants us to wear
female attire tomorrow.

115
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:24,799
Is that all?

116
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:26,760
Don't worry.

117
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,040
I won't compromise your secret identity.

118
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,079
Xiaoqi, you're the best.

119
00:06:31,239 --> 00:06:32,959
You're my robot cat
from the 22nd century.

120
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:34,440
By the way,

121
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,200
did Gu Mo cause you any trouble?

122
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,200
He took a photo of Jiang Yicheng
and me on a blind date.

123
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,839
He wants me to break up with you.

124
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,040
He's insane!

125
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:45,000
I'll talk to him.

126
00:06:45,799 --> 00:06:47,119
He thinks I'm a womanizer,

127
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,519
then we should break up.

128
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,880
My secret will still be safe.

129
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:52,119
You have a point.

130
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,760
But I can't stand his behavior.

131
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:56,119
He's not my mom,

132
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,399
so why is he so bossy?

133
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,880
He cares about you.

134
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,320
I agreed with his terms.

135
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,640
Don't spill the bean yourself.

136
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Okay.

137
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,679
I have this strange feeling of

138
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:09,239
breaking up with the love of my life.

139
00:07:11,239 --> 00:07:12,119
What should I wear tomorrow?

140
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:13,119
Let's check it out.

141
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,359
Sure. Come with me.

142
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:15,480
Trust me,

143
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:18,239
your beauty will mesmerize
everyone in the office.

144
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:19,119
Let's go.

145
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,040
Put your hands down!

146
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:26,320
What are you afraid of now?

147
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:29,440
Hurry up!

148
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,399
Put it down!

149
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,399
All right.

150
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,440
We've learned our mistake!

151
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:37,359
Yezi!

152
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,160
We're sorry!

153
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,079
Have mercy on us.

154
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,320
It's not easy to work in this outfit.

155
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:41,880
That's right!

156
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,480
You got the photos and videos.

157
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:46,239
Go get changed.

158
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:48,799
You're supposed to wear it the whole day,

159
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,679
not a second less.

160
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:50,440
That'd make the punishment pointless.

161
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:51,000
Yeah!

162
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:51,720
He's right!

163
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,160
Mr. Jiang.

164
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:53,600
It's not easy to work in this outfit.

165
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,320
We're missing one.

166
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,160
Where's the other one?

167
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:57,959
Lu Li!

168
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,399
Lu Li?

169
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,040
Lu Li!

170
00:07:59,079 --> 00:07:59,760
Where is he?

171
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:00,320
I have no idea.

172
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,000
I don't know.

173
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:01,720
Yeah.

174
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,799
Did he run away?

175
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:17,000
Seriously?

176
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,000
My goodness,

177
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,679
if he weren't a man

178
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,399
under that mask,

179
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,559
I'd fall in love with him
for the 58th time.

180
00:08:58,599 --> 00:08:59,239
Good morning.

181
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,039
Such grace and beauty.

182
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,280
He's a totally different person.

183
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,280
Unmatched charm.

184
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,799
Dongfang Bubai!

185
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:17,200
Lu Li.

186
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:19,400
Come to my office.

187
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:24,880
Do you need a hand?

188
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,640
For what?

189
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,000
Nothing.

190
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,559
I like your style today.

191
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,000
I should get going.

192
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,280
Stop staring.

193
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,000
Did I say it's over?

194
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,159
Get into your poses!

195
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,080
Stat!

196
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,919
But Mr. Chen said...

197
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,520
Hurry up!

198
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,840
Were it not for Mr. Jiang,

199
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:48,919
I'd never made this move!

200
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:03,000
Mr. Jiang, how may I help you?

201
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:10,200
Are you going to talk
while wearing that veil?

202
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,599
But

203
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,599
it's part of the outfit.

204
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,280
I didn't ask you to cosplay.

205
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:17,159
Get rid of it.

206
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:17,960
But...

207
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,640
No, I can't do that.

208
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,119
I mean it!

209
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,799
Give it here.

210
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:25,119
Mr. Jiang!

211
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:03,559
Mr. Jiang.

212
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,000
This thing is hideous!

213
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:08,119
Get changed.

214
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,640
Mr. Jiang.

215
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,239
You said we must wear it for a day,

216
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,520
not a minute less.

217
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,919
It was your punishment,

218
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,080
but now I feel punished!

219
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,200
Get changed.

220
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,119
Mr. Jiang.

221
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,520
Get out!

222
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,719
Okay.

223
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:42,320
Am I really...

224
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,559
This tastes nice.

225
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,640
Try it out.

226
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,200
What's the matter?

227
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,719
Are you in a bad mood?

228
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,039
I just had a breakup.
Of course I'm in a bad mood.

229
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,880
Did you break up with Lu Li?

230
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:43,400
Why?

231
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:49,359
What do you think?

232
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,960
How should I know what happened?

233
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,200
(Drop the act.)

234
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,119
(Garden Restaurant)

235
00:12:58,119 --> 00:12:59,520
Should I teach him a lesson for you?

236
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,640
I can kick him out
of Enchant Technology.

237
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,359
Are you serious?

238
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,119
When did I ever lie to you?

239
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:12,719
Forget it.

240
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,159
We broke up because
our personalities didn't match.

241
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:17,799
It was a peaceful breakup.

242
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,359
As you wish.

243
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,640
Try it out.

244
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:39,000
This seller looks fine.

245
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,559
The ratings are good.

246
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,119
See?

247
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,719
The number checks in.

248
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,880
Can we skip?

249
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:44,919
Make it symmetrical.

250
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:47,400
We are writing codes, not drawing.

251
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,479
(It's too early.)

252
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,440
Will that do?

253
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,200
It looks very messy.

254
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,159
The color looks nice.

255
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,320
The color matches you.

256
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,559
See?

257
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,320
Yeah.

258
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:25,359
(Xiaoqi!)

259
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:26,599
(My monthlies just came!)

260
00:14:26,719 --> 00:14:28,000
(I forgot the pads.)

261
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,239
It's an urgent matter.

262
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,039
I must go now.

263
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,039
Why isn't it cold?

264
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,960
Since you like cold drinks,

265
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:42,919
it's no wonder you're cold.

266
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,000
A free item with each purchase.

267
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:53,280
We'll each get one.

268
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:54,000
Okay?

269
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:56,559
This looks nice.

270
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,599
Where is Lu Li?

271
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,239
He went to the restroom.

272
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,000
What?

273
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,840
Mr. Jiang.

274
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:03,919
Do you need him for something?

275
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,799
If you do,

276
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,840
I'll send him to your office
when he's back.

277
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:08,159
Never mind.

278
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,679
Lu Li?

279
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,760
Lu Li?

280
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,599
Lu Li, are you in it?

281
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:36,440
Mr. Jiang.

282
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,679
The concept draft is ready.

283
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,799
We need you to evaluate it

284
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,320
so we can proceed with the next step.

285
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:47,559
I'll be there at once.

286
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,280
Your package is on the door.

287
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,359
Take it.

288
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,560
Where did you go?

289
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:54,520
Are you not feeling well?

290
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,760
It's some mild stomachache.

291
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,839
Maybe I caught a cold.

292
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,040
Nuisance.

293
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,359
Come.

294
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,520
Where to?

295
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,520
To the hospital.

296
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,719
It's all right.

297
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:08,599
I'll be fine after some rest.

298
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:09,839
Are you sure?

299
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,680
Yes.

300
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,760
Then take a day off.

301
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,680
I'll send you home.

302
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,048
(Mose Time)

303
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:36,719
Mr. Jiang.

304
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,239
Thank you for today.

305
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:39,520
Stay safe

306
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:40,319
on your way home.

307
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,040
- So...
- Well...

308
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,800
I should get going.

309
00:18:47,439 --> 00:18:48,520
Goodbye, Mr. Jiang.

310
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,000
See you, Mr. Jiang.

311
00:18:57,239 --> 00:18:59,680
My dear Li is finally back!

312
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:01,359
Who is the man?

313
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,520
Jiang Yicheng.

314
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,680
I'll explain later.

315
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:04,920
Jiang Yicheng?

316
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:09,599
Hello, boss.

317
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:11,400
I am Gu Xiaoqi in the Weibo incident.

318
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,439
I remember you.

319
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,800
I should thank you

320
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,359
for giving him a chance.

321
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,640
Since you're already here,

322
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,599
would you come in

323
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,520
and have some milk tea?

324
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,359
Never mind, I must go now.

325
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:26,199
Bye!

326
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:37,680
Gu Xiaoqi.

327
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,640
Explain everything from earlier today!

328
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,880
It's no big deal.

329
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,079
What's done is done.

330
00:19:45,199 --> 00:19:46,239
Give me a break.

331
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,719
Come clean.

332
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,079
What was it with Gu Mo?

333
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,199
He asked me out.

334
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:56,160
And?

335
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,119
I told her with my marvelous acting

336
00:19:58,199 --> 00:19:59,520
that you and I had broken up.

337
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,160
Everything was in my control.

338
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,160
But then I got your message.

339
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,719
When I got to the office,

340
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:07,040
Jiang Yicheng was
standing outside the restroom.

341
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:11,239
So I could only tell
Gu Mo the whole truth.

342
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,239
Did you tell him my secret?

343
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,520
No,

344
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,199
I must talk to him.

345
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,359
Hold on!

346
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,400
He promised not to tell anyone.

347
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:20,119
Not to mention

348
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:22,239
he would help you in the company.

349
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:23,199
He can be

350
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,479
pretty annoying at times,

351
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:25,160
but

352
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,920
he has never broken a promise

353
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,079
he's made me.

354
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:29,760
If he ever lied to me,

355
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,959
I'd blacklist him for
the rest of his life.

356
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,920
You have a point.

357
00:20:34,439 --> 00:20:36,680
Gu Mo doesn't look like
the gossiping type.

358
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,479
Now that he knows I am a girl,

359
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,040
at least he won't pick on me.

360
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:43,839
Don't you worry.
I'll keep an eye on him.

361
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:48,719
My monthlies came early too!

362
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:03,119
My parcel.

363
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:03,800
Okay.

364
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:10,640
Director Gu.

365
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:15,000
Thank you for the help yesterday.

366
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:16,319
I was helping Xiaoqi,

367
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,239
not you.

368
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,040
Thank you for keeping the secret for me.

369
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,439
Had you told me sooner,

370
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:24,359
you'd be a lot safer in the office.

371
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,479
All right.

372
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:34,520
Xiaoqi told me

373
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:35,560
you were her best friend.

374
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,599
We are on the same side here.

375
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,680
Let me know if you need help.

376
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:40,000
Wait.

377
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,319
Well...

378
00:21:42,479 --> 00:21:45,400
About my photos with Mr. Jiang...

379
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,000
I'll delete them now.

380
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:48,319
Wait.

381
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:51,000
Could you send me the photo?

382
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,119
I applaud your bravery.

383
00:21:59,439 --> 00:22:00,479
I got it.

384
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:01,800
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

385
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,719
I haven't decided which department
I'll be joining,

386
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:44,280
but one thing is for sure.

387
00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:45,719
I will not allow anyone to show up

388
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,040
without their sense of fashion.

389
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,119
First of all,

390
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,000
no more checkered shirts.

391
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,520
Take them off!

392
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:13,640
Sorry.

393
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,800
I was getting my parcel.

394
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,239
I bought a new checkered shirt.

395
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,359
Lu!

396
00:23:19,479 --> 00:23:21,520
Come over here!

397
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:31,280
Consider these my welcome gift for you.

398
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,920
I even matched the outfits for you.

399
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:34,959
Now,

400
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:36,439
feel free to show your gratitude.

401
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,680
Gratitude!

402
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:46,959
If my guess is right,

403
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:48,800
this crone is coming

404
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,920
to our department.

405
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,959
Judging by her style,

406
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:53,079
we're likely to work overtime today.

407
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,520
I'll ask Mr. Chen for help.

408
00:23:55,719 --> 00:23:56,839
Go!

409
00:23:58,839 --> 00:23:59,680
Stop right there.

410
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:01,040
Get changed now.

411
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:06,439
Strip.

412
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:07,319
Put this on.

413
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,439
I'll pass.

414
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,800
It's a loose-fitting shirt.

415
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:12,920
This is blasphemy towards fashion!

416
00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:13,520
Hurry up.

417
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:14,040
Get changed.

418
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:14,760
I'll give you a hand.

419
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:15,599
Never mind.

420
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,040
Let me help you.

421
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:16,599
Never mind.

422
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,199
I can do it myself.

423
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:17,920
I'll help you get changed.

424
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:18,640
I'll help you get changed.

425
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:18,959
No!

426
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,319
Never mind!

427
00:24:19,439 --> 00:24:19,719
I'll help you get changed.

428
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,880
I like the shirt.

429
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,359
No!

430
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:22,359
I'll help you get changed.

431
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,160
What are you doing?

432
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:26,839
Mr. Jiang.

433
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:29,160
Mr. Jiang.

434
00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:30,040
You're finally here.

435
00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:32,160
These are my welcoming gift to the staff.

436
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,400
By gift, you mean bullying my staff?

437
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,239
I only asked them to get changed.

438
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:38,599
I didn't do anything bad.

439
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:40,160
This is a game company,

440
00:24:40,199 --> 00:24:41,239
not a fashion show.

441
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:42,439
I'll send you home if you make

442
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,439
a mess out of this place.

443
00:24:43,719 --> 00:24:44,479
And you,

444
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,520
don't you have work to do?

445
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:46,359
Yes!

446
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:47,319
Yes.

447
00:24:47,439 --> 00:24:48,400
Let's work.

448
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:50,880
Keep your things away.

449
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,160
Deputy director of the research center.

450
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,079
No.

451
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,119
Pick one from the publicity.

452
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:09,680
I want to be with Yiming.

453
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,040
You are already trouble here.

454
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:12,479
I can't let you be a nuisance
to my technical director.

455
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,079
You blatantly took him away from me!

456
00:25:14,199 --> 00:25:15,319
Are you even my brother?

457
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,760
And I don't need a lovestruck sister.

458
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,119
You...

459
00:25:18,199 --> 00:25:19,280
You want to drive me mad

460
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:20,839
so you could have
our family wealth to yourself!

461
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,000
Be our publicity director,

462
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:23,000
or go home.

463
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:26,359
If you touched my computer,

464
00:25:26,439 --> 00:25:27,920
you'd never see Chen Yiming again.

465
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:31,640
I'm not talking to you
for the rest of this morning!

466
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:36,239
Mr. Chen.

467
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,599
This is the data analysis report
from our team.

468
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:40,199
Leave it on the table.

469
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:41,160
Sure.

470
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:42,599
Do you want some coffee?

471
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:44,359
Sure.

472
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,479
Mr. Chen.

473
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,719
Do you prefer brewing your own coffee?

474
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,640
Yes.

475
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,119
I like having some coffee ground

476
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:52,520
when I finish the drink.

477
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,680
I find it very down-to-earth.

478
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:59,280
I'm not particularly
interested in coffee.

479
00:25:59,479 --> 00:26:01,560
But I am curious about latte art.

480
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,599
I could teach you

481
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,800
how to steam the milk.

482
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:04,839
Sure.

483
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,119
Come.

484
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,560
Here.

485
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,680
The main purpose

486
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,520
is to mix the milk with air.

487
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:14,520
So

488
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:16,040
you must pay attention
to the angle of the steam wand.

489
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,000
If it's too deep,
there won't be enough air to mix with.

490
00:26:19,239 --> 00:26:19,959
If it's too shallow,

491
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,239
you might spill the milk
when you turn on the steam wand.

492
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:25,640
Am I doing it right?

493
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:26,880
Good.

494
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:29,040
Come.

495
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:32,640
Brother.

496
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,560
Is Yiming always so nice to his fans?

497
00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:36,239
Address me as "Mr. Jiang."

498
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,000
I want to be his fan too.

499
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:48,199
Come.

500
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:48,839
This is for you.

501
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,959
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

502
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:55,119
Mr. Jiang.

503
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:56,199
How may I help you?

504
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,800
I'm here for the coffee.

505
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,680
You barely came here.

506
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,839
I didn't hire you to make coffee.

507
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,959
Come with me.

508
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,079
Yiming.

509
00:27:14,239 --> 00:27:16,160
Could you make me some coffee too?

510
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,920
I'll make you another cup.

511
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:21,439
With a heart on it.

512
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:27,680
These are

513
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,719
some of the games our
company has developed recently.

514
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:30,839
They are integrated with VR equipment.

515
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,880
This is a flight simulator.

516
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:34,439
There are over 100 flight modes in it.

517
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,280
This is a racing simulator.

518
00:27:36,439 --> 00:27:38,839
It simulates the 360-degree view
of a race car.

519
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:40,839
And this over here

520
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,160
is a shooter.

521
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,199
These all came to fruition
under my leadership.

522
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:49,959
What is this?

523
00:27:50,479 --> 00:27:51,160
Can't you tell?

524
00:27:51,239 --> 00:27:52,160
This is an airplane.

525
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,479
How does it work?

526
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,027
(Star Explorers)

527
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:58,079
For a dogfight, of course.

528
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:08,800
Mr. Jiang.

529
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:10,719
I can't brew coffee at work,

530
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,280
but am I allowed to play video games?

531
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,079
You're not here to have fun.

532
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:16,040
We are here for inspection.

533
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,240
(Ease Attic)

534
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,959
Follow me closely.

535
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:00,640
Mr. Jiang, you are so cool.

536
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,800
It took you long enough to notice.

537
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,640
Come on.

538
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,000
Okay.

539
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,040
Great teamwork.

540
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,479
Mr. Jiang?

541
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:53,239
Mr. Jiang?

542
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:57,839
Mr. Jiang!

543
00:29:58,119 --> 00:29:59,520
Where are you?

544
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:05,880
I'm right here.

545
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,800
Are you all right?

546
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,520
You're a lousy teammate.

547
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,760
I can't believe you are good at
this video game.

548
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,439
As I said before,

549
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,800
I'll keep you safe.

550
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:09,319
Are we here to inspect this as well?

551
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,760
We're gathering materials.

552
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,359
Would you give it a try?

553
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:16,920
I'm not playing a kid's game.

554
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:29,000
You said you couldn't jump.

555
00:31:29,239 --> 00:31:30,119
Jump higher!

556
00:31:30,479 --> 00:31:31,880
Of course I can jump!

557
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,360
(Mind the step)

558
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,000
(Basket pulling prohibited)

559
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,439
Well?

560
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,479
Let me see it.

561
00:32:17,199 --> 00:32:18,599
What's with the weird poses?

562
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,400
This...

563
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,199
These are two alphabets.

564
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,119
Y and C.

565
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:27,359
It's the initials of someone I like.

566
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:34,920
What are you doing?

567
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,520
Let me go!

568
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,199
Mr. Jiang!

569
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,160
Mr. Jiang!

570
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:04,760
I'm getting off work.

571
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,640
Remember to turn off the lights.

572
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:09,199
My work is done as well.

573
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:11,640
Old Ape.

574
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,839
I sent it to your email.

575
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:14,760
Okay.

576
00:33:15,199 --> 00:33:16,239
Have you settled everything?

577
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,160
The beginner's jobs are easier.

578
00:33:20,239 --> 00:33:20,959
I knew it.

579
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:22,319
You couldn't be faster than me.

580
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,319
Hey, son,

581
00:33:24,439 --> 00:33:25,599
rest well when you get home.

582
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,959
Don't stay up late for video games.

583
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:28,880
What if you went bald?

584
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,880
Don't worry.

585
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,479
I won't make your mistakes.

586
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:32,479
Hey...

587
00:33:34,959 --> 00:33:38,280
After ten years of toiling
with no end in sight,

588
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,280
I still tinker with codes
throughout the night.

589
00:33:47,439 --> 00:33:49,239
Da Huang, I could give you a hand.

590
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:50,640
Tomorrow is my day off.

591
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,160
Thank you, bro.

592
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,599
(Rhyme x1)
We are always doing it solo.

593
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,553
(Rhyme x2)
The solitude and bugs are caught up in a battle.

594
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:02,199
(Rhyme x3)
We are a team.

595
00:34:02,479 --> 00:34:04,199
(Rhyme x3)
We're never letting you go

596
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:05,880
(Rhyme x3)
into the battle solo!

597
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:07,920
Lu Li,

598
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,760
we are brothers from now on.

599
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,600
Okay.

600
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,760
All right.

601
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:19,000
You two are embarrassing yourselves.

602
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,320
Perhaps

603
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:21,239
I should stay back as well.

604
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,320
Sure!

605
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,360
Since you are staying,

606
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,600
I would be discarding buddies

607
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,679
if I left.

608
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:29,000
I'm staying too.

609
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:29,639
But...

610
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:30,399
Kids.

611
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:31,120
This is great.

612
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:33,800
Since everyone is staying,

613
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,199
would you consider

614
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,840
giving me a hand?

615
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,239
Come on!

616
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,840
Get your supper!

617
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,919
Supper!

618
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,800
Did you buy us supper?

619
00:35:01,919 --> 00:35:02,719
Working needs diligence,

620
00:35:02,879 --> 00:35:03,879
even more so for having supper!

621
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:04,320
Am I right?

622
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,399
Yeah!

623
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,679
Let's dig in!

624
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,520
Let's go.

625
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,840
Hold on.

626
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,919
I bought fried chicken.

627
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,800
But there is only one drumstick.

628
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,239
It's mine!

629
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,080
I want the drumstick.

630
00:35:19,879 --> 00:35:20,600
Give it to me.

631
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,000
I want the drumstick.

632
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,280
Give it to me.

633
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,399
Respect the elderly!

634
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:29,520
Don't take all of it.

635
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:30,840
There is no drumstick!

636
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,199
It's not in here.

637
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,080
Give it to me!

638
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,760
He has it.

639
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:35,639
Stop right there!

640
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:43,199
I'll have one only.

641
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,679
Slow down.

642
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,439
This is tasty.

643
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,439
Mine is better.

644
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,520
They are the same.

645
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:54,000
What do you think?

646
00:35:54,439 --> 00:35:55,120
Do they remind you

647
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:57,040
of the time when we first
started this business?

648
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:00,679
I just want to have some fried chicken.

649
00:36:17,879 --> 00:36:20,360
Programmers, all the best!

650
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,560
What are these things?

651
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:38,360
There is no normal clothing here.

652
00:36:38,439 --> 00:36:40,120
She's not acting like a girl at all!

653
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:42,560
What are you doing?

654
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:43,840
Are you tinkering with the lamp?

655
00:36:43,919 --> 00:36:45,000
You've been at it for a week.

656
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,040
Did you fix it?

657
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,840
The parts just arrived yesterday.

658
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:49,000
Wait.

659
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,600
Keep your voice down a little.

660
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:51,840
Our girl is sleeping.

661
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,520
She's turned her day upside-down!

662
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,719
She is ruining her health!

663
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,040
Keep your voice down!

664
00:36:59,080 --> 00:36:59,919
Li?

665
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:01,280
Lu Li.

666
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,280
It's time to wake up.

667
00:37:02,879 --> 00:37:03,760
Why are you still in bed?

668
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,159
It's time to get up.

669
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,000
See?

670
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,520
The sun is up and shining.

671
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:08,560
Don't be so lazy.

672
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,399
It's time to wake up.

673
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,280
Come up.

674
00:37:11,399 --> 00:37:13,080
Get up, we're shopping
for some proper clothes.

675
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,159
Get up!

676
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,760
Get up.

677
00:37:15,959 --> 00:37:16,879
Hurry up!

678
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,479
Okay.

679
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:26,040
Lu Li, wake up!

680
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:32,919
My clothing is normal.

681
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:45,959
Li.

682
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,320
Hurry up.

683
00:37:49,479 --> 00:37:50,080
Look at you.

684
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:51,560
You lack the necessary exercises.

685
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:53,479
Your health is worse than mine.

686
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,439
If you keep staring at the computer,

687
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,639
your body will crumble.

688
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,719
Mom.

689
00:38:06,919 --> 00:38:07,560
Well,

690
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:08,560
go on ahead.

691
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:09,679
I'm getting some drinks.

692
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,280
No sugar.

693
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,080
You'll gain weight.

694
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:12,760
Fine.

695
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,479
Wait.

696
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:16,360
I want a sugar-free one.

697
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:26,040
I'm paying for hers too.

698
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,000
Koala!

699
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,560
(Jiguang Fried Chicken)

700
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,360
Sir, your fried chicken.

701
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,159
Excuse me.

702
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,000
Pardon me.

703
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,959
Sorry.

704
00:39:40,439 --> 00:39:41,760
Why did you come in?

705
00:39:43,959 --> 00:39:45,080
Sorry.

706
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,520
Come out.

707
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:46,120
I know you're there.

708
00:40:49,479 --> 00:40:50,600
You don't have to come out.

709
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,120
I want to know,

710
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,959
why you run away when seeing me?

711
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:07,879
Sir.

712
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,280
This is our storeroom.

713
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,520
There is no one inside.

714
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,679
It's empty.

715
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,679
Is there no one else here?

716
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:21,800
No.

717
00:41:21,919 --> 00:41:22,879
It's just you.

718
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:25,560
Do you need to purchase some underwear?

719
00:41:28,479 --> 00:41:29,639
It's a relief to hear that.

720
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:33,439
The measurement is normal.

721
00:41:33,919 --> 00:41:35,040
I'm here to take the door measurement.

722
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:36,399
I'll check downstairs.

723
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,280
I look forward to your explanation.
