-Let's go and buy some.
-You have such a huge appetite.

Where's the drink you bought?

68
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,937
I finished it.

69
00:05:19,021 --> 00:05:21,000
-You actually didn't buy one for me.
-You didn't say you wanted it.

71
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,035
Yiming, is your heart beating rapidly?

72
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:36,343
Are you especially nervous?

73
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,280
Not at all.

74
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:40,288
If so, why aren't you looking
into my eyes?

75
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,880
I'm done.

76
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,320
Take a look.

77
00:05:49,423 --> 00:05:51,435
-This...
-What the heck is this?

78
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,359
Isn't it too ugly?

79
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,516
Look. This face is so long.

80
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,916
It doesn't look like me at all.
And the lips are so thick.

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,040
This must be an ape.

82
00:05:59,383 --> 00:06:00,755
This is my drawing style.

83
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,315
Why did you ask me to draw it for you
when you don't like it?

84
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,715
Wait.
I just thought the models were ugly.

85
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,195
I didn't expect your drawing style
to be this ugly.

86
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,560
I don't care. Refund me my money.

87
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,636
Lady, you can't just say that.

88
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,119
This is how a typical caricature
looks like.

89
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,359
Mister, she has a short temper.

90
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:15,799
I think it looks pretty vivid to me.

91
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:18,440
-The hunk beside you is more reasonable.
-Wait.

92
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:20,475
-How is it vivid?
-Thank you, mister.

93
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:21,956
-All right.
-How is it vivid by any means?

94
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,799
He's humiliating my good looks!

95
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:28,755
You shouldn't have stopped me just now.

96
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:29,995
He's just bad at drawing.

97
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:30,919
He's a conman.

98
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,755
I thought you said it was ugly.

99
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,190
Why are you still keeping it?

100
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,315
Even so, it's our first portrait.

101
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,640
I can't bear to throw it away.

102
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:47,720
Yiming, were you touched by my action?

103
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,239
Don't you think I'm adorable?

104
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,560
Keep your distance from me.

105
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,160
What's wrong?

106
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,140
The shoes are rubbing against my heels.

107
00:07:16,239 --> 00:07:18,779
Why did you wear high heels even though
you knew we were coming to Ancient Town?

108
00:07:18,863 --> 00:07:21,023
You're going to be here.
Of course I needed to dress myself up.

109
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,679
Let me see.

110
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,119
I'll give you a piggyback.
Climb onto my back.

111
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,920
I knew you couldn't
bear to see me in pain.

112
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:58,480
Yiming,
you're my favourite person in the world.

113
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,880
There's a fabric shoe store in front.

114
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,195
-I'll carry you there.
-Okay.

115
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,519
I'll go anywhere you like.

116
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,279
But now,
I don't think I need a pair of shoes.

117
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:25,239
Should we book two rooms instead?

118
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,600
Forget about it.

119
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:28,760
Our secret will be exposed
if Jiang Zitong sees us doing so.

120
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,756
If we light candles
within a confined space,

121
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,159
we won't be able to breathe.

122
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:04,599
You're right.

123
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,796
This Jiang Zitong,

124
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,799
she's only good at doing indecent things.

125
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,960
I'll reprimand her tomorrow.

126
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:13,679
You shouldn't reprimand her.

127
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,440
She just did it out of kind intention.

128
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,080
She doesn't understand the situation
we're in.

129
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:23,200
I'll keep the candles away.

130
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:28,960
There's something here.

131
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,885
-I'll open the door.
-I'll blow out the candles.

132
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:00,319
Let me see.

133
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,556
How is it?
Your honeymoon suite looks great, right?

134
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,692
Can I apply for reimbursement?

135
00:10:05,776 --> 00:10:07,590
Who told you to be a busybody
and meddle with my affair?

136
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,876
Mum told me to be the mediator
between you two.

137
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,756
Why do you think I was willing to meddle
with your stupid affair?

138
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,240
So?

139
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:16,919
Are you here at this late hour
to see us sleep together?

140
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,755
I'm just here to deliver
an imperial edict.

141
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,356
Li's birthday is tomorrow.

142
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,719
Your heartless brother
will surely forget about it.

143
00:10:29,239 --> 00:10:31,275
You should go and remind him.

144
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:34,796
They will spend
her first birthday together tomorrow.

145
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,760
They must celebrate her birthday together.

146
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,440
Hurry and accept the imperial edict.

147
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,880
Her birthday?

148
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:47,199
Yes.

149
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,676
I've passed her message to you. I beg you.

150
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,635
Please don't argue with her anymore.

151
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:52,916
You're not young anymore.

152
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,916
Yet you still need me
to meddle with your affair.

153
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,880
You're so insensible.

154
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,440
You finally did something useful for once.

155
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,600
Get out.

156
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,240
Brother!

157
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,960
Jiang Yicheng, good luck. You can do it.

Lu Li.

159
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,039

-Sorry.

163
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,240
Our cakes are sold out.

164
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:53,515
-Are there any cake shops nearby?
-There are.

165
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:55,035
But I guess they're closed by now.

166
00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:56,440
Our shop is the last shop you can find.

167
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:59,559
-Thanks.
-Don't mention it.

168
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,515
Hello.

169
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:16,515
You have two minutes.

170
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:17,439
Come to the courtyard.

171
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,160
Jiang Yicheng.

172
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,200
Why were you looking for me?

173
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:45,760
♪Happy Birthday to You♪

174
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:50,760
♪Happy Birthday to You♪

175
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,679
♪Happy Birthday to You♪

176
00:12:57,119 --> 00:13:01,159
♪Happy Birthday to You♪

177
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:17,280
What's wrong?
Are you so touched that you're speechless?

178
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,155
Are you celebrating my birthday for me?

179
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:25,239
Don't you see it?
Is there anyone else here?

180
00:13:27,359 --> 00:13:29,080
Did you actually know
that today's my birthday?

181
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,360
It's late now.

182
00:13:33,719 --> 00:13:36,061
That's why I couldn't buy you a cake.
Let's make do with this for now.

183
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:41,559
Did you make this?

184
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:45,119
Although it isn't a proper cake,

185
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,960
it's my exclusive design.

186
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:52,480
-I don't think it's unfair to you.
-Not at all.

187
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,637
This is the best...

188
00:13:54,721 --> 00:13:56,520
and most unique birthday gift
I have ever received.

189
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,196
It'll be midnight soon.

190
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,639
Make your wish and blow out the candles.
Hurry.

191
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,960
I hope the current blissful moment...

192
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:14,239
can continue.

193
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,240
Koala Lu,

194
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:34,999
happy birthday.

195
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,880
Thank you, Jiang Yicheng.

196
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:44,380
What wish did you wish just now?

197
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:48,359
My wish won't come true
if I tell you right now.

198
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,624
How could I make your wish come true...

199
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:57,599
if you don't tell me about it?

200
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,200
So if I tell you my wish,

201
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,159
will you really make it come true?

202
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,796
I hope...

203
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,039
Of course I'm joking.

204
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,035
If you requested for me
to hand my company to you,

205
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:14,200
wouldn't that be a huge loss for me?

206
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:23,320
Thank you for everything.

207
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,640
That's more like it.

208
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:13,319
Who is it?

209
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,719
Yiming.

210
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,160
Zitong?

211
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:22,239
Yiming,

212
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,919
I'm here to treat you to a glass of wine.

213
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:27,440
You're drunk.

214
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,840
Let me send you to your room.

215
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:30,439
I don't want to.

216
00:16:37,239 --> 00:16:39,356
Today is the 3285th day...

217
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,039
we've known each other.

218
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:45,799
So we must celebrate this occasion.

219
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,996
I'll send you back
after I finish this glass, all right?

220
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,920
Okay.

221
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:55,159
Wait for me.

222
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:57,479
I want to drink cross-cupped wine
with you.

223
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,196
Stop messing around.

224
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,599
I won't let go if you don't drink it.

225
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,480
I'll drink it.

226
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,400
After finishing this glass,

227
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,479
you'll be mine.

228
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:25,880
You're a lady.

229
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:28,920
You came into a man's room
while wearing this in a drunken manner.

230
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,966
You don't behave like a lady at all.

231
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,209
But you're the man I fancy.

232
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,520
I love you 3000...

233
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:41,400
How many days has it been again?

234
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,319
I can't remember!

235
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,115
I need to ask my brother.

236
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,796
I'm sure he knows about this. Let's go.

237
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,934
Let's go and find my brother.

238
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:01,559
Zitong, listen to me.

239
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:04,235
You were 15 when I first met you.

240
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:05,515
Since then,

241
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:07,800
I've always treated you
like my little sister.

242
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,920
But I don't want to be your little sister.

243
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,119
I want to be your girlfriend.

244
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:19,079
Sorry, Zitong.

245
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,211
There's no way for me
to have other feelings for you...

246
00:18:22,295 --> 00:18:23,704
when I treat you as my little sister.

247
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,119
I'm a grown-up now.

248
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,959
I'm not the little girl you know anymore.

249
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,160
That's not what I mean.

250
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:38,520
What should I do to make you
stop treating me as your little sister?

251
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:42,959
Stop saying silly things.
Let me send you to your room, okay?

252
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:49,264
Do you still treat me
as your little sister after seeing this?

253
00:18:57,239 --> 00:19:00,000
Jiang Zitong,
if you want other people to love you,

254
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,089
first, you need to learn
how to love yourself.

255
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,239
You can rest here.
I'll sleep in your room.

256
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:27,000
I have some emails to reply to.
You can take a bath first.

257
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:31,035
All right, I'll take a bath.

258
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:33,119
By the way, Zitong prepared
a set of pyjamas for you.

259
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:43,300
(I wish Mr. Jiang and Mrs. Jiang
a happy night)

260
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,160
Sister-in-law, this is the birthday gift
I've specially picked for you.

261
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,000
I wish you two a happy night.

262
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,480
You're welcome.

263
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,719
Why didn't you change?

264
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:03,839
I'm used to wearing my own clothes.

265
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,680
I'll take a bath then.

266
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:29,319
My dear Li, happy birthday.

267
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,275
May you conquer Jiang Yicheng soon...

268
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:34,040
and win his heart.

269
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,560
Jiang Yicheng made this cake for me.

270
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:58,439
What?

271
00:22:59,239 --> 00:23:00,839
Did he actually celebrate your birthday
for you?

272
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,235
What stage are you guys in right now?
Did you confess to him?

273
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,159
No.

274
00:23:05,439 --> 00:23:07,319
I've completely forgotten about it.

275
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,920
If so, why are you still showing off?

276
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,560
You should go and conquer him.

277
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:18,079
Your mind is so tainted.

278
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,599
Why are you still awake?

279
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,155
I'm not sleepy yet.

280
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,160
You can sleep first.

281
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:12,560
Actually, I'm not sleepy as well.

282
00:24:13,199 --> 00:24:15,036
I'll watch some TV shows with you.

283
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,680
Do you want a drink?

284
00:25:01,439 --> 00:25:02,800
No, thanks.

285
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,199
Let's watch some TV shows.

286
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:45,679
So...

287
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:48,716
I think we will have a busy day
ahead of us tomorrow.

288
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,160
I think we should sleep early tonight.

289
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,916
You're the birthday girl today.
You can sleep on the bed.

290
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,840
I'll sleep on the sofa.

291
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:12,160
Why don't we sleep on the bed together?

292
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:18,239
We slept on the same bed before
when we went on a business trip.

293
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,959
There's nothing to worry about.

294
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,119
Let's sleep together then.

295
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:19,959
What are you looking at?

296
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,400
Thank you.

297
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,040
You're the first person to celebrate
my birthday with me this year.

298
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,920
Since I'm celebrating it for you,
of course I need to be the first.

299
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:36,079
But...

300
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,599
whose spot did I steal?

301
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,039
Xiaoqi.

302
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,520
Xiaoqi was the one celebrating my birthday
for me every year.

303
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:48,199
You're not popular at all.

304
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,959
Don't tell me you didn't have
any boyfriends or suitors before this.

305
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,319
You're the first man...

306
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:01,719
to celebrate my birthday for me
after my father.

307
00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:06,479
That's why this year's birthday
feels special to me.

308
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:09,800
You're this touched over
a birthday celebration.

309
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,359
You're so easily satisfied.

310
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,319
Spring is here.

311
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,680
The animal's mating season is here.

312
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,280
I'll complain about them.

313
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:44,800
Don't do it.

314
00:28:45,439 --> 00:28:46,279
It's too late.

315
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,471
But when I hear this noise...

316
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,840
I can't sleep.

317
00:28:58,719 --> 00:28:59,559
If so,

318
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,239
wait for me.

319
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:03,679
I have an idea.

320
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,028
Are we listening to songs?

321
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,056
♪The love is sprouting♪

322
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,656
♪Leaving a doodle on the cake♪

323
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:50,180

Your phone is ringing.

349
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,512
-I would like to check out. Thank you.
-All right.

350
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:18,799
Yicheng,

351
00:31:20,239 --> 00:31:21,079
it's nothing.

352
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,395
I have work to do today.

353
00:31:22,479 --> 00:31:24,559
-I'll return first. You guys can continue.
-Yiming.

354
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,956
-Yiming.
-Your sister is here.

355
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,880
I'll hang up for now.

356
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,760
Why didn't you wait for me?

357
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,120
Have you taken breakfast?

358
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,880
Call me Brother.

359
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:36,196
We can talk once you're sober.

360
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,120
I'll leave first.

361
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,880
Today's Lu Li's birthday.
Aren't you joining us?

362
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:43,169
Is today Lu Li's birthday?

363
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,880
Why are you guys still here?

364
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:47,600
-Morning, Sister-in-law.
-Morning.

365
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:50,240
Lu Li, happy birthday.

366
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,360
Thanks.

367
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,836
I couldn't prepare your birthday gift
in time.

368
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,501
Let's celebrate your birthday
with a cake later.

369
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:57,240
We celebrated her birthday last night.
You should return first if you're busy.

370
00:31:58,239 --> 00:31:59,476
Are you even humane?

371
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,839
We helped you coax your wife.
How dare you separate us?

372
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,152
Children shouldn't speak
when adults are speaking.

373
00:32:04,719 --> 00:32:06,316
I'm two years older than Lu Li.

374
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,119
Do you know what you're doing?
You're robbing the cradle.

375
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,796
There's a silver workshop nearby.

376
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,959
We can make our own accessories.
Why don't we go and try it out?

377
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,479
Yes, birthday girl.
We'll follow your will.

378
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:21,520
I forgot to tell you this.
Your skin looks tanned now.

379
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:28,436
It's quite far.

380
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,880
Why don't we ride a bike?

381
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,115
Since it's a couple of bikes,

382
00:32:33,199 --> 00:32:34,556
I guess I can ride this.

383
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,599
Yiming, you should take the front seat.

384
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:42,199
Can I request for Lu Li's help?

385
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,640
What's wrong?

386
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:45,640
Don't ask me if you treat me
as your brother.

387
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:48,199
I can't lend her to you.

388
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:50,959
Sit down.

389
00:32:55,199 --> 00:32:56,039
Take the front seat.

390
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:02,919
We'll leave first.

391
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:05,159
Goodbye.

392
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:08,875
Yiming, hurry up.
We need to catch up to them.

393
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:09,799
Let's go.

394
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:31,199
Why are you so heavy?

395
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:37,920
Were you even pedaling just now?

396
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:42,199
Your back is too straight.

397
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,872
Of course you can't pedal the bike
like that.

398
00:33:43,952 --> 00:33:46,760
You need to bend your back a little
to minimise drag.

399
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,000
Lower.

400
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,199
Why are you tugging my shirt?

401
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,720
Get off the bike.

402
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:58,316
What's wrong?

403
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,556
You're as slow as a koala.

404
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,480
Let me do the peddling.

405
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,440
Sit tight.

406
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,919
I'll show you the definition of speed.

407
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,966
You better not throw up.

408
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,399
You can do it.

409
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,639
Yiming, you can do it.

410
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,115
You can do it.

411
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,762
Faster!

412
00:34:22,846 --> 00:34:24,846
Faster!

413
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,280
Why did you stop?

414
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,199
Can you let go of me?

415
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,600
No.

416
00:34:31,959 --> 00:34:33,436
This is a rare chance.

417
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,600
I won't let go of you.

418
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,320
If you don't let go of me,
I'll get off the bike.

419
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,360
Fine then.

420
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,159
I'll tell my brother
what happened last night.

421
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,840
You...

422
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,559
Sit tight.

423
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,460
(Wuyin)

424
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:32,079
This must be the place.
Yiming, let's go in.

425
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:35,159
Welcome.

426
00:35:36,479 --> 00:35:39,280
Welcome to our workshop.
You can create your own accessories here.

427
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:41,953
Over here,
you can order your own accessory...

428
00:35:42,037 --> 00:35:43,840
according to the available designs.

429
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,635
You can also create
and customise your own accessory as well.

430
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:49,200
-All right, thank you.
-Thank you, mister.

431
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:51,355
Yiming, which one do you like?

432
00:35:51,439 --> 00:35:53,239
-I'll make it for you.
-No need for that.

433
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,199
I like this one.

434
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,919
Make one for me, all right?

435
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,560
I'll buy it for you if you like it.

436
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,679
Buying it is different
from making it yourself.

437
00:36:04,439 --> 00:36:07,360
Just treat this
as my early birthday gift, okay?

438
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:13,560
Which one would you like to make?

439
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:16,000
Do you wish to know?

440
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,639
You can continue wishing then.

441
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,200
Are you done?

442
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,075
My goodness.

443
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,919
This looks amazing.

444
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:29,075
Come. Let me show it to you guys.

445
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:31,115
These are the ear studs
Yiming made for me.

446
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:32,039
Look.

447
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,040
Z, T.

448
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,996
Are these the initials of your name?

449
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,075
Of course.

450
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:39,959
This is the only one of its kind
in the world.

451
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,280
Yiming, am I right?

452
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,120
What did you guys make?

453
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:46,840
I made key chains.

454
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,040
You made two of them.

455
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,854
So did you make a set of couple key chains
for you and Yicheng?

456
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:58,600
I wish to thank him for celebrating
my birthday with me last night.

457
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:04,919
Your metal piece
doesn't have any aesthetical sense to it.

458
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,279
I lack a key chain.
Why don't you give it to me?

459
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,635
That belongs to me.
I don't like to give away my things.

460
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:13,559
Go away.

461
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:23,959
Hope and love.

462
00:38:24,479 --> 00:38:26,679
I made it according to the mould.

463
00:38:29,439 --> 00:38:30,360
What did you make?

464
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:38,080
Is that a keyring?

465
00:38:42,439 --> 00:38:43,520
It's a ring.

466
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:53,879
Jiang Yicheng, don't tell me
you don't know Sister-in-law's ring size?

467
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:56,919
Who said it was a ring?

468
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,756
It's just an artistic keyring.

469
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,340
I plan to throw it away
after I'm done with it.

470
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,639
If you want to throw it away,
you should let me keep it.

471
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:07,399
I can use this as a necklace
after I put a chain on it.

472
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,519
I told you already.
You have a great artistic sense.

473
00:39:12,919 --> 00:39:14,155
Don't try to understand it.

474
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:15,080
Just feel it.

475
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:40,920
What is this?

476
00:39:41,959 --> 00:39:42,959
Can I hang it there?

477
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:46,039
It's hideous.

478
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,760
You'll get used to it over time.

479
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,555
-My baby!
-My baby.

480
00:39:57,639 --> 00:39:59,120
Happy birthday!

481
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:00,676
Thanks, Dad, Mum.

482
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,996
I'm outside right now.

483
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,639
I'll visit you guys later.

484
00:40:04,479 --> 00:40:05,319
Where's Jiang?

485
00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:07,512
Is he still busy with work
during the weekend?

486
00:40:08,798 --> 00:40:09,708
Sorry about that.

487
00:40:09,792 --> 00:40:11,196
Sorry for not visiting you guys
before this.

488
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,827
Later,
I'll visit you two together with Lu Li.

489
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,115
-All right.
-That's great to hear.

490
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:17,676
-We'll prepare the dishes then.
-That's right.

491
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,756
We'll wait for you guys to come.

492
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,916
All right. That's it for now.

493
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,199
Goodbye.

494
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:24,716
Let's go. Let's do some grocery shopping.

495
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,360
-Hurry.
-Let's hurry.

496
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:32,920
What's wrong?
Don't you want me to visit them?

497
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,479
Of course I don't mean that.

498
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:38,080
I'm sure Dad and Mum will be glad
to see us.

499
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,439
I was just surprised.

500
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:44,239
Why are you treating me so well suddenly?

501
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,239
I'm just afraid your parents
might be suspicious of us.

502
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:49,429
I'm just fulfilling
my part of the contract.

503
00:41:05,879 --> 00:41:06,719
Your seat belt.

504
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,595
You made me a fruit cake last night.

505
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:44,155
There's no need to buy another cake.

506
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:45,635
I'm a perfectionist.

507
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:47,360
I mustn't leave any regrets behind.

508
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,640
Pick one.

509
00:41:51,479 --> 00:41:52,555
-Hello.
-Hello.

510
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:54,959
So can we design a cake
with our portraits on it?

511
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,835
Please look over here.

512
00:41:56,919 --> 00:41:58,595
These are some DIY cake shops.

513
00:41:58,679 --> 00:41:59,594
If you're interested in them,

514
00:41:59,678 --> 00:42:01,276
you can customise
and create your own cake.

515
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,399
All right, let me take a look.

516
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,519
I don't know how to make that.
