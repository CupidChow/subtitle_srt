4
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,070
The Yin family's joyful events are spreading.

5
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,640
Wanwan from Lidu

6
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,760
comes to wish Master Yin a happy birthday.

7
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,590
Fine.

8
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,640
For me,

9
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,000
today is full of surprises!

10
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,150
Since Miss Wanwan is here,

11
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,560
the song you left incomplete yesterday

12
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,710
can be finished now.

13
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,980
♪The bright sky clears after rain♪

14
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,320
♪A painted bird flits out of the forest♪

15
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:51,690
♪The oriole sings, leaping from the woods♪

16
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:58,290
♪Youthful hearts brim with passion♪

17
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,840
♪Aiya yi duo wei ya♪

18
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,150
Be careful! Young Madam.

19
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,910
(Xia Qiu usually calm,)

20
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,280
(but now seems flustered.)

21
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,750
(From Li Du yesterday and here today,)

22
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,400
(every move she makes)

23
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,680
(seems deliberate and calculated.)

24
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,590
Reward her.

25
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,960
Thank you, Master Yin.

26
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,680
Before I leave,

27
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,280
may I borrow a room to freshen up?

28
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,190
Please.

29
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,360
Sister Hong

30
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,470
is becoming more reckless.

31
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,080
Without notice,

32
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,260
she sent a songstress to our family banquet.

33
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,500
My mistake.

34
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,020
I'll have her leave immediately

35
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,620
and ask someone to check on Lidu.

36
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,060
No need.

37
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,260
She's just a trivial butterfly.

38
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,420
Third Brother,

39
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,620
don't be fooled by women like her.

40
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,820
Now that you're back,

41
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,620
what about your engagement

42
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,420
with the Meng family?

43
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,900
What engagement?

44
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,140
Have you been so busy to forget?

45
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,460
You and Meng Yuanyuan,

46
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,060
our families are close

47
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,300
and you grew up together.

48
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,580
This is only natural.

49
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,860
I'm worried for you.

50
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,860
You're uncle,

51
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,460
but you marry later than your nephew.

52
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,500
It's embarrassing.

53
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,740
Besides,

54
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,460
seeing you settle down

55
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,380
is your mother's wish,

56
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,020
isn't it?

57
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,460
Sister,

58
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,420
I've found you.

59
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,540
You've got the wrong person.

60
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,780
Really?

61
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,180
Do you think I'd mistake you?

62
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,300
She loves reading,

63
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,620
dislikes bright colors,

64
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,860
always wears white dresses,

65
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,540
and has loved white roses since childhood.

66
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,340
Oh,

67
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,460
the mark under her eye isn't a tear mole.

68
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,740
When we were playing hide-and-seek,

69
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,180
I accidentally scratched her.

70
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,100
Our parents punished me,

71
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,060
but she begged for mercy on my behalf.

72
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,820
Shen Zhiqiu, everyone has their fate.

73
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,580
From the day I was adopted by the Yin family,

74
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,220
we ceased to have any connection.

75
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,100
So many years of silence,

76
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,620
don't you get the message?

77
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,700
You're an orphanage girl,

78
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,540
and I'm the Young Madam of the Yin family.

79
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,460
Even if you're here today,

80
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,500
do you think anyone would believe you?

81
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,660
Take the ticket and money

82
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,420
and get as far away as you can.

83
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,860
Here

84
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,900
is no one wants to see you again.

85
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,500
At that time,

86
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,580
wasn't I supposed to be adopted?

87
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,020
Uncle, are you here to adopt a child?

88
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,220
What are you doing here?

89
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,980
No, um...

90
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,620
Boss Yin, the girl I mentioned earlier,

91
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,580
it's not her.

92
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,940
Please wait, I'll bring her right away.

93
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,300
Uncle, I can sing, write,

94
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,340
and dance.

95
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,580
I'm obedient.

96
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,460
Won't you consider adopting me?

97
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,580
If you

98
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,140
come to my house

99
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,260
and there's a younger brother,

100
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,540
how would you treat him?

101
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,100
I'd treat him well for life,

102
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,420
listen to you, and listen to him.

103
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,460
Sister, I know where you are.

104
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,980
Come out!

105
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,700
Sister, sister, save me!

106
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,140
Sister.

107
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,220
Sister.

108
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,260
So what?

109
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,700
What's done is done.

110
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,820
If you want to survive,

111
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,300
take the money and leave.

112
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,940
Don't think I don't know

113
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,100
your intentions.

114
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,900
With your lowly status,

115
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,020
you dream of climbing into my husband's bed?

116
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,500
Hao,

117
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,740
I've never seen Xia

118
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,220
so upset over another woman.

119
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,460
Forget it.

120
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,100
She crossed the line, even think...

121
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,300
I enjoy seeing Xia get jealous for me.

122
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,780
How about this?

123
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,380
If Young Master Yin takes me in,

124
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,460
I'll find ways every day

125
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,540
to make the Young Madam jealous.

126
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,380
If I marry Young Master Yin,

127
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,180
you'd be my elder sister.

128
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,180
Brother Hai,

129
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,340
about the matter in Yixing.

130
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,060
I must thank you again.

131
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,060
I don't get it.

132
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,020
Why you abandon profitable ventures abroad

133
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,340
to return to Shen City to clean up a mess?

134
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,500
Brother Hai,

135
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,780
are you remember my mother?

136
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,780
How could I dare forget?

137
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,340
If it weren't for your mother

138
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,480
using her dowry to

139
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,380
establish the Yixing business,

140
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,540
how would we have survived?

141
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,660
But why did she pass away from illness?

142
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,060
Back then, you were out at sea,

143
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,460
and I was the one who managed her funeral.

144
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,060
Why bring this up suddenly?

145
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,500
About my mother,

146
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,940
there's more to reveal.

147
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,420
You're the elder sister,

148
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,060
I'm the younger one.

149
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,540
What qualifies you to be my elder sister?

150
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:30,900
Boss.

151
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,300
Give me some wine.

152
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,540
You haven't been here in a while.

153
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,780
Ok, two shots of wine and a plate of beef.

154
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,260
Wait a second,

155
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,620
isn't this Miss Wanwan?

156
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,700
Still out this late?

157
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,380
Didn't snag a Yin family man.

158
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,020
Do you think

159
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,500
you can walk into the Yin family like that?

160
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,300
Better come home with me.

161
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,100
What are you doing?

162
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,620
Drunk and causing trouble?

163
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,660
What are you doing?

164
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,820
Crazy woman! Just you wait.

165
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,860
Here...

166
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:13,980
Brother Hai,

167
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,100
this time

168
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,540
you must help me.

169
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,300
Brother Hai,

170
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,060
is there any trouble?

171
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,140
It's my duty to assist the Madam.

172
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,540
But...

173
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,260
Rumors about you marrying the Miss Meng

174
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,700
have already spread across Shen City.

175
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,660
If you truly marry into the Meng family,

176
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,980
everything you do will be under scrutiny.

177
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,980
Then forget leaving Shen City,

178
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,180
even stepping out of your house,

179
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,820
people will know everything

180
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,940
in detail.

181
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,020
Someone's coming. You go first.

182
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,740
It's you again?

183
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,980
Blood brothers? Blood sisters?

184
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,460
It's all scheming.

185
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,540
The poor scheme,

186
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,340
and so do the rich.

187
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,860
I heard everything that day.

188
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,940
Just like me,

189
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,980
you came to Shen City with a purpose.

190
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,780
Take a picture of this.

191
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,820
The Lidu songstress is insane.

192
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,860
It's the Third Master. Let's go.

193
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,940
If Miss Wanwan

194
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,700
doesn't want her voice anymore,

195
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,620
then destroy it.

196
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,660
Poison her voice

197
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,100
so she can't sing a word today.

198
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,020
From now on,

199
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,660
she no longer belongs to Lidu.
