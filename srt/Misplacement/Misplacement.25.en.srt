4
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,190
I said,

5
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,710
we haven't had our wedding yet,

6
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,880
so I woke up.

7
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,630
You said the same,

8
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,590
so you have to wake up too,

9
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,280
alright?

10
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,320
Yin Shixiong's been captured.

11
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,840
The photos and shipping records

12
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,280
have also been delivered.

13
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,550
The doctor said

14
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,070
her condition is a bit complicated.

15
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,320
Wanwan, she…

16
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,640
How is she?

17
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,670
Her brain function is damaged.

18
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,880
She can still breathe,

19
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,960
but she's unconscious.

20
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,280
Speak clearly.

21
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,480
Prepare for the worst.

22
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,630
She may never wake up again.

23
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,230
You just said

24
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,800
Yin Shixiong was captured.

25
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,760
When is his execution?

26
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,280
What's wrong?

27
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,110
With so much evidence,

28
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,630
shouldn't he get the death penalty?

29
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,280
Calm down.

30
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,280
His crimes involve many people, so…

31
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,670
So, he hasn't been convicted yet.

32
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:31,990
I heard it will be...

33
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,590
reported to the provincial authorities.

34
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,070
Where are you going?
You haven't recovered yet.

35
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,230
North Villa is safe.

36
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,710
Take good care of her.

37
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,920
You're going to see Yin Shixiong?

38
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,400
When she wakes up,

39
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,280
I owe her an explanation.

40
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,230
Third Brother,

41
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,190
long time no see.

42
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,670
You actually survived.

43
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,000
Where's your little lover?

44
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,480
Why didn't she come with you?

45
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,320
I think

46
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,550
she's the one who wants

47
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,480
to see me the most, right?

48
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,110
Don't think I don't know

49
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,320
what you're planning.

50
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,110
So soon,

51
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,800
you've figured it all out.

52
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,510
Let's hear it.

53
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,720
You want to destroy the evidence

54
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,320
during delivery.

55
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,400
What else?

56
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,950
Did you think

57
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,000
just Meng Minghe alone

58
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,190
could hold me down?

59
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,440
You're underestimating your Big Brother.

60
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,920
If Meng Minghe had that ability,

61
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,030
why would I let you marry his daughter?

62
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,920
These hands of mine

63
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,030
are stained

64
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,320
with more blood than you could imagine.

65
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,190
When I get out,

66
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,630
I'll tell you all about it.

67
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,000
Third Brother,

68
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:40,760
this hand of yours…

69
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,960
It's useless now, isn't it?

70
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,280
It's not me underestimating you.

71
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,480
It's the other way around.

72
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,510
The evidence is successfully delivered.

73
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,440
The verdict is in your cell.

74
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,510
You won't survive the night.

75
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,030
No way!

76
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,150
Guards!

77
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,510
Yin Heng!

78
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,030
Get back here!

79
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,320
Yin Heng!

80
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,280
Third Master,

81
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,030
do you know what "broken palm" is?

82
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,680
That's me.

83
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,360
When my parents died,

84
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,320
my sister was trapped

85
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,320
in the Yin family for me,

86
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,710
hanging by a thread.

87
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,200
Even you…

88
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,710
Every time you meet me,
something bad happens.

89
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,600
(Because of you,)

90
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,430
(I found the ability to love again.)

91
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,470
(Now Yi Xing is back on track.)

92
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,640
(My mother's name has been cleared.)

93
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,000
(You've never been a burden to me.)

94
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,840
See?

95
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,520
This way,

96
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,470
you're not a broken palm anymore.

97
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,430
What brings you here?

98
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,070
We're leaving Shen City.

99
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,600
Where to?

100
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,880
To where we should go.

101
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,600
To do what we should do.

102
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,720
Take care of yourself,

103
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,150
and your loved one.

104
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,840
We…

105
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,230
We'll wait for you

106
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,870
to reunite.

107
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,800
Will she wake up?

108
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,840
She will.

109
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,150
We haven't had our wedding yet.

110
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,300
(Happiness)

111
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,840
Xia,

112
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,150
does this look good on me?

113
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,760
Wanwan, you're the most beautiful bride.

114
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,110
Are you ready yet?

115
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,310
The auspicious hour is near.

116
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,600
Is Yin Heng here?

117
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,440
Look at you,

118
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,430
which bride gets this anxious?

119
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,560
Xia, you're teasing me.

120
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,800
Go on.

121
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,960
Two families unite,
forming an everlasting bond.

122
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:01,310
Peach flowers bloom.
A perfect day for wedding.

123
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,680
May future generations thrive and flourish.

124
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,960
The vow of growing old together is recorded

125
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:14,230
in the book of love, written in crimson ink.

126
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,390
Congratulate!

127
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,390
I just want to

128
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,430
be with you.

129
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,920
(Shen Zhiqiu.)

130
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,720
(Wake up soon.)

131
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,800
