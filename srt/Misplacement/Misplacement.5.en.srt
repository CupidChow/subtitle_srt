5
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:13,720
that woman's belongings

6
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,350
have already been moved into the house.

7
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,760
The Young Master seems quite interested.

8
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,280
I didn't expect it,

9
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,120

17
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,230
I take care of the Yin family affairs.

18
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,870
We can't just leave these garbage

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,430
lying around the house.

20
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,840
Who moved my things?

21
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,630
Once you step into the this door,

22
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,000
everything belongs to the Yin family.

23
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,430
The Young Madam can dispose of it.

24
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,590
What a Young Madam!

25
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,630
Tell her to give it back to me.

26
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,960
The Young Madam has noble status.

27
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,470
How could she touch your trash?

28
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,030
I want to see her.

29
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,080
I think...

30
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,430
Since you didn't bring things,

31
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,000
you want to frame the Young Madam.

32
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,280

And what about your most precious thing?

00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,800
It was lost long ago.

71
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,440
You...

72
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,070

00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,310
How dare she come back?

75
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,480
But since it was Third Uncle who spoke,

76
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,190
no one can stop her.

77
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,510
So you let her go into Third Master's room?

78
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,430
If the Young Master finds out…

79
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,680
No matter what,

80
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,680
I can't let Hao marry her.

81
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,510
Madam really loves the Young Master.

82
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,430
This is the first time I've seen her

83
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,720
so anxious in all these years.

84
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,510
I knew you'd come back.

85
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,120
Why is Third Master so certain?

86
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,160
I want to marry you.

87
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,680
Naturally, I investigated your background.

88
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,560
You recognized me,

89
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,830
knows my intentions are not pure,

90
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,360
but still wants to marry me.

91
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,240
I just know you're not pure,

92
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,310
so I gambled on you return.

93
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,830
Are you not afraid I'll use your secret?

94
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,830
The more you need this family,

95
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,560
for me,

96
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,510

98
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,750

101
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,110
I understand.

102
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,430
Don't worry, Third Master.

103
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,600
I know what to do.

104
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,510
Sister,

105
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,270
since you don't want to call me sister,

106
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,310
then just call me aunt.

If I don't go,

117
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,840
wouldn't that just play into their hands?

- Master Meng, long time no see.

Master Meng,

132
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,670
don't listen to his nonsense.

133
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,720
His marriage to Yuanyuan

134
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,120
was arranged when our father was still alive.

135
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,480
It was arranged by parents and matchmakers.

136
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,470
You...

137
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,750
The marriage with Miss Meng,

138
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,360
I've never heard my father mention.

139
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,480
Now that our parents are gone,

140
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,360
how can there be a parental arrangement?

141
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,630
I heard this lady

142
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,910
came out of Lidu's brothel.

143
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,440
Father,

144
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,550
don't you think here feels too quiet?

145
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,910
I heard Miss Wanwan's song is known.

146
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,390
How about you sing a song?

147
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,790
I'll teach Heng some new dance steps.

148
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,150
I don't think that's appropriate.

149
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,710
Third Master,

150
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,600
I've found out about that matter.

151
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,960
Sorry,

152
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,390
I need to excuse for a moment.

153
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,440

154
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,150
let me introduce you to some brothers.

155

- Alright.
- Let's go.

156
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,790
You can't marry brother Heng.

157
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,910
This matter,

158
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,360
I'm afraid your opinion doesn't count.

159
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,350
You...

160
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,720
At that time,

161
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,480
please welcome Miss Meng to our wedding.

162
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,390
Excuse me.

164
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,120

and now I can kill you.
