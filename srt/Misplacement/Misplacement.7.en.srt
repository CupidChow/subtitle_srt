- It was so dangerous yesterday.

11
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,320
It's lucky that you're just lightly wounded.

12
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,150
I just don't get it.

13
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,480
Why are you wearing

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,300
(Shen City Business Tycoon's Banquet)
that vixen's outfit?

15
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,920
(Who is this assassin?)
Are you trying to protect her?

16
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,000
I say,

17
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,550
just let her die at Lidu

18
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,110
to save the Yin family from trouble.

19
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,540
Suicide?

20
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,780
She probably knew she wouldn't survive,

21
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,220
so she ended her own suffering.

22
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,140
Did you investigate her background?

23
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,580
She escaped from Lidu,

24
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,340
and was rescued by a certain Mr. Shen.

25
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,100
Mr. Shen?

26
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,860
How much do you think
he knows about Zhenghao?

27
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,580
Doesn't matter how much.

28
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,980
He can't be left alive.

29
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,260
Rest assured, Master.

30
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,940
I have people out investigating

31

in the schools.

32
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,100
He won't escape.

33
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,780
Mr. Shen.

34
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,740
Yesterday, you said

35
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,460
you'd bring my sister back.

I'm a few years older than you.

39
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,420
Back then, when I saved you two,

40
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,660
I didn't ask your past.

41
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,500
Because I know

42
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,420
everyone has secrets
they don't want to share.

00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,860
I hoped that one day when you leave here,

45

you could live well.

Mr. Shen,

47
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,460
I will definitely avenge Xiao Mei.

48
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,820
No one wanted this tragedy to happen,

49
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,940
but Xiao Mei struck first.

do as I say

52

and leave this place.

53
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,780
Mr. Shen,

54
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,020
don't you have someone
you want to protect?

55
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,060
How could I not have
someone to protect?

again and again,

only to be driven out each time.

Now,

63
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,700
I thought I'd finally
uncover the truth.

64

But you're gone.

65

88

Just tell me.

93
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,100
leave us alone.

Go ahead.

95

Before my father passed,

96
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,740
he told me

97
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,020
if I ever met a woman

98
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,100
both beautiful and capable,

99
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,660
I should tell her this story.

100
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,660
It was the only mistake
my father made

101
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,660
to save the Orphanage.

These silver dollars

103
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,260
are a donation to the Orphanage.

Mr. Yin,

105
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,500
I heard you have a young son at home.

106
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,300
That's why I'm not here to find him

107
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,060
a girl as companion.

108
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,100
My son is spoiled

109
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,620
and not in the best of health.

110
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,020
This girl has to be obedient.

111
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,700
If my son passes away early,

112
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,020
she'll keep him company

113
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,180
on the road to the afterlife.

114
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,620
Why are you here? Get out.

115
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,180
Sir, are you here to adopt a child?

116
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,580
No. Mr. Yin,

117
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,580
the girl I mentioned earlier,

118
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,540
it's not her.

119
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,500
Please wait, I'll bring her over now.

120
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,860
Sir, I can sing and write,

121
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,980
and I can dance too.

122
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,060
I'm obedient.

123
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,220
Why don't you adopt me?

124
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,540
I originally planned

125
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,660
to send your sister to the Yin family.

126
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,060
She and the Young Master
of the Yin family

127
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,460
were close in age

128
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,380
and still too young to understand much.

129
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,940
She was too strong-willed
to bear grievance.

130
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,500
From now on,

131
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,820
she won't have
anything to do with this place.

132
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,500
If you want to survive,

133
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,140
just consider her dead.

134
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,940
Fifty-six. Fifty-seven.

135
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,180
Fifty-eight. Fifty-nine.

136
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,580
Sixty.

137
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,140
Xia, are you hiding?

138
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,660
I'm coming to find you now.

139
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,780
Back then,

140
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,020
the Yin family wanted to take you,

141
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,540
not your sister.

142
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,300
- Your sister protected you,
- Xia!

143
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,420
Xia, save me!

144
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,140
- and went to the Yin family for you.
- Xia!

145
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,020
Xia.

146
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,340
Why has she put off
telling me the truth?

147
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,180
Why did you keep driving me away?

148
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,340
My father said,

149
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,020
only when you truly gained power

150
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,060
would it mean something
to let you know.

151
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,060
Otherwise...

152
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,740
(Since Yin Heng returned to Shen City)

153
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,220
(Xia's behavior has been so unusual.)

154
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,540
(Today, I finally understand.)

155
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,820
Xia, this room…

156
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,660
doesn't it look like a bridal chamber?

157
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,660
Master's asked you about
Third Uncle marrying Wanwan.

158
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,020
Repeat what you said,

159
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,740
word for word.

160
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,140
A Lidu songstress
with a lowly background,

161
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,820
is truly unworthy of Third Uncle.

162
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,420
But if he really cares for her....

163
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,820
You're so thoughtful
of Third Uncle, huh?

164
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,820
Lowly background?

165
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,260
You must've forgotten who you are.

166
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,420
Lowly background?

167
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,540
Then in your eyes,

168
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,420
who's worthy of Third Uncle?

169
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,860
You?

170
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,300
Ever since you came to the Yin family,

171
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,340
you've been stuck with me,

172
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,780
a powerless, sickly man.

173
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,020
You're not happy, are you?

174
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,140
Before, I went to Lidu,

175
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,820
and you didn't care at all.

176
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,260
But…

177
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,340
once a woman connected
to Yin Heng appeared,

178
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,020
it's like you lost your mind.

179
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,540
Not only did you go to Lidu yourself,

180
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,660
but you even got hurt.

181
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,300
You can't stand
seeing Yin Heng marry, can you?

182
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,540
Don't look at me with those innocent eyes.

183
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,100
I hit the nail on the head, didn't I?

184
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,420
These are...

185
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,300
all the stuff

186
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,780
Yin Heng brought back.

187
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,900
Every single one,

188
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,940
you've treated like a treasure.

189
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,620
Tell me.

190
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,180
Have I not treated you well?

191
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,780
Those things are just novelties.

192
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,940
They mean nothing.

193
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,260
Novelties?

194
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,620
Novelties?

195
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,660
I'll show you something novel.

196
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,620
Novel!

197
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,940
Novel!

198
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,180
You brought this on yourself!

199
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,940
Hao! Hao!

200
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,340
Hao...

201
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,620
Hao,

202
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,860
here's the companion I found for you.

203
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,820
You two play here for a while.

204
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,460
I need to handle
the paperwork with the Director.

205
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,620
Hello, my name is

206
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,940
Xia Qiu.

207
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,940
Want some candy?

208
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,220
It's sweet.

209
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,540
You've been with me
since you were eight.

210
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,940
Even if you have to die,

211
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,340
it'll be by my hand.

212
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,700
You belong to me.

213
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,500
Your life is mine too.

214
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,140
What do you want to do with her?

215
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,780
Take her virginity.

216
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,460
Wanwan,

217
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,540
what about your parents?

218
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,540
There was a fire at home.

219
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,020
They passed away when I was very young.

220
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,180
