00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,840
is it your place to tell me what to do?

00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,590
Are you out of your mind?

44
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,360
You're injured so bad.

45
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,320
You can't return yet.

00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,230
Yin Shixiong's already
burned your bridge.

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,440
To my brother Yin Heng:

48
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,880
You detained others and made a scene.

49
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,440
Sullying the family's reputation,

50
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,590
by the order of our parents,

51
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,070
all your business responsibilities

52
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,070
related to Yi Xing are hereby revoked.

I'll ground your sorry behind.

You…

55
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,800
Take care of your injuries.

56
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,440
Can you meet her?

57
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,670
Help me ask her some questions.

58
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,070
I didn't expect

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,840
you're a romantic type.

60
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,390
I'm impressed.

61
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,510
Nonsense.

62
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,400
- He just worries that bitch…
- Shut up!

63
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,920
I don't give a damn.

64
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,510
Third Master,

65
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,800
she caused your injury

66
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,110
and ruined our plans.

67
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,070
I'll sneak into the Yin family

68
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,000
to shut her up

69
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,230
for good.

70
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,480
Don't.

71
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,710
Third Master,

72
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,360
don't tell me you do care about her.

73
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,440
- Sir.
- Welcome.

74
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,510
Welcome.

75
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,390
Have a seat.

76
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,320
Sir.

77
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,200
Coming.

78
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,630
I'm okay.

79
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,190
No one bullies me.

80
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,760
Doctor Tang,

81
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,760
don't waste your efforts on me.

82
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,480
It's not even my question.

83
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,630
Whoever it is, no need.

84
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,670
Welcome, have a seat.

85
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,070
This.

86
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,760
Where did you get it?

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,070
What's wrong with it?

88
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,670
It's important to me.

89
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It seems to be for

90
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,800
replenishing energy and relieving pain.

91
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,230
It contains common tonics,

92
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,510
but two ingredients are antagonistic.

93
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,670
Over time,

94
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,030
it could harm one's life.

95
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,230
More important,

96
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,670
it's laced with opium.

97
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,470
You…

98
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,030
Stop smashing it.

99
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,280
It won't break.

100
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,280
Calm down.

101
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,190
The does is small.
She's able to stop using it.

102
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,840
(Last night I wondered...)

103
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,400
(Who could wield such influence?)

104
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,320
(Making every clinic refuse house calls?)

105
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,760
(Today, I found out...)

106
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,880
(The Yin family is poisoning my sister.)

107
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,030
(I wonder if Yin Zhenghao's life)

108
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,590
(can trade for the truth.)

109
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,510
(Yin Heng...)

110
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,880
(He seems not recover yet.)

111
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,590
(I can't tell him)

112
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,230
(what Yin Shixiong has done.)

113
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,110
What are you doing here?

114
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,440
That's what I should ask you.

115
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,590
Third Master, you know the answer.

116
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,880
Are you worried

117
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,150
I'll spill secrets?

118
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,190
Relax.

119
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,480
I won't betray others for profit.

120
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,710
Besides,

121
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,510
Young Master has been good to me.

122
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,030
You remember what I told you, right?

123
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,000
Of course.

124
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,390
Dead people can't talk, right?

125
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:35,270
Why don't you use this to kill me?

126
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,230
I'm just a songstress.

127
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,070
If you're not here to kill me,

128
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,190
I don't deserve such attention from you.

129
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,150
As for the assassination,

130
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,030
it's made me understand that

131
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,680
I have nothing to do
with your mother's death.

132
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,960
Why should I take these risks?

133
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,520
But I won't let you come in vain.

134
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,920
Tonight, I belong to you.

135
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,350
After that,

136
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,520
we're even.

137
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,520
You know what to do.

138
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,640
I won't allow

139
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,680
anyone to point a gun at you.

140
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,560
(Protect yourself.)

141
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,760
(Please, be safe.)

142
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,270
Miss Wanwan,

143
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,720
why are you here?

144
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,800
It's late.

145
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,150
I wonder if Master

146
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,520
and Young Master have returned.

147
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,350
They went to

148
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,390
the dock today to inspect goods.

149
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,000
They're busy,

150
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,720
so they won't be back tonight.

151
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,150
You should go back.

152
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,640
Master. Young Master.

153
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,070
The shipment is good.

154
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,920
You shouldn't drink.

155
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,520
You've ignored everything

156
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,720
the doctor said, haven't you?

157
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,000
Father,

158
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,230
he even said I wouldn't
live over past thirty.

159
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
But look at me.

160
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,760
Do I seem like only have a few years left?

161
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,030
Nonsense.

162
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,150
Now,

163
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,070
I don't want to die.

164
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,560
In a few days,

165
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,920
a new shipment will arrive.

166
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,880
(Documentation)
I'll leave it to you.

167
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,990
Master,

168
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,920
are you really going to assign Young Master

169
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,350
such dangerous task?

170
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,520
While I was away from Shen City,

171
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,000
did something happen?

172
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,600
The old Shen's Hospital site connects to

173
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,520
the tavern, whose owner surnamed Shen.

174
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,350
I've visited there several times,

175
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,720
but didn't see the owner.

176
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,150
However,

177
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,310
one time,

178
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,310
I ran into Miss Wanwan there.

179
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,800
Doesn't seem like a coincidence.

180
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,230
We forgot to check one place

181
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,800
about the adoption issue.

182
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,110
The Orphanage.

183
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,560
You've packed your bags?

184
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,840
Are you planning to run away?

185
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,560
Butler Wang,

186
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,880
enforce the family rules.

187
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,760
That woman is pregnant

188
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,000
