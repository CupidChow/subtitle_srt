3
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,190
Come in.

4
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,160
Third Uncle.

5
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,920
This is Miss Wanwan's wedding dress.

6
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,800
I thought it looked a bit plain.

7
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,440
So I added some lace
to the collar and cuffs.

8
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:27,960
You like it?

9
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,150
Wanwan's parents lost their lives

10
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,280
in a fire at home.

11
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,870
Oh?

12
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,960
Miss Wanwan has had a hard life.

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,710
Third Uncle, you must treat her well.

14
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,710
Wanwan showed me your childhood photos.

15
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,630
I know about your relationship.

16
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,710
Please, Third Uncle, don't let this get out.

17
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,230
Was there something more

18
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,160
to her parents' death?

19
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,480
- Back then,
- What are you doing?

20
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,960
She was so young.

21
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,630
I didn't want her to live a life with hatred.

22
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,590
- Back then…
- Master.

23
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,800
- I came to the Yin family in her place.
- Master.

24
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,030
Not only because I feared she'd suffer here,

25
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,630
but also because the Yin family
is prominent in Shen City,

26
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,670
(Miracle Worker)
they'd find the truth of my parents' deaths.

27
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,030
If possible,

28
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,920
I hope she never
learns about the family feud.

29
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,590
Have you found the culprit?

30
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,840
As long as my sister stays with me,

31
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,590
I will never reveal the truth.

32
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,070
The Yin family is involved.

33
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,280
When someone has attachments,

34
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,440
hatred...

35
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,190
should be put aside.

36
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,120
Third Uncle.

37
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,280
Could you promise me something?

38
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,280
No matter what happens in the future,

39
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,430
protect her.

40
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,030
Don't let her find out about these.

41
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,030
She's suffered so much all these years,

42
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,840
let her live happily

43
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,230
from now on.

44
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,680
Please, get up.

45
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,760
Promise me first.

46
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,880
Get up first.

47
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,760
Do you promise?

48
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,150
Alright, I promise you.

49
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,590
Weren't you going to take Miss Wanwan out?

50
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,550
Hurry up, then.

51
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,070
When we got married,

52
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,590
I hired all the tailors in the city

53
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,760
to make over a dozen wedding dresses

54
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,000
for you.

55
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,960
You didn't even glance at them.

56
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,320
Don't...

57
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,110
Let go of it.

58
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,480
Since you treasure it so much,

59
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,070
why don't you put it on

60
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,400
for me?

61
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,550
Put it on!

62
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,510
I want to make Xia Qiu a dress in this color.

63
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,480
Let her wear it at our wedding.

64
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,240
Alright.

65
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,320
Go and have a look.

66
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,030
Sir.

67
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,360
Miss, if you like it,

68
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,710
you can try it on in the store.

69
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,400
Go ahead.

70
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,550
Sir, you really do care about your wife.

71
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,360
I'm going to look around.

72
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,590
Okay.

73
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,320
I wonder if Wanwan

74
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,400
would look better in this dress

75
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,550
than you do.

76
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,590
What exactly are you trying to do?

77
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,640
Remember.

78
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,840
This wedding dress

79
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,070
will never belong to you.

80
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,720
Sir.

81
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,910
Sir,

82
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,320
has your family

83
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,640
ever taken in a girl?

84
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,510
No, I only have a son.

85
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,510
Are you…

86
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,340
Sir,

87
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,920
what was that person asking about?

88
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,470
It's odd, really.

89
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,920
These past two days

90
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,070
people keep coming by to ask

91
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,760
if anyone took in a girl

92
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,760
some ten or so years ag.

93
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,430
Maybe it's some wealthy family

94
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,070
looking for a lost child.

95
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,110
Does it look nice?

96
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,920
It's lovely.

97
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,960
I just bought it on a whim.

98
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,400
Third Master,

99
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,390
is there anything I can do to help you?

100
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,430
Just live well.

101
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,600
When someone has attachments,

102
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,640
hatred...

103
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,600
should be put aside.

104
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,560
The proper formalities can't be skipped.

105
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,390
Since your parents are gone,

106
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,270
let Xia Qiu escort you

107
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,520
at your wedding.

108
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,920
Third Master,

109
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,800
you mean…

110
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,310
I can

111
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,390
spend some time with the Young Madam?

112
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,560
You can't return to your old residence.

113
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,800
But I have another villa.

114
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,190
Tomorrow night, I'll arrange for Xia Qiu

115
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,920
to accompany you there.

116
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,190
Third Master,

117
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,400
thank you.

118
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,390
How's the investigation going?

119
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,720
We've narrowed it down

120
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,390
to a few families
who've adopted daughters.

121
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,390
Their backgrounds seem clean.

122
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,720
Doesn't seem like
they're connected to Lidu.

123
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,030
In what we do, it's better

124
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,560
to kill a thousand by mistake

125
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,110
than let one go.

126
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,480
Understood.

127
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,870
By the way,

128
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,430
what's Hao planning

129
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,270
for tomorrow's wedding?

130
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,880
I heard he hired an assassin.

131
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,800
He's set on killing Yin Heng?

132
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,870
No.

133
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,310
To kill a woman.

134
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,880
That scoundrel.

135
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,110
He only thinks about
petty romantic matters.

136
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,720
In this family,

137
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,960
if he can't be of use to me,

138
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,520
there's no need to keep him around.

139
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,440
By the way,

140
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,600
since the assassin's been hired,

141
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,350
don't waste it.

142
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,760
Leave it there. I'll drink it later.

143
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,390
Did the tavern owner
send Xiao Yun out of the city?

144
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,430
Young Madam,
they've wronged you so much,

145
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,400
yet you still…

146
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,680
They don't know who I am.

147
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,230
How can it be considered harm?

148
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,560
Besides,

149
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,960
helping them was my own choice back then.

150
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,720
Seeing them reminds me of…

151
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,720
Does it look nice?

152
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,840
It's beautiful.

153
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,920
Young Madam,
you haven't slept for nights

154
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:27,030
for Third Master's wedding.

155
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,310
I'm not doing it for him.

156
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,880
All these years,

157
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,760
I've already seen you as my little sister.

158
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,760
Once this is over,

159
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,470
I'll arrange a good marriage for you.

160
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,760
When it's your wedding,

161
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,560
I'll make your wedding dress

162
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,680
and tie your bouquet.

163
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,230
I'll make she watch

164
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,110
how anyone who wants to marry Yin Heng

165
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,190
meets their end.

166
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,150
Young Madam,

167
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,070
tomorrow…

168
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,680
What is it?

169
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,000
I… I heard…

170
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,150
you'll go to the North Villa
to accompany her.

171
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,920
I'm worried you'll be too tired.

172
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,880
I'd like to accompany you.

173
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,110
Get up.

174
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,640
Third Uncle is considerate.

175
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,310
This is what I should do.

176
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,470
(Does Third Uncle
want to give me more time)

177
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,000
(to spend with my sister?)

178
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,070
(Wanwan,)

179
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,680
(maybe you can rely on Third Uncle.)

180
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,150
The day my mother passed away,

181
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,520
Big Brother, where were you?
