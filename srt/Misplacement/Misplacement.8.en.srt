(Shipping Records)
(When Mother was still alive,)

(I never heard of Yi Xing
dealing in medicinal herbs.)

11
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,320
If you ask me, Third Master,

12
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,880
giving up the President's daughter

13
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,960
for a songstress

14
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,510
isn't a profitable trade.

15
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,630
(If they're trying to hide it from me,)

16
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,400
(there must be something fishy going on.)

17
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,440
Lady Fairy,

18
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,840
I fell for you at first sight.

19
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,710
I studied abroad and
am a progressive young man.

20
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,000
Love at first sight…

21
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,920
A progressive young man…

22
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,840
I came here boldly in hopes of...

23
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,400
Who are you?

24
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,960
You're from the Yin family.

25
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,880
Could you help me find Miss Wanwan?

26
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,880
I want to confess my feelings to her.

27
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,910
Are you crazy?

28
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,510
The entire Shen City knows

29
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,880
that Miss Wanwan

30
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,960
is going marry Third Master Yin.

31
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
I just got back from abroad.
I didn't know.

32
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,360
Well, now you know.

33
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,480
Wanwan is my woman.

34
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,640
You...

35
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,400
You're Yin Heng?

36
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,110
Only on the basis of love,

37
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,320
marriage is ethical.

38
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,510
Third Master,

39
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,920
aren't you fluent in English?

40
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,350
What…

41
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,670
what's he saying?

42
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,920
Only on the basis of love,

43
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,360
marriage is ethical.

44
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,550
Well said.

45
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,480
Who are you?

46
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,630
In a way,

47
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,880
we're allies.

48
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,360
I'm still holding out my hand.

49
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,760
Not very gentlemanly of you.

50
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,800
Here's a bonus line for you, lady:

51
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,030
deception

52
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,000
is the enemy of love.

53
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,590
I have no intention of being your ally.

54
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,780
How we doing on investigating Mr. Shen?

55
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,920
I've checked

56
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,800
all the schools and academies

57
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,800
in Shen City.

58
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,230
No teacher surnamed Shen.

59
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,320
I'll have people broaden the search,

60
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,190
look into the shops,

61
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,150
and see if there are any survivors

62
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,760
from Shen's Hospital.

63
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,030
Shen's Hospital? Weren't they...

64
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,720
Master, should we

65
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,880
prepare Third Master's
wedding as scheduled?

66
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,070
Let Xia Qiu handle it.

67
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,870
But...

68
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,000
Young Master might not be pleased.

69
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,670
That's what I want.

70
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,280
You don't want her to marry Yin Heng?

71
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,720
Fine.

72
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,550
Whatever you want,

73
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,070
I'll find a way to give it to you.

74
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,760
What do you plan to do with her?

75
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,510
I'll take her virginity,

76
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,480
see if she'll still

77
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,510
have the face to marry Yin Heng.

78
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,760
Who's there?

79
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:52,950
It's me.

80
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,360
Just what I was looking for.

81
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,640
Young Master Yin,

82
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,880
I have some family matters

83
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,710
to ask Young Madam.

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,840
Hao.

85
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,280
Young Master, Young Madam.

86
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,590
Master has instructed

87
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,800
that Third Master's wedding

88
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,710
be managed by Young Madam.

89
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,840
Okay.

90
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,070
You've been crying.

91
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,840
Someone's outside.

92
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,320
With your status entering the Yin family,

93
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,880
just serve Third Uncle properly.

94
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,070
If there's any negligence
or inappropriate thought…

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,230
The rules of the Yin family

96
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,710
are strict.

97
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,760
Yin family rules are strict indeed.

98
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,230
Can I ask if you live
comfortably under them?

99
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,230
Alive, I'm a member of the Yin family.

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,440
Dead, I'll be a ghost of it.

101
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,840
Madam, no need to worry about others.

102
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,590
Living under the same roof,

103
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,550
we should support each other.

104
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,360
Third Master treats me very well.

105
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,760
If you have any difficulties,

106
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,230
Third Master and I won't stand by.

107
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:12,510
Silly girl, don't do anything foolish.

108
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,440
(My sister hasn't abandoned me.)

109
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,390
Third Master,

110
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,510
thank you.

111
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,230
For what?

112
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:13,000
For sending someone to
accompany me to the Orphanage.

113
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,640
No need for thanks

114
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,310
between us.

115
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,760
From Xia Qiu throwing away all my stuff,

116
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,600
except for this,

117
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,880
to someone trying to kill me even in Lidu,

118
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,720
I knew something was wrong.

119
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,230
She seemed to push me away,

120
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,680
but in reality,

121
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,760
she was protecting me.

122
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,640
Wanwan,

123
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,960
what about your parents?

124
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,920
Why are you asking, Third Master?

125
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,680
Our wedding is near.

126
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,470
It's only right to ask.

127
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,190
There was a fire at home.

128
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,520
They passed away when I was very young.

129
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,000
I see…

130
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,270
But now,

131
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,880
I've found my sister.

132
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,070
It's all thanks to you, Third Master.

133
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,920
As previously agreed,

134
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,000
in the future,

135
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,760
I'll willingly help you cover up

136
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,310
and find the truth
about your mother's death.

137
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,310
I'll be your best partner.

138
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,270
Qingxue,

139
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,470
you're always

140
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,030
by Xia's side.

141
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,680
You know her best.

142
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,070
Tell me,

143
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,390
does she ever mention Third Uncle?

144
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,560
Rarely.

145
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,870
Is that so?

146
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,600
What has she

147
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,520
been talking about recently?

148
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,030
Daily necessities,

149
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,720
your health,

150
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,430
and...

151
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,150
Speak.

152
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,840
Young Madam seems
attentive to Miss Wanwan.

153
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,640
I recall that apart from your mother,

154
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,560
you have a six-year-old brother,

155
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,720
right?

156
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,840
Young Madam is truly loyal to you.

157
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,000
My brother is still young. Please don't...

158
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,520
Whoever she cares about,

159
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,000
I'll kill them.

160
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,680
I'll make she watch

161
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,680
how anyone who wants to marry Yin Heng

162
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,720
meets their end.

163
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,800
Go now.

164
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,430
Take good care of Xia.

165
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,880
Young Master, when do you plan to act?

166
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,030
When Yin Heng…

167
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,310
is at his happiest.

168
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,720
Was there something more

169
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,430
to your parents' deaths?

170
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,190
By the way,

171
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,150
what's Hao planning

172
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,880
for tomorrow's wedding?

173
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,350
I heard he hired an assassin.

174
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,230
He's set on killing Yin Heng?
