3
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,590
Didn't expect this Miss Wanwan

4
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,030
to be the daughter of an acquaintance.

5
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,480
This pocket watch.

6
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,190
I secretly placed it in her luggage.

7
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,030
Why?

8
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,760
Because I'm Shen Zhong's daughter.

9
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,880
I know you've been looking for me,

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,030
wanting to kill me.

11
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,240
I'm scared to die

12
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,920
so I hid the only keepsake

13
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,510
in the room of the woman I hate the most,

14
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,110
hoping that one day you'd find it

15
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,710
and kill her instead.

16
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,840
But there are two girls

17
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,280
in this photo.

18
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,710
I found her burdensome during the fire

19
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,000
so I abandoned her.

20
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,320
She died with my parents long ago.

21
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,480
Since you've kept this
hidden for so long,

22
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,150
why reveal it now?

23
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,070
Wouldn't it be better to

24
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,510
let her die in your place?

25
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,030
Because of my nightmares,

26
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,030
I can't forget my parents' death.

27
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,670
How could I not avenge them?

28
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,150
Mr. Shen, what a good act.

29
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,630
I came as soon as I got your message.

30
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,440
This bastard

31
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,800
really sold out Wanwan.

32
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,710
Wanwan isn't in the Yin Mansion now.

33
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,070
She's safer

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,960
in a crowded place.

35
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,960
You thought it through well.

36
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,590
Kill him.

37
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,710
Third Master, Third Master!

38
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,760
Please spare me!

39
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,400
I had no choice!

40
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,360
Third Master!

41
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,240
My man.

42
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,450
I asked him to keep an eye

43
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,920
on Yin Shixiong.

44
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,630
Young Madam's in danger at home.

45
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,000
It's nice having you around.

46
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,350
Well,

47
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,360
let's grab something to eat.

48
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,350
Okay.

49
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,320
(What?)

50
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,590
(Xia told me to meet Yin Heng here.)

51
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,360
(It was clearly Yin Heng's idea.)

52
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,150
(But he didn't show up himself.)

53
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,150
(Could something happen at home?)

54
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,550
Master.

55
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,720
Let's go.

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,030
Yin Zhenghao!

57
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,590
I'm fine.

58
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,320
It's okay.

59
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,470
It's okay.

60
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:57,910
Xia,

61
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,190
I can also risk my life

62
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,480
for the one I love,

63
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,230
just like Yin Heng.

64
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,350
Look,

65
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,760
Father allowed me to go out,

66
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,150
and I even got you some

67
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,280
foreign gadgets.

68
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,500
You like it?

69
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,580
How could you be so foolish?
Don't you know…

70
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,740
I know.

71
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,660
You've never loved me,

72
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,820
but it's okay.

73
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,620
I love you.

74
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,260
I told you long ago,

75
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,380
if you were to die,

76
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,900
it should be by my hand.

77
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,340
In the end,

78
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,740
I realize I can't bear to lose you.

79
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,620
Hao…

80
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,220
Hao!

81
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,260
Hao!

82
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,620
I remember

83
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,180
when I first arrived here,

84
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,540
Yin Shixiong enforced the family rules on me.

85
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,820
When the whip came down,

86
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,780
you stood in front of me,

87
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,660
just like today.

88
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,060
Your kindness to me,

89
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,900
I've never forgotten.

90
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,820
You always ask if I love you.

91
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,220
In truth,

92
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,260
I've always asked myself

93
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,220
the same question.

94
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,820
All I know is that

95
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,020
the foreign gadgets you burned to ashes…

96
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,820
It wasn't because I liked them.

97
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,540
I just didn't want you

98
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,660
feeling bored at home,

99
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,020
