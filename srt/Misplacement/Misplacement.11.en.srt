4
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,960
Brother Yin Heng.

5
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,480
Where is Brother Yin Heng?

6
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,390
Upstairs.

7
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,720
Wait a moment.

8
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,150
You can't go up yet.

9
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,110
Is he badly injured?

10
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,510
The doctor said

11
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,030
he has to make it through tonight.

12
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,110
Have you heard of
the term "broken palm"?

13
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,510
That's me.

14
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,400
When my parents died,

15
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,000
my sister was trapped

16
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,110
in the Yin family for me,

17
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,070
with her life hanging by a thread.

18
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,670
Even you…

19
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,070
Every time you meet me,
something bad happens.

20
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,480
What kind of fate do I have?

21
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,400
I'm living a hard life

22
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,550
and don't deserve anything.

23
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,280
Yin Heng!

24
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,280
Who let you in?

25
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,840
Yin Heng, you've caused such a big mess.

26
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,400
How long do you plan to hide?

27
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,320
Look,

28
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,960
trouble's come knocking on your door again.

29
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,070
Don't worry.

30
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,760
I won't let them take you.

31
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,070
You disturbed Third Master.

32
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,710
How dare you!

33
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,630
Yin Heng injured someone for no reason.

34
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,030
Hand him over immediately.

35
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,840
Who's masterminding the attack?

36
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,760
Don't you know it yourselves?

37
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,030
Cut the crap.

38
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,280
Wait.

39
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,630
Looks like Miss Wanwan is rational.

40
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,260
(WANTED Yin Heng)

41
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,280
If you want this to disappear,

42
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,800
it's easy.

43
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,230
Unless…

44
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,400
you come with me to the Yin family.

45
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,920
I'll get changed, and we'll leave.

46
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,510
Miss Wanwan,

47
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,670
Young Master doesn't like waiting.

48
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,150
What do you mean?

49
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,480
You don't get it?

50
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,360
They want to take you.

51
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,880
But Third Master won't let them.

52
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,070
Once he wakes up, he'll definitely kill me.

53
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,480
Miss Wanwan,

54
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,510
listen to me.

55
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,510
We'll stand firm against them.

56
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,030
It's not that they want to take me.

57
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,320
I want to go with them.

58
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,230
Now that Third Master may die,

59
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,030
he can't give me anything.

60
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,480
Even if he wakes,

61
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,630
Shen City may not remain the same.

62
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,190
I'd better plan ahead.

63
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,920
You! You…

64
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,280
You ungrateful vixen.

65
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,150
You like him?

66
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,800
Fine, I'll leave him to you.

67
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,670
Let's go.

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,840
Get out!

69
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,800
Out!

70
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,760
We'll see if you can
live in peace after this.

71
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,070
You have no shame.

72
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,760
You don't deserve him.

73
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,590
Brother Yin Heng.

74
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,070
(Please, you must…)

75
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,030
(must…)

76
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,000
(guard him until he wakes up.)

77
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,280
It's too stuffy. I want to go by foot.

78
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,590
Miss Wanwan,

79
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,510
don't playing tricks.

80
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,360
(It seems in this murder,)

81
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,320
(the target isn't just me, it's also Yin Heng.)

82
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,590
(Take care of your injuries.)

83
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,230
(I'll find out the truth.)

84
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,440
Little sister, be good.

85
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,110
It's a blessing from heaven

86
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,190
that you didn't get these injuries.

87
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,710
The wounds will heal.

88
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,550
I've thought it all through.

89
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,320
Now that you can stay by my side,

90
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,760
I'm satisfied.

91
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,350
Xia,

92
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,480
once I enter the Yin family,

93
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,510
I won't let anyone hurt you again.

94
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,590
Xia, is that you?

95
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,760
You scared me to death.

96
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,360
Whose medicine is this?

97
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,710
It's Young Madam's.

98
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,590
What happened to my sister?

99
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,030
Sister?

100
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You're the one that
Young Madam's been looking for.

101
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,230
This is the tonic
Young Madam drinks daily.

102
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,510
But I added

103
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,710
sleeping powder to it.

104
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,550
Because Young Master said…

105
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,230
to… tomorrow…

106
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,590
What's he going to do? Hurry and tell me.

107
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,840
Miss Wanwan,

108
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,960
tomorrow's wedding is dangerous.

109
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,800
I'm worried it might hurt Young Madam.

110
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,190
You're protected by Third Master,

111
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,760
but Young Madam, she…

112
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,760
She has me.

113
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,320
Look at that woman.

114
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,670
So much blood on her wedding dress.

115
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,190
Could it be that
she's murdered her husband?

116
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,990
(Yeah.)

117
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,630
(If I leave you at this time,)

118
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
(it's like killing you with my own hands?)

119
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,960
(But my sister is still in the Yin family,)

120
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,550
(I have no other choice.)

121
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,840
(Yin Heng,)

122
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,000
(if you want to hate…)

123
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,630
(hate me.)

124
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,390
The Yin family's hurt
my sister for so long.

125
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,560
(Now they've harmed my husband,)

126
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,070
(Let me see)

127
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,880
(what else do they want from me?)

128
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,620
(Happiness)

129
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,880
Interesting, Madam.

130
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,000
No.

131
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,030
You probably won't become my Madam.

132
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,760
Because…

133
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,390
you're about to become my woman.

134
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,030
Young Master Yin,

135
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,840
you're really scheming.

136
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,840
What?

137
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,520
It sounds like

138
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,150
you're unwilling.

139
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,960
What am I unwilling about?

140
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,680
Two men from the Yin family
are crazy about me.

141
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,840
I'm honored.

142
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,110
Well said.

143
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,150
I thought

144
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,960
you lowered yourself to me

145
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,800
just to save him.

146
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,350
I, a songstress,

147
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,430
came to Shen City with the goal

148
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,840
of marrying into the Yin family.

149
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,110
Whom I marry doesn't matter.

150
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Well said.

151
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,190
That wedding character…

152
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,470
No need to tear it off.

153
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,990
It's still useful.

154
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,840
Yes.

155
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,720
Unwilling?

156
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,470
So boring.

157
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,030
I thought you were some romantic type.

158
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,920
You don't like me?

159
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,840
Remember this.

160
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,030
It's not about my affection.

161
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,350
I just hate Yin Heng.

162
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,560
Go, escort my second concubine

163
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,390
to rest.

164
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,840
Young Master,

165
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,390
which room did you arrange?

166
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,720
How about Third Uncle's room?

167
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,470
I think

168
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,720
Third Uncle probably

169
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,350
won't be coming back.

170
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,470
That room…

171
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,110
From now on,

172
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,920
it'll be mine, my concubine.

173
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,800
Yes.

174
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,310
This way.

175
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,350
Wanwan is next door.

176
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,440
From now on,

177
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,520
you, as her sister,

178
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,760
should take good care of her.

179
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,520
Sister?

180
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,000
As long as I'm alive,

181
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,000
no one will hurt Xia Qiu.

182
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,430
I'm driving you away,

183
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,000
because I have a more
important mission for you.
