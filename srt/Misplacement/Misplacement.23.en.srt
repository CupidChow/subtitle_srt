3
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,070
You just want to hang out.

4
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,280
You can't let
Yin Heng's efforts go to taste.

5
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,670
Only if you stay at my house...

6
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,280
Hello, Miss.

7
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,190
I'm here to bring you your meal.

8
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,150
Miss Wanwan, you're really cautious.

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,590
Shame to see the poison all go to waste.

10
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,030
Who are you?

11
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,710
Miss Meng, don't panic.

12
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm here to kill her.

13
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,550
Young Master is dead.

14
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,000
She must be buried with him.

15
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,360
It's you.

16
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,400
Yin Zhenghao's servant.

17
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,550
Hao can't just die for nothing.

18
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,800
I want both sisters

19
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,710
to be buried with him.

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,260
(Arsenic)

21
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,800
To ensure everything goes smoothly...

22
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,920
I won't fail you, Master.

23
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,230
Your name is Cheng, right?

24
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,680
Yes.

25
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,000
If this mission succeeds,

26
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,280
you'll be my most trusted aide.

27
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,070
Thank you, Master.

28
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,670
Do you know who I am?

29
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,400
How dare you pose as my servant for murder.

30
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,670
You must be tired of living.

31
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,400
Think twice.

32
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,150
If you kill me,

33
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,960
you won't survive either.

34
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,960
Not just you,

35
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,630
but also your father, your mother,

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,230
and your entire family.

37
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,630
I've killed so many people for Young Master,

38
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,150
and I'm still alive.

39
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,110
Why would it be different this time?

40
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,230
Because you killed people for Yin Zhenghao,

41
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,190
Yin Shixiong is now using you

42
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,510
to kill me, offend the Meng family,

43
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,840
and then take the blame.

44
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,710
All your past sins can be atoned for

45
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,070
in one go.

46
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,110
Impossible!

47
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,400
Master promised me,

48
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,150
as long as I succeed,

49
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,760
I'd be his right-hand man.

50
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,440
Yin Zhenghao is dead.

51
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,480
Don't you need to be buried with him?

52
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,480
That's not true!

53
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,150
Master guaranteed it!

54
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,550
Even if there's only a glimmer of hope,

55
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,510
take it under your control.

56
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,510
Come home with me.

57
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,470
I don't care about

58
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,480
my father's opinions.
You have to come with me.

59
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,800
Wherever you go, I'll go with you.

60
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,440
I promised Brother Yin Heng.

61
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,800
No, it'll only be more dangerous.

62
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,440
Well...

63
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,480
If you want to help me,

64
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,710
notify your father to handle this body,

65
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,710
then come meet me later.

66
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,710
Tonight,

67
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,670
they were supposed

68
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,400
to trade with the foreigners here.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,710
But on your way here,

70
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,670
all the opium

71
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,070
has already been moved.

72
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,320
By now,

73
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,360
it should've reached Lidu.

74
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,190
Hurry up.

75
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,230
Over there.

76
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,840
Move in.

77
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,670
Third Brother,

78
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,590
tell me.

79
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,190
If I burn down this warehouse,

80
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,360
will there be any evidence left?

81
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,480
Shen Zhiqiu.

82
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,320
Is she alive?

83
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,440
Last night, you didn't come back.

84
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,030
I couldn't stop worrying.

85
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,500
So I decided

86
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,940
to sneak into Lidu.

87
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,460
I figured, if…

88
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,660
If something happens,

89
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,260
I'd catch Yin Shixiong off guard.

90
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,940
Leave the rest to me.

91
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,740
I've checked.

92
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,700
There are over a dozen girls here,

93
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,300
all carrying opium.

94
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,500
The trade will proceed in the main hall.

95
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,620
Tonight's buyers

96
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,740
are all disguised as guests.

97
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,780
Where are you going?

98
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,500
Sister Hong's people are everywhere.

99
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,180
She must be working with Yin Shixiong.

100
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,580
Assassinating him is nearly impossible.

101
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,060
You're still looking…

102
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,180
For her, indeed.

103
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,060
You came so early?

104
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,060
Has Yin Heng been finished off?

105
00:06:59,020 --> 00:06:59,860
It's you.

106
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,380
How did you get in here?

107
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,460
You paid people to guard the door.

108
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,940
Why couldn't I pay them to leave?

109
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,660
Impossible.

110
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,300
Guards!

111
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,300
Guards!

112
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,540
Sister Hong,

113
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,980
didn't expect this, huh?

114
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,380
A week ago, I went bankrupt,

115
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,580
bribing

116
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,140
all the guards who'd be here tonight.

117
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,460
You thought I was dead,

118
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,260
that I'd never return to Lidu,

119
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,540
so you didn't increase the security.

120
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,100
Are you crazy?

121
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,940
You destroyed tonight's deal.

122
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,620
Aren't you afraid to die?

123
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,460
I am.

124
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,780
But I'm even more afraid

125
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,260
you villains will die too easily.

126
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,700
Looking back,

127
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,980
if Yin Heng hadn't come to Lidu that day,

128
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,380
I would've been forced
into dealing opium.

129
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,220
Lidu has colluded with Yin Shixiong,

130
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,900
causing countless deaths.

131
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,220
Today,

132
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,660
it's your time to die.

133
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,380
Brother Hai.

134
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,140
Yin Heng planned thoroughly.

135
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,940
He anticipated

136
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,580
there'd be trouble here tonight.

137
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,820
Bitch!

138
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,180
Even if you're still alive now,

139
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,460
Yin Heng won't survive the night.

140
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,180
Once Yin Heng is dead,

141
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,500
Master Yin will come to save me.

142
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,860
By then, none of you will escape.

143
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,780
Damn it, so much nonsense.

144
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:56,860
Let me shoot her down.

145
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,860
Wait.

146
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,220
She can't die so easily.

147
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,380
Tie her up.

148
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,340
- Yes.
- Yes.

149
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,140
Brother Hai,

150
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,220
where exactly is Yin Heng?

151
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,460
Will he be in danger?

152
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,620
He should be with Yin Shixiong.

153
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,820
The deal's location…

154
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,300
Yin Shixiong hasn't revealed it yet.

155
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,020
Yin Heng's thought it through

156
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,180
and stationed people at every location

157
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,580
the deal could move to.

158
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,060
So far, there's no news.

159
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,740
But from what that woman said earlier,

160
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,740
we'll see if Yin Heng

161
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,180
shows up with Yin Shixiong in Lidu.

162
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,180
Yin Heng,

163
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,460
I told you.

164
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,100
We'd make the best partners.

165
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,660
You always had so many questions for me,

166
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,100
and I never answered them properly.

167
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,500
Please stay safe.

168
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,860
Welcome, sir.

169
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,780
This way.

170
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,740
Welcome.

171
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,380
This way.

172
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,940
(I must play the role of Sister Hong well.)

173
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,580
(Nothing about tonight's deal
can leak outside Lidu.)

174
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,500
(Anyone involved in this deal,)

175
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,740
(once enters Lidu,)

176
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,020
(can never leave.)

177
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,900
Seeing me alive

178
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,820
disappoints you, huh?

179
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,740
Master Yin,

180
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,380
you're late.

181
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,940
Miss Shen Zhiqiu,

182
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,860
waiting here especially for me?

183
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,180
I'm truly honored.

184
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,380
Do you know why I've waited for you?

185
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,460
I'd love to know.

186
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,460
Twenty years ago,

187
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,780
you murdered my parents.

188
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,500
You then adopted Xia Qiu

189
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,540
but drove her to her death.

190
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,940
Actually,

191
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,940
Xia Qiu was a good girl.

192
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,580
What a pity.

193
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:06,260
You took Yin Heng's business,
killed his mother,

194
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,820
all for smuggling opium,
harming the country.

195
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,260
That's why I've waited for you.

196
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,620
You're not waiting for me.

197
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,140
You're waiting for death.

198
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,020
Where is Yin Heng? Tell me!

199
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,700
Where is he?

200
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,580
Listen to me.

201
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,060
Please,

202
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,740
listen to me,

203
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,300
one last time.

204
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,180
I want you alive.

205
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,660
Stay alive.

206
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,340
