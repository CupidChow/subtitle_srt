4
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,180
When will you stop avoiding me?

5
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,740
If I really wanted to avoid you,

6
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,820
would I still be at Lidu?

7
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,980
Lidu is extremely dangerous.

8
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,580
You're exposing yourself to the public.

9
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,020
Go back with me.

10
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,300
Be good, alright?

11
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,660
You're joking.

12
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,820
In a place like Lidu,

13
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,820
in front of so many people,

14
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,340
what danger could I possibly be in?

15
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,220
Appearing as Wanwan

16
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,860
is actually to protect myself.

17
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,100
Whether you're Wanwan

18
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,460
or Shen Zhiqiu,

19
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,580
you're leaving with me today.

20
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,020
I'm a songstress,

21
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,340
not a prostitute.

22
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,140
Don't worry.

23
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,620
You're my fiancée.

24
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,900
How can I not worry about you?

25
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,540
Wanwan,

26
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,420
it's your turn on stage.

27
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,620
Why aren't you out yet?

28
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,220
Got it, Sister Hong.

29
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,780
I'm changing.

30
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,220
Third Master,

31
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,220
if you don't leave, people will...

32
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,780
You asked for an
extra performance yourself.

33
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,540
Why are you still dawdling back there?

34
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,100
Sister Hong,

35
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,620
I'm not done changing yet.

36
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,980
Please wait for me.

37
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,940
Sister Hong, someone's here to see you.

38
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,860
Coming.

39
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,740
Hurry up.

40
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,340
People say that

41
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,700
don't easily let others watch your back.

42
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,060
Third Master, you saw it.

43
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,100
I'm not carrying any weapons

44
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,900
and won't assassinate

45
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,740
your dear brother.

46
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,740
As long as you know

47
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,340
what you should and shouldn't do.

48
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,140
What should I do?

49
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,620
Live well.

50
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,700
Let me help you.

51
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,860
Third Master,

52
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,900
we're even now.

53
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,060
How's it going?

54
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,220
She's right.

55
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,260
In a place like Lidu,

56
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,780
if anything happens,

57
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,100
it'll be big news in Shen City.

58
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,900
Yin Shixiong wouldn't dare act rashly.

59
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,620
I'll go check the West Warehouse.

60
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,860
You head back first.

61
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,860
Why should I head back?

62
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,260
Because it's dangerous.

63
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,740
I'm not afraid of danger.

64
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,940
Go back.

65
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,100
Miss Wanwan,

66
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,740
are you sure about this?

67
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,740
We don't have much time.

68
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,820
Yesterday, you told me about

69
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,660
Xiao Mei.

70
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,100
- I found Xiao Yun in a tailor shop.
- Come here.

71
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,270
- No.
- She told me…

72
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,380
I'll treat you well.

73
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,780
Master often brought Young Master

74
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,620
to Lidu for elite banquets.

75
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,060
Young Master was handsome,

76
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,900
so many girls hoping to escape their pasts

77
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,420
would try to get close to him.

78
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,380
Once,

79
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,820
Young Master disciplined a drunken man,

80
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,340
saving a girl from harassment.

81
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,900
That girl

82
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,260
was Xiao Mei.

83
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,060
Xiao Mei fell in love with Young Master.

84
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,020
Master Yin.

85
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,900
To please Master,

86
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,820
she agreed to his demands

87
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,460
and helped him in the opium trade,

88
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,580
only to be violated one night

89
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,740
by an opium-smoking guest.

90
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,220
Lidu would close for one day each month.

91
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,180
I thought it was for rest.

92
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:24,700
I never imagined

93
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,780
it was for an even filthier trade.

94
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,780
This month, that day should've been today,

95
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,380
but it's been delayed by a week.

96
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,340
You've only been back a few days,

97
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,100
and you've uncovered secrets like this.

98
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,460
Most of the women

99
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,860
helping Lidu and Yin Shixiong
with their trades

100
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,500
do it for money.

101
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,180
I could just pay them.

102
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,220
So you plan to wait a week?

103
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,780
On the monthly trade day,

104
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,540
Yin Shixiong always shows up.

105
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,060
This is not just for my sister,

106
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,220
but for my parents.

107
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,900
Yin Shixiong is very cautious.

108
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,540
Because of Yin Zhenghao's death,

109
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,700
this shipment has been held back.

110
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,140
How long will it take?

111
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,260
A week.

112
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,060
Be careful

113
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:18,740
during this time.

114
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,260
Don't worry about me.

115
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,540
I'm living a better life here
than at North Villa.

116
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,780
I've even gained weight.

117
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,060
What are you doing?

118
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,780
I went the wrong way.
