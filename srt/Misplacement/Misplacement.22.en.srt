00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,840
Playing the bad woman

5
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,110
is really fun.

6
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,320
Leave us alone.

7
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:25,920
I want to talk to her.

8
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,320
- Yes.
- Yes.

9
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:36,920
I've watched many plays recently.

10
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,070
How's my acting?

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,840
No way.

12
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,190
Even that didn't fool you?

13
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,800
I saw you and Tang Zhe

14
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,230
at the Guangming Cinema.

15
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,150
Yin Heng and I pretended to fall out,

16
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,030
and he agreed to marry you,

17
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,960
so as to fool Yin Shixiong.

18
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,710
Yin Heng sent me to the Meng family

19
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,920
because he wanted to keep me safe.

20
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,150
You shouldn't have sent me in.

21
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,880
I can't let you

22
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,320
stay in Lidu any longer.

23
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,840
I'll figure out a way

24
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,710
to get you to the Meng family.

25
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,000
So,

26
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,840
you and Brother Yin Heng

27
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,630
were acting in the first place?

28
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,030
You could say that.

29
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,710
I thought I was the lead actress.

30
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,230
Since you knew all along

31
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,440
that this was arranged by Brother Heng,

32
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,800
you still came anyway.

33
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:39,910
Looks like

34
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,150
you're really afraid of dying.

35
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,190
I'm willing to play along

36
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,880
because it's the only way
to see your father.

37
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,070
I want to talk to him.

38
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,190
Whatever you want to say,

39
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,800
Brother Heng has already told my father.

40
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,350
Master Meng,

41
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,550
I invited you here today

42
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,320
to show you these.

43
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,510
Are these really

44
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,760
what Yin Shixiong's done?

45
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,070
It's true.

46
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,960
These are the evidence.

47
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,400
It's not enough.

48
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,880
It isn't enough to convict him.

49
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,800
Master Meng,

50
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,030
I have a way.

51
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,150
But...

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,280
I'll need your daughter's help.

53
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,190
What a joke.

54
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,400
How can I

55
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,840
gamble my daughter's reputation?

56
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,800
Father.

57
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,430
Father,

58
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,510
I'm willing.

59
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,400
My father's so stubborn.

60
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,840
He won't let you into my house.

61
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,400
For now,

62
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,190
you'll have to stay here.

63
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,480
Once Brother Yin Heng succeeds,

64
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,920
he'll come for you.

65
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,800
I can't stay here.

66
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,320
Are you scared,

67
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:22,800
afraid to sleep alone?

68
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,480
Then I'll stay here with you.

69
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,670
You still don't trust me?

70
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,550
It's not that I don't trust you.

71
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,110
I just have more important things to do.

72
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,550
Got it.

73
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,070
You're hungry.

74
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,800
Tang Zhe says food matters most.

75
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,800
Hello, Miss.

76
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,630
I'm here to bring you your meal.

77
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,910
Thank you.

78
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,910
Dinner time.

79
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,710
Who just came by to deliver the food?

80
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,800
How would I know?

81
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,630
Not your family's servant?

82
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:12,760
My family has so many servants.

83
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,030
How could I recognize them all?

84
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,630
I remember their clothes

85
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,670
are all made by Jinsheng Tailor.

86
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,680
Yeah,

87
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,190
even for servants, they wear the best.

88
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,070
But that one wasn't wearing those.

89
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,670
What are you trying to say?

90
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,960
We're being watched.

91
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,480
The food may have been tampered with.

92
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,150
We can't stay here.

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,840
Come with me.

94
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,800
You really don't need me to go with you?

95
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,960
No.

96
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,840
I've been pretending to cooperate

97
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,000
with Yin Shixiong,

98
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,150
just to gather more evidence.

99
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,190
I can't afford any mistakes.

100
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,190
After tonight,

101
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,670
Yin Shixiong will finally be convicted.

102
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,510
Take good care of Miss Meng

103
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,920
and Wanwan.

104
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,990
Alright.

105
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,000
Third Brother,

106
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,760
you came yourself.

107
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:39,960
Big Brother,

108
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,710
following you out on a job,

109
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,590
I'll of course do as you say.

110
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,110
Yin Shixiong!

111
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,800
If you have the guts, kill me!

112
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,400
Master,

113
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,070
he's got a tough mouth.

114
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,960
Third Brother, how about...

115
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,590
How about you help me ask

116
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,360
what exactly he's found out?

117
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,110
Let him go.

118
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,920
Third Master,

119
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,680
you're here.

120
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,560
I'll take you out.

121
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,520
The stuff, they…

122
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,310
They haven't found it yet.

123
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,880
It's at the place we agreed on before.

124
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,800
I'm too soft,

125
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,070
hesitant to kill.

126
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,430
You help me finish him off.

127
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,270
It's also a contribution to Yi Xing.

128
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,230
Spare me, Third Master!

129
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,760
Third Master!

130
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,350
Third Master!

131
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,640
I… I can't make it.

132
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,600
That opium…

133
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,470
To gain their trust,

134
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,030
I've used it too.

135
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,190
Third Master,

136
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,350
this is...

137
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,470
all I can do.

138
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,720
Third Master... Third Master!

139
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,720
Please don't… Third Master!

140
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,760
Third Master, don't…

141
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,110
Third Master!

142
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,110
I don't regret it.

143
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,000
He just died.

144
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,470
What a pity.

145
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,150
Third Brother,

146
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,310
you really can do it, huh?

147
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,960
I'm impressed.

148
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,430
He's worked for you for so many years,

149
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,760
and you can still kill him.

150
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,760
If not for this,

151
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,760
I wouldn't know how to kill you.

152
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,070
Butler Wang,

153
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,560
you can kill Third Master now.

154
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,000
This is our best chance.

155
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,430
You're still recovering.

156
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,150
I'll infiltrate them.

157
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,000
Third Master!

158
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,150
Be careful

159
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,190
during this time.

160
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,070
Third Master,

161
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,150
don't worry about me.

162
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,030
You guessed right.

163
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,190
This is indeed

164
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,720
a place dealing in opium.

165
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,150
How could you

166
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,470
let Yi Xing get involved in this?

167
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,150
You'll get countless people killed!

168
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,800
You really are your mother's good son.

169
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,270
Your mother said the same to me.

170
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,270
My mother

171
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,470
always treated you like her own son.

172
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,070
She was indeed very kind to me.

173
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,230
I didn't want to kill her.

174
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,840
But she didn't let me sell opium at all.

175
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,150
I know.

176
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,560
All these years,

177
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,880
you've been investigating her death.

178
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,270
So I'll let you die knowing the truth.

179
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,430
Don't underestimate this opium.

180
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,880
Your mother

181
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,390
died from swallowing just a bit of it.

182
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,410
You bastard!

183
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,350
Calm down, Third Brother.

184
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,600
I'll send you to reunite
with you mother.

185
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,070
Oh.

186
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,350
And Miss Shen, Shen Zhiqiu.

187
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,150
I wonder

188
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,150
how she's doing now.

189
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,400
Master.

190
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,800
- Master!
- Master!

191
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,640
Think it through.

192
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,800
If I die,

193
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,920
can Shen Zhiqiu still survive?

Miss Meng, don't panic.

I'm here to kill her.

196
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,600
Young Master is dead.

197
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,030
She must be buried with him.

198
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,560
Third Brother,

199
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,150
tell me.

200
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,520
If we burn down this warehouse,

201
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,960
will there be any evidence left?
