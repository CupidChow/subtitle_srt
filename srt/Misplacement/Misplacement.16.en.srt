Enforce the family rules.

Find out who this Wanwan

6
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,440
truly is.

7
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,220
You…

8
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,190
What are you doing?

9
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,590
Since you couldn't leave,

10
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,030
head back to your room.

11
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,880
My injuries are healed now.

12
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,510
Shouldn't I return?

13
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,000
Third Master, your room...

14
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,550
That room's dirty.

15
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,000
I'll stay somewhere else.

16
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,880
His luck is incredible,

17
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,030
surviving even that.

18
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,960
Don't worry, Master.

19
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,360
I'll find someone else to...

20
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,280
No need.

21
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,670
Even such a serious injury

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,440
didn't end his life.

23
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,320
Until Zhenghao's shipment returns safely,

24
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,920
don't make any more moves.

25
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,190
Otherwise,

26
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,280
it'll draw unwanted attention,

27
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,920
which won't be good for us.

28
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,200
Send someone

29
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,920
to keep an eye on him.

30
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,190
See what he's up to.

31
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,510
Yes.

32

(related the death of
Third Master's mother.)

36
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,190
(Back then they refused to send a doctor.)

37
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,280
(Yin Shixiong is searching Shen sisters.)

38
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,630
(It must be tied to
the Shen family tragedy.)

39
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,550
(If he finds out)

40
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,320

Big Brother,

Master Meng wants to meet you tomorrow.

62
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,550
You're still in contact with him?

63
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,070
Of course.

64
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,070
After all, Yuanyuan's been
taking care of me.

65
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,230
Will you join me tomorrow?

66
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,480
No, I'll pass.

67
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,550
After facing life and death,

68
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,800
I've lost all interest in family business.

69
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,110
I'll have a date
with Yuanyuan tomorrow night

70
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,550
at the Guangming Cinema

71
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,590
to watch a movie.

72
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,630
It seems like

73
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,960
you've truly thought it all through.

74
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,440
I've switched out the meds.

75
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,760
It not poisonous.

76
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,320
What are you looking for?

77
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,070
It's a bit bitter.

78
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,920
There's usually sugar here.

79
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,150
I'll go buy some.

80
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,840
Never mind. It's okay.

81
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:09,990
Sit down.

82
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,430
Here.

83
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,280
Third Uncle's back.

84
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,440
Miss Meng took great care of him.

85
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,920
Third Uncle asked me
to arrange for you to meet.

86
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,360
Tell him the truth.

87
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,630
He'll understand.

(Guangming Grand Cinema)

89
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,590
I've thought about it too.

90
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,440
When Zhenghao returns,

91
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,230
I'll tell him about the baby.

92
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,670
While he's happy,

93
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,960
I'll ask him to stop my meds and let you go.

94
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,440
Now that

95
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,360
he's got the family business he wanted,

96
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,760
and Third Uncle is fine,

97
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,840
you and Third Uncle…

98
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,320
But if it doesn't go well,

99
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,630
you'll be in danger.

100
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:21,190
How could you throw away
Third Uncle's gift?

101
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,030
You need to mend things with him

102
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,230
to protect me,

103
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,110
or we'll both be enemies
of the Yin family.

104
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,190
How could our life go on then?

105
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:30,950
Take this.

106
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,030
Take it.

107
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,800
This was left to me by Third Master,

108
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,560
for self-defense.

109
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,190
I never returned it.

110
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,270
Now I'll give it to you.

111
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,230
So I can rest easy

112
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,390
when I'm not around.

113
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,800
Promise me.

114
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,800
Wait for me to return.

115
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,390
I promise.

Are you okay, Young Master?

120
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,560
You've been working day and night.

121
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,880
I'm worried about your health.

122
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,430
Will Xia like this foreign gadget?

123
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,960
Whatever you give,

124
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,560
she'll surely like them.

125
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,840
Go buy some candy.

126
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,400
She dislikes bitterness.

127
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,760
Yes.

128
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,600
After so long,

129
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,520
you still haven't found the Shen sisters?

130
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,800

131
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,430
Did you check the Orphanage?

No matter what,

133
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,840
you must cut the weeds at their roots.

134
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,270
Father,

135
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,110
you're back.

136
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,070
Weren't you heading to Master Meng?

137
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,560
Something came up at home,
so I returned early.

138
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,760
Is it serious?

139
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,560
Have you been taking your meds

140
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,190
on time recently?

141
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,760
Every day.

142

143

Drink it.

144
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,520
Father, you're mistaken.

145
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,600
I've already had today's.

146

Let me ask her.

She…

153
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,230
She's feeling unwell

154
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,880
and has gone to bed.

155
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,030
Go, fetch her.

you were right.

161

165

This shipment is labeled
as medicinal herbs.

It's exactly what
you've been investigating.

167

No.

168

I can't let you take this risk.

169

This is our best chance.

170
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,800
You're still recovering.

171
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,430
I'll infiltrate them.

172
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,350
Third Master,

173
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,030
you need to watch not just

174
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,470
the major apothecaries,

175
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,520
but surely other places too.

176
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,110

190
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,390
Since you've already known,

191
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,920
there's no point hiding it from you.

192
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,270
I intend to keep you tied to the Yin family,

193
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,760
to Zhenghao.

194
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,800
And if Zhenghao is gone one day,

195
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,150
don't think you'll survive on your own.

196
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,760
I want you to beg me, in tears,

197
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,840
to accompany Zhenghao

198
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,880
on the road to hell.

199
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,480
Master,

200
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,230
look at what I found.

201
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,800
Because of my nightmares,

202
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,000
I can't forget the murder of my parents.

203
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,390
How could I not seek revenge?

204
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,760
Mr. Shen, what a good act.
