(After last night,)

5
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:28,930
(I could die without regrets.)

6
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,360
(If there's an afterlife,)

7
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,000
(I'll kiss you a thousand times.)

8
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,980
(Name: Shen Zhiqiu, Alias: Wanwan)

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,440
Master, tell me.

10
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,190
Does this mean

11
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,630
I'm about to enter the Yin family?

12
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,110
So what if she ran away back then?

13
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,800
In the end,

14
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,190
she still ends up dying by my hands.

15
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,550
This's the price the Shen family pays

16
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,880
for opposing you, Master.

17
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,480
But, Master,

18
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,190
why not get someone more capable

19
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,440
to simply kill…

20
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,230
She's right.

21
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,920
Since she dared to return to Lidu,

22
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,510
it means she's still

23
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,920
holding onto evidence.

24
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,590
Killing her

25
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,150
won't solve the problem.

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,880
Understood.

27
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,320
Tomorrow,

28
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,230
it will depend on how Yin Heng performs.

29
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,880
If he can help me

30
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,110
win over the Meng family,

31
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,480
I might consider

32
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,590
letting him live.

33
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,280
Thanks to Master Meng,

34
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,800
Yi Xing has thrived in an unimpeded way

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,070
in Shen City.

36
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,710
Since Hao's been gone for some time,

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,840
it's time for Yi Xing

38
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,550
to reopen.

39
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,630
After tonight,

40
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,440
we will be one family.

41
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,470
Tomorrow,

42
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,590
a double celebration.

43
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,670
Good.

44
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,160
You see?

45
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,190
You still need to beg me to marry you.

46
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,030
Master Meng,

47
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,960
thank you for your forgiveness

48
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,780
and still being willing
to marrying Yuanyuan to me.

49
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,200
Third Brother,

50
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,510
don't rush.

51
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,550
Wait for a distinguished guest.

52
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,880
The wedding wine...

53
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,360
Everyone should drink it together, right?

54
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,160
This way.

55
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,630
Isn't this Heng's former fiancée?

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,150
Why invite her here?

57
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,100
Master Meng.

58
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,190
How dare you come here?

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,840
What now?

60
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,880
Trying to ruin my plans again?

61
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,230
I'm spoiling your joy, huh?

62
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,440
Please, Miss Wanwan, have a seat.

63
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,950
No need.

64
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,200
Bring her up.

65
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,800
What?

66
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,590
You worry about her?

67
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,110
Of course not.

68
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,190
I just don't want an old flame

69
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,960
to spoil the mood of a new one.

70
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,030
Master Meng,

71
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,760
this woman is

72
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,760
a liar, stirring chaos in my family.

73
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,480
She nearly drove
my brother and me apart,

74
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,760
and almost

75
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,230
ruined the marriage
between our families.

76
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,510
Today,

77
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,880
bringing her here

78
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,840
is to settle this debt.

79
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,510
Isn't that right, Third Brother?

80
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:02,950
How about

81
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,280
driving her out of the Shen city?

82
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,320
Master Meng,

83
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,360
you may not be aware,

84
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,280
but Yin family business…

85
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,630
It is none of your concern.

86
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,320
Back then, I was gravely injured,

87
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,840
and you left me

88
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,710
to seek out my nephew.

89
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,590
After he passed away, you left him,

90
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,070
returning to Lidu.

91
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,550
For what?

92
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,760
Trying to catch another rich husband?

93
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,640
Master Yin,

94
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,760
well played.

95
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,960
Third Brother,

96
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,880
how should this be handled?

97
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,320
Someone,

98
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,550
take her away.

99
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,280
Father.

100
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,390
Father,

101
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,070
she once humiliated me publicly.

102
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,390
Now,

103
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,360
I want her to serve me tea,

104
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,840
to be my servant girl.

105
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,190
I also want her

106
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,280
to witness me marrying Brother Yin Heng.

107
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,880
Since Yuanyuan has asked,

108
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:02,510
this woman is yours to deal with.

109
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,110
Take her away.

110
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,550
Brother Yin Heng,

111
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,070
cheers.

112
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,960
Don't let that woman ruin our mood.

113
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,960
Big Brother, a toast to you.

114
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,880
Third Brother,

115
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,510
the Yin family can't do without you.

116
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,110
Of course.

117
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,440
By the way,

118
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,720
tomorrow night,

119
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,230
join me in handling a batch of goods.

120
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,510
In the future, I will rely on you

121
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,190
to deal with the foreigners.

122
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,550
Got it.

123
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,480
Not going in?

124
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,630
You must have forgotten,

125
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,480
today is my mother's death anniversary.

126
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,100
I should pay my respects
in the North Villa.

127
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,400
I did forget.

128
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
Take your time. I'll head in first.

129
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,720
Master,

130
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,390
Third Master he…

131
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,840
He's still obedient.

132
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:35,800
Does he truly treat that woman

133
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,470
as just a fleeting affair?

134
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,560
His feelings for her are nearly written

135
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,800
all over his face.

136
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,520
Does he think I'm a fool?

137
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,920
Then why not call his bluff?

138
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,110
Meng Yuanyuan likes him.

139
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,720
Why not use that

140
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,840
to get him to do what we need?

141
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,720
Once it's settled,

142
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,640
we'll deal with that woman.

143
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,110
Even if he's angry,

144
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,800
once he's on my ship,

145
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,230
it won't be so easy

146
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,800
to get off.

147
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,230
Master.

148
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:06,910
Yes?

149
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,640
Third Master's subordinate, Xiao Wu,

150
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,030
was reported today.

151
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,800
He was spotted earlier

152
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,110
taking photos at the warehouse.

153
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,390
What photos?

154
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,520
We're still interrogating him.

155
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,680
Yin Heng's orders?

156
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,600
No matter the means,

157
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,150
make him talk.

158
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,520
Yes.

159
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,070
Third Brother,

160
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,760
I spared your life,

161
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,680
yet you have a death wish.

162
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,020
(Mother Yang of the Yin family)

163
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,940
(Wanwan.)

164
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,740
(Trust me.)

165
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,500
(Trust me.)

166
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,660
I'll send you to reunite with you mother.

167
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,220
Oh.

168
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,540
And Miss Shen, Shen Zhiqiu.

169
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,420
I wonder how she's doing now.

170
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,060
