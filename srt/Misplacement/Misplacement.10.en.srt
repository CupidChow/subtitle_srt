(North Villa)

5
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,110
What are you doing?

6
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,120
Xia!

7
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,320
This is your wedding dress.

8
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,190
Oh, Xia,

9
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,440
I also have something for you.

10
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,800
This.

11
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,400
I picked it with Third Master
for you a few days ago.

12
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,550
It's beautiful.

13
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,230
Thank you and Third Master.

14
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,710
Don't just stand there.
Try on the wedding dress.

15
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,880
See if it fits.

16
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,030
Xia,

17
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,550
try on the new clothes I gave you too.

18
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:07,910
Alright.

19
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,070
You caught a cold?

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,280
It doesn't matter.

21
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,840
Xia,

22
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,480
how exactly is your life in…

23
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,280
You can't call me that after today.

24
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,760
Starting tomorrow,

25
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,190
you'll become Third Master's wife.

26
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,710
In terms of seniority,

27
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,550
you'll be my Madam.

28
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,440
But today, you're still my sister.

29
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,120
Xia,

30
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,590
few days ago, at the Orphanage,

31
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,720
I heard that you…

32
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,030
Don't listen to their nonsense.

33
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,800
I'm really doing fine.

34
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,880
Xia, I've never worn something
that fits this well.

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,840
It's nothing.

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,440
You said I wsa too strong-willed

37
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,880
to bear any grievance.

38
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,200
Xia,

39
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,800
is it because of me…

40
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,800
If you're swollen from crying,

41
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,550
you won't look good tomorrow.

42
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,400
It's Yin Zhenghao.

43
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,320
He did this to you.

44
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,190
These scars

45
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,510
were from when I was young and reckless.

46
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,110
They don't hurt anymore.

47
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,440
The Yin family

48
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,880
has many rules.

49
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,670
Then tell me.

50
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,920
If Yin Zhenghao dies,

51
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,630
will you also die?

52
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,400
Is that another rule of the Yin family?

53
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,400
Xia,

54
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,630
say something.

55
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,590
I finally found you.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,190
Don't leave me.

57
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,400
Of course not.

58
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,360
Doesn't it fit perfectly?

59
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,510
Why would I lie to you?

60
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,550
I'll stay with you.

61
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,380
(Mother Yang of the Yin family)

62
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,800
Mother,

63
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,280
(Rest in peace. Mother Yang of the Yin family)

64
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,840
I didn't listen to you
and took over Yi Xing.

65
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,110
You always wanted to see the world,

66
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,320
but I didn't stay by your side,

67
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,320
or protect you well.

68
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,230
Now I'm back.

69
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,880
I'll get to the bottom of everything.

70
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,150
Rest assured.

71
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,440
I won't let Yi Xing

72
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,440
fall into Yin Shixiong's hands.

73
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,030
I'm here

74
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,070
to check on the groom.

75
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,840
This is Mother Yang's…

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,920
Don't touch it.

77
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,230
Looks like…

78
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,190
you still haven't let go.

79
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,800
The day my mother passed away,

80
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,760
Big Brother, where were you?

81
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,280
You know,

82
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,190
when she passed,

83
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,760
I wasn't in Shen City either.

84
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,960
I rushed back as soon
as I heard the news.

85
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,840
She was always frail

86
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,190
and you were away for years.

87
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:32,550
She must have fallen ill from missing you.

88
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,600
Third Brother,

89
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,800
you shouldn't blame yourself too much.

90
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,710
Let's not talk about it.

91
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,840
Tomorrow is your big day.

92
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,590
This is a gift from me.

93
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,190
It's getting late.

94
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,760
Get some rest.

95
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,710
(I've checked the records.)

96
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,590
(You didn't leave the city that day.)

97
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,110
Young Master, drink this while it's warm.

98
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,920
Don't want it? Fine.

99
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,280
He has been in a bad mood lately.

100
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,150
After tomorrow,

101
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,840
find a doctor

102
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,190
for him.

103
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,280
Got it.

104
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,840
That won't be necessary.

105
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,150
After tomorrow,

106
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,150
I'll be in a good mood.

107
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,470
Father,

108
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,880
if Third Uncle never returns to Shen City,

109
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,760
would you pass the business to me?

110
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,030
Of course.

111
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,150
I didn't let you get involved before

112
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,920
because you were unwell.

113
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,630
Now that

114
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,710
you're recovering,

115
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,200
and…

116
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,000
you're my only son,

117
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,880
who else would I pass Yi Xing to?

118
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,520
But if Third Uncle comes back,

119
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,920
things might not go as planned.

120
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,760
Master,

121
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,560
are you...

122
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,350
Since childhood,

123
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,680
I used Yin Heng to suppress him,

124
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,760
and make him believe

125
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,470
Yin Heng took everything from him.

126
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,680
At this point,

127
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,230
as a father,

128
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,430
I have no choice but to push him.

129
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,360
Master,

130
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,390
you've truly gone to great lengths

131
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,000
for Young Master's future.

132
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,760
Yin Heng,

133
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,920
we'll see.

134
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,270
Third Master.

135
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,560
Third Master.

136
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,070
We're ready to go.

137
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,880
You're dressed to impress.

138
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,190
Afraid I'll outshine you, Third Master?

139
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,800
Let's go.

140
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,190
The show is about to begin.

141
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,390
Have you been here before, Xia?

142
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,350
Third Master's mother
loved this courtyard.

143
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,470
After Old Madam passed,

144
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,390
Third Master bought it.

145
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,960
You're the first person

146
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,520
besides him to live here.

147
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,270
From now on,

148
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,800
don't call me Xia anymore.

149
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,350
Be a good bride to Third Master.

150
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,150
Keep it.

151
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,270
Don't let anyone see it.

152
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,560
It's you, isn't it?

153
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,150
What are you doing?

154
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,150
I should ask you the same question.

155
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,180
- Abduct the bride.
– Abduct the groom.

156
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,150
Well…

157
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,310
aren't we here…

158
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,000
to abduct the newlyweds?

159
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,960
Hush!

160
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,150
Quiet, will you?

161
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,150
Don't mess up my plan.

162
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,640
You…

163
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,600
Let go of me!

164
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,190
Let go of me!

165
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,070
- Oh, no.
- Who are you?

166
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,230
Let go of me!

167
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,150
Isn't that a Yin family carriage?

168
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,520
No one would pick up
a bride without fireworks

169
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,000
and just take her away.

170
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,760
Thi… Third Master.

171
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:03,990
Third Master.

172
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,150
Some men

173
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,680
have abducted Wanwan.

174
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,560
- That way.
- That way.

175
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,150
Xiao Wu,

176
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,190
escort Young Madam home.

177
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,110
Alright.

178
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,680
Be careful, Third Master.

179
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,030
My motor!

180
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,310
Third Master!

181
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,600
- Stay still.
- Let go of me.

182
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,110
Stop!

183
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,640
Let go of her.

184
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,640
Well, Third Master.

185
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,070
A grand display of hero thing.

186
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,960
You know me?

187
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,190
Of course. I'm paid.

188
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,800
What do you want?

189
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,070
Let her go first.

190
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,520
Kneel down

191
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,800
right here on the street.

192
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,270
Kowtow to me three times,
and I'll let her go.

193
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,390
Deal.

194
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,800
Third Master.

195
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,760
It's worthwhile.

196
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,800
Facing death today,

197
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,960
at least you've got
a beauty to accompany you.

198
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,440
Third Master!

199
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,360
Are you hurt?

200
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,600
Third Master!

201
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,310
Third Master!

202
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,440
Third Master.

203
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,230
It's alright.

204
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:56,960
It's alright.

205
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,520
I'll call for help right now.

206
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,440
Third Master.

207
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,370
Wanwan.

208
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:03,840
Call me Yin Heng.

209
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,030
Third Master sounds too distant.

210
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,350
Yin Heng.

211
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,560
Yin Heng.

212
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,000
You'll be okay. You'll be okay.

213
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,230
Please, Yin Heng.

214
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,960
Stay with me. Stay with me.

215
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,150
You hear me. Stay with me.

216
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,000
Wanwan,

217
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,680
we haven't even had the ceremony yet.

218
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,430
Yin Heng,

219
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,680
keep awake.

220
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,800
Yin Heng.

221
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,800
Yin Heng!

222
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,720
Yin Heng!

223
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,230
They weren't trying to take me.

224
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,720
I wanted to go with them.

225
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,470
Third Master's life
is hanging by a thread.

226
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,070
Even if he wakes,

227
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,800
Shen City may not remain the same.

228
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,430
It's better to make plans early.

229
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,520
You might not become my Madam.

230
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,070
Because...

231
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,920
you're about to become my woman.
