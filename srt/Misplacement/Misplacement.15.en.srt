00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:03,870
Tang Zhe,

4
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,120
before I got injured,

5
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,150
the Yin family was
investigating which families

6
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,150
adopted girls 15 years ago.

7
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,150
I'm afraid Shen sisters' identities

8
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,060
can't be kept hidden.

9
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:14,900
(Hope Orphanage)

10
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,190
You must find a way

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,800
to destroy their files at the Orphanage.

12
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,740
(Hope Orphanage Registration Form)

13
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,420
(Orphan Shen Zhixia)

14
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,500
(Eldest daughter, parents deceased,
elder sister of Shen Zhiqiu)

15
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,620
(Second daughter, parents deceased,
younger sister of Shen Zhixia)

16
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,800
A servant of the Yin family lost a child,

17
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,510
claiming the child was sent here.

18
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,230
Investigate the registration records here.

19
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,880
Mr. Tang, what are you eating?

20
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,710
You want some?

21
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,260
- Search.
- Yes.

22
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,920
(My teacher never taught me)

23
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,440
(whether eating paper would kill people.)

24
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,880
Xia.

25
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,880
Qingxue. Qingxue!

26
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,880
Bring my medicine, quickly!

27
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,510
Medicine… Med…

28
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,630
Medicine.

29
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,390
Xia.

30
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:54,920
Xia.

31
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,840
You can't take that medicine anymore.

32
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,190
You don't know.

33
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,710
I've been taking it all along,

34
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,190
or I'll get unbearable headache.

35
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,840
Go fetch it!

36
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,070
Let me tell you.

37
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,440
It can stop the pain,

38
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,800
but actually it's made from…

39
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,640
What happened?

40
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,920
Young Madam had a headache attack

41
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,190
and accidentally hit the dressing table.

42
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,880
I heard the noise so I came here.

43
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,510
Let me clean this up.

44
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,440
Young Madam's in her nightgown.

45
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,000
It's not proper for you to stay here.

46
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,840
Then I'll leave it to you.

47
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,190
Wanwan.

48
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,550
Qingxue…

49
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,320
Where's Qingxue?

50
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,320
I asked her

51
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,800
to help me with some errands.

52
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,320
She's trustworthy.

53
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,710
What are you doing?

54
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,440
Sending you away.

55
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:42,920
It's the only way

56
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,070
you can stop taking that medicine.

57
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,550
Where are you sending me?

58
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,320
Well…

59
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,230
What's wrong with that medicine?

60
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,070
It's laced with opium.

61
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,350
Xia,

62
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,110
you can get through this.

63
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,600
Be tough.

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,360
(My sister has endured fifteen years)

65
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,880
(of suffering for me.)

66
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,230
(I can't let her go on like this.)

67
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,120
(Xia,)

68
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,070
(I'll find a way)

69
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,880
(to send you away from here.)

70
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,440
Xia,

71
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,320
in the future,

72
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,150
I'll bring back many foreign gadgets for you.

73
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,110
You won't have to rely on

74
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,550
Yin Heng to get those stuff anymore.

75
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,960
Let him in.

76
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,630
Does Yin Heng take me for a fool

77
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,230
or think I provide shelters?

78
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,600
Sorry.

79
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,550
Didn't expect

80
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,710
such a dull stuff

81
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,070
could still hurt someone.

82
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,400
Young Master Yin,

83
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,920
not surprisingly,

84
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,880
you're wary of me.

85
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yet you still dare to come.

86
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,320
People strive to move upward,

87
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,840
like water flows downward.

88
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,510
Besides,

89
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,880
if you didn't want me to stay,

90
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,760
this strike

91
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,630
wouldn't have been here, right?

92
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,590
Then tell me.

93
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,840
Why should I let you stay?

94
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,960
I can help you.

95
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,230
What ever Yin Heng could accomplish,

96
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,350
I promise

97
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,520
you can as well.

98
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,000
A loyal dog indeed.

99
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,430
I can't leave.

100
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,720
Don't worry about me.

101
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,430
You want to trade your life for mine,

102
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,190
to set me free,

103
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,640
right?

104
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,880
Wanwan.

105
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,840
You're going to be an aunt.

106
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,960
What?

107
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,800
Feel my pulse.

108
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,070
This is what father taught me

109
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,070
when mother was pregnant with you.

110
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,270
But your current condition…

111
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,840
I want to keep this child.

112
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,840
Stay strong.

113
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,000
Grow up healthy.

114
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,840
I will protect you.

115
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,620
(Shen City's Hope Orphanage)

116
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,430
Pregnant?

117
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,480
No… You…

118
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,640
You…

119
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,600
That bastard Yin Zhenghao!

120
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,030
Not me.

121
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,270
Just answer my question.

122
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,310
Pregnant woman shouldn't travel far.

123
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,800
If something happens along the way,

124
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,960
could you take responsibility?

125
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,840
Are you leaving?

126
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,190
To where?

127
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,720
With whom?

128
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,920
- It's you.
- It's you.

129
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,760
I'm here to fetch meds
for Brother Yin Heng.

130
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,430
(So Yin Heng is fine.)

131
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,640
By the way,

132
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,640
prescribe some prenatal meds for me.

133
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,880
I'll pick it up the other day.

134
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,840
And thank you.

135
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,960
Thank me?

136
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,230
Crazy.

137
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,390
Thank me for what?

138
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,190
For letting her know Yin Heng's alive.

139
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,840
Oh, you're so clever.

140
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,640
Here.

141
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,480
Thanks.

142
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,310
Why are you following me?

143
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,470
Afraid you'll say nonsense to Yin Heng.

144
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,640
Brother Yin Heng,

145
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,430
where are you going?

146
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,600
It's time to return.

147
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,150
You've heard, haven't you?

148
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,480
What?

149
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,030
Nothing.

150
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,230
Xiao Wu said that

151
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,390
he'll leave with Yin Zhenghao.

152
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,600
It's time to go back.

153
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,430
That woman is pregnant

154
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,230
with Yin Zhenghao's child.

155
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,190
I saw it with my own eyes.

156
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,960
She asked Tang Zhe for prenatal meds.

157
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,840
I know that since childhood

158
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,190
you've always gotten

159
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,470
everything you want.

160
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,190
But you failed when it came to me.

161
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,840
You can't accept it.

162
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,190
I truly appreciate

163
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,270
your help.

164
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,840
But I'm not some object or garment

165
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,110
that you can acquire.

166
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,840
You'll never have me.

167
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,360
No way.

168
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,190
You were fine just now.

169
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,560
Why are you crying all of a sudden?

170
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,600
Don't cry. Calm down.

171
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,920
It's gonna be alright.

172
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,310
Okay?

173
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,030
Why did you hit me?

174
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,920
Why don't you speak up for me?

175
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:21,910
But…

176
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,960
she's not the one that's pregnant.

177
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,110
For real?

178
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,840
You know she's not pregnant,

179
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,560
but you're not mad?

180
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,840
Why…

181
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,350
Why are you so happy?

182
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,880
Because this means that

183
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,000
Brother Yin Heng still has a chance.

184
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,270
Not like me.

185
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,110
I had my chance.

186
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,800
Let's go.

187
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,470
I'll treat you to a nice meal.

188
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,190
Get on.

189
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,800
Be careful. Don't fall.

190
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,030
What's this?

191
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,800
I caught a cold

192
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,270
so I saw a doctor.

193
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,840
Sedatives.

194
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,150
Your luggage.

195
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,110
You're planning to escape.

196
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:58,000
(The Yin family's power is all over the city.)

197
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,110
(It's almost impossible for her to leave.)

198
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,030
(I have to keep the child.)

199
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,430
(It's my only leverage.)

200
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,030
Bulter Wang,

201
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,720
enforce the family rules.

202
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,680
Find out who this Wanwan

203
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,470
truly is.

204
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,640
(Wanwan,)

205
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,150
(I'm back.)

206
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,900
After facing life and death,

207
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,660
I've lost all interest in family business.

208
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,190
I'll have a date
with Yuanyuan tomorrow night

209
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,560
at the Guangming Cinema.

210
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,560
Since you've already known,

211
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,000
there's no point hiding it from you.

212
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,350
I intend to keep you tied to the Yin family,

213
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,760
to Zhenghao.

214
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,880
And if Zhenghao is gone one day,

215
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,360
don't think you'll survive on your own.
