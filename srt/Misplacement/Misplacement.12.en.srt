4
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,840
Young Madam doesn't want
to wake up, does she?

5
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,800
Then keep kneeling.

6
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,840
Did you say something to Young Madam

7
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,140
that you shouldn't have?

8
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,030
No… no, I didn't.

9
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,760
Someone,

10
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,280
take her out.

11
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,840
Twenty strikes with the rod.

12
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,010
Stop!

13
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,570
You killed Wanwan?

14
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,400
How could I?

15
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,280
Are you sure you're not lying to me?

16
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,840
Why would I lie to you?

17
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,320
Drink the medicine.

18
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,760
Otherwise,

19
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,320
you'll have a headache.

20
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,360
Wanwan is just next door.

21
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,480
From now on,

22
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,440
you, as her sister,

23
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,960
should take good care of her.

24
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,880
Sister?

25
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,280
I told you

26
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,480
I'd make her my concubine.

27
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,240
See?

28
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,800
I never lie to you.

29
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,880
Our Third Uncle

30
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,510
probably won't live to marry her.

31
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,440
Third Master! Let's go.

32
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,630
From now on,

33
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,400
she no longer belongs to Lidu.

34
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,360
Let me introduce her to you.

35
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,440
This is

36
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,800
my fiancée,

37
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,160
Wanwan.

38
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,760
Thank you

39
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,070
for sending someone to
accompany me to the Orphanage.

40
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,320
No need for thanks

41
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,840
between us.

42
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,320
Third Master,

43
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,280
is there anything I can do to help you?

44
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,710
Just live well.

there's only a glimmer of hope,

47
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,440
take it under your control.

48
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,480
I won't allow anyone

49
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,150
to point a gun at you.

50
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,800
We haven't even

51
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,280
had the ceremony yet.

from the start.

62
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,800
The misplaced life with my sister

63
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,550
should end here.

64
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,200
(Yin Heng,)

65
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,110
(the ones who dared to kill in broad daylight)

66
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,920
(must hold immense power.)

67
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,440
(Take care of your injuries.)

00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,630
(I'll be your spy,)

69
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,510
(investigating how many seeds of sin)

70
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,480
(are still hidden in this family.)

71
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,420
Are you blind?

72
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,780
Don't wipe it.

73
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,340
Where's Young Madam?

74
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,860
I haven't seen her for days.

75
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,940
She's awake.

76
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,860
Young Master locked her in the room.

77
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,060
What happened?

78
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,540
Young Master,

79
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,380
it seems Young Madam
doesn't welcome me at all.

80
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,540
Even her maid dares to bully me.

81
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,820
Look,

82
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,460
she burned my leg.

83
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,780
Then what do you think

84
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,780
we should do about it?

85
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,260
A maid without respect shouldn't be kept.

86
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,220
Or someday, what gets spilled on me

87
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,460
won't be hot soup,

88
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,300
but acid.

89
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,460
So ruthless.

90
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,620
Young Master, you already have

91
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,620
a virtuous, dignified wife.

92
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,700
I ought to be a bit willful,

93
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,700
to keep your life interesting, don't you think?

94
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,940
Then in your opinion…

95
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,060
Miss Wanwan, please don't make me leave.

96
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,180
Young Master, I've served
Young Madam for six years.

97
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,060
She can't live without me.

98
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,980
Since Miss Wanwan

99
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,020
has already decided.

100
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,700
Then get lost.

101
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,180
My clothes are dirty.

102
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,340
I need to change into something prettier.

103
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,700
That way, you will feel happy
when you see me.

104
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,660
Let's go.

105
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,700
Why?

106
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,980
Why are you driving me away?

107
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,940
That day, the task Yin Zhenghao gave you...

108
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,980
You didn't finish it.

109
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,420
Do you think

110
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,780
staying in the Yin family
will end well for you?

111
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,180
As long as I'm alive,

112
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,060
I won't let anyone harm Xia Qiu.

113
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,500
I'm driving you away,

114
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,100
because I have
a more important mission for you.

115
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,060
Previously, my sister told me,

116
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,500
the assassin at Lidu that day
was named Xiao Mei.

117
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,940
She had an older sister.

118
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,340
Go find her.

119
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,140
I saw Xiao Mei before at Lidu,

120
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,900
but she later disappeared inexplicably.

121
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,100
I suspect

122
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,580
this matter isn't that simple.

123
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,420
What about you?

124
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,580
I want to see

125
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,220
what he's hiding.

126
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,540
(What medicine needs
to be taken for so many years?)

127
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,180
(I remember my sister
is healthy since childhood.)

128
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,220
(Why is she now taking daily medication,)

129
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,380
(and looking worse by the day?)

130
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,100
(If it turns out this medicine is harmful,)

131
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,900
(it could save my sister)

132
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,620
(and help Yin Heng too.)

133
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,540
Doctor,

134
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,820
take a look at this medicine.

135
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,620
What's wrong with it?

136
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,220
What's wrong?

137
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,580
Tell me, what's wrong with this medicine?

138
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,700
You'd better leave.

139
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,580
Please, leave, just leave.

140
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,780
(Zhang's Apothecary)

141
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,180
Miss, please go.

142
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,220
Just go.

143
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,580
I can't answer your questions.

144
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,900
Don't delay our business.

145
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,100
What are you doing here?

146
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,380
How's Third Master doing?

147
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,340
Don't you even ask?

148
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,340
No bad news

149
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,940
is good news.

150
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,700
Have you no conscience?

151
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,820
For your sake,

152
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,540
Third Master is still in a coma.

153
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,380
Or what?

154
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,420
Watching over him day and night

155
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,980
will make him wake up?

156
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,940
As far as I know,

157
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,860
Miss Meng is already doing that.

158
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,860
Third Master must've been...

159
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,980
blind.

160
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,180
Then I will simply wish Third Master

161
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,940
a full recovery

162
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,180
and all the best.

163
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:44,940
(Yin Heng,)

164
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,140
(take care of your injuries.)

165
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,180
(For now,)

166
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,540
(I'll spy on the Yin family for you.)

167
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:01,500
(Yong'an Tavern)

168
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,700
Sir,

169
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,820
why are you closing so early?

170
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,700
This isn't closing.

171
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,020
This is shutting down.

172
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,020
I'm just a worker here.

173
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,860
Mr. Shen hasn't shown up for months.

174
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,140
He doesn't even pay wages.

175
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,820
Every now and then,

176
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,340
someone comes looking for Mr. Shen,

177
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,100
making it impossible to do business.

178
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,460
Why not close?

179
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,020
Mr. Shen…

180
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,940
He keeps his identity so mysterious.

181
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,540
No idea who he's crossed.

182
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,620
I'm the one suffering.

183
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,420
Who's looking for Mr. Shen?

184
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,380
I don't know.

185
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,460
But they look like

186
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,620
powerful people.

187
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,380
Sir,

188
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,180
Mr. Shen is my benefactor.

189
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,900
Since he's tied up
with something important,

190
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,700
I'll cover your wages for now.

191
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,620
Alright.

192
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,100
Miss, come inside.

193
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,860
Want something to eat or drink?

194
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,100
I'll prepare it now.

195
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,180
Have a seat.

196
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,540
Wait here.

197
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,580
Miss Wanwan.

198
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,980
Manager Wang.

199
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,220
What a coincidence.

200
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,500
I come here to have a rest.

201
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,460
The boss went to the kitchen.

202
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,380
Right.

203
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,780
He just corrected me that he's not the boss.

204
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,820
Who is the boss?

205
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,740
I heard the surname is Shen.

206
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,540
I heard he just left town today.

207
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,660
(Why did my sister take on
the alias of Mr. Shen?)

208
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,140
(And why is Yin Shixiong
looking for Mr. Shen?)

209
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,900
(And this medicine…)

210
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,940
(Why did the shopkeepers
of several apothecaries)

211
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,540
(all drive me away?)

212
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,220
Xia,

213
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,940
my father told me

214
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,460
I can finally

215
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,060
fully replace Yin Heng.

216
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,140
Between me and Third Master,
it's just a game.

217
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,300
I wanted to marry into the Yin family.

218
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,500
Third Master just happened to need a bride.

219
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,700
Now that Young Master has gained power,

220
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,340
I'm willing to be with him.
