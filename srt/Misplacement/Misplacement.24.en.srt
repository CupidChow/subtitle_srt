I won't let them take you away.

194
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,920
You know what to do.

195
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,350
Lidu is extremely dangerous.

196
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:16,840
Go back with me.

197
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,110
I'm a songstress,

198
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,350
not a prostitute.

199
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,150
Don't worry.

200
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,760
You're my fiancée.

201
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,390
How can I not worry about you?

202
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,760
Third Master,

203
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,070
what will our life be like

204
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,720
after we marry?

205
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,600
We…

206
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,640
We'll probably live in the North Villa.

207
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,520
Every day before you leave,

208
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,190
I'll be waiting at the door.

209
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,190
Every day before I leave,

210
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,470
I'll place a hairpin on you.

211
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,680
I can't bear to leave you.

212
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,680
And I can't bear to leave.

213
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,190
Shen Zhiqiu,

214
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,400
you must stay with me.

215
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,110
Don't worry.

216
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,190
We haven't had our wedding yet.

217
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,160
Did you think just Meng Minghe alone

218
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,560
could hold me down?

219
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,600
You're underestimating your Big Brother.

220
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,640
It's not me underestimating you.

221
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,840
It's the other way around.
