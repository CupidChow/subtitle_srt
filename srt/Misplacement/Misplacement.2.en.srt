Incense...

5
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,640
What are you planning to do to Yin Zhenghao?

6
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,400
Third Master ruined my plan.

7
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,310
How will you compensate me?

8
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,590
Who exactly are you?

9
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,400
What did you overhear on the boat yesterday?

10
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,280
This has nothing to do with you.

11
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,320
Third Master,

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,310
that old man wants to kill you.

13
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,000
Why not

14
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,950
we strike first?

15
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,950
Don't forget why we came back.

16
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,480
Yes.

17
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,230
To uncover the truth

18
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,230
behind the Old Madam's death.

19
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,400
Miss, are you disembarking?

20
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,070
Who?

21
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,520
You asked so many questions,

22
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,240
how could I answer them all?

23
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,590
So I ask Third Master one question?

24
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:20,870
If

25
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,960
I were to marry into the Yin family,

26
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,710
Third master thinks

27
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,280
should I marry Yin Zhenghao

28
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,630
or you?

29
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,910
Nonsense.

30
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,360
But Third Master, our fates are intertwined.

31
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,470
Could it be because

32
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,870
I saved you yesterday?

33
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,310
Are you planning

34
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,190
to repay me with your life?

35
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,630
You lost my shipment,

36
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,190
and now you're hiding here to enjoy yourself.

37
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,030
Go in.

38
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,590
What trouble has Third Master gotten into

39
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,190
to be relentlessly pursued like this?

40
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,560
Wanwan, are you there?

41
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,190
Yin Zhenghao has gone, right?

42
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,080
Don't waste words on her.

43
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,710
Boss, this box seems suspicious.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,800
It contains my personal belongings.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,280
Not exactly convenient to open.

46
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,430
Step aside!

47
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,840
Are you suspecting I'm hiding someone here?

48
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,080
That's right.

49
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,400
And if I'm not?

50
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,430
If not,

51
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,870
you must leave.

52
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,960
Trying to trick me?

53
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,470
Go ahead, open it.

54
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,310
Yes, sir.

55
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,470
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

56
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,680
A word from a gentleman.

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,030
Please go ahead

58
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,720
I told you

59
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,600
I'm very good at hide-and-seek.

60
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,270
Third Master,

61
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,720
your wound...

62
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,070
Just now,

63
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,480
were you hurt?

64
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,430
It's your wound

65
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,830
don't get proper treat,

66
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,240
it might leave a lasting problem.

67
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,750
What would've happened if they found you?

68
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,480
They're looking for Yin Zhenghao.

69
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,680
They wouldn't dare do anything to me.

70
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,680
So you were testing me?

71
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,870
Not entirely.

72
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,830
Wanwan,

73
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,950
your...

74
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,750
The Young Madam of the Yin family

75
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,070
sent someone to deliver you a letter.

76
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,360
Do you know Xia Qiu?

77
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,910
Who?

78
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,630
The Young Madam of the Yin family,

79
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,560
Yin Zhenghao's wife.

80
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,800
It's probably a warning.

81
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,240
Just a little scare tactic.

82
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,840
What's the matter, Third Master?

83
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,560
You reluctant to leave?

84
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,040
You owe me a favor.

85
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,120
Don't forget to repay me when we meet again.

86
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,340
Third Master,

87
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,780
I've looked into that woman.

88
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,340
She's top performer from the neighbo city.

89
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,260
They say Sister Hong at Lidu

90
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,780
promised her something.

91
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,380
That's why she came to Shen City.

92
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,700
What did she promise?

93
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,580
To help her

94
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,940
meet Young Master Yin.

95
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,700
(After all these years,)

96
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,900
(Zhenghao was in the estate.)

97
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,900
(He couldn't know a woman from aother city.)

98
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,210
(Her gaze…)

99
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,380
(It's nothing like a simple courtesan.)

100
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,780
(She has secrets)

101
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,460
(of her own.)

102
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:54,980
Whatever her story is.

103
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,060
As long as she doesn't interfere with plans

104
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,580
to avenge the Old Madam.

105
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,180
Let's hope so.

106
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,220
Young Madam.

107
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,100
Young Madam,

108
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,100
why did you sent a message to the Hai family,

109
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,980
let them look for the Young Master at Lidu?

110
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,820
They'll never find him.

111
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,860
So, I don't understand.

112
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,900
Third Master has already sent him back.

113
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,820
Why make trouble at Lidu?

114
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,380
I want her to know.

115
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,100
Stay away from Zhenghao

116
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,500
and the Yin family.

117
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,340
I've never seen

118
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,580
you so angry before.

119
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,580
You even sent a letter to that woman.

120
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,780
How do you know if she can even read?

121
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,380
She can read.

122
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,660
This isn't a place for you.

123
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,580
(After you left,)

124
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,420
(they said you didn't want me anymore.)

125
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,060
(I didn't believe it.)

126
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,980
(So I tried to escape from the orphanage.)

127
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,180
(Those years, I was beaten, scolded,)

128
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,100
(starved, and frozen.)

129
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:20,900
Sister.

130
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,020
Sister, is that you?

131
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,020
- Who are you?
- What are you doing here?

132
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,500
- Go!
- Go away!

133
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,380
Stop!

134
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,140
Just when I was about to collapse,

135
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,820
I saw you at the Yin family's door.

136
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,020
Third uncle, do you need something?

137
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,180
You have a sister.

138
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,740
Third Uncle, you're joking.

139
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,580
I came from the orphanage.

140
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,140
I don't have a sister.

141
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,940
Orphanage,

142
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,540
no parents.

143
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,860
That doesn't mean you don't have sister.

144
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,380
Well, if you put it that way.

145
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,300
The ones younger than me at the orphanage

146
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,900
are all my brothers and sisters.

147
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,500
Then,

148
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,380
if you had any deep connections there?

149
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,740
They saw me adopted by the Yin family.

150
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,260
It's too late to hold a grudge.

151
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,500
How could there be anyone with deep ties.

152
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,500
If third uncle have no other things,

153
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,740
then I'll go in.

154
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,300
Fine.

155
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,460
(The hope that was just kindled)

156
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,420
(was extinguished by the rain of that day.)

157
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,020
(You really don't want me anymore.)

158
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,780
(If not for Third Master,)

159
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,100
(I might have died that day.)

160
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,420
The Yin family isn't a place for you.

161
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,180
Go back.

162
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,100
(After being sold from many dance halls,)

163
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,860
(finally, I have a chance to return.)

164
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,940
The Yin family isn't a place for you.

165
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,740
Here isn't a place for you.

166
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,620
(You're wrong.)

167
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,980
(Yin family is a place for me.)

168
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,780
(Yin Mansion)

169
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,620
Elder brother,

170
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,380
today is your big birthday.

171
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,740
I raise a glass to you.

172
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,660
Father,

173
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,680
(Master Yin, Yin Shixiong)
I returned to Shen City and heard that

174
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,700
Zhenghao lost Mr. Hai's goods.

175
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,540
But now I'm back.

176
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,900
I'll handle the matter with the goods.

177
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,860
The Yi Xing' deal

178
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,060
is important to me.

179
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,300
Don't worry, brother.

180
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,860
From now on,

181
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,220
everything will be fine.

182
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,060
The Yin family's joyful events are spreading.

183
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,940
Wanwan from Lidu

184
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,740
comes to wish Elder Yin a happy birthday.

185
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,620
I love seeing Xia jealous.

186
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,940
If I marry Young Master Yin,

187
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,780
you're the sister, and I'm the younger sister.

188
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:56,230
♪Fate speaks of joys and sorrows♪

189
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:03,310
