=Beyond Romance=

4
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,460
Didn't he see anyone else?

5
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,820
After Third Master left,

6
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,860
he went straight to the tavern's back door.

7
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,140
Our men didn't dare get too close.

8
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,620
But from a distance, it seemed like

9
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,820
he had arranged to meet the songstress.

10
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,460
I knew it. This woman

11
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,460
showing up today wasn't so simple.

12
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,660
I thought her target was Zhenghao,

13
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,860
the clueless one.

14
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,420
Turns out she's reaching

15
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,940
for Third Brother instead.

16
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,420
Quite ambitious.

17
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,340
Master, what's your decision?

18
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,820
He doesn't want to marry Meng Yuanyuan

19
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,740
because of my monitor.

20
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,380
But this kind of woman…

21
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,020
Third Brother, oh, Third Brother,

22
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,260
you're far too naive.

23
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,540
This type of woman

24
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,380
is the easiest to bribe.

25
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,620
But…

26
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,580
But…

27
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,860
About the young master, I heard…

28
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,820
Father,

29
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,860
I want to take a concubine.

30
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:09,940
Father,

31
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,860
what is the meaning of this?

32
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,780
What meaning?

33
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,580
Father,

34
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,500
I want this woman

35
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,460
as my concubine.

36
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,300
Then you should ask if your Third Uncle

37
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,180
is willing to give her up for you.

38
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,980
Young Master, Young Master!

39
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,220
Master,

40
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,260
just a songstress,

41
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,140
it's not good

42
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,580
for uncle and nephew to fight over.

43
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,500
Yin Heng suddenly returning this time

44
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,500
must have his own plans.

45
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,300
If Zhenghao wants to achieve anything,

46
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,460
Yin Heng is a hurdle he cannot bypass.

47
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,260
It's time

48
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,380
to let those two

49
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,580
fight it out.

50
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,300
Cheap woman,

51
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,500
dreaming of becoming a phoenix?

52
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,020
You've lost your mind.

53
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,660
Skipping work yesterday,

54
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,900
and now secretly attending the banquet?

55
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,500
Lidu holds you,

56
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,500
you're Miss Wanwan.

57
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,420
Lidu wants to destroy you,

58
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,860
you're nothing.

59
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,780
If you dare to seduce Young Master Yin,

60
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,540
in Shen City,

61
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,620
there will be no place for you.

62
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,180
Do you understand?

63
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,580
Sister Hong, I quit singing.

64
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,740
What did you say?

65
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,580
I said, I quit singing.

66
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,860
In Lidu,

67
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,540
you don't get to say anything.

68
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,620
Take her away.

69
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,060
If Miss Wanwan

70
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,900
doesn't want her voice anymore,

71
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,940
then destroy it.

72
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,060
- Yes.
- Yes.

73
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,980
Why meet here?

74
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,060
Here values money, so we can save trouble.

75
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,620
Take the gold bars

76
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,580
and lock the door from the outside.

77
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,940
Got it.

78
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,540
Did you find anything?

79
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,340
I went to the address you gave me.

80
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,620
The old servant of the late madam

81
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,340
wasn't in that village at all.

82
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,420
Do you remember the house you visited?

83
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,260
It was torn down after you were attacked.

84
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,500
It seems someone is trying

85
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,260
to erase all traces

86
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,740
before I returned to Shen City.

87
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,500
You're back in Shen City.

88
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,660
The enemy is in the shadow, you're contrary.

89
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,500
And your marriage

90
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,740
is tricky.

91
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,820
If

92
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,180
it were me marrying into the Yin family,

93
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,940
do you think

94
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,300
it'd be better to marry Zhenghao,

95
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,780
or to marry you?

96
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,500
I heard everything that day.

97
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,020
Just like me,

98
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,460
you came to Shen City with a purpose.

99
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,860
When the wedding happens,

100
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,620
I'll invite you for a toast.

101
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,560
Hiss.

102
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,620
Sister.

103
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,660
Sister.

104
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,820
Sister.

105
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,340
Sister.

106
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,100
Sister.

107
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,900
Open the door! Let me out!

108
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,940
Sister, let me out!

109
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,320
Save me!

110
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,540
Open the door!

111
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,980
Let me out!

112
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,660
Save me!

113
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,620
Open the door!

114
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,420
At Lidu, when Sister Hong gives an order,

115
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,460
no one will save you even if you scream.

116
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,580
I advise you

117
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,940
to serve the two of us well.

118
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,900
I'll put in a good word for you then,

119
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:22,860
and

120
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,060
you might be let out sooner.

121
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,620
Don't know what's good for you.

122
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,420
Poison her voice first.

123
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,580
Let's see if she can make a sound today.

124
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,220
What wind blows you here, sir?

125
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,780
We're not even open yet.

126
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,020
Third Master,

127
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,860
what

128
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,940
brings you here?

129
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,140
To propose.

130
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,860
You've got some nerve.

131
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,620
Don't you know whose woman I am?

132
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,620
The Young Master Yin has feelings for me.

133
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,340
You'd better think twice.

134
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,660
I think this woman is bluffing.

135
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,700
If you dare hurt me,

136
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,020
aren't you afraid Yong Master Yin

137
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,980
will have you both castrated and feed dogs?

138
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,220
The Young Master Yin is interested in you?

139
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,380
Drink the medicine.

140
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,420
Third Master.

141
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,340
Just as the madam instructed,

142
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,300
castrate them both and feed dogs.

143
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,460
Third Master, spare us!

144
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,660
Spare us, Third Master!

145
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,300
What?

146
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,620
Hoping Zhenghao will save you?

147
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,780
Third Master.

148
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,540
Third Master.

149
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,340
From now on,

150
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,500
she no longer belongs to Lidu.

151
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,380
Third Master, why…

152
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,100
No reason.

153
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,460
Third Master knows what I'm asking about.

154
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,020
To marry you.

155
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,060
Xiao Wu,

156
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,270
I have matters to attend to.

157
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,060
Take Miss Wanwan back first.

158
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,340
Yes, Third Master.

159
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,860
You can't go back to Lidu anymore.

160
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,820
Stay by my side

161
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,700
and keep everything you know

162
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,220
buried in your heart.

163
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,540
(Yin Mansion)

164
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,340
You look good in this.

165
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,220
You don't want me to marry her?

166
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,820
Of course not.

167
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,180
No one wants husband to take a concubine.

168
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,860
We've been married for years.

169
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,620
I've never seen you flustered over woman.

170
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,260
Could it

171
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,460
because she's connected

172
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,260
to Third Uncle?

173
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,820
What does she have to do with

174
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,220
Third Uncle?

175
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,100
Do you think I'm not capable of taking her,

176
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,060
or that I can't win?

177
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,500
Young Madam, it's time for your medicine.

178
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,780
Has Third Uncle returned?

179
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,300
Young Master,

180
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,260
Young Madam,

181
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,660
he went to Lidu and hasn't returned,

182
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,620
but he did send that songstress back.

183
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,500
What do you think

184
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,780
Third Uncle is planning?

185
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,700
Since he returned,

186
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,500
you seem like your soul has left you.

187
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,860
I'm just thinking of

188
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,780
how to stop you from marrying her.

189
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,100
Really?

190
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,980
Of course.

191
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,180
Promise me

192
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,900
to send her away.

193
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,620
(How ridiculous.)

194
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,860
(The first time you ever kissed me,)

195
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,580
(and it's for someone else.)

196
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,340
Two people taking what they need.

197
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,300
It sounds like

198
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,260
a perfect match.

199
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,100
You must know

200
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,260
that the dead cannot reveal secrets.

201
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,820
Since you refuse to call me little sister,

202
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,900
then call me aunt.
