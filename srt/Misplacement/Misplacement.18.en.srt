Miss Wanwan.

5
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,800
Miss Wanwan.

6
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,230
Miss Wanwan.

7
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,200
You can't go in.

8
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,920
Come out. I know you're here.

9
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,280
You said you'd protect Young Madam.

10
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,550
Where were you when she was killed?

11
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,880
Miss Wanwan.

12
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,590
- Let her in.
- Let go.

13
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,200
Alright.

14
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,840
You're Xia Qiu's personal maid.

15
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,710
Third Master, Young Madam…

16
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,480
This has nothing to do with Wanwan.

17
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,320
You broke into the North Villa.

18
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,960
You're not just here for Wanwan, are you?

19
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,840
Before last night,

20
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,710
you saw Xia Qiu?

21
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,070
I did.

22
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,160
What did she say?

23
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,030
She said

24
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,150
if anything happened to her,

25
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,400
give these two letters to Third Master.

26
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,800
What else?

27
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,760
Young Madam, you look lovely today.

28
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,800
Is there a special occasion?

29
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,590
(To Shen Zhiqiu)
Here are two letters.

30
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,670
(To Yin Heng)
One for Third Uncle.

31
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,150
The other for Wanwan.

32
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,880
Over the years,

33
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,000
I've saved some money.

34
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,110
I had planned to give it to you

35
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,480
as your dowry.

36
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,070
Now that you're leaving the Yin Mansion,

37
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,000
take it with you.

38
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,400
Young Madam, I can't take it.

39
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,880
I said take it, so take it.

40
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,230
Look after Wanwan for me.

41
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,590
Consider it my request.

42
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,000
Young Madam, what's going on?

43
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,510
I'll go find Miss Wanwan

44
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,470
and Third Uncle.

45
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,840
If something happens
in the Yin Mansion tonight,

46
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,070
hand this letter to Third Uncle.

47
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,550
Help me put this on.

48
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,440
Third Uncle,

49
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,670
I once told you

50
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,510
when someone has attachments,

51
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,000
hatred

52
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,550
should be put aside.

53
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,760
But evil won't relent.

54
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,960
Wanwan's life is at risk. I have no choice

55
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,590
but to take this step.

56
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,920
I've taken medicine for years.

57
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,000
I couldn't bear an heir for the Yin family.

58
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,070
The only bargaining chip

59
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,880
against Yin Shixiong is gone.

60
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,670
I can tell that

61
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,510
there're affections between you and Wanwan.

62
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,190
So I took it upon myself

63
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,510
to use her name to arrange an meeting.

64
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,150
It's the only way

65
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,360
to give her a chance of survival

66
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,960
in this disaster.

67
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,800
From now on,

68
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,480
may evil meet its end.

69
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,190
May you and Wanwan

70
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,510
be safe

71
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,800
and sound.

72
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,680
You two

73
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,070
are really a handful.

74
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,960
One's shot,

75
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,320
the other's fainted.

76
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,840
Take off your clothes.

77
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,800
Isn't that...

78
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,920
inappropriate?

79
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,280
Cut the crap.

80
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,510
Continue.

81
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,000
Wait, what exactly are you doing?

82
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,000
I don't know what you're planning,

83
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,110
but you really think
you can hold me hostage?

84
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,510
- Don't come over.
- Alright. I won't.

85
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,760
But please calm down.

86
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,800
That old bastard Yin Shixiong

87
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
has killed so many people.

88
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,510
He's bedridden now.

89
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,360
Should we take this chance…

90
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:53,670
We can't kill him.

91
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:54,870
Why not?

92
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,360
If he dies,

93
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,400
Yi Xing will fall apart.

94
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,760
Yi Xing is my mother's legacy.

95
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,590
If Yin Shixiong dies now,

96
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,840
the opium trade will
become Yi Xing's burden.

97
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,900
(Documentation)

98
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:27,150
Murder must be paid for with blood.

99
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,550
I'd love nothing more

100
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,800
than to tear him apart.

101
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,620
(Black substance is tested as opium.)

102
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,280
But if we don't put an end
to the opium trade,

103
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,840
more people will suffer.

104
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,360
What about Wanwan?

105
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,270
What's going on?

106
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:22,920
Wait.

107
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,230
Wait.

108
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,030
Tell me what happened!

109
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,390
Did you let Wanwan go?

110
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,030
She held a hairpin to her neck.

111
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,430
I couldn't stop her.

112
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,960
What good are you?

113
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,030
That's my medicine box.

114
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,520
Wanwan took it.

115
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,760
She's been here.

116
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,840
Third Master, you…

117
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:29,910
What?

118
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,150
You dare block my way?

119
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,600
I wouldn't dare.

120
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,000
Master is injured

121
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,520
and almost broken by grief.

122
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,760
He can't take more shocks.

123
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,470
I brought a doctor anyway.

124
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,430
Let him take a look.

125
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,030
Third Master, you can't go in.

126
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,960
Be wise.

127
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,030
You know whose dog to be in the future.

128
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,920
The person you're looking for

129
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,270
is not here.

130
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,560
She might really not be here.

131
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,430
Third Master,

132
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,680
how do you always find me?

133
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,840
I'm done playing hide-and-seek with you.

134
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,680
It's boring.

135
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,110
Since the tavern owner died here,

136
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,880
no one's dared to come back.

137
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,560
It's safe for now.

138
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,920
Tomorrow,

139
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,470
reopen the tavern.

140
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,110
Wouldn't the Yin family find out?

141
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,560
If we operate openly,

142
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,470
they'll be less likely to harm us.

143
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:40,620
(Sister Shen Zhixia)

144
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,180
(Rest in peace. Sister Shen Zhixia)

145
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,430
Xia liked cleanliness.

146
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,800
Her face in this photo has blood on it.

147
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,720
I need to get a new one.

148
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,740
(Yin plans to collaborate
with hospitals in Shen City)

149
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,380
(and mix opium into medicine.
Please investigate.)

150
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,680
(It's Father's handwriting.)

151
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,230
Yin Shixiong plans to collaborate

152
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,680
with hospitals in Shen City

153
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,150
and mix opium into medicine.

154
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,270
Please investigate.

155
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,110
Will this work?

156
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,680
Isn't it too risky?

157
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,720
It's the only way.

158
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,430
I must deliver this watch

159
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,270
to someone in charge.

160
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,430
If not,

161
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,230
all of Shen City

162
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,150
will become a city of poison.

163
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,390
It must be Yin Shixiong's people,

164
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,680
trying to convince me to join them.

165
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,440
Well,

166
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,000
take the watch to our daughters' room.

167
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,150
Hurry!

168
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,640
Go!

169
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,190
(Yin Shixiong.)

170
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,960
(The one who killed my parents back then)

171
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,350
(was you.)

172
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,640
Young Madam saved my life.

173
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,190
If you're about to seek revenge,

174
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,400
count me in.

175
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,640
Did you come back

176
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,000
to inform me of the news about Xiao Yun?

177
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,880
Aren't you afraid

178
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,150
of being silenced?

179
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,520
If that happens, they'll only silence me.

180
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,920
But by then,

181
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,920
a secret will no longer be a secret.
