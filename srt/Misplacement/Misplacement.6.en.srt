=You're One=

4
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,280
It seems the news from Hai Dafu

5
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,480
was correct.

6
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,790
We returned to hometown after mother gone.

7
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,840
Only her maid was said to have been arranged

8
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,480
by my elder brother in a neighboring city.

9
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,840
Now, it seems Aunt Liu was already killed.

10
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:16,870
So, this address

11
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,150
was just a trap waiting for me.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,870
Open the door!

13
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,790
You'd better have some shame.

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,840
Are you trying to hide,

15
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:40,950
wait for Brother Heng to return

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,230
and then play the pitiful card?

17
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,510
I've seen enough tricks from women like you.

18
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:45,990
Open the door!

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,850
Miss,

20
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,280
is she hiding because of your beauty

21
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,400
and too shy to face you.

22
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,950
It's fine if she doesn't come out.

23
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,590
She must know her low status

24
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,230
and dare not show her face.

25
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,870
Third Brother,

26
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,710
don't treat people this way,

27
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,590
or Master Meng will be unhappy.

28
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,750
Is Master Meng unhappy,

29
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,080
or is it you?

30
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,270
Anyway,

31
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,080
I have some business in Yixing,

32
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,190
so I'll leave first.

33
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,840
You stay with Master Meng for me.

34
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,400
Third Master,

35
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,750
if it's really Yin Shixiong killed the Madam,

36
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,800
I'll shoot...

37
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,680
It's not the right time yet.

38
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,280
I need to talk to Miss Meng first.

39
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,000
You...

40
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,710
Brother Heng,

41
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,150
you're back!

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,360
I've recently learned ballroom dance.

43
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,310
I can teach you.

44
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,120
Hao,

45
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,680
you look upset.

46
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,120
I remember you don't usually like

47
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,910
attending such events.

48
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,870
What brings you here today?

49
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,910
It's the first time

50
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,240
I've seen you dress

51
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,080
so flamboyantly.

52
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,680
After thinking it through,

53
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,030
I realize I was wrong before

54
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,360
and didn't consider your feelings.

55
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,710
Dressed like this,

56
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,400
who are you trying to seduce?

57
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,240
Don't look at others.

58
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,470
I don't mind if you take a concubine.

59
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,680
Miss Meng,

60
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,480
I have to tell you,

61
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,800
I will not marry you.

62
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,000
Why?

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,580
(Dressing Room)

64
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,600
Is anyone there?

65
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,070
Is anyone there?

66
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,270
Is anyone there?

67
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,040
Third Master.

68
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,430
Third Master.

69
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,160
Little sister is not afraid.

70
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,160
Don't be afraid, I'll take you away.

71
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,390
Shen Zhiqiu,

72
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,000
everyone has their fate.

73
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,160
From the moment I was adopted,

74
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,070
we've had no relationship.

75
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,600
Don't cry,

76
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,600
I'll always be with you.

77
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,870
Tears never help.

78
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,800
Such thing

79
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,190
I've known for 15 years.

80
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,430
(Why are we all from Lidu,)

81
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,680
(you went from a sparrow to a phoenix.)

82
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,000
(Miss Xiao Mei, the charming beauty)

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,830
(Young Master Yin won't spare me a glance.)

84
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,830
(It's all because of you.)

85
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,720
(Recent performer Wanwan)

86
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,040
(I hate you.)

87
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,830
(I hate you for taking my place.)

88
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,920
(Tonight at the Lidu Cabaret)

89
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,800
(I hate you for taking my everything.)

90
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,600
What,

91
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,510
trying to seduce Master Yin isn't enough,

92
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,040
now you're seduce his uncle?

93
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,070
(I won't let you have him.)

94
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,560
Coquette,

95
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,190
go to hell.

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,800
Where are the people?

97
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,270
Come here!

98
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,390
Someone killed.

99
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,320
How could something like this happen here?

100
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,600
- Alright.
- What's going on?

101
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,110
Don't go,

102
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,750
she was going to kill you.

103
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,510
That dress looks good on her.

104
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,800
Young Madam, you have a kind heart.

105
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,560
That woman is trying to seduce Young Master,

106
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,560
and you're still making clothes for her?

107
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,240
She's cunning,

108
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,950
now she can't marry Young Master,

109
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,270
she's trying to cling to Third Master.

110
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,040
It's shameless.

111
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,920
The Meng family will host a banquet tonight,

112
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,950
probably for Third Uncle's wedding.

113
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,360
The gate of the Yin family

114
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,120
is not so easily entered.

115
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,740
(Su Ji Tailor Shop)

116
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,590
Take this.

117
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,680
Tonight, when she returns to Lidu,

118
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,160
she will be humiliated.

119
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,510
Even Xiao Mei,

120
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,830
the Lidu dancer you saved,

121
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,630
is furious

122
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,870
and plans to return tonight

123
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,190
to give her a lesson.

124
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,440
Xiao Mei,

125
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,160
what is she going to Lidu for?

126
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,590
Xia,

127
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:47,920
Xia.

128
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,750
(She knew someone was trying to kill me.)

129
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,630
(She was trying to protect me?)

130
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,600
Why do something foolish?

131
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,750
She's been in Shen City only a few days,

132
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,310
and she's going to marry Master Zhenghao?

133
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,070
Why does she have such good fortune?

134
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,670
Why?

135
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,390
Why must I suffer humiliation

136
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,630
and never raise my head?

137
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,920
Her life isn't so great.

138
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,430
You're the one who saved me, Mrs. Shen,

139
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,320
the Young Madam.

140
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,030
I can save you,

141
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,240
and I can also kill you.

142
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,750
No.

143
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,560
Is everything alright?

144
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,680
What about Xia Qiu?

145
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,550
She's fine,

146
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,120
just woke up.

147
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,000
I'll get you out of city tomorrow.

148
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,160
Out of the city?

149
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,630
Where to?

150
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,870
Our agreement before

151
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,560
is void.

152
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,720
What does Third Master think of me?

153
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:28,120
You say we'll marry and cancel when you want?

154
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,910
I still have things to settle.

155
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,000
I can't leave.

156
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,750
In fact,

157
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:40,270
I give up relationship with Young Master.

158
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,390
Then I talk to the Young Master.

159
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,750
Maybe he'll keep me.

160
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,320
You dare?

161
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,750
Then Third Master should make it clear.

162
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,510
Is it because of Miss Meng's talent,

163
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,750
can help you more,

164
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,360
or because you've broken your word and,

165
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,320
like everyone else, see me as a burden?

166
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,390
Now you see,

167
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,360
the Yin family is not a good place.

168
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,910
Such thing

169
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,360
will always happen here,

170
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,670
and I can't protect you all the time.

171
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,840
Are you afraid

172
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,440
I'll leak your plans to survive?

173
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,320
I'm afraid

174
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,270
you'll ruin my plans.

175
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,630
Then kill me.

176
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,150
Dead people can't spill reveal.

177
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,960
You've seen it.

178
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,480
I'm no saint either.

179
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,120
Now you either marry me

180
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
or kill me.

181
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,320
Learn it?

182
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Even if there's only a slim chance left,

183
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,840
take control of your own fate.

184
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,270
I won't allow

185
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,200
anyone to point a gun at you.

186
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,040
Third Master,

187
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,080
now you are my last hope.

188
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,790
I won't leave,

189
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,480
I can't leave.

190
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,910
(Trust me.)

191
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,960
(I'll be your best partner.)

192
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,840
I've spread the word.

193
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,200
Next month,

194
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,440
I'll marry Wanwan.

195
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:06,750
Xia Qiu,

196
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,860
Father,

197
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,630
you've always managed

198
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,670
the family's ceremonies and banquets.

199
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,510
What do you think of Third Uncle's wedding?

200
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,240
It's not really my place to say,

201
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,480
but a Lidu singer is too lowly

202
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,270
for Third Uncle.

203
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,910
But if he truly loves her, we...

204
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,270
Third Brother, our parents have gone,

205
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,150
your marriage should be arranged by Brother.

206
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,630
No need for me to worry.

207
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,600
If anyone

208
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,360
dares to harm Wanwan,

209
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,030
no one will be able to protect.

210
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,120
Since Third Brother

211
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:54,200
believes we are all one family,

212
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,910
Xia Qiu,

213
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,510
later,

214
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,600
show Miss Wanwan around

215
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:00,870
and make her feel at home.

216
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,200
How about the assassin from yesterday?

217
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,720
He committed suicide.

218
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,320
Come to my study, this isn't over yet.

219
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,440
Yes.

220
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,840
Third Master.

221
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,000
We're getting married soon.

222
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,840
I want to visit the place I grew up.

223
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,320
OK.

224
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,510
(You blocked the assassination for me.)

225
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,150
(Today, you still push me away.)

226
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,080
(Since you won't tell me the truth,)

227
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,080
(I'll go back to the orphanage and find out.)

228
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:56,240
Why did you tell me the truth so late?

229
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,000
Why did you keep pushing me away?

230
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,440
My father said,

231
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,360
only when you truly have power

232
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,390
will telling me this matter.

233
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,960
You've been with me since you were eight.

234
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,360
Even if you die,

235
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,870
you must die at my hands.
