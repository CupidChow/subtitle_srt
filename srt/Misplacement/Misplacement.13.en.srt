00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:04,870
Sir,

5
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,240
a bowl of Plain Noodles.

6
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,330
Okay, have a seat.

7
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,620
Yuanyang fruit.

8
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,800
Lady Fariy!

9
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,080
Cigarettes, take a look.

10
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,280
You can't get it elsewhere.

11
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,550
I have the latest news about Yin Heng.

12
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,030
I went to the North Villa today.

13
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,760
Although he hasn't woken up yet,

14
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,550
he should be out of danger now.

15
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,070
What were you doing there?

16
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,280
A house call.

17
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,150
Really?

18
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,510
Didn't expect that, did you?

19
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,920
Actually, I'm a doctor.

20
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,630
The Orphanage has someone taking care of it.

21
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,710
I occasionally check on the kids' health.

22
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,630
Never thought we'd meet like this

23
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,630
in such a vast sea of people.

24
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:11,710
You say you're a doctor,

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,400
then tell me what's in this.

26
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,480
Trying to test me?

27
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,840
If you trust me,

28
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,510
let me take this bottle with me.

29
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,280
I'll confirm the ingredients and let you know.

30
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:50,950
Alright.

31
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,550
Sir, the noodles for this lady.

32
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,600
Okay.

33
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,150
Thank you for helping me

34
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,920
and for looking after Yin Heng.

35
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,720
Come in quickly.

36
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,840
Where have you been?

37
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,960
What's wrong? Did something happen?

38
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,020
I'm fine.

39
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,380
Master came back and didn't see you.

40
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,780
I'm afraid he'll cause trouble for you again.

41
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,620
They've already sent someone to kill me.

42
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,540
What could be worse than that?

43
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,740
Did you go find Third…

44
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,860
I still remember what I owe him,

45
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,140
but I have something more urgent to ask you.

46
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,270
Shh.

47
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,580
Young Master, you're back.

48
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,940
I heard

49
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,980
you went out today.

50
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,300
Yeah.

51
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,500
A few days ago, I threw a little tantrum

52
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,340
and drove away Young Madam's maid.

53
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,420
After thinking about it,

54
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,100
I felt like I made a mistake.

55
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,820
So,

56
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,940
this morning

57
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,660
I went out to buy a new box of rouge

58
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,500
to apologize to Young Madam.

59
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,140
I have good news

60
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,780
that I want to share with her.

61
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,380
Leave us alone.

62
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,700
Well,

63
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,500
what's the good news?

64
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,580
Can't you share it with me?

65
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,260
Young Master,

66
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,140
aren't you afraid I'll get jealous?

67
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,540
Do you want to keep watching?

68
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,900
There's more exciting stuff.

69
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,580
Get out.

70
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,820
Xia,

71
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,460
my father told me

72
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,460
I can finally

73
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,180
fully replace Yin Heng.

74
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,300
Even if he wakes up,

75
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,980
he'll be nothing

76
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,260
in the Yin family.

77
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,860
Watch me closely.

78
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,660
I can do this

79
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,980
better than he ever did.

80
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,940
Xiao Wu.

81
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,420
Xiao Wu.

82
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,340
Third Master.

83
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,130
Third Master, you're finally awake.

84
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,060
How do you feel?

85
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,220
Should I call a doctor?

86
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,460
Where's Wanwan?

87
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,300
Wanwan…

88
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,180
She…

89
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,700
she was tired

90
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,820
so she went back to rest.

91
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,300
Brother Yin Heng.

92
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,860
You're awake.

93
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,780
What are you doing here?

94
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,140
I made this myself. Please try it.

95
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,460
I'll go call a doctor.

96
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,620
You talk first.

97
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,300
Miss Meng.

98
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,420
You shouldn't do this.

99
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,740
I'm willing.

100
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,780
I have a wife.

101
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,100
Wife?

102
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,690
She saw your serious injury

103
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,300
and immediately wanted to marry Yin Zhenghao.

104
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,940
How dare she!

105
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,220
Third Master.

106
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,700
Doctor Tang's arrived

107
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,020
to check your injuries.

108
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,620
Third Master.

109
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,300
Where's Third Master?

110
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,020
Xia,

111
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,260
do you know Third Master's mother?

112
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,660
(Mother Yang)
Third Master isn't Master's full brother.

113
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,660
After his mother married into the Yin family,

114
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,380
she used all her dowry

115
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,220
to help his grandfather establish Yi Xing

116
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,660
and become wealthy.

117
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,740
Later,

118
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,100
he insisted on studying business abroad,

119
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,340
so Yi Xing was handed over to Master.

120
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,140
When I entered the Yin family,

121
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,260
only Old Madam treated me well.

122
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,540
(Rest in peace.)
What has always bothered me is that

123
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,540
the night she passed away,

124
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,660
I searched every clinic in Shen City,

125
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,900
but none of them were open.

126
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,540
Clinics usually make house calls even at night.

127
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,420
Xia wouldn't lie to me.

128
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,120
Someone must have given an order

129
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,460
to not allow she to be saved.

130
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,260
Wanwan.

131
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,740
I was about to bathe, wait for me.

132
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,700
After thinking it over,

133
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,500
this good news

134
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,340
should really be shared with you.

135
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,820
Are you scared?

136
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,140
How could I be?

137
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,660
I almost killed you.

138
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,700
You wanted to kill Yin Heng.

139
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,540
Unfortunately,

140
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,340
Third Master has great luck and fate.

141
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,140
So what?

142
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,260
Yin Heng's the biggest joke of the family.

143
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,380
He has nothing left.

144
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,060
Status, power,

145
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,420
and even you.

146
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,060
Tonight, you belong to me.

147
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,260
Between me and Third Master, it's just a game.

148
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,700
I wanted to marry into the Yin family.

149
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,300
Third Master just happened to need a bride.

150
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,100
Now that you've gained power,

151
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,860
I'm willing to be with you.

152
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,580
How could you

153
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,380
be so shameless?

154
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,140
I really feel sorry for Yin Heng.

155
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,900
Do you wish to die so very much?

156
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,100
As for the assassination,

157
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,900
it's made me understand

158
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,100
your mother's death have nothing to do with me.

159
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,740
