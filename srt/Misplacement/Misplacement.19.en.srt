- Cheers.

Waiter.

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,760
More liquor.

8
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,840
Hurry up.

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,320
- Coming.
- Alright.

10
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,280
Drink it up.

12
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,110
- Come on, cheers!
- Cheers.

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,460
(To Shen Zhiqiu)
Wanwan,

14
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,920
you probably hate me a lot.

15
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,480
I abandoned you when we were kids.

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,440
Now I've left you behind again.

17
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,000
Since I left fifteen years ago,

18
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,670
I never dream of seeing you again.

19
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,920
I finally got a chance
to call you "sister".

20
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,360
Seeing you again is already a blessing.

21
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,550
I know how strong-willed you are.

22
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,840
Once you make up your mind,

23
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,550
you never let go.

24
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,400
That's

25
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,960
how you survived

26
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,150
with my hatred to keep you strong.

27
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:50,910
Right?

28
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:57,150
Fifty-six, fifty-seven, fifty-eight,

29
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,440
fifty-nine, sixty.

30
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,150
Xia, are you ready?

31
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,550
I'm coming to find you!

32
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,000
Xia.

33
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,800
I found you!

34
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,960
You've got the wrong person.

35
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,120
That's right,

36
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,190
Shen Zhixia.

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,000
I hate you so much.

38
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,510
I hate you for saving my life,

39
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,840
but leaving me alone.

40
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,110
What's done is done.

41
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,880
If you want to live,

42
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,400
take the money and leave.

43
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,320
Take care

44
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,920
of your valuables.

45
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,760
Yin family rules are strict indeed.

46
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,320
Do you live comfortably under them?

47
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,880
How could the Young Madam

48
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,880
of the Yin family not be happy?

49
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,000
Wanwan, don't do anything foolish.

50
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,320
Xia,

51
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,880
is it because of me…

52
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,960
I'll be with you.

53
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,320
Wanwan,

54
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,150
you're going to be an aunt.

55
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,550
Promise me.

56
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,720
Wait for me to come back.

57
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,110
I promise.

58
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,440
Carry this hatred

59
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,400
and keep living.

60
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,070
Little sister, don't blame me for nagging.

61
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,320
Third Uncle is worth trusting for life.

62
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,280
With him around,

63
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,230
you'll be safe.

64
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,070
Why?

65
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,030
Why does everyone

66
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,800
risk their lives to protect me?

67
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,920
Xia, I love playing hide-and-seek.

68
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,800
But what if I can't find you?

69
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,440
If you can't find me,

70
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,510
open this,

71
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,710
count to sixty, and I'll appear.

72
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,720
Alright, Xia.

73
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,440
I'll take good care of it.

74
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,480
Xia,

75
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,030
I can't find you anymore.

00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,760
Yin Zhenghao is already dead.

110
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,000
When will you

111
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,510
bring me and our son into this family?

112
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,510
Hao just passed away.

113
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,400

114
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,630

115
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,960
what will people

116
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,840
think of me?

117
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,280
All these years,

118
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,920
you kept telling me,

119
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,480
once Yin Zhenghao dies,

120
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,550
you'll give us our rightful place.

121
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,920
You tricked me into doing dirty works.

122
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,440
Alright, alright.

123
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,670
I get it.

124
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,070
Sit down.

125
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,720

126
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,880

00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,230

128
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,280
Non...

129
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,230
If I catch her,

130
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,710
I'll kill her for sure.

131
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,030
Right now,

132
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,030
she's at Lidu.

133
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,470
How should I address you?

134
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,230
As…

135
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,150
the Third Madam,

136
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,430
or as Young Master's concubine?

137
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,350
Sister Hong, you jest.

138
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,310
Just call me Wanwan.

139
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,150
This place is too small

140
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,110
to accommodate someone

141
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,150
as important as you.

142
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,920
I was foolish before,

143
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,270
causing trouble for you.

144
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,190
Give me another chance,

145
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,270
and I'll help your business flourish

146
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,720
in Shen City.

147
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,070
Oh?

148
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,800
Tell me.

149
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,760
The Yin family's secrets.

150
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,030
I'll cooperate.

151
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,070
Aren't you afraid

152
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,600
of being silenced?

153
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,880
Only I would be silenced.

154
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,000
But then,

155
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,920
the secret would no longer be a secret.

156
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,520
I'd like to see

157
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,480
what will happen

158
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,560
if I spread the news at a time like this,

159
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,720
letting everyone in Shen City know.

160
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,920
She's back at Lidu.

161
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,190
It would make it hard for me to kill her.

162
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,760
Fine.

163
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,760
After this shipment is done,

164
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:04,920
I'll kill her

165
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,110
and officially

166
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:11,110
bring you into the Yin family.

167
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,270
Thank you.

168
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,640
Security check.

169
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,430
I didn't expect Wanwan to come back again.

170
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,760
That woman's a curse.

171
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,310
(Wanwan's Debut)
She's thrown out by the Yin family.

172
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,350
Helen of Troy.

173
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,150
Check.

174
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,720
Go on in.

175
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,640
Please wait a moment.

176
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:37,990
Come in, please.

177
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,000
Wanwan isn't at the tavern.

178
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,150
Where did she go?

179
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,030
Xiao Wu sent word that

180
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,800
Yin Shixiong's goods
are split into two parts:

181
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,680
one goes to the apothecaries,

182
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,190
and the other to Lidu.

183
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,350
Where are you going?

184
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,230
(Wanwan is at Lidu.)

185
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,520
(I want her to be safe within my sight.)

186
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,920
You're my fiancée.

187
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,600
How can I not worry about you?

188
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,840
Have you thought it through?

189
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,270
On the monthly trade day,

190
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,960
Yin Shixiong always shows up.

191
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,600
This is not just for my sister,
