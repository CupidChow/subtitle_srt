that your job is very noble.

50
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,300
your job must be

51
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,220

♫Every moment to eternity, I keep it for you♫

179
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:57,330
♫Every moment to eternity, I keep it for you♫

180
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:57,470
Alright.
♫Every moment to eternity, I keep it for you♫

181
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,160
Alright.

182
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,570
Sir, this way please.

183
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,380
I'm sorry, sir.

184
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,640
I was afraid they might say something.

185
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,360
I'm sorry.

186
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,600
Xiaoxiao is currently being interviewed.

187
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,040
Please wait here for a while.

188
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,800
Okay.

189
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,970
Then let's continue.

190
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,490
As the lead actress,

191
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,680
how do you view

192
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,160
the concept of love portrayed in this movie?

193
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:19,950
First of all, I really admire

194
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,310
the female protagonist's courage in love.

195
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,510
But personally,

196
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,270
I'm not someone who puts love above everything else.

197
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,550
I believe that, apart from

198
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,270
dedicating herself to love, a woman

199
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,470
should also have her own career in life.

200
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,200
Well said.

201
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,870
So, previously, you've taken on

202
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,910
mostly gentle roles.

203
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,320
I've heard that in your next project,

204
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,440
you'll be playing a villain.

205
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,670
So, how are you

206
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,600
going to

207
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,790
approach this role?

208
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:46,200
I think it's a new attempt for me.

209
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,480
It's also a chance for me

210
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,550
to step out of my comfort zone.

211
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,960
But the director gave me a lot of reassurance

212
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,550
and explained a lot of details about the character,

213
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:58,110
which, honestly, I could really relate to.

214
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,790
I hope everyone will see this character.

215
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,710
Don't drink too much.

216
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,450
Have some hot water.

217
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,590
I'm sorry.

218
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,030
I made things awkward for you today.

219
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,600
Do you think I should have just told him

220
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,990
that I haven't moved on yet,

221
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,810
and that's why I...

222
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:41,450
Xiaoxiao.

223
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,410
You've waited long enough

224
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,130
and done enough for him.

225
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,620
Since he was the one who broke up with you,

226
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:55,800
disappeared,

227
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,360
and gave up on your relationship,

228
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,750
why can't you let go?

229
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,780
For someone like him,

230
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,730
you should just cut your losses as soon as possible.

231
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:19,930
Let me put it this way:

232
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,910
as long as you, Luo Xiaoxiao, are willing,

233
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,910
what kind of man can't you get?

234
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,030
I mean normal men.

235
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,610
Why do you have to keep getting tangled up with him?

236
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,600
Chen Shen,

237
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,260
I think you're right.

238
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,100
If there's a man I, Luo Xiaoxiao, want,

239
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,800
I'll get him no matter what.

240
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,040
I won't let him go.

241
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,540
Alright, alright.

242
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,440
What are you talking about?

243
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,290
Have some hot water.

244
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,510
Happy birthday to me.

[Huhai Hexi Hospital]

246
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,870
I was just doing some rehabilitation exercises,

247
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,030
and I made you wait for so long.

248
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,140
I'm really sorry about that.

249
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,510
It's alright. I was just passing by,

250
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,980
so I thought I'd come and check on you.

251
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,530
By the way,

252
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,530
how are things going between you and Liu Yanze lately?

253
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,960
This rehabilitation center is quite big.

254
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,890
These lights...

255
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,070
are bright.

256
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,200
He's still avoiding you?

257
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,490
Isn't that just cowardly?

258
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,110
Alright, let's talk about something more cheerful.

259
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,580
How are things going between you and Xing Zhizhi?

260
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,780
Have you won him over?

261
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,260
Things are going smoothly, I guess.

262
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,600
But once I make a move,

263
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,790
he won't be able to escape from my grasp.

264
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:54,170
We'll see who can hold out until the end.

265
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,270

Hello, doctor.

308
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,760
Isn't Xing Zhizhi supposed to do the acupuncture for me?

309
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,450
Why? Does it have to be him?

310
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,250
Xing specifically asked me to do it.

311
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,540
I was the one who taught him acupuncture, you know.

312
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,170
What are you worried about?

00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:08,410

00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,680
Mr. Ren,

317
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,480
are you busy?

318
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,200
Come in.

319
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:20,310
This

320
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,880
is this week's public opinion report.

321
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,870
Take a look.

322
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,490
This week, her topics and searches

323
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,570
have significantly increased.

324
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,440
Her reputation is also on the rise.

325
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,550
Many people are looking forward to her variety show.

326
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,270
To be honest,

327
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,510
Fei has really

328
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,320
worked hard for this show.

329
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,320
It pained me to see it.

330
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,510
So,

331
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,750
when it actually airs,

332
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,670
her popularity

333
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,960
is sure to soar.

334
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,080
I hope so.

335
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,080
So, Mr. Ren, I think

336
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,200
the period when this variety show airs

337
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,190
is the

338
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,360
most important stage for Qin Fei's rise.

339
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,080
We should strive to secure

340
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,750
better projects and better resources for her

341
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,650
during this time.

342
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,740
Compared to the pay,

343
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,220
I believe a good opportunity

344
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,460
will definitely elevate her status.

345
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,210
Very well.

346
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,520
I wish you would become a manager soon.

00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,320
Alright, Mr. Ren.

If there's nothing else,

349
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,300

I have two tickets here.

353
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,140

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,030
But aren't you back now,

548
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,350
healthy and in one piece?

549
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,960
Why not go and win her back?

550
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,100
Do you know

551
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,350
what the most terrible thing is in a relationship?

552
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,030
What?

553
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:47,810
One word:

554
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,580
change.

555
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,000
Xiaoxiao is now

556
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,070
a big star.

557
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,320
What am I?

558
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,740
I'm just a little bodyguard.

559
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,370
It's over.

560
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,960
We won't have a future anymore.

561
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,790
Come on, let's drink.

562
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,010
Drink up.

563
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:18,760
Stop thinking about it

564
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,820
and eat something.

565
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,190
What's wrong now, Miss Qin?

566
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:46,470
Xing Zhizhi, what do you mean?

567
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,820
What do you mean by "what do you mean?"

568
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,830
You made a treatment plan for me

569
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,840
but said you didn't have time to do acupuncture for me.

570
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,750
You went to queue up to buy tickets

571
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,650
for my favorite concert

572
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,170
but didn't want to go with me.

573
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,100
What do you mean?

574
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,070
I told you I might not have time.

575
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,690
Are you playing dumb with me?

576
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,690
Do you dare say

577
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,550
that you don't like me at all now?

578
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,350
What does me liking you have to do with you?

579
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,980
Besides, you've already said

580
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,810
that we can only be friends

581
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,330
and that I shouldn't cling to you anymore

582
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:18,890
or waste time on you.

583
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,120
Have you forgotten?

584
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,390
Or...

585
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,610
you don't want me to give up?

586
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,960
Out of things to say now?

587
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,830
Well then.

588
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,340
Xing Zhizhi, are you trying to compete with me?

589
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,110
Let me tell you.

590
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,200
When it comes to competition, I have never lost to anyone!

591
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,890
Fine!

592
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:54,300
I'll see how long you can hold out.

593
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:24,140
[Qin Fei]

594
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:35,870
You're awake?

595
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,810
Do you like the photo at the door?

596
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:38,980
From now on, you'll see my face

597
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,010
every time you enter and leave the house,

598
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:42,070
which will surely brighten your mood for the whole day.

599
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,240
This is called trespassing.

600
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,570
I might call the police on you.

601
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,000
But you gave me this password.

602
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,640
I used to live here

603
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,270
for a while, remember?

604
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,160
Well, if you

605
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,480
insist on calling the police to arrest me,

606
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,380
then go ahead.

607
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,540
Do it.

608
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,500
I'll be waiting.

609
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,640
What's wrong?

610
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,190
Can't bear to do it, can you?

611
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,400
Come on, come on.

612
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,040
Look what I've prepared for you.

613
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,160
You made them?

614
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,030
I really worked hard to prepare

615
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:15,960
this whole table of dishes.

616
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,940
My hands are all rough from the work.

617
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,900
Come over and try it.

618
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,140
Hurry up. Come on.

619
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,080
Please.

620
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,000
This sweet and sour pork

621
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,730
is something my ex-boyfriend—

622
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:29,830
a friend of mine from Northeast China,

623
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:30,640
taught me.

624
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,400
It has to be

625
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,940
made with pork tenderloin, coated, deep-fried,

626
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,570
and then drizzled with sweet and sour sauce. It's really delicious.

627
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,560
Wait.

628
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,470
Northeast boyfriend?

629
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:41,870
Northeast friend.

630
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,310
A native of Tieling,

631
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,880
so this sweet and sour pork is especially authentic.

632
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,880
Try this one too.

633
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,680
This is boiled fish—

634
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,880
Sichuan boiled fish.

635
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:50,680
Don't tell me

636
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,370
you have a Sichuan ex-boyfriend too.

637
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,330
How did you know?

638
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:59,190
Just try it. They're all delicious.

639
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,850
It's hot?

640
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,150
Is it good?

641
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,550
Is it good? Is it good?

642
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,460
This sweet and sour pork

643
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,790
tastes just like what they serve

644
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,470
at Yang's Restaurant across from our hospital.

645
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,680
And this boiled fish

646
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:46,070
is a signature dish of Longrenju, right?

647
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,880
As for the rice…

648
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,630
this rice is indeed made by you.

649
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:51,070
You put too much water.

650
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,750
Do you find it fun to deceive me?

651
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,660
You've figured it all out.

652
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,320
Qin Xiaofei,

653
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:00,290
let me ask you.

654
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,810
Did you chase others like this before?

655
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,520
These cheap tricks of yours

656
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,090
might have worked on your ex-boyfriends

657
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,850
from all over the country,

658
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,110
but sorry,

659
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,100
I'm not falling for this.

660
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,200
Xing Zhizhi,

661
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,680
isn't that a bit too harsh?

662
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,310
What do you mean by cheap tricks?

663
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,920
These things were all bought by me

664
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,110
and placed here for you.

665
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,240
Isn't that a gesture of affection?

666
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,030
The point isn't whether you bought them or made them,

667
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,020
but that you deceived me

668
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,480
by exaggerating a feeling that's only one or two points

669
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,480
to ten.

670
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,430
You asked me to date you

671
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:37,930
just to prove you didn't lose, right?

672
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:39,860
Is dating about winning or losing?

673
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,760
You can treat love like a game,

674
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,450
but I can choose not to play along.

675
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,810
I'll change the password right away.

676
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,210
Don't come here anymore.

677
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:19,910
If you put in a bit more effort, the treadmill is going to be crushed by you.

678
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,040
What's wrong? Feeling defeated?

679
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:27,790
Do you think there's something wrong with Xing Zhizhi?

680
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,790
I kindly bought some food for him

681
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:30,720
and delivered it.

682
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,490
Do you know what he said?

683
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:32,640
He said I was deceiving him.

684
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,910
He said that my cheap tricks

685
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:34,970
only worked on my ex-boyfriends

686
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:36,370
but wouldn't work on him.

687
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:37,880
Well, he was right.

688
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,730
Qin Fei, have you ever

689
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,750
seriously pursued someone before?

690
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:49,840
You're right.

691
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,690
This is indeed my first time pursuing someone.

692
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,660
But I'm very serious about it.

693
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:54,910
Do you know what I've done?

694
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:56,310
I searched for information online.

695
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,310
It said that

696
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,580
I need to make him feel

697
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,590
that I'm in high demand

698
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,930
to create a sense of urgency.

699
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:02,500
Xing Zhizhi isn't just anyone.

700
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,810
You need to be sincere.

701
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:04,950
Do you understand?

702
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:07,130
Am I not sincere?

703
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,080
Are you?

704
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,250
I am.

705
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,410
You

706
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,680
have to stand in his shoes

707
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,700
and think about what he needs, right?

708
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,140
For example,

709
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,160
what he likes to eat

710
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,710
and what he likes to use.

711
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:19,860
What he likes to eat and use?

712
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,580
Then I should cover both aspects.

713
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,360
The superficial stuff,

714
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,380
and the heartfelt stuff.

715
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,840
I've got to cover them all.

716
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:27,940
Alright,

717
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,570
I'm talking to a brick wall here.

718
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:31,020
Let's not talk about this anymore.

719
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,640
Let's get to the serious business now.

720
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,310
Do you...

721
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,360
want to join Director Liu's new show?

722
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,440
How did you know?

723
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:38,040
I've just signed on for the lead female role.

724
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,350
I'll send you the script in a bit.

725
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,220
You take a look at it.

726
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,550
About that second female lead,

727
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,920
she's the kind...

728
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,190
who's quite thin and almost gaunt.

729
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,890
If you just slim down a bit more,

730
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,240
you'll have a chance.

731
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:48,940
Okay,

732
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,180
I'll try harder.

00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,540
Say something else; let me sniff it.

920
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,800
I...

921
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:09,090
Come on, that's enough. Let's go inside.

922
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,560
It smells so good.

923
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,670
This is the free-range chicken I brought back from Shunde

924
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,830
with goji berries

925
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,650
and eggs.

926
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,040
Come on, try some.

927
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,550
Hurry.

928
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,590
Here.

929
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,920
Wait a minute.

930
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,830
I won't eat these noodles

931
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:33,730
unless you admit you like me.

932
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:35,870
Eat it or not; I don't care.

933
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,520
It's just too delicious.

934
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,840
There's still more in the pot.

935
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,510
I'll have another bowl.

936
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,520
Xing Zhizhi, how could you?

937
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,550
I'm like this already,

938
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,140
and you can't even pretend a little?

939
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,860
Take your noodles away.

940
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,840
Take them away.

941
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:56,880
Alright, come on.

942
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,240
Tell me,

943
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,700
why do you have to torture

944
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:02,060
your own body like this?

945
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:04,170
I have no choice.

946
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,950
Because my new role

947
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:07,410
is a poor intern doctor,

948
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,850
working her way through school.

949
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:12,710
Xiaoxiao said I needed to lose a bit more weight,

950
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,880
or I wouldn't fit the character.

951
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:17,030
This is the script, right?

952
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,230
[Character: Wang Hui, Liu Ran]
This is the script, right?

953
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:18,330
This is the script, right?

954
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:21,690
An intern doctor.

955
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:27,200
Is this role really that important to you?

956
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,080
Alright then.

957
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,290
But you have to promise me

958
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,460
to eat a bowl of chicken soup noodles now

959
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,260
and clear your schedule for tomorrow.

960
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,120
I'll teach you.

961
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,060
You promise?

962
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,200
I'll go eat noodles.

963
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:47,980
Let's go.

964
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,030
I'll buy you some zero-calorie sugar later,

965
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:52,690
so you won't have to worry about gaining weight.

966
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:54,220
But I don't have the energy to walk.

967
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,880
Carry me to the table, please.

968
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,660
I'm going to eat noodles.

969
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,040
Xing Zhizhi,

970
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:07,210
how can you be so cold-hearted?

971
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,440
Don't eat all the noodles.

972
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,440
[Mic on] [Speaker on]

973
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:38,430
You're dressed quite differently today, Dr. Xing.

974
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:41,690
I have some free time this morning.

975
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:42,880
Before we get to the practical part,

976
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,670
I'll first go over some theoretical concepts with you.

977
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:45,310
Okay.

978
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:46,530
I'll go get a pen. Wait for me a moment.

979
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:46,640
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]
I'll go get a pen. Wait for me a moment.

980
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:46,670
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

981
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:47,920
Okay.
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

982
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,570
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

983
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,560
Alright, go ahead.

984
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,280
[Mic on] [Speaker on] [Camera on]
Alright, go ahead.

985
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,240
[Mic on] [Speaker on] [Camera on]

986
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:00,190
First of all,

987
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:01,710
the most commonly used surgical suturing

988
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:04,830
in our clinical practice is simple interrupted suturing.

989
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:06,510
The instruments we use are a needle holder

990
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:07,700
and a pair of forceps.

991
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,750
Hold the needle with the needle holder.

992
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:09,260
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]
Hold the needle with the needle holder.

993
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:09,290
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

994
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:10,660
Insert the needle vertically,
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

995
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:11,580
which means
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

996
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:11,610
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

997
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:13,330
the curvature of the needle
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

998
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:13,360
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

999
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,880
should remain perpendicular to the skin.
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

1000
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,310
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

1001
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:16,630
Right.
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

1002
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:17,160
Right.

1003
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:20,040
Then, the most important thing is to insert the needle first,

1004
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,690
then withdraw it,

1005
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,550
and then lift it, making sure to pull it straight

1006
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:24,710
at a balanced angle.

1007
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:26,630
Then cut and withdraw the needle.

1008
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:29,120
Hold it before proceeding to the next steps.

1009
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,830
[You're so handsome when you're focused]

1010
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:37,860
Listen carefully.
[You're so handsome when you're focused]

1011
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:38,910
[You're so handsome when you're focused]

1012
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:40,790
Okay, Mr. Xing,

1013
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:42,130
please continue.
