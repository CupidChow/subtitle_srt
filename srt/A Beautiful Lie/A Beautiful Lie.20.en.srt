but it may also be...

182
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,540
I mean, it may be

183
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,970
caused by psychological issues.

184
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,920
If not, come to our hospital's

185
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,550
psychiatry department and have them take a look.

186
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,360
Du, you...

187
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,550
You...

188
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,790
We all work in the same hospital.

189
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,590
What are you afraid of? Just have them check on you.

[WeChat]

191
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,390
Today's girlfriend update,

192
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,610
please check.

193
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,690
I had oatmeal with milk for breakfast.

194
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,810
As per your medical advice, I didn't go hungry.

195
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,720
The soup at lunch wasn't good at all.

196
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,180
I really miss your homemade pork rib soup...

197
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,210
There's no signal at the outdoor set today,

198
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,400
so I don't know

199
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:36,030
when these WeChat messages will go through...

200
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,560
Here is a wildflower for you...

201
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,580
Mainly to remind you...

202
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,030
that you're taken now.

203
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,870
Don't pick up on other girls!

204
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,150
Xiaoxiao says

205
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,180
communication is key in relationships.

206
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,250
So I'm sending you whatever comes to mind.

207
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,380
You must do the same—

208
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,200
report your whereabouts to me anytime, anywhere.

209
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,320
You're not replying at all...

210
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,380
Looks like there's really no signal.

211
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:02,480
Xing Zhizhi, I miss you so much.

212
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,360
I'll be back soon!

[Qin Xiaofei]

214
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,320
I've been really busy with work today

215
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,670
and just now got to have lunch.

216
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,070
I miss you too.

218
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,230
Xiaofei.

219
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,700
You're taking a break? Let me tell you,

220
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,630
the director praised me today.

221
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,560
It's the first time

222
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,600
a director has told me

223
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,870
that my acting was decent.

224
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,380
And Xiaoxiao also said I was really into the role

225
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,940
and that my acting had improved.

226
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,740
Are you happy?

227
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,110
Of course, I'm happy.

228
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,560
You know very well

229
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:05,390
that I did go through some hardships for this show.

230
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,190
What's wrong?

231
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,150
Why are you looking at me like that?

232
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:17,030
Do you think I'm being too talkative and clingy?

233
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,250
How could I be, Xiaofei?

234
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,410
I love it when you're clingy.

235
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,150
And I love

236
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:25,500
how you share everything with me, whether it's big or small.

237
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,870
However, Ms. Qin,

238
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,390
you mentioned getting deeply into the role.

239
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,770
Are you talking about the romantic scenes with Hao Jun?

240
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,050
What if you can't get out of character?

241
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:32,640
I...

242
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,190
Xing Zhizhi,

243
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,720
why have you suddenly

244
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,480
become so insecure?

245
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,980
That's not like you.

246
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,130
This is my first relationship, and I'm often alone,

247
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,080
so it's understandable

248
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,410
that I don't have much confidence, right?

249
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,580
Then I'll tell you some news.

250
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:50,580
What is it?

251
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,030
Because my acting skills have improved rapidly,

Okay.

260
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,080
Sir, this item

261
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,150
is half price for the second one today.

262

Would you like a second one?

263
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,630
No, I don't need it.

264
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,230

Okay, cut!

Good! Good!

271
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,070
Come on.

Good job, well done.

During this time,

276
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,070
I've had high expectations for you.

277
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,250
You've also made great progress.

278
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,730
Good, very good indeed.

We're about to change sets.

Hold this for me.

316
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,110
Okay.

317
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,200
Wait for me in the car.

318
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,110
Okay.

319
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,090
Congrats on finishing filming.

320
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,710
All packed up?

321
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,590
It's so nice to have someone waiting for you at home.

322
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,350
What's this for?

323
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,640
Thank you for helping me get this role.

324
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,350
What are you thanking me for?

325
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,590
You earned it yourself

326
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,050
through your own efforts.

327
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,140
Do you know

328
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,830
why I like Wang Hui?

329
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,130
Because she's brave.

330
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,590
She knows

331
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,470
to move on with her head held high.

332
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,260
Xiaoxiao,

333
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,630
I'm really grateful to you.

334
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,200
Thank you for encouraging me

335
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,070
to embrace a new love.

336
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,220
Now, I'm going to embrace love.

337
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,100
What about you? What are you planning to do?

338
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,850
Chen Shen does seem quite unreliable,

339
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,890
but I have to admit

340
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,940
that he really likes you.

341
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,060
When did he buy you off too?

342
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,370
I can't help it.

343
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,070
He offered too much.

344
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,410
He said if you agree,

345
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,130
he'll give me his entire fortune.

346
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,350
How about this?

347
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,750
You pretend to agree first,

348
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,480
and then we can split his money.

349
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,880
You sold me out, and I have to give you half of the money?

350
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,140
Be happy,

351
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,220
leading lady.

352
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,370
Xiaoxiao.

353
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,140
Xiaoxiao, I'll head back first.

354
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:24,790
Okay.

355
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,900
Didn't I tell you to come later?

356
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,160
You must have been waiting for a while.

357
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,310
I didn't have anything else to do,

358
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,540
so I came early.

359
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,810
Rose.

360
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,500
It's quite beautiful.

361
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,060
Who gave it to you?

362
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,800
Qin Fei. She wrapped up filming today.

363
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,990
Oh, right, right.

364
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:45,440
Well,

365
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,550
I've brought you some snacks.

366
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:50,160
They are all fruits that you like,

367
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,810
and this soy milk.

368
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,050
Didn't you say you really loved it last time?

369
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,550
I'm now the distributor of this soy milk.

370
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,880
You can have as much as you want from now on.

371
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,120
Well,

372
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:03,000
do you want to go see a movie together later?

373
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,990
I heard there's a good one out.

374
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,510
It's okay. If you don't want to watch,

375
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,030
then we won't. I can just take you home.

376
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:09,760
Let's watch.

377
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,800
What movie?

378
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,680
Let me check what movies there are.

379
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,220
I bought tickets for two movies.

380
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,630
One is a romance,

381
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,050
while the other is a sci-fi.

382
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,790
If you don't want to watch the romance,

383
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,790
we can watch the sci-fi movie.

384
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,120
This sci-fi movie

385
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,550
also has a love plot in it.

386
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,550
Cheers.

387
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,780
What did you think of the movie today?

388
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,560
What do you think?

389
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,180
I think it's just okay.

390
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,160
Really?

391
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,310
You spent half the movie looking at me

392
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,200
instead of watching,

393
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,650
and you still think it's just okay?

394
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:09,730
Elaborate on that.

395
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,790
Well, if you put it that way,

396
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,580
it also proves that you spent half the time looking at me.

397
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,870
If you weren't looking at me, how would you know that I was looking at you?

398
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:19,070
How long have you been interested in me?

399
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,380
Why did you suddenly ask that?

400
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,260
I don't think that is a good movie.

401
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,200
A one-sided love,

402
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,680
where only one person waits alone,

403
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,730
is too cruel for anyone

404
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,990
and unfair.

405
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,940
Am I right?

406
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,510
It is unfair.

407
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,190
But love

408
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,770
is never about fairness.

409
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,900
Even if only one person is waiting,

410
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,890
as long as they're willing

411
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,460
to wait,

412
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,090
I think that's okay.

413
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,430
Are you sure?

414
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,390
I'm sure.

415
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,110
Okay.

416
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,660
We still have time.

417
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:20,040
Whose movie do you want to watch next?

418
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,700
I'll go with you.

419
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,120
Really?

420
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,030
Really.

421
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,120
Okay.

422
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,300
Opportunity knocks, but once.

423
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,250
Better tell me quick before I change my mind.

424
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,980
I want to watch "Summer Girls."

425
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,390
Can you watch it with me?

426
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,480
Then, let's watch it.

427
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,310
Really?

428
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,480
Really.

429
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,180
Okay.

430
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,960
But I'll just give it a try.

431
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,480
I can't guarantee that this movie will be good.

432
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,240
If it's not good

433
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,880
and you want to leave halfway,

434
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,830
you have to tell me.

435
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,160
Don't worry.

436
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:09,100
Even if this movie isn't good,

437
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,610
I will definitely

438
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,520
leave in the middle.

439
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,190
I'm just joking.

440
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:16,110
I definitely won't leave.

441
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:16,720
Don't worry.

442
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,350
I was joking.

443
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,160
I was only joking earlier.

444
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,820
Whoever leaves first is a dog.

445
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,110
Rest assured.

446
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,620
I definitely won't leave.

447
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,670
Hurry up and eat; the steak is getting cold.

448
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,990
You're so handsome.

449
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,110
Dr. Xing, what's the occasion?

450
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,900
Handing out sweets so early in the morning?

451
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,810
So sweet.

452
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:52,860
What are you talking about?

453
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,200
Isn't it Nurses' Day today?

454
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,130
I thought I'd hand out some chocolates to you.

455
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,110
The drinks will be here soon.

456
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,830
You all have one. You all have one.

457
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,270
Thank you, Dr. Xing.

458
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,270
No problem, no problem.

459
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,000
You seem to be in high spirits.

460
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,860
Did something good happen to you?

461
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,950
Is your girlfriend back?

462
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,030
What are you talking about?

463
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:10,530
Everyone's been working really hard lately,

464
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:11,690
so I thought I'd bring some chocolates

465
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:13,690
to reward you for all your hard work.

466
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,070
Well, that girl, you know?

467
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,400
No, no. Forget it. Forget it.

468
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,720
Take the chocolates. Just take the chocolates.

469
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,380
Well, well, Xing Zhizhi.

470
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,510
You're already taken, yet you're still flirting around here.

471
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,730
Yes, each one has different flavors, and then...

472
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,520
No wonder you didn't reply to my WeChat messages.

473
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,190
Flirting with girls here, huh?

474
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:27,920
And you said

475
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:30,370
that you thought of me on the day and dreamed of me at night.

476
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:32,400
-It was all just an act.
-The drinks will be here soon.

477
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,930
Alright, I'm going back to work now. Goodbye.

478
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,430
Thank you, Dr. Xing!

479
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,070
-It's okay.
-Thank you, Dr. Xing!

480
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,040
I was standing right in front of you for so long,

481
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,160
yet your eyes were glued to those young nurses.

482
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,580
You didn't even spare me a glance.

483
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,240
You really are a piece of work.

484
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,740
Where are you?

485
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,340
When did you get here?

486
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,400
Didn't you say

487
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,660
you'd be back tomorrow?

488
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,680
Coffee booked the flight ticket too early.

489
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,200
Alright, then, I'll take you out for something good.

490
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,090
I'm not going.

491
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,310
All the chocolates are gone.

492
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,850
What's left for me to eat?

493
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,720
Tell me the truth.

494
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,410
Why did you buy chocolates for them?

495
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:32,650
I can explain.

496
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:33,980
Isn't it Nurses' Day today?

497
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,440
So I gave them chocolates.

498
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,350
It's just an employee benefit.

499
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,880
We have to give them something on Nurses' Day,

500
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,750
right?

501
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,650
Don't be jealous, okay?

502
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,460
Don't be jealous.

503
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,260
I am jealous. Why shouldn't I be?

504
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,160
Are you still jealous?

505
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,680
You're still jealous, aren't you?

506
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,700
Alright, alright.

507
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,560
What are you doing? There are so many people around.

508
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:58,660
Alright, don't be jealous, okay?

509
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,910
Okay?

510
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,700
You must be tired after such a long day.

511
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,970
Go home and get some rest.

512
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:06,470
Tomorrow at ten in the morning,

513
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,960
let's meet at the bottom of the mall by your place.

514
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,810
What are we going to the mall for?

515
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,550
To go on a date.

516
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,850
Why isn't he here yet?

517
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,830
I'm all covered up like this.

518
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:39,160
What if Xing Zhizhi doesn't recognize me?

519
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,110
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

520
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:12,990
I'm sorry, Qin Xiaofei.

521
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,550
I... I got stuck in traffic on my way here.

522
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,640
Good thing you recognized me.

523
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,340
I was worried you wouldn't find me among all these people.

524
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,550
How could I not recognize you?

525
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,440
Look at this entire floor;

526
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,710
you're the one dressed the most strangely.

527
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,640
How am I dressed strangely?

528
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:24,520
If it weren't for you

529
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,310
insisting on meeting in such a public place...

530
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,970
I'm a public figure after all.

531
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,650
I'm all wrapped up like this

532
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,250
just because I'm afraid it'd affect your life.

533
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,640
Alright. How could I be afraid of that?

534
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,900
I'm only afraid you don't want to affect my life

535
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,100
and might run away without taking responsibility for me.

536
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,160
Zhizhi,

537
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,360
would you feel

538
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,020
that dating me is particularly a hassle?

539
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,450
We're going out on a date,

540
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,550
yet it's like we're sneaking around.

541
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,750
And we can't even take a nice couple photo.

542
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,160
How could I be?

543
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:59,760
Since it's a date,

544
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,050
let's do something exciting.

545
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,730

00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,440
Very impressive.

727
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:35,550
Dr. Xing, off work?

728
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:36,880
Yes, I'm off work.

729
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,920
And who is this?

730
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,320
Hello, sisters.

731
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:43,200
Oh, right, she's my cousin from a distant relative's side.

732
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,710
She's on break from school,

733
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,190
so I'm showing her around.

734
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:47,420
Alright, have a good time then.

735
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,880

Alright, have a good time then.

[Use this elevator for outpatient check-ups]

737
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,440
We'll be going now, Dr. Xing.

738
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,510
-Bye.
-Bye. Take care.
[Use this elevator for outpatient check-ups]

739
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:51,700
-Bye.
-Bye. Take care.

740
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,920
How was that? I pulled it off, right?

741
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,740
You're good.

742
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,940
So, cousin, where shall we go tonight?

743
00:37:59,430 --> 00:37:59,990
Here.

744
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,600
Thank you, thank you. I'll return them to you tomorrow.

745
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,400
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

746
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,080
Come on, give it to me.

747
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:10,150
Hey, what are you doing?

748
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,160
Stop it; people can see us.

749
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,750
I'm hungry.

750
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,180
Alright, alright.

751
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,040
Then, you

752
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,000
put the batteries in the flashlight.

753
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,920
I'll go make some noodles for you.

754
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,070
What are you afraid of?

755
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,360
Are you afraid that someone might see us?

756
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,320
I'm not; why would I be afraid?

757
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,770
How could I be afraid?

758
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:23,630
I...

759
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:24,930
I'm not afraid.

760
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,170
If you're not afraid, come on, come on.

761
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,170
Give me a kiss.

762
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,900
Fine, I'll kiss you. Sure, who's afraid?

763
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,590
I told you that you were afraid, yet you still wouldn't admit it.

764
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:42,070
-I'm not.
-Then why are you avoiding?

765
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,400
-He coughed, and I…
-Come here. Come on.

766
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:51,530
Look how nervous you are.

767
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,520
Well... they're all watching.

768
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,450
Who's watching you?

769
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:55,200
If you're like this, let me tell you.

770
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,660
If you don't care, then I won't care either.

771
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,860
I'm really going to kiss you. I'm really going to kiss you.

772
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:03,260
[Alarm: 10 minutes later]

773
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:09,960
[Alarm: 10 minutes later]

774
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,060
Wake up.

775
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,500
It's time to watch the lunar eclipse.

776
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,330
Come on, get up.

777
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,150
Ten more minutes.

778
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:32,090
Hurry up, or we'll miss it.

779
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,700
You go. I'm not going.

780
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:37,910
If you don't get up,

781
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:39,510
I'll tickle you.

782
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,480
Get up; get up.

783
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,150
-Don't tickle me.
-Get up.

784
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:46,550
Get up, get up, get up, up!

785
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:52,700
Are you a dog? You bit me.

786
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,590
You're really angry now.

787
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:02,320
Then, then...

788
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,170
bite me again, then.

789
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:11,960
Alright, don't be mad.

790
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:13,300
Hurry up; we're going to be late.

791
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,740
We're going to miss it.

792
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,870
-I haven't put on my wig yet. -It's fine.

793
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,530
The eclipse will be over soon.

794
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,470
I want to ask you a question.

795
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
After seeing me in Paris,

796
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,630
did you try to find me?

797
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,890
No. Why do you ask?

798
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:34,180
I just wanted to know.

799
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:36,170
But now I regret having asked.

800
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:40,340
Next question.

801
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:42,860
Have you ever watched a lunar eclipse with someone else?

802
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,330
Think carefully before you answer.

803
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:45,500
If you answer incorrectly,

804
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,160
you'll be in serious trouble.

805
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,480
I haven't.

806
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,760
You're the first and only one.

807
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:58,650
I'll barely consider that a correct answer.

808
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,840
Look, the lunar eclipse is starting!

809
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,550
Look.

810
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,080
The ancients' words weren't very reliable.

811
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:03,610
Didn't they refer to the lunar eclipse as "the Heavenly Dog devouring the moon"?

812
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:05,700
It doesn't look like a dog at all.

813
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,260
But...

814
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:14,250
the lies from the ancients sound more poetic.

815
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,220
So people just pretended to believe them.

816
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,030
When many people believed them,

817
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:21,550
those lies turned into beautiful legends.

818
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:26,060
Do you get what I'm saying?

819
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,410
Yeah.

820
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,190
You mean

821
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,770
that even if you're lying,

822
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,250
I still have to pretend to believe you.

823
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,710
Whatever you say is right.

824
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,140
Clever.

825
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:38,580
What about me?

826
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,840
Would you believe everything I tell you?

827
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,590
Xing Zhizhi,

828
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:43,810
I'm asking you questions now.

829
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:45,180
Who said you could ask a question back?

830
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,030
You're so bossy.

831
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,630
I am particularly bossy.

832
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:49,280
And I have plenty of flaws too.

833
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,360
I'm unreasonable and willful.

834
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,920
And you bite.

835
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:54,420
Alright, alright.

836
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,400
I like you just the way you are,

837
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,150
okay?

838
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:59,730
Does your hand hurt?

839
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,700
It's this hand.

840
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,000
Then does this hand hurt?

841
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,440
It hurts. Of course, it hurts.

842
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,250
It doesn't hurt. Not at all.

843
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,440
I would.

844
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:21,370
I'd believe everything you say.

00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:22,290
