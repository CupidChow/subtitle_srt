920
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,480
at this stage,

921
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,550
bringing Xixi back to Huhai for treatment

922
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,800
is more appropriate.

923
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,790
What about the expenses?

924
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:10,060
I've applied for a relief fund for Xixi.

925
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:12,260
And the publicity center also thinks

926
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,670
that Xixi's

927
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,860
entire treatment and rehabilitation process

928
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,720
can be used as a promotional case.

929
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,860
You don't need to worry about the expenses.

930
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:23,680
Since that isn't an issue,

931
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:24,950
what's the reason

932
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,510
for you to send Xixi away

933
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,910
and talk to me privately?

934
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,550
There is indeed a rather difficult issue

935
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,400
I'd like to discuss with you.

936
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,240
Yes, yes.

937
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:42,900
You see,

938
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,760
as you know,

939
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,320
rehabilitation is quite a challenging process.

940
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,360
And for a child of Xixi's age,

941
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,030
to successfully complete rehabilitation,

942
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,320
she needs

943
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,930
emotional support.

944
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,590
I believe at this stage,

945
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:55,150
the person who can provide her with this support

946
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,670
is probably only you.

947
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:58,230
I understand,

948
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,690
but what do you mean by "probably"?

949
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:01,280
Dr. Xing, please explain.

950
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,000
In other words,

951
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,570
Ms. Qin, I know you're usually very busy,

952
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,500
but

953
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,960
if you could find some time

954
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,230
in your busy schedule to accompany Xixi...

955
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,670
Dr. Xing, come here.

956
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,400
Look into my eyes and answer me.

957
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,190
Will my accompanying Xixi during her recovery

958
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:14,320
really help with her rehabilitation?

959
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Are these requests you're making of me

960
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,280
truly,

961
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,150
completely and thoroughly

962
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:21,730
for Xixi's benefit?

963
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,090
-My eye's a little…
-Look at me.

964
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,280
I'm pretty sure.

965
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,730
Really.

970

Okay.

971
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:06,960
Hello?

972
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,370
What are you doing?

973
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,670
Why did it take you so long?

974
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:10,760
What are you up to?

975
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,840
What's the matter?

976
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,590
Here's the thing,

977
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,760
I'm

978
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,000
with your

979
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
father and Cheng.

980
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,630
And

981
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:23,030
your brother Cheng is on vacation right now.

982
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:24,590
He wants to come visit you.

983
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:26,360
So we decided together

984
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,550
to go to your place,

985
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:29,750
Huhai, and spend a couple of days there.

986
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,760
Okay.

987
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,710
When are you coming?

988
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:34,110
I'll have Coffee book the hotel in advance.

989
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,550
No need to book a hotel.

990
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:36,960
Isn't your house big enough?

991
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,670
I've discussed it with your father and brother.

992
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:39,760
We'll stay with you,

993
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,760
spend time together and get closer.

994
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,760
You, your husband, and your son

995
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,070
have already discussed this,

996
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:46,440
so what's the point of telling me now?

997
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,040
Just to notify me, is that it?

998
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,480
Xiaofei,

999
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,930
how could you talk to me like that?

1000
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,110
We were very happy

1001
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,840
to get together with you.

1002
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,280
You just have to say it like that, don't you?

1003
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,810
It's irritating, isn't it?

1004
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:04,230
Fine,

1005
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,150
since you put it that way,

1006
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,080
I'm notifying you right now.

1007
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,760
We're coming right away. Deal with it yourself.

1008
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:20,110
Are you alright?

1009
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:21,930
Ms. Qin Fei.

1010
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:23,030
Xixi.

1011
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,140
Then I'll leave Xixi to you.

1012
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,000
Alright.

1013
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,400
Xixi,

1014
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,670
you're hugging me so tightly.

1015
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,610
Are you afraid I'll run away?

1016
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:38,490
You missed me so much, didn't you?

1017
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,110
Who missed you?

1018
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:41,000
Ms. Qin Fei,

1019
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,480
didn't you say when I came to Huhai,

1020
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,280
you'd take me to see Ms. Jin Na?

1021
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:44,880
What now?

1022
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,400
Are you not going to keep your word?

1023
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,110
You ungrateful little one,

1024
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:51,540
as soon as you see me, you talk about Jin Na.

1025
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:52,710
As soon as I heard you were here,

1026
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:53,880
I came running right away.

1027
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,510
I didn't ask you to come.

1028
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:57,400
I wouldn't trust you to take care of me.

1029
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,280
It was Mr. Xing's idea.

1030
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:00,250
Xixi,

1031
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,320
look, my eye got hit today.

1032
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,960
See, it's bruised.

1033
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:11,250
About Xixi's rehabilitation...

1034
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,360
I'm fine with it.

1035
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:14,360
Okay.

1036
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,480
Then, what about Xixi's daily diet?

1037
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,280
If there are any dietary restrictions,

1038
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,930
just tell Coffee about it on WeChat.

1039
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:19,930
Alright.

1040
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,360
So during Xixi's rehabilitation,

1041
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,400
she'll stay at your place.

1042
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:22,960
No.

1043
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:25,470
Why?

1044
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:28,470
Is it inconvenient because you have visitors at home?

1045
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:29,900
Xixi,

1046
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:31,710
I don't want to stay at home recently.

1047
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,260
Let's rent a place near the hospital

1048
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:34,660
and live together, okay?

1049
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,000
Alright then.

1050
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:41,730
Where are you going?

1051
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:43,130
To look for an apartment.

1052
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,340
Now?

1053
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:46,410
Let's go, Xixi.

1054
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,520
Wait, I haven't got my bag.
