Fei said she's going out with Dr. Xing

36
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,570
and told me not to wait for her.

37
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,680
Is that so?

38
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,870
Yes, it is.

39
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,520
Just now at home, she was talking about playing it cool,

40
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,180
and the next minute she's off with someone else.

41
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,800
I hope there's nothing wrong with Dr. Xing's eyes.

42
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,830

so I think you know

64
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,670
what I mean by now.

65

132
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,870
I can stay at my parents' house.

133
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,580
Or I can sleep in the hospital's on-call room.

134
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,810
Why are you overthinking this?

135
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,170
There's a child here.

136
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:43,830

letting your patient stay in your own house?

146
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,310
That's some patient perk.

Letting a friend crash at my place

152
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,080

00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,830
Neither.

192
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,840
This is the passcode to my house.

193
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,020
You and Xixi can tidy up.

194
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,140
I'm heading out.

195
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,450
Oh, and by the way,

196
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,350
accept my friend request

197
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,300
on WeChat.

198
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,050
It'll be easier to stay in touch.

199
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,670
Didn't you already add Xixi on WeChat?

200
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,790
Yes, he did.

201
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,020
Then you can just reach out to Xixi.

202
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,660
After all, we're just...

203
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,540
Friends.

204
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:36,530
Let's go, Xixi.

205
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,320
I will take you out.

206
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,210
Where are you going?

207
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,640
To the supermarket.

208
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,850
Then let me help you.

209
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,030
Xixi.

210
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,460
Do you like this?

211
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,760
Here, have one.

212
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,830
This taste is great.

213
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,400
This.

214
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,510
Sure.

215
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,550
Two more of these.

216
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,530
Xing Zhizhi, are you serious?

217
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,710
Xixi starts rehab tomorrow—

218
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,840
she should be eating light and healthy.

219
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,120
Do you really think this is appropriate?

220
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,760
Ms. Qin.

221
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,510
I want to look at picture books.

222
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,280
Alright, you can look here.

223
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,440
I'll go grab some toothpaste and towels.

224
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,800
What color towels?

225
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,930
Pink and blue.

226
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:10,110
Alright.

227
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,930
Pink and blue.

228
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,440
Haven't you finished it yet?

229
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,670
No, not yet.

230
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,120
Isn't that the big star?

231
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,810
Big star? You must be mistaken.

232
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:29,510
Which big star?

233
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,140
That one.

234
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,390
Qin Fei.

235
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,990
Have you read the gossip about Qin Fei?

236
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,300
She's always fighting.

237
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,600
How could I have missed it?

238
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,040
She's so fake.

239
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:37,790
Agree.

240
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,390
I heard her endorsement

241
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,750
got pulled by the brand.

242
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,800
Serves her right.

243
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,120
What are you doing?

244
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,620
I'm picking out toothpaste.

245
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,240
Have you watched "Story of Mingyue"?

246
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,570
Of course I have.

247
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,010
Her acting is so cringe. I can't stand it.

248
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,890
I know, right? It's unbearable.

249
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,380
Who are you talking about?

250
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,030
I'll tell you—

251
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,080
Ms. Qin Fei is the most beautiful

252
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,770
and kindest person I've ever met.

253
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,790
You're not even worthy of a strand of her hair!

254
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,670
I won't allow you to badmouth her!

255
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,370
Little girl, who are you?

256
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,030
Let me stay!

257
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,430
I haven't finished telling them off yet.

258
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:14,870
Alright, alright.

259
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,130
We all know how tough you've been lately.

260
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,440
Okay, calm down.

261
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,090
Weren't you a Jin Na fan?

262
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,910
What?

263
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,530
Jumped ship?

264
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,520
You really should go out less.

265
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,630
You're always causing me trouble.

266
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,860
Good point.

267
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,390
Immature.

268
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,250
Dr. Xing.

269
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,440
Let me, let me, let me.

270
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,640
It's fine, it's fine.

271
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,270
Fei told me about Xixi's situation on WeChat.

272
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,390
Thank you for your help.

273
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,390
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

274
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,120
Fei is actually

275
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,000
pretty easy to get along with.

276
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,560
Plus, she's super neat and clean.

277
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,020
She'll definitely be a great houseguest.

278
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,320
Dr. Xing, you don't need to worry.

279
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,840
It's just that her temper has been a bit short lately.

280
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,830
Please be a little more patient with her.

281
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,920
It's no problem.

282
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,520
Actually, I originally wanted Xixi

283
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,530
to stay at Qin Fei's place.

284
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,150
But she didn't seem very willing.

285
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,960
It's not that Fei is being stingy.

286
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,510
It's fine. I get it. I understand.

287
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,120
Given her job, I completely understand.

288
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,630
No, no.

289
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,380
That's not it.

290
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,740
Well, then it's...

291
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,210
I'll be straightforward with you, Dr. Xing.

292
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,920
Fei is in a bad mood

293
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,650
because of her mom.

294
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,690
You see, with everything Fei is going through right now,

295
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:46,790
instead of showing any concern,

296
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,250
her mom just keeps criticizing her.

297
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,970
And to make matters worse, she insisted on

298
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:50,800
bringing the whole family here, staying in Fei's home.

299
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,040
So Fei, being stubborn as she is,

300
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,380
decided to just give up the house entirely.

301
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,760
In the end, it all boils down to

302
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,760
that Fei doesn't want to see her mom.

303
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,380
I see. But why are things

304
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,120
so tense between her and her mom?

305
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,440
It's old baggage.

306
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,050
Though their tempers are indeed quite similar.

307
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,460
And when you were in Linkang,

308
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,490
you've probably gotten a taste

309
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,460
of her personality, right?

310
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,490
Got it.

311
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,670
Alright, mission accomplished. I'll leave.

312
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,320
Dr. Xing, I'll leave her in your care.

313
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,320
Don't worry. It's no problem.

314
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,550
Bye.

315
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,280
Dr. Xing,

316
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,910
Fei told me about the house-hunting situation.

317
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,960
I went to check out a few places today,

318
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,140
but the environment wasn't great.

319
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,320
I've scheduled another appointment with a realtor tomorrow afternoon.

320
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,270
If you're free,

321
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,930
would you come and pick one out?

322
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:32,560
No need.

323
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,650
I've got a place to stay.

324
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:34,890

I'm looking for a solution, okay?

330
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,670
You're only in elementary school,

331
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,600

didn't you just get off work?

Why haven't you left yet?

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,080
Why haven't you left yet?

378
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,900
There's something going on at home.

379
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,820
I'll have to stay here for a few days.

380
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,240
What happened at your home?

381
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,770
How long do you need to stay?

382
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,760
It's nothing serious.

383
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,290
I won't be staying for long.

384
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,340
Qin Fei.

385
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,940
Qin Fei!

Xing Zhizhi.

387
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,310
Your kitchen stove is on fire!

388
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,940
Be careful!

389
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,270
Ms. Qin, what happened?

390
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,740
Xixi, it's alright now.

391
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,170
Don't worry.

392
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,830
Are you okay?

393
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,660
Did you get hurt?

394
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,030
I'm fine.

395
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,920
It's just that Xixi wanted a fried egg,

396
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,530
so I thought I'd make one for her.

397
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,180
I did a pretty good job.

398
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:16,990
Oh, by the way,

399
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,990
why did you get in without knocking?

400
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,350
If I hadn't come in, you would've set my whole house on fire.

401
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,270
That's not acceptable.

402
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,270
You said you'd let Xixi and me stay here.

403
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,300
How come you just show up whenever you want?

404
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,160
I'm going to change the door code.

405
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,070
Fine, go ahead.

406
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,140
I don't care.

407
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,140
Then change it now. Right now.

408
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,070
Mr. Xing,

409
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,940
we're from the property management.

410
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,640
Did a fire just start in your home?

411
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,850
Mr. Xing,

412
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,610
could you please open the door?

413
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,500
Wait.

414
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:42,510
I can't let people see me here.

415
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,750
They might think we're living together.

416
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,350
I'll go back to my room first.

417
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:48,830
It's nothing.

418
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,680
I just left something on the stove and forgot about it.

419
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,310
It's all good now. Thank you.

420
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,920
Mr. Xing,

421
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,800
we still need to check your fire alarm system

422
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,280
to make sure it's working properly.

423
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,580
Let go. What are you doing?

424
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,250
Alright.

425
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,610
Just a moment, please.

426
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,530
What are you doing?

427
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,130

428
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,360
What WeChat?

429
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,710
Accept my WeChat request, and I'll let go.

430
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,040
I know you're not the type to take advantage of someone in a situation like this.

431
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,150
I wasn't before,

00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,660
but I am now.

433
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,080
Fine.

434
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,500
You won't accept it, huh?

435
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,680

are you alright?

441
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,400
I'm fine. I'm really sorry

442
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,000
for making you come out here so early.

443
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,710
It's fine. As long as you're okay, that's all that matters.

444
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,560
I'm fine.

445
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,280
I've also checked the fire alarm.

446
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,260
There doesn't seem to be a problem.

447
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,360
If you still need to inspect it,

448
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,410
could we do it another day?

449
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,730
I've got to head out.

450
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,260
Alright then. We'll come by another day.

451
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,110
You take care.

452
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,410
Bye.

Thank you, thank you.

454
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,550
Sorry for the trouble.

455
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,700

I never expected a doctor to pull something like this.

if you had blocked or deleted me.

I'm telling you,

476
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,880
just because we added each other on WeChat

477
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,610
doesn't mean we're that close.

It's almost time.

480
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,590
I'll wait for you two downstairs.

481
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,270

[Emergency]

483
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,770
Left leg.

484
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,650
Press down with your left leg. Yes.

485
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:50,060
Now slowly lift your right leg, higher.

486
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:51,000
Good.

487
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,800
Step forward again.

488
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:53,550
Good.

489
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,200
Support yourself with both hands.

490
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:55,800
That's it.

491
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,800
And then slowly,

492
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,890
lift your right leg and bring it forward too.

493
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,520
Make sure it's stable.

494
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,460
Once she's up,

495
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,570
you can gradually

496
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,620
take your hands off her body,

497
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,480
just keeping them there for protection.

498
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,400
Great, good job.

499
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,230
Very good.

500
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,800
Keep supporting yourself.

501
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,680
Right now, Xixi is putting most of her weight

502
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,200
on the leg that wasn't injured.

503
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,840
The key to this stage of rehab

504
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,040
is helping her gradually

505
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,520
find her own balance.

506
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:24,080
As she practices more, she'll slowly build confidence.

507
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,780
Once she gets over the mental hurdle,

508
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,910
we can start focusing on strengthening her leg muscles.

509
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:30,430
Come on.

510
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,580

512
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,030
his back pain got worse this morning.

513
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,410
He's asking you to come take a look.

514
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,270
Got it, I'll head over right away.

515
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,710
In the early stages of rehab,

516
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,130
it's going to be tough.

517
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,610
You just need to be patient

518
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,620
and give her lots of encouragement and support.

519
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,570
-Keep going.
-Dr. Xing!

520
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,380

521
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:53,850
I'll go check on a patient real quick.

522
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,650
If anything comes up, WeChat me.

523
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,590
This rehabilitation department is big enough

524
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,590
to function without you.

525
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,450
Xixi,

526
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:03,510
can you wait a moment?

527
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,510
I need to make a phone call, alright?

528
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,840

your parents yet.

532
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,760
From what I saw, their flight should have landed.

533
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,910
I'll try calling them again.

534
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,370
Alright, don't worry.

535
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,630
Hello, excuse me.

536
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,810
Could you take a picture for us?

537
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:33,950
Thank you.

538
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,740
Sure.

539
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,400
No problem.

540
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:41,000
One, two, three.

541
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,320
Check it out.

542
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,920
-Okay.
-No problem.

543
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,600
This angle isn't right.

544
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,920
Look, this angle isn't good.

545
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,750
Could you take another one for us?

546
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,950
I'm sorry, Madam, I have something else I need to do.

547
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,260
I'm here to pick someone up.

548
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,160
Young lady, I can tell

549
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,500
you're beautiful and stylish.

550
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,590
I believe you can

551
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,160
find a very good angle.

552
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,160
Just one more photo,

553
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,030
please? Just one more.

No, ma'am.

00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,180
I have something important to do. I'm here to pick someone up.

560

Please, ask someone else for help.

565
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,200
Where are you?

566
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,130
Hello, Auntie.

Hello, Uncle.

Hello.

570
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,380
Auntie, let me take another picture for you.

571
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,980
I'll definitely capture your natural beauty.

00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,310
Fei, I've picked them up.

577
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,130
I'll take them for a walk around.

Xixi.

579
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,810
Shouldn't we listen to the doctor?

580
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,440
We should try to put our weight

581
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,840
on the leg that was injured.

582
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,780
What's wrong?

583
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,810
It hurts.

584
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,860
It hurts?

585
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,290
That shouldn't be the case.

586
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:37,830
The wound should have healed by now.

587
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,540
Can I take a look?

588
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,430
Does it hurt when I touch it like this?

589
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,020
It should be fine.

590
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,500
Don't be afraid. Let's try again.

591
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,460
Is that okay?

592
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,920
Xixi, what's wrong?

593
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,790
Ms. Qin, it hurts!

594
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:03,530
It hurts.

595
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,580
I'll call Mr. Xing right away.

596
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,820
Don't worry.

Dr. Xing,

602
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:26,750
say something, please.

603
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,310
What's going on?

00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,310
Xixi's rehabilitation plan

605
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:32,240
may need to be readjusted.

606
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,910
Is there something wrong with Xixi's leg?

607
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,950
The wound on her leg has healed well.

608
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,480
And all the results

609
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,540
show no problems.

610
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:40,680
That's impossible.

611
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,880
She was just crying from pain.

612
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,750
I know.

613
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,840
Apart from physical factors,

614
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,210
psychological factors can also

615
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,500
lead to real pain in the body,

616
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,230
creating a pain disorder.

617
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,260
Based on the current situation,

618
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,840
it's very likely caused by psychological factors.

619
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,240

helping to calm her down.

How is she?

627
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:41,460
There are two aspects.

628
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,350
On one hand,

629
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,240
she experienced a serious trauma;

630
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,590
her body has endured great pain

631
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,720
and has a strong memory of it.

632
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,300
On the other hand, it's her mindset.

633
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,860
Xixi mentioned she loves running marathons.

634
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:55,780
When she was younger, she promised her dad

635
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,380
they would participate

636
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,580

But now...

638

This is the painting Xixi just drew.

639
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,240
It's a dream she often has.

640
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,730
The girl in the drawing represents herself.

In a dark basement,

642
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,660
she's trapped,

Take Xixi for example,

00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,350
she's very afraid

654
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:35,850
her leg won't heal,

655
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,170
that she won't be able to run,

656
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,000
and thus can't fulfill her promise

657
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,220

he'd run the marathon with me.

they are prone to losing confidence in the future,

748
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,790
No need, no need. Fei has arranged everything.

749
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,720
You and Uncle can stay in this room.

750

Why don't you take a rest for now?

765

I'll be on my way.

Dr. Xing, you're here.

You've brought so many things.

I'll go tell the director.

He'll be so happy to know you're here.

Alright. Thank you, Dr. Xing.

It's nothing. Don't mention it.

It's been a while since you've been here.

do you believe in serendipity?

826
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,970
Serendipity?

827
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,920
I met someone I thought I'd never cross paths with again.

828
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,210
I had a wonderfully

00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,260

I look forward to something every day

but there's a bit of nervousness too.

833
00:35:58,870 --> 00:35:59,980
It's like

Before opening it, you can't wait

to find out what flavor it is.

There's no doctor at home. Come back quickly.

It's okay.

After taking the medicine,

her fever has gone down.

Of course.

Now, sleep.

Your place is quite inconvenient.

00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,920
After I gave Xixi her medicine,

859
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,070
I couldn't even find a piece of candy for her.

860
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,380
I'm the only one taking care of her,

861
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,640
and it's not easy to go out and buy things.

862
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:11,410
Then why don't you just order it online?

863
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:15,130
Xixi's leg makes it hard for her to move.

864
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,850

Why don't you sleep here?

880
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,230
Don't get the wrong idea.

881
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,400
It's because Xixi has trouble moving,

882
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,630
and it's hard for me to get her

883
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,190

884
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:00,180

00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,250
If tomorrow doesn't work, then the day after.

934
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,510
Or the day after that, if you're too busy.

935
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:35,500
If you really can't make it, then that's okay.

936
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,970
I understand.

937
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,870
It's okay, it's okay.

938
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:42,570
Then let's make it 7 PM tomorrow.

939
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,140
7 PM tomorrow?

940
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,010
7 PM tomorrow sounds good.

941
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:49,270
Xiaofei, it's settled then.

942
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,800
Tomorrow at 7 PM,

943
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:52,230
we'll meet at home.

944
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,000
Okay, goodbye.

945
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:06,550
One, two, one, two, one, two, one two.

946
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:08,710
One, two, three, four, retreat, one, two, three, four, five.

947
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:10,320
One, two, three, four, five.

948
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,630
One, two, three, four, five.

949
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:13,880
Sorry, sorry!

950
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,280
It's okay, it's okay.

951
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:14,670
Are you alright?

952
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:15,510
I'm fine.

953
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,700
Let's go again, then.

954
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,320
Okay, sure.

955
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:17,920
One.

956
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:19,070
Two.

957
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,230
One-two, one-two.

958
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:22,970
One, two, three, four, five.

959
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,790
One, two, three, four, five.

960
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,080
One, two, three, four, five.

961
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,110
How was that?

962
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:40,290
Shen, sorry to trouble you,

963
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:42,340
calling you out so late to spar with me.

964
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,970
I came here for you today.

965
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:45,350
You don't need to be so polite

966
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:47,090
given our relationship.

967
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,800
What's our relationship?

968
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:50,960
Right, I forgot.

969
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,840
You're my agent,

970
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,880
my boss.

971
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,550
I should respectfully address you as

972
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,600
Mr. Chen.

973
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:00,300
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

974
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,700
Mocking me on purpose.

975
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,550
Come on.

976
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:05,840
You're in high spirits tonight.

977
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,840
But I still think your punches lack power.

978
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,760
You can push a little harder.

979
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,280
Come on, give it your all.

980
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:10,930
One.

981
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,870
One.

982
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:12,460
Two.

983
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:13,230
Two.

984
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:14,920
One-two, one-two.

985
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,180
One, two, three, four.

986
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,150
Faster, one, two, three, four, five.

987
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:18,750
One, two, three, four, five.

988
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:20,810
One, two, three, four, five.

989
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,720
Very good, again.

990
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:25,850
Wait a moment.

991
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:29,560
I heard from Mei that you want me to arrange a meeting for you.

992
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,000
Who's on the guest list?

993
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:32,630
Sounds like a big deal.

994
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:33,380
Qin Fei.

995
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:34,450
Qin Fei?

996
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:35,920
Chen Shen!
