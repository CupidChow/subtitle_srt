It's because the nurses mention her every day,

00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,230
saying that recently

8
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,710
she's been dating a very popular male celebrity.

9
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,110

When you liked me,

19
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,830
I was really too insecure.

20
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,050
So ever since we broke up,

21
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,050
I've been regretting every second.

22
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,360
I was wrong.

23
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,420
Can you help me?

24
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,270

Qin Fei has a fierce determination.

This interpretation is much better than the previous one where she was crying.

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,640
This interpretation is excellent.

31
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,430

32
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,040

38
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,560

[Okay, I got it. What are you doing?]
[I heard that there's a music fountain in Xicheng City Park which is very beautiful. Go and see it when you have time]

189
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,080
No one's love is perfect.
[Okay, I got it. What are you doing?]
[I heard that there's a music fountain in Xicheng City Park which is very beautiful. Go and see it when you have time]

190
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:57,030
No one's love is perfect.

191
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:01,200
Because of each other, our hearts become...

192
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
Forget it.

193
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,680
There's only one left.

194
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:07,040
I'll save it for later.

195
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:14,120
My dearest, the one I care for,

196
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,720
for whom are you keeping your innocence?

197
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,480
In smiles and tears, we learn to be grateful.

198
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,440
You're lying.

199
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,070
The music fountain in the city park

200
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,520
is a total scam.

201
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,450
It's bare.

202
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,810
What's there to see?

203
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,380
They are also brave people.

204
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,790
Be brave to chase

205
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:39,940
and seize fleeting opportunities.

206
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:39,980
[Yang's Restaurant]
and seize fleeting opportunities.

207
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,330
[Yang's Restaurant]

208
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,510
There's also a Yang's Restaurant here?

209
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:47,480
Ma'am,

210
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,120
your dishes are all served. Please enjoy.

211
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,790
Thank you.

212
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,870
-Welcome!
-Hello.

213
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:56,580
Dr. Xing,

214
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,990
this is a very distinctive little restaurant

215
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,870
near our hospital.

216
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,820
The food here is really delicious.

217
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,930
It's Xicheng cuisine.

218
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,460
You'll know once you eat it.

219
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,390
Let's go inside.

220
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,380
I see.

221
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,310
Let's sit here.

222
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,510
How about we sit over there?

223
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,170
I think it might be a bit more spacious.

224
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:10,800
-Alright.
-Please take seats.

225
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,400
-Okay. Sit down.
-It's okay.

226
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,150
Please.

227
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,030
Thank you.

228
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,620
-Let's all take our seats.
-Have a seat, Director.

229
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,910
Why didn't you tell me you were here in Xicheng?

230
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,160
Dr. Xing, your speech today

231
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,370
was truly brilliant.

232
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:31,980
Thank you.

233
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,890
I wanted to give you a surprise.

234
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,810
Have you finished filming?

235
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,630
The rehabilitation center. How about that?

236
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,490
Are you interested in joining us?

237
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:39,690
Well, um, it's...

238
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,680
Here's the thing, Director.

239
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,580
Dr. Xing is a treasure to our hospital.

240
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,850
We definitely won't let him go.

241
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:45,800
Oh, right.

242
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,570
Dr. Xing,

243
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,960
do you have a girlfriend?

244
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,830
I have a niece,

245
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,580
and I'll introduce you to her later.

246
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,940
She's also a doctor,

247
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,100
a thoracic surgeon.

248
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,020
What a coincidence!

249
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,790
Dr. Xing was also a thoracic surgeon before.

250
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,720
Is that so?

251
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,600
Dr. Xing,

252
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,740
my niece

253
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,750
is very beautiful.

254
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,440
I'll give you her WeChat contact.

255
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,720
You young people can talk.

256
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,200
No need, Director.

257
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,030
-Actually, I…
-Excuse me.

258
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:12,830
Check please.

259
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,990
Okay.

260
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,430
Director,

261
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:22,090
here's the thing.

262
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:22,730
Well...

263
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,080
I just received a notification

264
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,360
that there's an online consultation at the hospital.

265
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,530
Yu Zhecheng and I need to go back now.

266
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,460
I'm sorry about this.

267
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,270
Really?

268
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,360
Coffee just notified me. Let's go.

269
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:31,950
Oh, okay.

270
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:32,910
-Sorry.
-What a coincidence.

271
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:33,910
We have to leave now.

272
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,630
But we haven't eaten yet.

273
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,550
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.

274
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,790
You haven't added her on WeChat yet.

275
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,590
I'll definitely do it next time.

276
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,840
Come on. It's...

277
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,080
We haven't got to eat, and they have already left.

278
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,000
We haven't got to eat.

279
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Come on, let's...

280
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:45,930
Xiaofei.

281
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,550
I...

282
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,360
Good luck, bro.

283
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,150
I'll go and call Coffee.

284
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,150
Get lost.

285
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,810
I didn't add her on WeChat just now.

286
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,490
Really.

287
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,420
You're not angry?

288
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,690
I was so scared. I thought you were angry.

289
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,190
Who said I'm not angry?

290
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,010
I have work tomorrow.

291
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,040
If I stay up late, my face will swell.

292
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,010
Now, at most,

293
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,930
you have one hour to make me feel better.

294
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:09,860
Go.

295
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,640
Come with me.

296
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,120
Why did you bring me here?

297
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,270
Come.

298
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,680
Wait for me a second, okay?

299
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:22,780
Just a second.

300
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,100
Excuse me.

301
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:25,640
Well,

302
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,610
could you play a song called

303
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,920
"You're the One?" Please.

304
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,440
Sure.

305
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,120
-Thank you.
-Okay.

306
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,420
May I borrow this?

307
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,130
-Just pull it out.
-Okay.

308
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,000
Thanks.

309
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,550
The silence of night,

310
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,610
the breath of rain.

311
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:49,090
They became pleasant

312
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,360
because of you.

313
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:55,370
I never told you

314
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,640
how much I missed you.

315
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:06,370
When I opened my mouth, I couldn't say anything.

316
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,810
You, jade-hued

317
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,160
and radiant bright.

318
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,640
You, ashen-gray

319
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:19,240
with gaze downcast.

320
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,980
Amid all the shadows,

321
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:27,300
you're the only one I see.

322
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,440
I've never told you.

323
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,960
I've never been so firm

324
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,160
that you're the one.

325
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,390
Longing for you to become the air I breathe.

326
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,930
Thinking of you

327
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,790
might give me the courage

328
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,410
to softly say that I miss you.

329
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,540
You're the one.

330
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,680
I want to hear you softly call my name.

331
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,260
I want to hold you,

332
00:17:55,290 --> 00:18:01,080
feeling my heartbeat sync with yours.

333
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,820
When I think of you,

334
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,970
I'm sure.

335
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,450
Qin Xiaofei,

336
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,690
I'm very happy to see you tonight.

337
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,520
How about you?

338
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,480
I'm also very happy

339
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:18,720
to see you tonight.

340
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,600
♫You're the one♫
to see you tonight.

341
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,560

345

Fei, where have you been?
♫When I think of you, I'm sure♫

346
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,460
♫When I think of you, I'm sure♫

347
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,610
Fei, have you had dinner?

348
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,350
Fei, it's too late.

349
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,350
It's not safe to be alone.

350
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,950
I'm coming to pick you up now.

351
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,220
Fei!

352
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,290
Why are you here?

353
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,310
What?

354
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,540
Am I not welcome here?

355
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,920
Is there someone hiding in your room?

356
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,400
You hit me too hard.

357
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,720
Keep pretending.

358
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,190
I thought it was Fei.

359
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,760
She hasn't replied to my messages for a long time.

360
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,650
Don't worry.

361
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,320
She's with Xing Zhizhi.

362
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,200
That won't do.

363
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:20,960
It's already so late.

364
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,650
She won't look good on camera tomorrow if she doesn't rest now.

365
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,210
Don't disturb them.

366
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:25,740
Well,

367
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,110
you haven't seen your boyfriend for so long,

368
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,370
and that's your reaction?

369
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,770
I'm going to make a scene.

370
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,350
Go ahead.

371
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,640
Do it.

372
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,220
Watch how I'll deal with you.

373
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,380
Wei.

374
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,460
We haven't seen each other for years.

375
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,470
Long time no see.

376
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,410
It has been so many years.

377
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,540
Come on in.

378
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:50,640
Mrs. Liu?

379
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,070
Don't call her that.

380
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,090
Got it, got it.

381
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,210
Can't say it, right?

382
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:56,940
I get it.

383
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,220
Liu always talks about you.

384
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,330
Finally, I get to meet you in person today.

385
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,200
Hello.

386
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,040
Hello.

387
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,790
What's your relationship with Liu Yanze?

388
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,160
He never mentioned it?

389
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,320
I served in the same unit as Liu.

390
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,570
He really looked after me.

391
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:11,540
After we were discharged,

392
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,720
I returned to Xicheng.

393
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,720
Now, I'm in charge of security at this hotel.

394
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,050
You can just call me Wei.

395
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:16,840
Alright.

396
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,300
Well, um...

397
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,930
can I take a picture with her?

398
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,470
My wife is a huge fan of hers.

399
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,550
Did I ask you to come here for sightseeing?

400
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,020
Get down to business.

401
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,090
Sure, let's take a photo. No problem.

402
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,330
You're so kind.

403
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,210
Here, Mrs. Liu.

404
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,020
Let's take one more.

405
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,380
That's enough.

406
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,610
Get down to business.

407
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,400
Where's that camera?

408
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,070
It was found in the ornament across from the bedroom.

409
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,670
It wasn't there when we checked in the morning.

410
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,680
So, it was aimed at Mrs. Liu.

411
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,180
Have you called the police?

412
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,840
I don't think it's necessary.

413
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,750
I don't want my personal matters

414
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,510
to cause panic within the crew

415
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,860
and affect the filming.

416
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:09,930
Wei,

417
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,380
how about this?

418
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,690
Could you strengthen

419
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,110
the hotel's security a little bit?

420
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:14,740
And also,

421
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,930
could you take me

422
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,820
to check the hotel surveillance?

423
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,680
I can handle

424
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,020
the security part.

425
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:23,110
However, if you

426
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,350
don't want to call the police,

427
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,620
checking the surveillance footage might be a bit tricky.

428
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,220
It's okay. I understand.

429
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,450
But please

430
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,290
keep this

431
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,420
confidential.

432
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:32,920
Alright.

433
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,950
I don't want it to blow up

434
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,720
and cause unnecessary trouble.

435
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,070
Don't worry about that.

436
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,130
I can keep a secret.

437
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:38,920
Well,

438
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,510
if it's convenient for you later,

439
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,380
I'd like to go over your upcoming schedule with you.

440
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,930
The follow-up security arrangements need...

441
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:45,490
Come on.

442
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,910
You can go over it with me.

443
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:47,910
She needs to rest.

444
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,080
Wei.

445
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:51,850
Mrs. Liu.

446
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,540
If it's convenient, could I have a word with you?

447
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,850
Just the two of us.

448
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,110
Thank you so much for today.

449
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,200
We called you up here so late.

450
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,520
What are you talking about?

451
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,410
Mrs. Liu,

452
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,550
the matters concerning you and Liu

453
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,030
are like my own.

454
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,830
I can see you two have a really good relationship.

455
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,310
He doesn't talk much usually

456
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,030
and there are many things he didn't tell me

457
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,130
So, have you two been

458
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,320
in touch all this time?

459
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,560
Of course.

460
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,860
My friendship with Liu

461
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:23,690
is rock solid.

462
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,540
From the time we enlisted to when we were discharged,

463
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,860
we never lost contact.

464
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,910
Is that so?

465
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,180
Well, he...

466
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,880
He told me about some mission he participated in five years ago.

467
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,080
You weren't with him?

468
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:35,680
Mrs. Liu,

469
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,420
you overestimated me.

470
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:38,510
I wanted to join that mission,

471
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,920
but my performance

472
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:40,980
wasn't up to par.

473
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,140
Back then,

474
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,780
Liu suddenly disappeared.

475
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,320
We couldn't reach him no matter what we tried.

476
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,360
And we weren't allowed to ask.

477
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,480
We just guessed

478
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,350
that he must have gone

479
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,410
on some kind of special mission.

480
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,490
That's what he told me too.

481
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,520
But when I asked him about it later,

482
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,200
he was

483
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:01,360
all mysterious and wouldn't tell me anything.

484
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,570
Do you know what the mission was?

485
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:04,850
No, I don't.

486
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:07,770
But these kinds of special missions

487
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,460
are usually quite dangerous.

488
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,500
Liu is really capable.

489
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,070
He certainly is.

490
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,170
Wei,

491
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:22,560
I...

492
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,810
have one more question,

493
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:26,090
and I hope you can answer me honestly.

494
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,170
Mrs. Liu, go ahead.

495
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,460
How many Mrs. Lius

496
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,230
do you know?

497
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,180
Well,

498
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:50,470
are you hungry? Do you want to grab some late-night snacks?

499
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,390
Inviting an actress to have late-night snacks—

500
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,510
what are you up to?

501
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,000
It's because you're feeling down today,

502
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,510
and you didn't tell me why.

503
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,530
Today,

504
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,430
I had 18 NGs in one scene.

505
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:08,360
Don't look at me like that.

506
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,070
I passed the scene eventually.

507
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,680
The director even praised me,

508
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,540
and my co-actor acknowledged me.

509
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,140
Isn't that a good thing?

510
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,930
Then why aren't you happy?

511
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,160
I don't know.

512
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,800
I just don't feel as happy as I imagined.

513
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,890
Coffee and Xiaoxiao were really happy for me,

514
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,410
saying I broke through my limits.

515
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,060
But honestly, I feel really exhausted.

516
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,290
To get into character,

517
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,240
I haven't dared to check

518
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,440
the WeChat messages you've sent me lately.

519
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,440
I figured as much.

520
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,400
It's really hard for me.

521
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,070
Like Xiaoxiao

522
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,180
and Hao Jun—

523
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,610
they can cry when they need to cry

524
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,500
and laugh when they need to laugh.

525
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,360
But I feel like

526
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,530
I have no talent at all.

527
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,400
In their eyes, they saw me break through my limits.

528
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,090
But I know for myself

529
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,870
that this is already my limit in acting.

530
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,060
Xiaofei.

531
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,160
Acting is just a job.

532
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,330
Jobs are jobs, and dreams are dreams.

533
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,450
If it's just a job,

534
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,540
it's okay to slack off occasionally.

535
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:19,560
What you said is absolutely not true.

536
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,430
Because I know you.

537
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,950
I know that even if you were told to slack off, you wouldn't.

538
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,280
But I think

539
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,260
as long as you don't let yourself down,

540
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,120
that's enough.

541
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,070
Right?

542
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,630
Don't worry.

543
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,810
Actually, I'm already feeling better.

544
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,040
Really?

545
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,180
Really.

546
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,840
I was in a really bad mood at first,

547
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,610
but unexpectedly seeing Yang's Restaurant

548
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:41,170
lifted my mood by 10 points.

549
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,110
Seeing you unexpectedly

550
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:44,110
lifted it by 80 points.

551
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:46,280
You tried to cheer me up and sang for me,

552
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,440
so now my mood is already at 100 points.

553
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,970
If you hadn't shown up today,

554
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,070
I definitely wouldn't sleep well tonight.

555
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:55,200
If I don't sleep well, I can't act well.

556
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:57,270
And if I don't act well, the director will scold me.

557
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,980
So, your appearance was really helpful.

558
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,500
You're my placebo.

559
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,980
A placebo in medical terms

560
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:07,510
means it has no real effect.

561
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,110
That's exactly what I meant.

562
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,680
In that case,

563
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:13,790
I'll have to try harder.

564
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,390
Let's go. I'll send you back.

565
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,700
Oh, by the way,

566
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,200
you told me that

567
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,330
to perform love scenes, you need to get into character.

568
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,610
What does that mean?

569
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:28,460
What's the name of the actor you act with?

570
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,880
Hao Jun, right?

571
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,030
What's the situation between you two?

572
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:32,910
Oh,

573
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,520
he added me on WeChat today

574
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,180
and said he's available anytime.

575
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,700
What does that mean?

576
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,750
It means...

577
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,090
to go over the script.

578
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,290
You didn't see the gossip about Hao Jun and me

579
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:47,620
and believe it, did you?

580
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,640
No.

581
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,720
How could I possibly believe gossip?

582
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,690
You don't suspect us at all?

583
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:54,340
No.

584
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,250
You're not the slightest bit jealous?

585
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,340
No.

586
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:00,690
No?

587
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,430
It sounds a bit unpleasant.

588
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,590
Just a little.

589
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:07,310
Just a little?

590
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,150
Just a little.

591
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,290
Only a tiny bit.

592
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,750
Okay, a tiny bit is fine for me.

593
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:16,570
I'm really unhappy.

594
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,270
Why?

595
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,720
Why is he "available anytime"?

596
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,070
What do you mean?

597
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,350
He was just acknowledging me.

598
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,720
What are you thinking?

599
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:27,140
Just acknowledgment? Does acknowledgment require being available anytime?

600
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:38,770
Don't rub your eyes.

601
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:39,830
It's not hygienic.

602
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:42,090
Here.

603
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,300
Take this eye drop back

604
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,980
and use it when your eyes feel uncomfortable.

605
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,680
Don't always play with your phone before bed.

606
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,790
Go to sleep early.

607
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,200
Got it, Dad.

608
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,320
I've only said a few words,

609
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:56,150
and you're already complaining that I'm nagging.

610
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,110
Chubby.

611
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,020
I'm almost out of my sesame balls.

612
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,150
What should I do?

613
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,180
I've already made some.

614
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,040
Just have Coffee come and pick them up.

615
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,490
That's my boyfriend.

616
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,140
How long are you staying here?

617
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,010
A week.

618
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,220
Too bad I have scenes to shoot lately.

619
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,640
It's okay.

620
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,060
I'm here for meetings anyway.

621
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,340
Is that so?

622
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,400
I was thinking you could come visit the set

623
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,920
when you're not busy.

624
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,140
You want me to come?

625
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,770
After the meeting tomorrow morning,

626
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:33,630
I should be free in the afternoon.

627
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,470
Filming on set can be really boring.

628
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,190
I'm not going there to watch the filming.

629
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:43,750
Well,

630
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:46,580
if someone on the set asks me

631
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:49,470
what my relationship with you is, what should I say?

632
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,050
Your private doctor?

633
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,260
Your assistant?

634
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,460
My reserve family member.

635
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,850
That's more like it.

636
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,000
What's wrong?

637
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,500
Just say it.

638
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,970
You asked me to say it.

639
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,790
Liu, Mrs. Liu is such a great girl.

640
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,520
How could you bring yourself to break up with her?

641
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,990
What do you know? Stop stirring the pot.

642
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,030
I just know she has a good heart

643
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,440
and values relationships.

644
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,590
Don't think that just because your wife is great,

645
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:49,750
you can take her for granted.

646
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,200
Do you understand?

647
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,400
Are you done talking?

648
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,070
Let's get to business.

649
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:53,960
About the surveillance,

650
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,950
I'll handle it myself.

651
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,490
I'll let you know if there is any progress.

652
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:58,420
You should just focus on yourself.

653
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:00,110
Don't take advantage of the fact that she likes you

654
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:00,960
to act willfully

655
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,850
and bully her.

656
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,890
I'm leaving.

657
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,990
What a coincidence.

658
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:15,400
Why are you here?

659
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,790
I'm bringing Qin Fei back.

660
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,720
And you?

661
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,850
I...

662
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,970
Meeting by chance is better than making an appointment. Wanna grab a drink tonight?

663
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:27,580
No.

664
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,690
I have work today.

665
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:30,730
Work?

666
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,400
Is it the kind that requires close protection?

667
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,500
I was wondering why you were being all mysterious,

668
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,250
telling me you were on a business trip without saying where.

669
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,410
I thought you don't take private bodyguard jobs.

670
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,350
Have you changed your mind?

671
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,530
After all these years of persisting,

672
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:45,260
you still can't move on, right?

673
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,140
This is work.

674
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,310
Do you understand?

675
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,150
Work.

676
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,310
Besides,

677
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,070
there's a man more suitable

678
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,800
than me by her side now.

679
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,020
It should be this way.

680
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,240
It should be this way?

681
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,170
You can really stand to see someone by her side

682
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:02,890
and not feel uncomfortable

683
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,050
or regretful at all?

684
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,010
I'm not like you.

685
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,780
Why did you come all the way to Xicheng

686
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,670
in the middle of your busy schedule?

687
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:10,400
Stalking?

688
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:11,570
My...

689
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:14,820
My current role is a family member.

690
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,570
You should watch and learn.

691
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,650
A family member?

692
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,880
My boss is here to see me.

693
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,280
If you don't have anything else, leave now.

694
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,100
I don't want to see you when I'm back.

695
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:24,930
Fine.

696
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,460
What?

697
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,660
Have you changed your mind?

698
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:58,800
I can't run anymore.

699
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,710
Who said we'd run six kilometers today?

700
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,590
Come on, let's go.

701
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,480
Don't slack off.

702
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,640
I don't want to slack off, but...

703
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,670
What?

704
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,370
How about you carry me on your back while running?

705
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,260
No way.

706
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,270
Liu Yanze.

707
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,480
Come on, my princess.

708
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,600
Let's go!

709
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,200
I talked a lot with Wei today.

710
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,000
Aren't you curious about

711
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,930
what we talked about, Captain Liu?

712
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,510
Wei heard about our breakup

713
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,850
and said a lot of good things about you.

714
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,110
He said

715
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,350
you must have made that choice

716
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,880
because you were about to go on a mission,

717
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,220
afraid it would be dangerous,

718
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,070
and you might not come back,

719
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,800
and didn't want to hold me back.

720
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:03,620
Is that true?

721
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,190
Miss Luo,

722
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,810
chatting while running

723
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,140
can easily affect your workout results.

724
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:15,210
Liu Yanze, I'm really curious.

725
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:15,830
In your eyes,

726
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,480
what kind of person am I?

727
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,330
Am I short-sighted,

728
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,690
someone who can only share good times but not the tough ones?

729
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:23,810
Or am I

730
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:25,520
someone with low endurance

731
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:28,280
who doesn't deserve to understand your aspirations and ideals?

732
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,600
Don't overthink it.

733
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:30,490
You're great.

734
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,780
But I've already started overthinking.

735
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,140
I'm even thinking

736
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,600
that if I had spent a little more time

737
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:38,290
understanding your thoughts

738
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,000
and considered you more back then,

739
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
maybe we wouldn't have ended up

740
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,200
like this today.

741
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,880
Back then,

742
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,900
it was my fault.

743
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:04,690
Liu Yanze,

744
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,630
You haven't moved on,

745
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,050
have you?

746
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,630
I haven't.

747
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,580
The reason I came to your company

748
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:27,240
and kept pushing for you to be my bodyguard

749
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,430
was that I wanted to keep you by my side.

750
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,480
And when I talked about getting married before,

751
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,980
I wasn't joking.

752
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:45,520
Liu Yanze,

753
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:49,870
if you still have a place for me in your heart,

754
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,470
even if it's just a small one,

755
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,410
think about

756
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,260
us again.

757
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,170
Xiaoxiao,

758
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,590
how can you be so bold?

759
00:35:58,610 --> 00:35:59,770
You know someone is watching you,

760
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:01,830
yet you still went out for night runs?

761
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,860
Why didn't you stop her?

762
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,740
Hurry up and close the door.

763
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,170
How did you get in?

764
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:08,900
I had Mei find the spare card key for me.

765
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,570
Come, sit down.

766
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:10,840
Come on. Why are you here again?

767
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,430
Didn't you just go to the set a couple of days ago?

768
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:14,120
Don't you have anything to do at the company?

769
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,550
How can you even say that?

770
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,560
You were being monitored and secretly filmed,

771
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,150
and you hid such a big thing from me?

772
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,960
If it weren't for Captain Liu telling me himself,

773
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,570
I would still be in the dark like a fool,

774
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:24,030
thinking everything was fine for you on set.

775
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,970
Why do you tell him everything?

776
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,460
Mr. Chen

777
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:29,920
is the legal representative of the client company for this project.

778
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,980
According to the contract terms,

779
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,310
he has the right to know.

780
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,410
Exactly.

781
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,570
Luckily, Captain Liu told me.

782
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,550
As soon as I finished handling the matters over at Huhai,

783
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:38,110
I rushed over here.

784
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,660
Xiaoxiao,

785
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,550
I know you're thinking of the crew

786
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,200
and don't want to trouble others.

787
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,890
But it's different this time.

788
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:47,410
This time, just listen to me.

789
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:48,870
Let's call the police now.

790
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,020
Sit down first.

791
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,400
-Xiaoxiao.
-Sit down.

792
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,490
Drink.

793
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:03,230
I don't like water.

794
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:03,960
Drink.

795
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,240
Drink and calm down.

796
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,400
You're really something.

797
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,190
That camera has been there for more than just a day or two.

798
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,590
Do you really have to be this scared?

799
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,960
Captain Liu said

800
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,700
that this matter isn't that simple.

801
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,860
You believe him but not me?

802
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,880
I believe you.

803
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:20,310
But I don't trust those bad people outside.

804
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,020
Xiaoxiao,

805
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:24,680
if something really happens to you,

806
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,500
I won't be able to live.

807
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,150
You should live.

808
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:26,920
Aren't you doing just fine?

809
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,630
Why won't you live?

810
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,160
Mr. Chen,

811
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,150
Miss Luo,

812
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,220
you two talk.

813
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,170
Call me anytime.

814
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,160
Thank you, Captain Liu.

815
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:39,300
Xiaoxiao,

816
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,760
I think we should be cautious

817
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,240
about this matter.

818
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,160
Xiaoxiao.

819
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,230
Xiaoxiao?

820
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:13,850
This one...

821
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,710
No, this one.

822
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:25,250
This one, this one.

823
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,220
It should be put here.

824
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,100
You childish fool,

825
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:37,320
you think this thing can stump me?

826
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:38,970
When you get here,

827
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I'll show you how to put it together.

828
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:44,510
How should I follow the steps

829
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,370
I just put together to restore it?

830
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:50,240
I'll leave it like this for now.

831
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,490
Fei,

832
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,460
the flyleaf.

833
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,920
When Xing Zhizhi arrives later,

834
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,450
don't forget to pick him up.

835
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,920
It's today?

836
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,730
On today's call sheet, they added...

837
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,090
a kissing scene.

838
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,790
A kissing scene?

839
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,040
What?

840
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,070
Let me take a look.

841
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,210
And it's you forcefully kissing Hao Jun.

842
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:18,080
[Kiss Hao Jun forcefully]
And it's you forcefully kissing Hao Jun.

843
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:18,510
And it's you forcefully kissing Hao Jun.

844
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:22,950
Does this coordinator have a grudge against me?

845
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,750
No worries, I'll call him now

846
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,310
and tell him not to come.

847
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:27,320
Where's...

848
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,780
Where's his phone number?

849
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,790
Wang Hui,

850
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,120
do you love me?

851
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,870
Wang Hui,

852
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:38,970
do you love me?

853
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:39,760
Jun,

854
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,720
do you have a crush on Qin Fei this time?

855
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,520
I just need to rehearse with her.

856
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:47,630
Why are you wearing perfume for rehearsal?

857
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,380
We have been in the crew for so long.

858
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,250
Have you seen Qin Fei behave like what they say online?

859
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,770
I don't think so.

860
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:54,560
How is it?

861
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,880
He's not answering my calls.

862
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,210
But you still can't do that.

863
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:59,640
We know there's no problem with Qin Fei,

864
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,110
but if you're going to be with her,

865
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,900
it'll cause chaos.

866
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:03,960
I'm an actor.

867
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,540
I make a living by acting.

868
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:07,550
Those who like me are fans of my work.

869
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:10,400
If dating Qin Fei would make them...

870
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,960
Is this guy from the crew?

871
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,430
I haven't seen him before.

872
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,060
This guy wouldn't be...

873
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,580
a stalker, would he?

874
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,180
These people are really too much.

875
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,420
They're everywhere.

876
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:31,530
Jun, Jun, Jun.

877
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:32,670
Don't be too impulsive.

878
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,650
What's there to be afraid of?

879
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:35,520
Watch how I'll deal with him.

880
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,080
Go and call security first.

881
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,480
Who are you looking for?

882
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,930
Why are you standing there?

883
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:44,490
It's none of your business.

884
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,500
This is a film set; outsiders aren't allowed in.

885
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,760
How did you get in here?

886
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,030
How did you know Qin Fei's room number?

887
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,470
You paparazzis

888
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,560
are getting more and more brazen,

889
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,960
always chasing and stalking, taking pictures everywhere.

890
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,770
Hao Jun?

891
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,440
Are you hiding a camera in your hand?

892
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,370
-Give it to me.
-What are you doing?

893
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:03,340
What are you doing?

894
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,540
I'm Qin Fei's friend.

895
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,390
If you're her friend,

896
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:06,420
then I'm her boyfriend.

897
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,420
Xing Zhizhi?

898
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,700
Qin Fei, don't be afraid.

899
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,080
I've controlled the situation.

900
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,410
Security will be here soon.

901
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:17,850
Why did you call security? You misunderstood.

902
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,290
Let go. Let go.

903
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,350
I didn't misunderstand.

904
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,090
Just now,

905
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,320
I saw him outside your door with a creepy smile,

906
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,260
acting sneaky,

907
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:28,400
looking like a pervert and a stalker.

908
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:30,030
I don't care about other crews,

909
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:30,970
but the crew I'm in

910
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:32,560
must protect the artists' privacy.

911
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,620
I will not tolerate this kind of behavior.

912
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,870
Thank you.

913
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:38,110
I really know him. He's my friend.

914
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,140
Yes.

915
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,480
He's Dr. Xing.

916
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,020
He's a friend of our Fei.

917
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:43,950
A friend?

918
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,210
What kind of friend?

919
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,140
What's your relationship?

920
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,140
He is my...

921
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,600
I'm her physical therapist.

922
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,780
She got injured during filming yesterday,

923
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,800
and I came here specifically to help her with rehabilitation.

924
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,470
I'm Xing Zhizhi from the rehabilitation department of Hexi Hospital.

925
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:09,280
A doctor?

926
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,230
A physical therapist?

927
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,670
What? Don't I look like one?

928
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,280
Yes.

929
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,460
Fei hurt her waist,

930
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,670
but she doesn't want to tell the crew.

931
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:17,230
So she asked Dr. Xing to come over

932
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,480
and help her with treatment.

933
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,410
So do you have any other questions?

934
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:23,170
Then it was a misunderstanding. I'm sorry.

935
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,240
I was just too worried about Qin Fei.

936
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,710
Please take good care of her.

937
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:30,580
It's no trouble.

938
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,600
Did you twist your wrist?

939
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:46,150
Does it hurt?

940
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,700
No.

941
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:53,290
Are you angry?

942
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,360
Don't be angry. I'm sorry.

943
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,260
He likes you.

944
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,520
Xing Zhizhi,

945
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:02,230
do you have to be jealous of him?

946
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:03,280
He doesn't even like me.

947
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,190
He hasn't been nice to me at all.

948
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,110
I'm sure he likes you.

949
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:06,510
-He really hasn't…
-Fei.

950
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,630
The lunch boxes are here. Eat some.

951
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,000
I'm going to grab a bite.

952
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:17,250
What?

953
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,560
Fei, he has a conflict with Hao Jun now.

954
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:22,880
The first scene this afternoon

955
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,880
is the kissing scene between you and Hao Jun.

956
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,480
What... what should we do?

957
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,360
What should we do?

958
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:29,210
What should we do?
