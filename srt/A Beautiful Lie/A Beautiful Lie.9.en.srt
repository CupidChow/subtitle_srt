You two are being way too dramatic.

00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,390
Is this necessary?

5
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,080
Director Chen's film.

6
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,690
He's a top-tier director.

7
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,340
It's normal to take it seriously.

8
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,800
I'd gladly trade twenty pounds of my fat

9
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,860
for Fei to get this role.

10
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,610
If you want to lose weight, just say so.

11
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,630
Don't say useless things.

12
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,380
Shut up.

13
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,120
I'm not that eager to be in this film either.

14
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,250
Don't say that.

15
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,380
Do you know how rare this opportunity is?

16
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,590
Hello?

17
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,360
Hello.

18
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,620
Yes, yes, yes.

19
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:39,980
That's right.

20
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,380
Goodbye.

21
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,180
I told you so.

22
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,620
Things don't just fall

23
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,770
into your lap in this world.

24
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,340
The higher the expectations, the greater the disappointment.

25
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,150
I didn't even like that role.

26
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,950
If it weren't for this so-called Director Chen,

27
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,280
I wouldn't have even gone to the audition.

28
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,150
It doesn't matter.

29
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,250
It's just a role, isn't it?

30
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,360

stay with Fei.

36
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:19,630
Okay.

00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:20,970

00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,940
-I didn’t sleep well yesterday.
-Fei.

39
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,010
I want to sleep a bit more.

40
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,090
You should go too.

41
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,240

57
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,240
you look so beautiful.

58
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,720
How did you become so beautiful in just a few days?

59
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,190
You must be aging backwards.

61
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,780
You haven't called me in three months, you know.

62
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,400
Well, I... I think about you every day.

Nothing. What could be wrong?

66
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,780
What else could I be doing besides thinking about you every day?

67
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,980
Is that so?

68
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,940
If you don't tell the truth, I might just believe you.

I knew it.

74
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,660
You only think of me when you need money.

00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,020
That's not true.

00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,000

84
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,800

No, no.

91
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,360
Not yet.

No, no, no.

even our old neighbors

103
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,560
are still thinking about you, little hottie.

104
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,770
They ask, "Is your little Xing married yet?"

What about my money?

109
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,950
Can't we chat for a while? You just want the money, is that it?

110
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,120
Let's chat for five more bucks' worth.

If you're going to be like this,

I'll have to ask Mom and Dad instead.

115
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,560
Honestly.

116
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,270
Alright, I'll transfer it to you in a bit.

117
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,030

-Come.

This is the cake I bought this morning.

00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,930
It's delicious. Try it.

123
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,460
I queued for several hours.

124
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,620
Thank you. What's wrong?

125
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,430
I haven't been to the company for several days.

126
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,760
I've missed you and everyone else so much.

127
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:32,870
Please don't say that.

128
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,330
If you have something to say, say it quickly.

129
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,040
I want to withdraw some money.

130
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,770
I need your personal approval.

131
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,210
What?

132
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,610
Withdraw money?

133
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,630
What for?

134
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,070
I have some personal matters. Don't worry about it.

135
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,660
Qin Fei, what do you mean by that?

136
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,350
Actually, your timing is quite good.

137
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,790
I wanted to talk to you.

138
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,690
Qin Fei, you're a celebrity.

139
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,110
You're an artist.

140
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,180
You're not a gangster.

141
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,990
If you have any problems or needs,

142
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,840
you need to

143
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,420
explain everything clearly to the company.

144
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,280
Right?

145
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,030
I also have my own privacy.

146
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,470
I just need this money.

147
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,250
Could you please sign it for me?

148
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,780
I didn't say I wouldn't sign it.

149
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,050
But as an artist,

150
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,160
shouldn't you first

151
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,380
explain things clearly to the company?

152
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,600
Don't you know how much trouble you've caused?

153
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,370
With Jin Na,

154
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,230
didn't you act on your own?

155
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,090
Why are you bringing up Jin Na's matter again?

156
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,040
Was that my fault?

157
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,060
I wasn't wrongly accused?

158
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,450
How long has it been since then?

159
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,030
Okay, fine. I won't talk about Jin Na.

160
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,390
Let's talk about the present.

161
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,050
About Xixi's photos.

162
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,560
What a great opportunity it was.

163
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,060
You came running back, begging us not to release them.

164
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,820
What were you thinking?

165
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:51,440
I knew what you were going to poop out as soon as you lifted your butt.

166
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,100
What are you muttering about?

167
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,270
See, I knew it!

168
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,440
Watch your language. You're an artist!

169
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,440
What are you saying there?

170
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,670
Alright, Mr. Ren.

171
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,960
I'm sorry.

172
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,720
You know how my mouth is.

173
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,550
It's not like you just met me, right?

174
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,030
I absolutely promise you

175
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,480
I'll behave properly from now on and not attract haters.

176
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,680
Is that okay with you?

177
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,720
Qin Fei, let me tell you.

178
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,800
We can joke around,

179
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,800
but what I'm saying is serious.

180
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,960
Think carefully and use your head.

181
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,990
You are an artist.

182
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,750
Yes, yes, yes.

183
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,270
I was indeed vulgar just now.

184
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,240
I apologize to you.

185
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,360
I'm sorry, Mr. Ren.

186
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,010
Really.

187
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:21,530

Because there was no extra tin left,

494
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,070

495

we're not going to that show anymore.

Yes, he said it was good at first,

Let's go.
♫Make my heart beat faster♫

737
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:47,580
Let's go.

738
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,640
Go!

739
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,960
You know, that tutu actually suits you.

740
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,140
Then I'll wear it for you every day from now on.

741
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,340
Sure, sure!

742
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,980
The car key is inside.

743
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,480
Please come in.

744
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,600
Come on.

745
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,620
Pull your feet in.

746
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,140
This one.

747
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:25,000
Slowly, slowly. Good.

748
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,830
Very good.

749
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,040
Let's go.

750
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,050
Be careful.

751
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,960
I want to try it myself.

752
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,330
Okay.

753
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:37,480
Come.

754
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,360
Take it slow.

755
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:40,470
Be careful.

756
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,490
Very good. That's right. Step firmly.

757
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,450
Correct.

758
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:46,500
You can do it.

759
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,460
You've got this.

760
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,030
Yes.

761
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:51,440
Turn around. Sit down with your bottom first.

762
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,210
Slowly.

763
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,360
Good, that's right.

764
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:56,490
Excellent.

765
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:57,450
Come on.

766
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,730
Right. Move your legs.

767
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:00,850
Bit by bit.

768
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,230
Good.

769
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,760
-Get in the car.
-Okay.

770
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:09,690
Xixi.

771
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,350
You did great today.

772
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,980
Xixi.

773
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,800
I won't be accompanying you to the clinic today.

774
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,500
When you get there, listen to Ms. Qin Fei

775
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,140
and Ms. Ge Wu, okay?

776
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:40,370
No problem.

777
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,390
But Mr. Xing,

778
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,570
you must do this big matter well.

779
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,440
Don’t let Ms. Qin Fei down.

780
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,960
What are you two mumbling about?

781
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,100
What big matter?

782
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:51,430
What are you saying about me?

783
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:52,240
Nothing.

784
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,860
Ms. Qin, let's hurry up.

785
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:55,320
Let's go.

786
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,930
Fine, don't tell me.

787
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,160
Xixi,

788
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,050
tell me.

789
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,600
Is Xing Zhizhi hiding something from me?

790
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,950
You can whisper it to me. I won't tell anyone.

791
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:13,800
Mr. Xing said to focus on driving and not talk.

792
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:16,000
But the car isn't even moving.

793
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,590
You little rascal.

794
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,750
I'm not going to be nice to you anymore.

795
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,460
Hello.

796
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,140
Is this Xinghai Advertising?

797
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:55,310
I'd like to rent your building rotating ad space.

798
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,310
Is that possible?

799
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:59,480
No problem. What content would you like to display?

800
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,880
Celebrity fan-support.

801
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,660
Which celebrity?

802
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,110
Miss Hedgehog.

803
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,760
Ms. Qin Fei.

804
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:17,060
What's the matter?

805
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,070
Poor thing.

806
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,640
Has Ms. Ge Wu finished your treatment?

807
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,400
Come, let me take a look.

808
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:28,960
Good girl.

809
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,760
Xixi is so brave.

810
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,970
How was it?

811
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,530
All the indicators are better than last time.

812
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:40,920
Look at this.

813
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,670
The little girl on the boat

814
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,570
is an accurate reflection of Xixi's inner self.

815
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,430
She knows her current condition isn't good,

816
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,280
but, at least,

817
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,540
she has a goal now.

818
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,260
So, what's the next step?

819
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,090
The next step is rehabilitation therapy.

820
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:58,240
However, rehabilitation therapy has high demands on a child's physiology

821
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,240
and psychology.

822
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,000
I suggest

823
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,710
that Xixi stays here tonight

824
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,590
for a polysomnography test.

825
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:05,970
It will help us better assess

826
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:07,200
her stress levels.

827
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:07,880
Alright.

828
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,860
Then I'll stay to keep her company.

829
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,860
No.

830
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:10,780
No, no.

831
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:12,960
What's wrong?

832
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,700
You don't want to stay here, right?

833
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,110
It's not that.

834
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:17,030
I'll stay as Ms. Ge Wu said,

835
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,100
but you should go home.

836
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,250
Because...

837
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,730
B-Because...

838
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,580
Because of what?

839
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,480
Mr. Xing said he'd wait for you tonight.

840
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,590
He has a surprise.

841
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,260
Alright,

842
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,520
you should hurry back.

843
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,750
I can take care of Xixi.

844
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:37,660
Don't worry.

845
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,330
Explain yourself clearly.

846
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:40,960
Ms. Ge Wu, I want to draw more.

847
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,110
Let's go draw then.

848
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,110
We're leaving.

849
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,320
We're going to draw, okay?

850
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,480
This way, this way.

851
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,800
Go on, hurry back.

852
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:56,770
Can you make

853
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:58,250
this crown a bit brighter?

854
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,130
Good, good.

855
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:01,930
That's good.

856
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:04,110
Don't make it too extravagant.

857
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,570
It doesn't suit her style.

858
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,300
You seem quite obsessed

859
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,520
with this celebrity.

860
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,020
You call her

861
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,100
a virtual idol,

862
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,020
right?

863
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,440
If this background

864
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,070
is projected onto a big screen,

865
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:18,200
won't it be unclear?

866
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,370
You're right.

867
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,850
Let me darken it a bit.

868
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,490
How's this?

869
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:26,580
I think that's about right.

870
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,180
Now,

871
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:28,140
play it through and see how it looks.

872
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,230
Alright.

873
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,230
Are you alright?

874
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:38,920
Slow down.

875
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,150
I can walk.

876
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:40,980
Yes.

877
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:41,800
Let me tell you,

878
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,320
after drinking,

879
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,070
the wind makes it go straight to your head.

880
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,070
Yes, yes, yes.

881
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,400
Um...

882
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,280
Ms. Xiao,

883
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:48,840
you...

884
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,080
could you reconsider it?

885
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,330
Reconsider what?

886
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:56,020
We're not right for each other. Don't be silly.

887
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,440
It's that matter with Qin Fei.

888
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,940
Why don't you rethink it?

889
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,120
You've been going in circles all night,

890
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,340
and now you're back to this topic again.

891
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,480
If you do this again next time,

892
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,080
I won't come when you organize a gathering.

893
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:11,920
Don't say that.

894
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,670
-Don’t.
-I'm leaving.

895
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,350
Watch your head.

896
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,720
We've been friends for so many years.

897
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,800
Sir, let's go.

898
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,920
Take care.

899
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:20,960
Goodbye.

900
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,800
The invincible cosmic beauty Miss Hedgehog.

901
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,760
Someone must have prepared this surprise for their girlfriend.

902
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,230
I'm so envious.

903
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,680
Why does the logo on Miss Hedgehog's clothes

904
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,370
look so familiar?

905
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:42,840
Isn't this

906
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,760
the one customized by Qin Fei?

907
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:45,990
Look at this.

908
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,350
[Linkang Hospital]
Look at this.

909
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:47,380
[Linkang Hospital]

910
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,120
Linkang Aid.
[Linkang Hospital]

911
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:49,180
[Linkang Hospital]

912
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:50,760
Qin Fei went to Linkang

913
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,850
a few days ago.

914
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,690
Could this leading lady really be her?

915
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:55,210
Is she really that nice?

916
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:55,880
Then who is

917
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,460
this Snail Girl?

918
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:58,210
Yeah.

919
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:01,640
Qin Fei?

920
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,930
And this Snail Girl is...

921
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,020
Right, I think it's

922
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,340
a little kid affected by the disaster.

923
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,470
Qin Fei has been helping her all along.

924
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:11,280
Qin Fei is really nice.

925
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,840
She's not only beautiful,

926
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,320
but also kind, isn't she?

927
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:24,410
[Looking forward to Qin Fei’s appearance.]

928
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,500
[Miss Hedgehog is Qin Fei, right?]

931

940
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:01,650

Yeah.

946
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:15,510
Ren Siqi, are you deliberately messing with me?

947
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:16,770
There's nothing here.

948
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:19,170
Wait, it's not this one, not this one.

949
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,250
Hold on a moment.

00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:43,920
I was wondering why you wouldn't let me post the photos.
