00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:49,700
Hello.

5
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:50,590
I'd like to ask something.

6
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,480
Do you have

7
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,500
any sugar-free black sesame balls?

8
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,020
I'm sorry, we don't have that.

9
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,280
The pure sesame balls don't taste good.

10
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,210
Usually only elderly people make it for themselves.

11
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,680
If I want to make it myself,

12
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,610
do you have any fresh black sesame?

13
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:02,750
Over there.

14
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,770
Handsome,

15
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,310
you even make it for them yourself?

16
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,000
You must really care about them.

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,590
Yes.

18
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,310
Thank you.

but look at the location you picked.

25
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,790
It's remote and there's no signal.

26
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,080
How are you going to get customers?

27
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,960
Chen,

28
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,140
do you have a charging cable?

29
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,470
Can I borrow it for a bit?

30
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,130
I don't have a charger,

31
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,870
but I have a drink called Summer Girl.

32
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,560
Try it.

33
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,130
Summer Girl?

34
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,070
I remember in Xiaoxiao's first movie,

35
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,980
the cocktail the male lead made her

36
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,410
was called Summer Girl.

37
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm not sure

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,750
if it has the same nostalgic vibe as in the movie,

39
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,570
but it looks pretty good.

40
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,500
Give it a try.

41
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,620
Xiaoxiao was in a movie

42
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,750
called Who Knows My Heart.

43
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,710
The bookstore where she met the male lead

44
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,060
was called Zero Degree.

45
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,140
Chen Shen,

46
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,000
you opened this bar for Xiaoxiao?

47
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,030
I've liked Xiaoxiao for many years.

48
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,430
That's

49
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,960
really touching,

50
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:43,030
but I don't get it.

51
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,150
You've had a crush on her for so long.

52
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,170
What if,

53
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,150
when you're finally together,

54
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,190
she's nothing like what you imagined?

55
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,000
What then?

56
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:02,950
Qin Fei,

57
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,780
do you know what it means to love someone?

58
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,870
I've indeed been in quite a few relationships.

59
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,490
Being in a relationship doesn't mean you've truly loved someone.

60
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,950
Loving someone isn't some kind of equation.

61
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,600
It's about wanting to give unconditionally.

62
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,940
Once you fall in love,

63
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,830
no matter what the other person is like,

64
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,830
you'll love them.

65
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,340
If you meet someone

66
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,390
who makes you want to break

67
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,870
your own principles,

68
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,730
even if you're uncertain about the future,

69
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,490
you want to take a chance on them.

70
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,820
No more hiding.

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,440

No more holding back.

73
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,800
That's when you've truly fallen in love.

74
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,160
Anyway, there's no point

75
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,490
in explaining it to you.

76
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,630
It's about time.

77
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,640
I've got to go.

78
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,660
When the bar officially opens,

79
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,080
I'll invite you all to come over.

80
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,340
Wait, Chen Shen.

81
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,430
What do you mean?

82
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,620
You're really not open for business?

83
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,120
But Xing Zhizhi told me to come to Zero Degree Bar.

84
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,750
Fei,

85
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,800
I've already told you,

86
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,530
you've come to the wrong place.

87
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,270
You didn't believe me.

88
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,950

89
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,750

how much I missed you

97
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,190
When I opened my mouth, I couldn't say anything.

98
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,600
You, jade-hued

99
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,070

If I had to be honest,

I was indeed

152
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,500
a little angry before.

153
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,500
I deliberately

154
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:21,860
ignored you,

155
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,500
gave you the cold shoulder,

and kept my distance from you before.

157
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,810
That's because I was mad at you.

158
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,570
I was mad that

159
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,030
you wouldn't face what's between us.

160
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,840
And I was mad that I tried everything

161
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,900
to get close to you,

162
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,730
but you kept pushing me away.

163
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,690
Qin Xiaofei,

164
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,970
I want to be with you.

00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,950
I've tried so hard.

166
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,600
You should know

167
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,270
how I feel about you by now.

168
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,030
But I can't figure you out.

169
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,340
I admit, I became afraid.

170
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,090
I hesitated, retreated,

171
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,640
and even tried to avoid you.

172
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,900
It was all because I was afraid of losing you.

173
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,780
I was afraid that if I stayed away,

174
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:23,760
you

175
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,110
would forget about me.

176
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,030
I was afraid that if I got too close,

177
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,560
you would find me annoying again

178
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,820
and push me away again.

179
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,940
When you didn't show up today,

180
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,030
I thought you were avoiding me again.

181
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,190
But I really couldn't give up.

182
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,730
I wanted to wait a little longer,

183
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,000
just a little longer.

184
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,560
But

185
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,810
when I saw you

186
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,790
rushing in,

187
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,410
the expression on your face told me

188
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,930
that you were serious

189
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,870
and sincere.

190
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,270
Now I'm sure

191
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,190
I'm more scared of

192
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,690
hurting you by pulling away

193
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,090
than of being hurt by you.

194
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,450
When have you ever seen me being serious?

195
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,140
You must have seen wrong.

196
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,750
Qin Xiaofei,

197
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,280
I can wait.

198
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,750
I'll wait until the moment

199
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,790
you get through this in your heart.

200
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,390
Until you throw away

201
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,600
all your worries and doubts.

202
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,600
Until you're ready

203
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,550
to give us a real chance.

204
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,650
No matter how long it takes,

205
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:42,650
I'll wait for you.

206
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,100
Aren't you afraid I'll run away again?

207
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,350
You're my fate.

208
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,500
Nonsense.

209
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,090
Quantum entanglement has already been proven.

210
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,010
We're entangled

211
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,360
like two particles in the universe,

212
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,620
affecting each other.

213
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,060
Even if you run away

214
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,670
and we lose contact,

215
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,650
we'll definitely meet again

216
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,350
somewhere in this world,

217
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,600
and influence each other.

218
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,200
You've gotta believe in science.

219
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,260
And more importantly, believe in me.

220
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,690
Chubby.

221
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,540
I don't understand much about science,

222
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,020
but I believe you.

223
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,260
I believe everything you say is sincere.

224
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,820
So, wait for me.

225
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:38,960
I will definitely

226
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,560
get through this in my heart.

227
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,700
As long as the person waiting for me

228
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,830
is you.

229
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,070
♫You're the one♫

230
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,140
♫Longing for you to become the air I breathe♫

231
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,130
♫Thinking of you might give me the courage♫

232
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,250
I'll wait for you.
♫Thinking of you might give me the courage♫

233
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,640
♫Thinking of you might give me the courage♫

234
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,470
♫To softly say that I miss you♫

235

♫You're the one♫

236
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:08,380
♫I want to hear you softly call my name as I hold you♫

♫Feel my heartbeat sync with yours♫

238
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:21,310
♫I'm sure my heart thinks of you♫

239
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,220
Why hasn't that contract been sent over yet?

240
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,950
Is there no news from the producer's side either?

241
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:37,790
I heard

242
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,960
there's

243
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,780
a new rising actress,

244
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,190
who said she's willing to lower her price

245
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,430
to take this role.

246
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,860
Did you get bumped?

247
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,320
No way.

248
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,840
The director praised Fei

249
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,500
at the audition the other day.

250
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,660
That role is definitely hers.

251
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,560
We're entangled

252
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,790
like two particles in the universe,

253
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,370
affecting each other.

254
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,540
Even if you run away

255
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,120
and we lose contact,

256
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,120
we'll definitely meet again

257
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,440
somewhere in this world.

258
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,660
You're so confident.

259
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:13,440
No, Fei,

260
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,200
I'm not being confident.

261
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,600
I'm just making an educated guess

262
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,870
based on the current situation.

263
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,630
Fei,

264
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,080
why hasn't there been any news yet?

265
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,780
Aren't you anxious?

266
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,080
But what's meant to be yours will be yours.

267
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,010
If it's not, nothing can change it.

268
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:26,850
No,

269
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,370
it's yours, it's definitely yours.

270
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,700
It's absolutely yours.

271
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,320
Really?

272
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,000
Really!

273
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,690
You can't back out now.

274
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,530
You need to have confidence in yourself.

275
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,740
But I've messed up so many times before.

276
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,300
This time is different.

277
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,830
You've been preparing seriously for so long.

278
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,730
Have I over-prepared?

279
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,650
Should I have just accepted it directly?

280
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,770
Accepted what?

281
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,840
Xing Zhizhi.

282
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:49,790
No, Fei,

283
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,150
we're talking about your new drama.

284
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,000
Not Xing Zhizhi.

285
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,560
Sorry, sorry.

286
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,030
Hello, Assistant Director Liu.

287
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,540
Goodbye.

288
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,400
It's okay, Fei.

289
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,200
Qin Fei,

290
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,020
you got it.

291
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,870
You got it, Qin Fei.

292
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,870
The second female lead?

293
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,000
Second female lead.

294
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,700
Luo Xiaoxiao is the female lead.

295
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,870
Hao Jun is the male lead.

296
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:46,510
Qin Fei, do you know

297
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,670
what it means for you to play

298
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,670
the second female lead in this drama?

299
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,670
It means making big money for the company.

300
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,790
What are you saying, Fei?

301
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,390
It means

302
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,080
you're one step closer to becoming a top-tier actress.

303
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,750
Calm down.

304
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,840
Put

305
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,240
your love life on hold.

306
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,500
Focus on your career right now.

307
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,750
You're not allowed to cause any trouble this time.

308
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,720
You've got to stay with the crew for three months,

309
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,550
not a single day off.

310
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,790
I'll go check the contract.

311
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,120
Where will it be filmed?

312
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:06,960
What was it again?

313
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,080
Xi City, right, Xi City.

314
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,310
When do we leave?

315
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,120
Now. They want you for a script reading

316
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,580
and costume fitting the day after tomorrow.

317
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,790
Hurry up!

318
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,270
Yes, yes, yes.

319
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,000
Fei, let's go now.

320
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,550
Let's leave right away.

321
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,200
I'll go pack your luggage.

322
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,870
Isn't the day after tomorrow a bit rushed?

323
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,800
It's not rushed.

324
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,360
[WeChat]

325
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,710
Do you have work this weekend?

326
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,240
I'm off duty.

327
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,060
Shall we go out and have some fun?

328
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,180
The crew called me in early.

329
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm going to Xi City now to shoot a film.

330
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,260
I won't be back for at least three months.

331
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,160
Three months?

332
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,580
That's so long.

333
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,080
Judging by your expression,

334
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,000
you've clearly received

335
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,480
the same bad news as I have.

336
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,270
I won't see Coffee for three months.

337
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,870
How am I going to endure this?

338
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,200
Since you'll be alone at home anyway,

339
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,430
why don't you come over for dinner on weekends?

340
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,240
I'm very busy on weekends.

341
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,480
Qin Fei has gone to shoot a film.

342
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,740
What are you busy with?

343
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,710
Don't tell me you didn't know.

344
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,780
Qin Fei didn't even tell you she was leaving?

345
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,700
That's impossible. She told me.

346
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,080
I need to work on my thesis.

347
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,510
My research topic has been selected

348
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,370
for this year's Rehabilitation Medicine Seminar.

349
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,440
Three months.

350
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,000
It'll pass quickly.

351
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,170
You are busy with work?

352
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,950
Sorry, sorry.

353
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,270
Fei,

354
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,440
how come you just arrived at the set

355
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,030
and bought so many things?

356
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,530
I didn't buy anything.

357
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,730
Then who bought all this?

358
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:32,960
Yu Zhecheng?

359
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,120
Coffee,

360
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,530
has Yu Zhecheng been busy at the hospital lately?

361
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,090
Not really.

362
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,600
So much food.

363
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,830
I really didn't expect

364
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,000
that Yu Zhecheng would be so thoughtful.

365
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,830
Yeah,

366
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,290
I didn't expect it either.

367
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,630
He even bought you so many toys.

368
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,920
Isn't that a bit childish?

369
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,320
You're not a kid anymore.

370
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,160
Kid.

371
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,880

I was just thinking about Yu Zhecheng.

379

How did he suddenly become so thoughtful?

380
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,960
He's even buying me snacks

381
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,230
and toys.

387

389

391
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,410

I know you don't like sweets,

393
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,720
so I made them myself.

394
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,560

No way.

527
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,590
He talked to the director,

528
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,960
saying he wanted to meet and discuss the scenes together tonight,

529

is that possible?

you'll need to let me know in advance.

Otherwise...

00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:04,990
Otherwise?

Hao Jun has a lot of fans.

625
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,040
He's quite a nice person too.

626

He keeps calling her Fei on set.

Qin Fei is deeply in love with him.

00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,280
They even have a kissing scene.

630
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,000
There are also rumors that

00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,440
Hao Jun

632
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,630
has some feelings for Qin Fei.

He's being very attentive to her on set every day.

Do you have a point?

What exactly are you trying to say?

Do you want me to ask Coffee about it?

Stay out of it.

how insecure and sensitive she must be.

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,520
You can't just stand there looking dazed.

656
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,430

What brings you here?

To visit Xiaoxiao on set?

668
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,830
She's not filming today.

669
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,360
I came here

670
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,240
to give you some friendly advice.

671
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:32,480
Do you know why Hao Jun

672
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,680
dislikes you so much?

673
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,200
What do you mean?

674
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,310
The role of the second female lead

675
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,640
was originally going to his junior.

676
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,390
But Xiaoxiao saw you were out of work

677
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:44,870
and recommended you to the director.

678
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,940
Didn't expect the director to immediately want you.

679
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,310
Now the entire crew thinks

680
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,640
you only got the role because of connections.

681
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,580
So you need to step up your game.

682
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,810
Xiaoxiao did recommend me,

683
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,820
but I got this role

684
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,240
through my own abilities in the audition.

685
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,720
I know that,

686
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,510
but do you think these people

687
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,880
know that?

688
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,230
Xiaoxiao won Best Actress with her first movie.

689
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,500
Who wouldn't be jealous?

690
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,170
Who wouldn't try to smear her?

691
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,590
Back then, no one believed in

692
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,790
her acting skills.

693
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,420
Just look at Hao Jun.

694
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,970
He was heavily criticized when he first debuted.

695
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:17,960
Then he went back to the stage

696
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,060
and performed in plays for a few years.

697
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,360
And now he's a hit.

698
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,020
Now,

699
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,350
no one dares talk badly about him anymore.

700
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:26,240
So,

701
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,670
if you want to be respected by others,

702
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:31,170
you must show some real ability.

703
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:39,510
Why are you suddenly being so nice to me?

704
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,820
I'm afraid you'll drag our Xiaoxiao down.

705
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,720
You're saying like Xiaoxiao

706
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,980
is someone special to you.

707
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,430
If you're going to talk like that,

708
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,890
I wish I hadn't warned you.

709
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,890
Just focus on your script.

710
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:57,090

719

I don't want to hear either of them.

721
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,070
They're both related to Qin Fei.

The good news.

723
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,160

The better news is

735
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,150

How can you be so thick-skinned?

740

No, think about it.

741
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:11,320
When you go to Xi City to see Qin Fei,

742
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,520
I'll definitely go see Coffee.

743
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,710
I'll take the third wheel away for you.

Wouldn't that mean we came for nothing?

869
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,320
That means you came for nothing.

876
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,800
I was too insecure.

894
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,220
our water truck is out of water.

895

Go refill it!

896
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,590
Why are you wasting time talking?

897
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,240
Get it done

898
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,250
or get out!

899
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:54,240

900
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:57,180

902
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,670

903
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:08,180
Relax.

904
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:10,540
Don't let the atmosphere here affect you.

905
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:13,790
The more you care about what others think,
the more it'll hurt.

906

Just take it easy.

907
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,570
Once you calm down,

908
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:18,410
the emotions will come naturally.

909
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:19,670
Here, have some water.

910
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:22,420
It's okay. You've just messed up 17 times.

911
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,350
I had it much worse one time before.

912
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:25,800
It was right after my breakup,

913
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:25,910
and I had to shoot a romance scene.

We shot for three days.

918
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,030
In the end, the director wouldn't even speak to me.

919
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,360
Even the staff on set were

920
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,960
avoiding me when they saw me.

921
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,510
Later, this scene was even cut out.

922
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,050
At that time, I felt

923
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,140
extremely embarrassed

924
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,200
and really upset.

925
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,230
But now, you see,

926
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:44,890
who remembers?

927
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:48,210
You said you had just broken up then,

928
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,670
was it with Liu Yanze?

929
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,140
The third day after the breakup.

930
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,080
What did that feel like?

931
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:02,480
You're missing the point.

932
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,220
How does that relate to the scene?

933
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,300
Xiaoxiao,

934
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,870
I really can't find the feeling for this scene.

935
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:09,580
Could you tell me about it?

936
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:21,620
The feeling was...

937
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:26,660
I felt like I was

938
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:27,620
completely dull

939
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,070
and numb.

940
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:34,440
I wanted to peel an apple for myself at that time,

941
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,370
but ended up cutting my hand with the knife.

942
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:38,200
I cut here. The blood just kept dripping.

943
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,330
I was just keeping watching like this.

944
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,420
You're kidding? Didn't it hurt?

945
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,220
It hurt.

946
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:45,650
But at that time,

947
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:47,560
I realized

948
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:51,850
that focusing on the physical pain

949
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,680
made my heart hurt a little less.

950
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,180
Even if it's just for a moment.

951
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,480
Shifting your focus

952
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:57,880
to something

953
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,440
less significant

954
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,960
made it more bearable.

955
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,680
I think I know how to do it now.

956
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:11,800
What are you doing?

957
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,660
It won't affect filming.

958
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:14,880
I think I'm ready.

959
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:16,510
Qin Fei, there's no need.

960
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,150
Xiaoxiao,

961
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,300
I feel I can do it.

962
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:20,850
Thank you.

00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:26,820
I've bought the desserts for you.

967
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:27,370
I've bought the desserts for you.

968
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:27,990
I'll eat them later.

969
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:29,190
Let's go to the scene.
