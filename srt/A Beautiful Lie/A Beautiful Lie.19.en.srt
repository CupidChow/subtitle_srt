Your relationship might

start sooner than you expect.

It could apply to anyone.

17
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,200
Fei, why don't you think about it carefully?

18
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,680
Maybe you've already met him,

19
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,400
and you just haven't realized it yet.

20
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,710
For example,

21
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,870
Dr. Xing.

22
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,210
Dr. Xing?

23
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,670
If I had waited for him to save me, I'd be dead by now.

24
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,360
One life-and-death experience

25
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,610
in Paris was more than enough.

26
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,080
But according to you,

27
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,090
my future husband could still be

28
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,370
the mysterious man who saved me in Paris?

29
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,450
That does sound romantic.

30
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,900
What's romantic about it?

31
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,650
I don't know his face,

32
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,670
his age, nothing.

33
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,160
I've only ever seen him in my dreams.

34
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,860
What's so romantic about that?

35
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,320
Have you dreamed about him again since then?

36
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:42,940
Yes, I have.

37
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,480
In the dream, I grabbed him and asked,

38
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,820
"Why did you save me back then?

39
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,810
Don't you know that living is exhausting?"

40
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,530
Alright, enough of this.

41
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,300
This kind of stuff is just to fool naive girls like you.

You're drunk and still came to find me.

00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,060

59
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,520
You're afraid that promises will fade,

60
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,780
afraid that beautiful things will pass,

61
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,910
and afraid that you'll never get what you desire.

62
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,630
Because you firmly believe

63
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,070
nothing in this world lasts forever,

64
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,020
you lie to yourself, pretending you don't need it.

65
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,900
And that's why you're hesitant in the face of Xing Zhizhi's promises.

I couldn't call you?

Now that you have a girlfriend,

Nothing much.

00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,780
I just told her to have you call me back

when you wake up.

153
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,540
Didn't you tell her you're my sister?

154
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,520
Let me think…

155
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,320
I don't remember what I said to her.

00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,510
What exactly did you say to her?

159
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,600
How did you say it?

160
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,120
Why are you so anxious?

161
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,270
Well, she said

162
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,910
she's just your friend.

163
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,510
Then I'll have to test her on purpose,

164
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,670
just to tease her.

165
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,810
I didn't tell her I'm your sister.

166
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,410
What's wrong? Is she angry?

167
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,630
Or is she jealous?

168
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,450
Didn't she give you a hard time?

169
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,980
Looks like she cares about you a lot.

170
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,620
More than just friends, huh?

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,280
Xing Zhizu.

172
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,820
You really got me in trouble.

173
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,130
No.

174
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,950
It doesn't show your waistline.

175

This white one...

176
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,670
Looks a bit plain, doesn't it?

177
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,390
It doesn't match your vibe.

178
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,630
After all, you're going to see your soon-to-be boyfriend,

179
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,420
not just attend a lecture.

180
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,650
Try another one.

181
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,930

183
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,720
Let him go find his "Your Highness" or whatever.

184
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,400
Anyway, I'm not going.

185
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,750
Whose "Your Highness"?

186

Yesterday, Xing Zhizhi

187
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,040
went out drinking with Liu Yanze.

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,120
He got drunk

189
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,050
and came to find me,

190
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,580
and I had to take care of him.

191
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,360
Turns out, he was too drunk to answer his phone,

192
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,360
so I answered a call from some woman.

193
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:42,620
Yesterday?

194
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,980
Liu Yanze asked Xing Zhizhi out for drinks?

195
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,620
Luo Xiaoxiao,

196
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,320
I said there was a woman who called him!

197
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,240
Okay, okay, okay, so...

198
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:50,840
And then? What happened?

199
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,840
So this woman called him,

200
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,870
and then?

201
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,790
And she had this sarcastic tone,

202
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,860
asking who I was,

203
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,030
and then started saying stuff like,

204
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,340
"come back soon, darling,"

205
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,800
"baby, I miss you so much."

206
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,440
And the best part?

207
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,290
Her contact name was "Your Highness"!

208
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:03,440

210
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,670
No way.

211
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,440
What do you mean, no way?

212
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,150
I never thought Xing Zhizhi

213
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,950
would be that kind of guy either.

214
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,660
Last night, that "Your Highness"

215
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,970
was my sister. My actual sister.

216
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,080
And "baby" is my nephew.

217
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,110
She was just teasing you on purpose.

218
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,500
Don't misunderstand.

219
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,970
See, I told you he's not like that. Look at that—

220
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,750
You misunderstood, didn't you?

221
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,240
Well, it's not necessarily all a misunderstanding.

222
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,550
Maybe he really does have a sister.

223
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,320
But who knows

224
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,670
who was calling him

225
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,670
last night?

226
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,120
You know how these guys can be.

227
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,870
How do I look in this?

228
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,280
Ugly.

229
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,090
Isn't this the one you bought?

230
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,550
Wait a second.

231
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,440
How about this one? It's this year's new collection.

232
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,360
I've only worn it once,

233
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,360
but it's a bit tight on me.

234
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,960
It should fit you perfectly.

235
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:57,510

Why shouldn't I go?

Even if there's this "Your Highness,"

241
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,520
I have to see who this person really is.

242

I've checked all the footage

from the hotel's entrance points.

374
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,680
There's no sign of Qin Fei.

00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,310
I suspect she's most likely

00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,550
still in the hotel.

00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,370
Think carefully.

00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,150
When she called you,

380
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,830
did she give any hints?

381
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,310
And the background noise—

382
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,530
the background noise is important, too.

383
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,290
Yes.

384
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,640
There was a lot of noise.

If it was really loud, like a buzzing sound,

393
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,010
she might be there.

00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,830
Yes.

00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,160

He's just my bodyguard.

He's nothing to me.

00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,750

If you don't like him,

00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,200
you can leave with Mr. Chen now.

557
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,530
My work here

558
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,510
is done.

559
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,680
What do you mean?

560
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,460
I'll wait for you in the car.

561
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,340
[Emergency Elevator]

562
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,610
That Li Wei...

563
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,010
He was the one stalking you

564
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,490
while you were at Huhai.

565
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,770
He was sending all those  things

566
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,360
to your house,

567
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,780
including the camera this time.

568
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,520
This guy has some serious mental issues

569
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,780
and can be aggressive.

570
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,110
So,

571
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,460
what are you trying to say?

572
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,550
I agreed to take on your case

573
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,750
because of him.

574
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,770
Now that he's under police control,

575
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,840
you're safe,

576
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,400
so there's no need

577
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,290
to continue

578
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,970
the private security arrangement.

579
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:15,040
But we have a contract.

580
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,880
If that's the case,

581
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,550
aren't you breaching it unilaterally?

582
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,970
I could report it to Blue Security

583
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,300
and seek compensation.

584
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,960
You won't do that.

585
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:24,920
Of course,

586
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,350
if you

587
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,970
insist on compensation,

588
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:32,530
I'm the main party responsible for the contract,

589
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,680
and it wouldn't affect Blue Security.

590
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:35,340
Of course,

591
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,030
[Emergency Elevator]
Of course,

592
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,940
[Emergency Elevator]

593
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,380
you could have Mr. Chen
[Emergency Elevator]

594
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,240
you could have Mr. Chen

595
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,490
pursue legal action.

596
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,230
Five years,

597
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,140
ten years,

598
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,440
twenty years—

599
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,800
it doesn't matter.

600
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,890
I'll try my best to pay it back slowly.

601
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,970
You're willing to sign a contract to protect me

602
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:56,400
over someone like Li Wei,

603
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,240
and now that the job is done,

604
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,110
you're eager to talk about compensation

605
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,830
just to avoid me?

606
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,810
Fine, Liu Yanze.

607
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,450
You're really something.

608
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:15,360
You're my ex-girlfriend, after all.

609
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,590
I can't just stand by

610
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,990
while you're in danger.

611
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,550
I'm not that kind of person.

612
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,640
You know that.

613
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:23,530
I know.

614
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:25,740
I know you,

615
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:28,820
and you know me too.

616
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,590
You know exactly how to hurt me the most.

617
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,230
Luo Xiaoxiao,

618
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:41,690
we were great together once,

619
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,340
but listen carefully—

620
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:44,540
that was in the past.

621
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,280
Is it really worth holding onto that?

622
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,450
You always ask

623
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,680
if I've moved on,

624
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:49,790

Remember to eat,

I'm thinking about Qin Fei.

672
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,760
She left without a word.

673
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:21,560
Do you think she was mad that day?

00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,620
What do you think?

675
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,570
How would I know?

676
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:27,120
She hasn't visited in the last couple of days,

677
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,570
and her texts are so half-hearted.

678
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,020
Am I about to be fired

679
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,840
as her "reserve family member"?

680
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,460
You've got a mouth, don't you?

681
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,340
If she doesn't say anything,

682
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,450
you can just ask.

683
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,760
Good point.

684
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:42,550
Where are you going?

685
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,510
To find her!

686
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,750
Sit down!

687
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,400
What's the rush?

688
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,830
You've got a check-up soon.

689
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,070
Just stay put and behave.

690
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,310
Then what should I do?

691
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,020
Look at you, so impatient.

692
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,740
Don't worry.

693
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,160
Your big sis here

694
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,710
has got this under control.

695
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,140
Cut!

696
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:23,740
Change the scene.

697
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,910
Okay, stop.

698
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,290
Change the scene!

699
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:27,750
Alright, change the scene, change the scene.

700
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,550
Sorry, excuse me.

701
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,750
Make way.

702
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,750
Give me my phone, give me my phone.

703
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,720
Thank you. Come on, come on.

704
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,720
Fei, put your clothes on first.

705
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,650
Give me my phone.

706
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,720
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

707
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,580
Slow down, slow down.

708
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,910
Fei, don't rush.

709
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:41,950
How's the filming going?

710
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,350
When are you coming?

711
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,600
Got time tomorrow?

712
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,020
I'm getting discharged.

713
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,750
Too clingy.

714
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,800
Fei, do you like this kind of man?

715
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,260
Coffee.

716
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,160
Get me a privacy screen protector

717
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,040
for my phone.

718
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:55,940
Alright, Fei.

719
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,520
Don't be so sensitive, Fei.

720
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:58,510
I heard about what happened the other day,

721
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,620
with that psycho kidnapping you

722
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,850
and that pretty boy coming to the rescue.

723
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:02,960
Are you two

724
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,230
together now or what?

725
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:05,330
Really, Hao Jun?

726
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:06,940
Do you even look in the mirror?

727
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,300
You don't know who looks like a pretty boy?

728
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:12,260
Fei, I'm not trying to stir things up.

729
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:14,240
But when we film romance scenes,

730
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,610
we're together

731
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,480
day in and day out for months.

732
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,980
Feelings can get real.

733
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:21,730
No, I mean...

734
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:22,920
I just wonder,

735
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,130
with him being so clingy,

736
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,450
can he handle this?

737
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:26,350
Besides, can he deal with

738
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:28,750
the avalanche of gossip?

739
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,850
I didn't want to argue with you at first because I thought it wasn't necessary,

740
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:32,220
but now I feel like I have to say something,

741
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,350
and it's just eight words.

742
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:34,470
Which eight words?

743
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,370
I like him, so what's it to you?

744
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,670
Xing Zhizhi told you, right?

745
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,230
He's insisting on getting discharged tomorrow,

746
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,800
and I can't stop him.

747
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:52,710
But I have to

748
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,830
head back to Huhai tonight,

749
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:55,770
so

750
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,990
I'm counting on you

751
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,810
to pick him up from the hospital.

752
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,880
Don't be nervous.

753
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,640
He's up and about,

754
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,630
and can take care of himself,

755
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,280
but emotionally,

756
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,890
he's a bit fragile.

757
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,300
He needs company.

758
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,320
When he gets sick, it's like he suddenly turns ten years younger.

759
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:14,420
I thought

760
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,310
you didn't want me to see him.

761
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,860
After all, it's my fault he got hurt.

762
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:24,750
The impression I got when you first met me was that

763
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,370
you didn't really like me.

764
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,560
Indeed,

765
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,900
I didn't like you much.

766
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,600
I know Xing Zhizhi's temper.

767
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,800
He's been keeping the thing between you two

768
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,030
tightly under wraps,

769
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,750
not telling the family anything.

770
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,330
There's only one reason for that—

771
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,290
you haven't

772
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,360
made up your mind yet.

773
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,900
So I tested you,

774
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:52,250
wanted to see

775
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:54,240
if you're truly serious about him.

776
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,050
Also,

777
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,930
to add a little spark

778
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,160
to my fragile little brother's

779
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,040
love life.

780
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,670
But don't get me wrong.

781
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,360
I'm not against you.

782
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:03,880
I just wanted to know

783
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,340
if you'd back down

784
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:06,730
if someone opposed you.

785
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,570
When you left the hospital

786
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,380
without saying much,

787
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,810
I was disappointed.

788
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,600
But just now,

789
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,260
your answer—I liked it.

790
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,360
What answer?

791
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,280
"I like him, so what's it to you?"

792
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,560
The fact that you'll stand up for him

793
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,520
in front of others is enough for me.

794
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,340
Wait,

795
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,970
did I misread the situation?

796
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:42,970
Do you not like him

797
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,200
and just don't know how to turn him down?

798
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:46,190
No,

799
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,840
it's just that

800
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:50,200
he likes me way more than I thought,

801
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,570
and I'm scared I can't handle it.

802
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,650
Don't overthink it.

803
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,900
As long as he likes you,

804
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,090
you can handle it.

805
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:17,860
Why,

806
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:19,230
haven't had enough of the hospital?

807
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,430
Waiting for someone?

808
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,260
Let's go, big shot.

809
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:28,290
I've got a virtual meeting to get to.

810
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:36,560
Fountain at seven tonight.

811
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,920
Fine, don't worry about me.

812
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,980
You can have a date night with Coffee.

813
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,250
So nice?

814
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,440
Where are you going then?

815
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:44,540
[Yang's Restaurant]
Where are you going then?

816
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:48,980
[Yang's Restaurant]

817
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,110
How is it?

818
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:55,880
Tastes good?

819
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:56,990
It's great.

820
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,150
Then eat more.

821
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,830
It's a specialty here.

822
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,590
Xing Zhizhi,

823
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,000
if I hadn't found out,

824
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,030
were you planning

825
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,650
to keep the truth from me forever?

826
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:20,780
What truth?

827
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:24,320
[Yang's Restaurant]

828
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,450
Where are you going?

[Yang's Restaurant]

830
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,700
I'm confessing to you.

831
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,440
This time,

832
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,670
I'm confessing.

833
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,790
Xing Zhizhi,

834
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,740
let's be together.

835
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,550
What are you sitting there for?

836
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:44,880
Aren't you coming over?

837
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,030
[Yang's Restaurant]

838
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,280
You weren't lying—

839
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,100
this place is really beautiful.

840
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,920
You've always been unsure

841
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,090
if you're still considered my "reserve family member."

842
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,430
Well, let me tell you now:

843
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,690
you're officially in.

844
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,440
Xing Zhizhi,

845
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,390
let's be together, okay?

846
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,170
Really?

847
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,930
You've told me so much before,

848
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:14,230
and I've thought about it for a long time.

849
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:15,770
I've made up my mind.

850
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,980
As long as it's you,

851
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:20,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

852
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:22,240
No matter how many challenges

853
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,120
or problems we face in the future,

854
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,140
if it's with you,

855
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:29,440
I'll be brave enough to face them all.

856
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,270
Maybe this time,

857
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,710
we'll be together for a very, very long time.

858
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:39,230
No, not maybe—

859
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:41,440
we definitely will.

860
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:52,780
♫Amid all the shadows, you're the only one I see♫

861
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,330
♫I never told you♫

862
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,580
♫I've never been so firm♫

863
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:02,220
♫You're the one♫

864
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,070
♫Longing for you to become the air I breathe♫

865
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,600
♫Thinking of you might give me the courage♫

866
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,270
♫To softly say that I miss you♫

867
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,450
♫You're the one♫

868
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:19,400
♫I want to hear you softly call my name as I hold you♫

869
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:25,350
♫Feel my heartbeat sync with yours♫

870
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:31,030
♫I'm sure my heart thinks of you♫

871
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,720
Your forehead is quite hot.

872
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:39,170
I filmed an outdoor scene in the windy afternoon,

873
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,830
then rushed here to see you—

874
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:41,860
what do you think?

875
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:53,750
[Yang's Restaurant]

876
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,700
Come on, take your medicine.

877
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,030
Thank you.

878
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:13,750
Careful, it's hot.

879
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,480
What's wrong?

880
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:19,400
Why is it bitter?

881
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,110
I want something sweet.

882
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:23,440
Then I'll make you some sugar water.

883
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,190
No, no.

884
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,660
That'll make me gain weight.

885
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,650
I want zero-calorie with xylitol.

886
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:29,110
It's the middle of the night.

887
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:31,110
Where am I supposed to find xylitol for you?

888
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,510
Be good, just drink this for now,

889
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:34,240
and I'll get you some tomorrow.

890
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,710
I'm your girlfriend.

891
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,400
You can't glare at me.

892
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:49,230
Please?

893
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:52,990
Alright.

894
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,110
I'll go get you xylitol now.

895
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:56,220
Good girl.

896
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,950

00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,710
Xiaofei.

898
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,630
Wake up.

899
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:46,630
I've added the xylitol.

900
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,690
Come on, take your medicine, okay?

901
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,510
Be good.

902
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:53,210
Here you go.

903
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:57,260
Here.

904
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:01,920
Is it sweet?

905
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:11,100
Good girl.

906
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,100
Alright.

907
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:15,690
Xing Zhizhi.

908
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:17,080
I took it seriously.

909
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:21,750
All that talk about quantum entanglement

910
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:23,210
and destiny—

911
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:25,670
I believe it now.

912
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,900
Because I just remembered...
