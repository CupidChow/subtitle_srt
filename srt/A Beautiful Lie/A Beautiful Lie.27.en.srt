00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:44,660
[Episode 27]
[What's the use of apologizing? It won't solve anything.]

5
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,030
How could he not be there?

6
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,000
He told me two days ago

7
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,120
he went to the Sydney Opera House.

8
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,390
He also mentioned going to some tower,

9
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,810
where he saw the whole of Sydney from the top.

10
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,410
He said the view was amazing.

11
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,940
He also told me he went to the beach.

12
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,720
He said that area by the sea

13
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,710
would be better if it were summer.

14
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,030
We could go surfing together.

15
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,890
And we could...

16
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,090
Stop acting.

17
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,900
With your acting skills, you think you can fool Fei?

18
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,050
She's the expert here.

19
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:04,960
Come clean.

20
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,550
Well, I...

21
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,150
My acting is not bad, right?

22
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,630
So Xing Zhizhi didn't go on a business trip at all,

23
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,090
nor did he go to Australia?

24
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,150
Where is he now?

25
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,680
There's this handsome guy in a band

26
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,330
who invited me to go to his performance.

27
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,980
I wasn't planning on going,

28
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,680
but now I've changed my mind.

29
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,960
Listening to a handsome guy sing is much more interesting

30
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,320
than listening to your made-up stories.

31
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,110
Yu Zhecheng, I'll give you

32
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,270
one last chance.

33
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,920
Where exactly is Xing Zhizhi?

34
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,080
If you don't tell the truth,

35
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,350
we'll break up immediately.

36
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,160
Don't.

37
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:32,960
Coffee.

38
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,400
Hey, Xing's business

39
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,200
has nothing to do with us, right?

40
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,490
I'll come clean.

41
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,580
Well,

42
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,710
the hospital didn't send him to Australia.

43
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,120
He took a six-month leave.

44
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,630
After I dropped him off at the airport that day,

45
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,520
he didn't tell me anything,

46
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,030
because he was afraid I'd spill the beans.

47
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,800
He took a six-month leave?

48
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,760
Why did he suddenly take such a long leave?

49
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,100
Fei, I really don't know about this.

50
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,030
I swear.

51
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,920
For the specifics, you'll have to ask Xing himself.

52
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:07,470
Coffee,

53
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,570
I've said everything honestly now.

54
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,370
We don't have to break up, right?

55
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,970
Don't you dare act all cheeky with me.

56
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,110
You're in trouble, Yu Zhecheng.

57
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,190
I'm warning you.

58
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,400
If you dare to reveal a single word

59
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,780
of what you told us today to Xing Zhizhi,

60
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,580
you'll face the consequences.

61
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,270
What did I do to deserve this?

62
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:37,870
Zhizu!

63
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,320
Superstar,

64
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,240
why did you suddenly decide to find me?

65
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,370
I ordered an Americano for you. Is that okay?

66
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,370
Thank you.

67
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,570
Tell me, what's wrong?

68
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,480
Zhizu,

69
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,330
has something happened to Xing Zhizhi?

70
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,920
He told me he was going to Australia

71
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,000
for a two-month exchange.

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,750
But in reality,

73
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,920
he's probably gone to Linkang County.

74
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,430
You suspect him?

75
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,230
I don't suspect him.

76
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,910
I'm really worried about him.

77
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,490
Zhizu,

78
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,080
do you know something?

79
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,280
I do

80
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,520
know something.

81
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,230
So...

82
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,850
But I think

83
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,820
it would be better if he

84
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,460
told you about this himself.

85
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,810
But I can assure you

86
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,170
he hasn't done anything bad,

87
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,230
and certainly nothing to betray you.

88
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,160
So, are you

89
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,520
planning to go find him?

90
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,850
I need to get to the bottom of this.

91
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,470
Coffee!

92
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,160
Sorry to keep you waiting.

93
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,650
I'm telling you,

94
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,140
from the bottom of my...

95
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,830
From where?

96
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,790
From an acting class?

97
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,450
I was forced to do it by Xing.

98
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,190
He forced you,

99
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,750
so that gives you the right to lie to me and Fei?

100
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,000
Yu Zhecheng, I'm telling you.

101
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,160
I agreed to be with you in the first place

102
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,510
because you were dedicated to your work

103
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,580
and sincere to others.

104
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,220
I never thought you'd become

105
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,360
such a smooth liar.

106
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,360
I...

107
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,920
After this incident, I finally see things clearly.

108
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,540
You can't judge a book by its cover.

109
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,720
Underneath your skin is a belly full of schemes.

110
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,160
Yu Zhecheng, let me tell you,

111
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,720
what I hate the most in this life

112
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,510
is being lied to,

113
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,480
and people lying to Fei.

114
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,560
Don't think you can just brush this off.

115
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,360
You must give me an explanation.

116
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,560
Yu Zhecheng, you've gotten bolder now.

117
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,120
You even—

118
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,890
Baby,

119
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,170
I know I was wrong.

120
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,540
Please forgive me.

121
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,540
I've grown grapes my whole life,

122
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,830
eaten grapes my whole life,

123
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,830
but I've never had

124
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,850
dishes made entirely with grapes.

125
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,010
Is this even edible?

126
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,400
Honey,

127
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,300
what's up with this Dr. Xing?

128
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,790
He's making videos and cooking all the time.

129
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,930
Young people have so much energy.

130
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,180
From morning 'til night,

131
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,710
he's always busy and never seems to get tired.

132
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,500
Here we go.

133
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,480
The last dish is fish.

134
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,290
This dish doesn't have grapes, does it?

135
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:23,820
It does.

136
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,560
Grape juice.

137
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:29,670
Uncle,

138
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,200
try it.

139
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,690
How is it?

140
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,190
You know what,

141
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,990
it's actually quite delicious.

142
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,260
All these dishes I made

143
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,820
both look and taste good.

144
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,480
Aunt, you should try it too.

145
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,720
It's really delicious.

146
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,580
Give it a taste.

147
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,080
It's good, it's good.

148
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,610
If it's good, then eat more.

149
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,830
Uncle, Aunt,

150
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,690
I have something I want to discuss with you.

151
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,170
What is it? Go ahead.

152
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,590
Mr. Xing and I want to renovate the guesthouse.

153
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,770
I know you've always wanted to renovate it

154
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,740
but couldn't afford it.

155
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,640
So,

156
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,120
I discussed it with Xixi,

157
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,590
and we decided to take on

158
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,560
the task of renovating the guesthouse.

159
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,430
This...

160
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,410
Dr. Xing, how can we allow this?

161
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,840
You're our guest here.

162
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,860
Uncle,

163
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,670
you haven't charged me for staying here,

164
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,270
so I'm certainly not a guest.

165
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,560
And actually, I've always felt that

166
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,890
the current guesthouse

167
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,190
is too plain.

168
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,210
We can add more entertainment options,

169
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,120
like you mentioned before, Uncle.

170
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,410
Fruit picking, fishing... all of that could work.

171
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,560
We can also make changes to the dining experience,

172
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,290
utilizing our vineyard

173
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,320
to offer a grape-themed meal set,

174
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,360
or even create

175
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,560
a themed guesthouse.

176
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,510
That's great!

177
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,870
A bizarre menu plus a themed guesthouse

178
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,390
will surely attract a lot of people.

179
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,520
That's right, Xixi.

180
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,840
You can use your paintings

181
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,740
as thematic elements.

182
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,190
Right?

183
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,780
Miss Hedgehog?

184
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,080
Is this the surprise you're planning for Ms. Qin Fei?

185
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,390
I suppose so.

186
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,320
So, Xixi,

187
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,090
before I tell Qin Fei about this,

188
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,200
you must keep it a secret for me, okay?

189
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:16,880
Good girl.

190
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,000
Dr. Xing,

191
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,180
you are Xixi's benefactor.

192
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,890
How can we let you pay for this?

193
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,010
The grapes in this vineyard have grown exceptionally well this year.

194
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,370
Once we sell all the grapes

195
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,680
from this vineyard,

196
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,020
we'll surely get a good price.

197
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,080
After we collect the money,

198
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,400
we can renovate it properly.

199
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,130
Uncle,

200
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,700
this won't cost too much.

201
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,620
We'll just take advantage of our unique features,

202
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,140
buy some decorations to make some changes,

203
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,000
then take some photos and put them online.

204
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,400
That should do it, right?

205
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:49,530
Of course,

206
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,150
if you two

207
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,810
don't trust me to do this,

208
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,890
that's fine too.

209
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,960
Dr. Xing,

210
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,520
you're contributing both money and effort.

211
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,280
How can we not trust you?

212
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,270
-Yes.
-Okay, Uncle.

213
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,670
It's settled then, okay?

214
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,350
To our themed guesthouse,

215
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:04,790
cheers!

216
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,320
Come on, cheers.

217
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,480
Cheers!

218
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,310
I'll finish mine first.

219
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:07,520
[Ms. Qin Fei]
I'll finish mine first.

220
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,060
[Ms. Qin Fei]

221
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,360
-I’ll fill it up for you.
-No.

222
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:11,670
I can't anymore.

223
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,510
Fill it up, fill it up.

224
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,430
Xixi,

225
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,670
tell me the truth.

226
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,810
Is Xing Zhizhi in Linkang?

227
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:17,950
Add a little more.

228
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,380
Wouldn't that be better?

229
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:21,650
No more, no more.

230
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,190
I really can't drink anymore, really can't.

231
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,850
I really can't drink anymore.

232
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:07,510
[Qin Fei]

233
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,850
[Qin Xiaofei]

234
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,080
[Qin Xiaofei]

235
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,720
Xiaofei.

236
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,550
Why aren't you responding to me?

237
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,880
Are you still not up?

238
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,160
How's your studying going?

239
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,170
Send me the problems you did incorrectly recently.

240
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,570
Let me take a look for you.

241
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,510
Zhecheng.

242
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,650
I can't reach Xiaofei.

243
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,460
How about this?

244
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,180
Go ask Coffee

245
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,130
how Qin Fei has been lately.

246
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,240
Don't let anything slip.

247
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,150
Mr. Xing!

248
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:14,870
We have a customer booking.

249
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,390
What should I do?

250
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,590
How should I respond?

251
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,580
Let me see.

252
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,590
[Welcome to Yunzhong Guesthouse]

253
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:21,620
Hello.
[Welcome to Yunzhong Guesthouse]

254
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,870
Hello.

255
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,890
Welcome to Yunzhong Guesthouse.

256
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,650
How many guests will there be in total?

257
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,660
Male guests?

258
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:30,870
Female guests?

259
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,360
How many rooms do you need?

260
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,270
One person.

261
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:34,960
Female.

262
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,370
Just one person?

263
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,540
Alright.

264
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,520
We can also help you arrange your itinerary.

265
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:44,240
If needed, we can provide a free tour guide as well.

266
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,770
When will you arrive?

267
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,530
I can drive to pick you up.

268
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,330
Send me

269
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,030
your time

270
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:49,860
and location.

271
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,780
You're so eager just because it's a girl.

272
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,510
Xing Zhizhi, you're dead meat.

273
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,300
That's great. Thank you for your hard work.

274
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,830
Your service is excellent.

275
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,410
Of course.

276
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,750
Excuse me,

277
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,700
how may I address you?

278
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,760
My surname is Li.

279
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,120
Okay,

280
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,230
Ms. Li.

281
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,310
All done.

282
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,280
She'll be at the town entrance at 10 AM tomorrow.

283
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,730
I'll check if the room needs anything else.

284
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,350
I'll leave the pickup to you.

285
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:27,770
Leave it to me.

286
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,360
Ms. Li who booked the guesthouse

287
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,840
is wearing a white dress and a black top.

288
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,900
She said she also brought a suitcase.

289
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,920
I've already arrived at the town entrance. I got it.

290
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,260
Good luck.

291
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,460
Why do I need luck just to pick someone up?

292
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:08,010
[Qin Xiaofei]

293
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,680
How are you doing?

294
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,830
Coffee.

295
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,720
Is Qin Fei

296
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,150
busy these days?

297
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,960
She didn’t reply to my WeChat messages all day.

298
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,390
She's doing fine.

299
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,190
I'm busy. I'll talk to you later.

300
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:05,770
H-Hello.

301
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,600
Hello.

302
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,850
Ms. Li, right?

303
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:08,600
Hello.

304
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,800
I'm Mr. Xing, who contacted you online.

305
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,580
I think you've got the wrong person.

306
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,370
My name is Lili.

307
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,990
-Sorry. Sorry.
-It’s okay.

308
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,360
This driver

309
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,020
must have just gotten his license.

310
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,930
Report him.

311
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,420
Didn't I tell you not to come?

312
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:27,960
Here.

313
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,190
I...

314
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,090
I...

315
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,990
I'm just trying to protect you.

316
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,950
So you won't be fooled by someone's sweet talk again.

317
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,440
When you see that jerk later,

318
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,950
don't you dare go soft on him.

319
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:39,850
Whatever he says,

320
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:40,540
just

321
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,310
don't listen

322
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,220
and don't believe it.

323
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,430
I'll personally expose

324
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,310
his hypocritical nature.

325
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,120
Actually, Linkang County has beautiful scenery.

326
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,730
There's a sandy lake for fishing.

327
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,410
There are flocks of sheep on the desert.

328
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,010
The lavender estate is also quite famous.

329
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,760
If you're interested, you can go for a visit.

330
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,470
Sure.

331
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,870
Are you from around here?

332
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,180
You don't look like it.

333
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,070
I'm not.

334
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,730
I'm here to help at the guesthouse.

335
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:02,460
Guesthouse?

336
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,000
Yes.

337
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,880
Ms. Qin Fei,

338
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:07,000
Mr. Xing Zhizhi has gone to pick you up.

339
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,570
He said he's already at the entrance of the town.

340
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,190
Don't worry,

341
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,150
I've kept it strictly confidential.

342
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,490
I didn't tell him it was you.

343
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:12,730
Lu Yicheng,

344
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,010
you remember what I told you, right?

345
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,900
How many times have you told me?

346
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,730
Relax,

347
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,810
I won't eat Xing Zhizhi alive.

348
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,290
I really don't understand you.

349
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,840
Why do you like him so much?

350
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,430
If it were me,

351
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,200
I'd just block him and be done with it.

352
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,070
Yes, our guesthouse also has its own orchard.

353
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,090
The environment is also very nice.

354
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,540
If you'd like to go,

355
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,910
you can go and take a look.

356
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,550
Do you have to confirm it with your own eyes?

357
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,060
Fei, do you see that?

358
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,480
I caught him red-handed.

359
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,160
Then let me add you on WeChat.

360
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,370
Of course, of course.

361
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,300
You scan my QR code.

362
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,560
Okay.

363
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:49,650
Amazing.

364
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,880
Absolutely amazing.

365
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,790
You're welcome anytime.

366
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,400
Alright.

367
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,960
I'll go take a look around over there first.

368
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,200
Then, if I have the chance,

369
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,270
I'll come and stay at your Yunzhong Guesthouse for a few days.

370
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:05,790
Okay.

371
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,630
I'll be going then.

372
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,760
-Bye.
-Bye.

373
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,500
I'm sorry...

374
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,620
Cheng?

375
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,640
Qin... Qin Fei.

376
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,030
Why are you here?

377
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,830
You must have mistaken me for someone else.

378
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,070
My surname is Li.

379
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,440
My name is Li Ar.

380
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,040
Li and Ar put together

381
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,010
is you.

382
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,170
Liar.

383
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,240
The van was taken by Xixi's uncle

384
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,070
to transport grapes to town.

385
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,320
This pedicab is all we have left.

386
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,050
Please bear with it for a while.

387
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,600
Are you alright?

388
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,120
Driver, watch the road.

389
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:06,960
When we arrive,

390
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,510
I'll make you some goji berry and snow fungus soup.

391
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,480
The goji berries here are excellent.

392
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,680
Since when did goji berries become

393
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,350
an Australian specialty?

394
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,240
Or are you saying

395
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,720
Linkang County suddenly changed its name to Australia?

396
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,810
Xiaofei, I-

397
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,730
Ms. Li.

398
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,330
Alright.

399
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:20,920
Ms. Li,

400
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,920
I really didn't mean to deceive you.

401
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:24,980
Didn't mean to?

402
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,640
Then why did you wear a sweater

403
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,540
to pretend it's winter in the Southern Hemisphere?

404
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,240
This is more than intentional.

405
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,560
This is premeditated.

406
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,610
A planned deception of my sister.

407
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,250
If I weren't so smart,

408
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,540
she'd still be foolishly believing you.

409
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,300
What's the matter?

410
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,030
Don't want me to tell the truth?

411
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,040
Too bad. You want to pretend,

412
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,230
but heaven won't let you.

413
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,090
You're not even putting effort into your lies.

414
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,110
You showed my sister the stars and the moon.

415
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,700
Don't you know the angle of the moon is different

416
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,100
in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres?

417
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,510
Do you even know how to drive?

418
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:56,920
I'm sorry.

419
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,480
-Sorry.
-I want to file a complaint.

420
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,240
Driver,

421
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,070
please focus.

422
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,240
Are you okay?

423
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,310
I-I-I'm fine.

424

[Yunzhong Guesthouse]

425
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,120
We're here.

426
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,110
Finally, we're here.

427
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,730
I'm exhausted.

428
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,510
Don't touch my sister.

429
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,520
I had no intention of touching your sister.

430
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,680
Fei, you really should lose some weight.

431
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,830
Do you have a misunderstanding about what's fat and what's thin?

432
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,070
Ms. Qin Fei!

433
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,440
I've missed you so much.

434
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,720
I've missed you too.

435
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,550
What brings you here?

436
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,380
Are you Ms. Li?

437
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,070
Yes, I am.

438
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,250
Are you happy to see me?

439
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,340
I feel like you've grown taller.

440
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,410
Two centimeters.

441
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,260
That's great.

442
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,420
Growing two centimeters still doesn't make you 1.6 meters tall.

443
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,380
What's so impressive about that?

444
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,400
-What do you mean?
-Ms. Qin,

445
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,400
who is he?

446
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,700
Free child labor.

447
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,640
I'm her brother. Her real brother.

448
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,100
Sister,

449
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,160
let's go take a walk in the courtyard.

450
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,040
Move the luggage!

451
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,400
Look at this courtyard. Isn't it great?

452
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,640
It's really nice indeed.

453
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,680
You are our guesthouse's

454
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,800
first guest.

455
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,610
I'm the first guest?

456
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,310
That won't do.

457
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,970
Business can't be this quiet.

458
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,410
Don't worry.

459
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,780
I like a lively atmosphere.

460
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,380
I'll help promote it for you.

461
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,500
You've quit the industry.

462
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,680
Got it. No need to thank me.

463
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,050
Let's go inside and take a look.

464
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:53,580
Let's go.

00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,540
What is this?

467
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,390
This is Mr. Xing's idea.

468
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,610
Interesting, isn't it?

469
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,700
He said room numbers are too ordinary,

470
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,930
so he came up with these words.

471
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:10,650
He thinks

472
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,220
it's more in line with young people's preferences nowadays.

473
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,010
Guests just need to choose one that suits them,

474
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,100
and we'll know

475
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,560
what their needs are.

476
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,620
Like with Mr. Xing,

477
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,960
his word is "busy."

478
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,080
Because he says he's considered a volunteer here.

479
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,790
That's because

480
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:27,740
there's no word for "liar" in here.

00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:34,270
Okay.

488
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,600
Let's give "lazy" to Cheng.

489
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,220
Why am I lazy?

490
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,270
Are you indirectly

491
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,130
saying I'm not doing proper work?

492
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,620
Ms. Qin, I didn't say anything!

493
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,430
You should go check out your room.

494
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:46,960
Let's go.

495
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,350
Ms. Qin, go take a look over there quickly.

00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,580

I'm waiting for you.

00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,200
I'll leave the luggage here for now.

508
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,000
Let me know if you need anything.

Yes.

Ms. Li.

513
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,260
Can I talk to you?

514
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,050
Go ahead.

515
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:44,840
I...

516
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,150
Something did happen to me recently.

517
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,750
But I didn't know how to tell you.

518
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,570
I know you've made a big decision

519
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:54,180
to study and prepare for the college entrance exam.

520
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,760
That's why I especially didn't want

521
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,200
my problems to affect you at this time.

522
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,260
Do you understand?

523
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,370
Are you done?

524
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:03,350
Shouldn't you be telling me

525
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,240
what exactly is going on with you?

526
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:06,670
I...

527
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:07,580
Fei.

528
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:08,920
I'm hungry.

529
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,200
I want to eat the sheep tied up at the door.

530
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:20,390
This Cheng is really annoying.

531
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,270
He even wanted to eat my sheep.

532
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:24,470
That's my pet,

533
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:26,010
not food.

534
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,780
Ms. Qin Fei is really something.

535
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,910
She could've come,

536
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,740
but she didn't even tell me she was bringing such an annoying person.

537
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,700
I mean,

538
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:38,270
I didn't know Ms. Qin Fei was coming early either.

539
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,060
Alright, stop pretending.

540
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,480
So,

541
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,070
what are you hiding from Ms. Qin Fei

542
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,760
that made you come here alone?

543
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,470
What?

544
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,040
Are you trying to gather information

545
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,520
to tell Qin Fei, right?

546
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,970
I won't, I swear.

547
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,730
What's wrong?

548
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,280
Your leg hurts, doesn't it?

549
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,630
Come, let me take a look.

550
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,050
Let me see.

551
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,240
Slowly.

552
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,160
It's okay.

553
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:05,770
Come.

554
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:09,260
Come, that's right, lean on me.

555
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:09,930
Let me see.

556
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:11,560
Come.

557
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,550
Bend your leg.

558
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:13,640
Bend it.

559
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,170
Bend.

560
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:15,850
Bend.

561
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,320
Does it hurt?

562

can you check if my movements are correct?

no one can change her mind.

750
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:23,550
Anyway, if she doesn't approve of you,

751
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,950
no amount of effort will make a difference.

752
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:30,890
Are you talking about me or yourself?

753
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,560
Of course I'm talking about you.

754
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,420
Is that so?

755
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,800
I've known your sister for so long.

756
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,200
How come I've never heard she has a brother?

757
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,690
Yes,

758
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,190
even if she doesn't like me

759
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,110
and doesn't want to acknowledge me as her brother,

760
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,250
don't get cocky.

761
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,630
She'll soon dislike you too.

762
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,120
Even if she doesn't like me,

763
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,210
I'm still her brother.

764
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,540
We're related by blood.

765
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,480
But if she doesn't like you,

766
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,660
you'll have no connection to her at all.

767
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,460
You'll be worse off than me then.

768
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:02,090
Xing Zhizhi!

769
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:06,400
Xing Zhizhi,

770
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,720
you bullied my sister!

771
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,420
Fei,

772
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,210
let's go.

773
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,320
Come with me.

774
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,230
Fei!

Are you sure you've got the right person?

779
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:24,480
Alright, Xiaofei.

780
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,020
Please stop crying, okay?

781
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,610
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

782
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,080
Can you please stop crying?

783
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,140
Don't cry anymore.

784
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:32,780
I'm really sorry.

785
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,030
I'll stop crying.

786
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,200
So you're sick.

787
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:42,960
Why didn't you tell me?

788
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:45,140
How did you know?

789
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,460
Never mind how I found out.

790
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,850
It's okay.

791
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:02,530
I can solve my own problem.

792
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,950
When is

793
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,490
the follow-up check?

794
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,330
In about 40 days or so.

795
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,000
Chubby.

796
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,300
It's okay.

797
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,170
I know there are many diseases

798
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,560
that are difficult to cure,

799
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,760
but it doesn't mean they're incurable.

800
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,840
Don't worry. You can do it.

801
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:32,180
You just need to remember

802
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,530
that no matter what happens in the future,

803
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:36,340
I'll always be with you.

804
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:39,610
Okay.

805
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,550
So now,

806
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,870
we don't need to think about anything.

807
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,100
Be happy.

808
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:49,170
Just think about one thing.

809
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,650
What's that?

810
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,010
Just think about

811
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,020
what we'll do together tomorrow.

812
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:15,100

00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,080
They've made up already?

815
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:34,810
Fei is way too easy-going.

816
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,260
I told you so.

817
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,980
I promise Xing's character is impeccable.

818
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,600
Nothing serious could happen.

819
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,330
Besides,

820
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,360
Fei isn't stupid.

821
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,030
It's good that they've reconciled.

822
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,430
Here, have some milk tea.

823

Amy?

824
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,490
Mr. Ren isn't available at the moment,

825
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:54,800
but he'll definitely have time.

826
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,720
No problem.

827
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:56,750
Okay, okay, okay.

828
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:58,120
Alright, Mr. Ren said

829
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,480
that we're counting on you

830
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,230
to find new talents for Xingyi,

831
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,400
Amy.

832
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,250
Okay, okay, okay.

833
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,070
Thank you, thank you.

834
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,480
Alright, thanks.

835
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,540
That's all for now.

836
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:09,550
Okay.

837
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:10,610
Goodbye, goodbye.

838
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:13,690
Not bad, Boss Coffee.

839
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,030
You sure can change your tune quickly.

840
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,030
How come I feel

841
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:19,190
now that the company has no artists,

842
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,300
you're even busier than before?

843
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,760
You don't even have time to talk to me anymore.

844
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,610
People

845
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,490
need to grow.

846
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,750
And precisely because we have no artists,

847
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,610
we need to work harder to recruit.

848
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:29,510
Fei is now a shareholder of Xingyi.

849
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:30,440
Since she's not here,

850
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,700
shouldn't I keep an eye on things for her?

851
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:34,540
Yu Zhecheng,

852
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,230
let me tell you.

853
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,870
You need to adapt.

854
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,730
Also, you have to open up

855
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,030
your mindset.

856
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:45,660
After all, in the future, your girlfriend

857
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:48,990
is going to be a strong, independent woman.

858
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:50,430
Let me tell you,

859
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,120
as long as you behave and listen, in the future,

860
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,980
you'll have the best of everything

861
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,270

However,

863
00:42:58,270 --> 00:42:59,410
if I find out

864
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,310
that you've teamed up with others to deceive me,

865
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:03,900
then I'll...

866
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,330
Ms. Coffee,

867
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,090
I, your boyfriend, have a broad perspective too.
