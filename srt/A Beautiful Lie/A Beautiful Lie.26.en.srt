00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,340
Liu Yanze?

188
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,480
Can you hear me clearly?

189
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,500
I'm Li Xue.

190
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,960
Did you recognize me?

191
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,580
Of course I did.

192
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,130
Li Xue.

193
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,930
You finally woke up.

194
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,200
You have no idea

195
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,320
how dangerous it was

196
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,960
the day you were brought to the hospital.

197
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,780
You almost scared me to death.

198
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,020
Don't worry.

199
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,070
The surgery Director Ge Anpei performed on you

200
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,300
was very successful.

201
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,790
Rest well.

202
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,220
Everything will be fine.

203
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,750
Thank you

204
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,100
for taking care of me these days.

205
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,530
I felt it.

206
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,150
Then you'd better get well soon.

207
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:34,190
You're really clingy.

208
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,500
I don't want to let you go.

209
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,580
Be good.

210
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,120
I'll be back soon.

211
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,390
Your friend Liu Yanze

212
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,970
hasn't fully recovered yet.

213
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:49,450
Aren't you worried about your friend if you leave like this?

214
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,360
Come on.

215
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,370
Don't worry.

216
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,800
I saw him yesterday.

217
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,510
This guy is as strong as an ox

218
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,920
and recovering really quickly.

219
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,720
He'll be fine.

220
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,920
Then I want to see you off.

221
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,050
This way we can be together a little longer.

222
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:02,850
No need.

223
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,260
Don't you dislike goodbyes?

224
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,080
You'll be sad then.

225
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,450
I don't want to make you sad.

226
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,150
But being apart from you makes me sadder.

227
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,740
Besides, I can help you carry your luggage.

228
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,440
No, no, no need.

229
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,010
You have no strength.

230
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,230
We've already agreed

231
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,870
that Yu Zhecheng will send me off.

232
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:15,960
Speaking of this guy,

233
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,740
is he reliable?

234
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,900
When is he coming?

235
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,050
He's here.

236
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:20,870
Wait for me, okay?

237
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,000
I'll go get the door.

238
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,080
You're finally here.

239
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,510
If you hadn't shown up,

240
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,870
Qin Fei would have sent me to the airport.

241
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,730
I can't convince her. Help me out.

242
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,790
Qin Fei, you're here too?

243
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,550
I came to send Xing off.

244
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,690
Well...

245
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,670
our professor said he would go with us.

246
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,560
I don't think my car can fit all of us.

247
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,570
How about…

248
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,330
Alright, you guys go ahead.

249
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,120
Okay then.

250
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,760
Xing, hurry up. I'll be waiting for you at the door.

251
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,260
Alright.

252
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,150
I'll be back soon.

253
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,180
I'll be waiting for you to come back.

254
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:56,840
Okay.

255
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,680
Take care of yourself.

256
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,510
I'm off.

257
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,390
I'll see you out.

258
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,260

262
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,040
What have you been up to lately, Mr. Xing?

263
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,880
You haven't messaged me in a while.

264
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,740
Are you not talking to me anymore?

265
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,490
I've been a bit busy recently.

266
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,200
How are you?

267
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,530
Are you recovering well?

268
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,170
I'm recovering very well.

269
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,860
My leg hardly hurts anymore.

270
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,950
Oh, by the way, Mr. Xing,

271
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,750
Uncle and Aunt have turned the house

272
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,060
we stayed in into a B&amp;B.

273
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,710
I'll send you some photos to take a look.

00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,040
How does it look?

277
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,640
It looks great.

278
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,380
Yeah.

279
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,270

Let me.

288
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,850
You must be exhausted, aren't you?

289
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:12,850
No.

290

Dr. Xing,

we've been wanting to have you over for a long time.

00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,600

Yes.

You are our Xixi's savior!

296
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,550
Aunt, you flatter me.

297
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,630
It was the least I could do.

298
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,550
Thank you so much, thank you.

299
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,480

-Have a seat.

Come.

308
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,280
Xixi, where's your cousin?

309
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,990
He's studying at university in Harbin,

310
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,390
so he's usually not home.

311
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,720
Yes, yes.

312
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,750

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,080
All these dishes

314
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,320
are from our own garden.

315
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,500
And this chicken

316
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:50,410
is a free-range chicken.

317
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,100
I hope it suits your taste, Dr. Xing.

00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,090
-Have a taste.
-Let me try.

319
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,280

00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,270
It's delicious.

321
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,070
Then have some more.

322
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,200
You usually can't find these

323

00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,030

Why didn't she come with you?

327
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:09,730
She's busy.

328
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,790
Come on.

329
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,920
She's already retired from the entertainment industry.

330
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,350
What could she possibly be busy with?

331
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,550
She posts on Moments from home

332
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,340

335
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,900
Please don't tell your Ms. Qin Fei, okay?

336
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,230
Did you two have a fight?

337
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,640
Or did you run away from home?

338
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,510
Or did she kick you out?

339
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,730

00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,880

It's really A?

You were just guessing, weren't you?

595
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:23,380
When we draw the line,

596
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,120
we get the third proposition.

597
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,040
When A is greater than zero and less than one,

598
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,860
there are indeed two intersection points.

599
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,380

Only option A considers the third proposition a false statement,

00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,520
Even your mom doesn't care about it, so why should you?

743
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,630
She didn't contact you, did she?

744
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:50,020
Maybe she didn't contact you because she supports me staying here.

745
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,670
Maybe she even hopes

746
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,960
I can bond with you,

747
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,310
Sis,

748
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,200
Just leave!

749
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,420
Your wound hasn't completely healed yet.

750
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,530
Don't think everything will be fine after you're discharged.

751
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:08,370
After you return to the team,

752
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:09,670
you can't start training right away

753
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,420
and definitely can't engage in strenuous exercise.

754
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,580
You also need to pay special attention to your diet.

755
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,300
No greasy or spicy food,

756
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,630
and eat more protein.

757
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:19,820
Take the medicine the doctor prescribed on time.

758
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,470
I will remind you every day.

759
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:22,690

I have already sent the details to your email.

765

If you have any concerns,

766
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,050

and their families are included in it.

770
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,410
Alright.

771
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,060
I'll consult professionals for the details.

772
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,790
I won't understand it even if you explain it to me.

You are the investor,

775
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,270
so I need to clarify

776
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,560
these things with you.

777
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:54,370

778
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:56,700

779
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,270
their donation ceremony.

780
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,160
What's wrong?

781
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,590
I've said before that the only condition for me

782
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:10,740
to fund this foundation is anonymity.

783
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:13,870
It's really not because of Liu Yanze.

784
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:16,940
Well...

785
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,400
It used to be,

786
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,240
but this time it really isn't.

787
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,510
This time in the hospital,

788
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,880
I saw many

789
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,250
team members who gave up treatment

790
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,310
due to difficult family conditions.

791
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,410
Their families could do nothing

792
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,610
but feel sad.

793
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,790
I don't want anyone else

794
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:33,200
to bear this feeling of helplessness.

795
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,960
You both know

796
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,220
that I almost became one of them before,

797
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,010
but I didn't hold on until the end.

798
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,810
They are braver than I am.

799
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,180
I want to do my best

800
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,000
to help them.

801
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,620

803
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,100
go and tell the rescue team

804
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,850
that I won't be attending the donation ceremony.

A couple of days ago,

808

our team received a donation

809
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,500
from a kind-hearted individual.

810
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,500

927
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,030
Women.

928
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,690
Hello, your package is here.

929
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:12,830
Thank you.

930
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:12,930
[Sun Muscat]
Thank you.

931
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,110
[Sun Muscat]

932
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,650
Lu Yicheng, can you be a bit quicker?

933
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,870
I asked you to wash some grapes.

934
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:25,730
Are you trying to grow them there?

935
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,770
Qin Fei, I protest.

936
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,320
I'm still a minor.

937
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,410
Employing child labor

938
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,170
is unethical and illegal.

939
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:32,930
Protest denied.

940
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:35,660
You can call the police or just go back to your mom.

941
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,250
Delicious.

942
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:42,600
Even if they're not delicious, you've already bought them.

943
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:45,000
I'll send two boxes to your dad and mom,

944
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,210
and then

945
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,360
send two boxes each to Coffee, Zhizu, Xiaoxiao,

946
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,960
and Ren Siqi.

947
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,840
As for Xing Zhizhi Hospital,

948
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,890
I'll just have Xixi send 20 boxes directly there.

949
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:57,240
Should I send some

950
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,920
to your teachers and classmates too?

951
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,130
Your naivety has reached a dangerous level.

952
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:03,080
Qin Fei, you really need to be more careful.

953
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,140
If you can talk, then talk;

954
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,430
if not, just shut up.

955
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,170
You're still in the mood for grapes?

956
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,240
Xing Zhizhi has been lying to you for so many days;

957
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,550
there must be something wrong with him.

958
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,380
What could be wrong?

959
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,510
Are you just stirring up trouble here?

960
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,340
I'm now 100% sure

961
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:21,270
that he's definitely not in Australia.

962
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:23,460
I'm now 100% sure

963
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:24,720
that you're about to leave my house.

964
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,480
What are you doing?

965
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,070
Qin Fei.

966
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,760
I... I didn't say I was leaving.

967
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,630
It's the middle of the night.

968
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,030
Can you really bear to see

969
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,320
a minor

970
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,440
stranded on the streets?

971
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,970
I'm under the protection of the Law on the Protection of Minors!

972
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,380
Qin Fei, you're being a coward.

973
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:40,900
Are you afraid of finding out he's a jerk,

974
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,270
realizing you misjudged him,

975
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:43,080
and being embarrassed?

976
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,960
I... I'm not mocking you.

977
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:46,800
I... I'm helping you.

978
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,370
I can prove it.

979
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,000
[Sun Muscat Grapes]

980
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,830
The grapes Xixi sent you
[Sun Muscat Grapes]

981
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:54,880
[Sun Muscat Grapes]

982
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:54,910
are called Sun Muscat,
[Sun Muscat Grapes]

983
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,320
are called Sun Muscat,

984
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,920
which require a very specific growing environment.

985
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,880
The grapes you saw in the video call with Xing Zhizhi

986
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,550
were Sun Muscat,

987
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:04,700
just like the ones Xixi sent you.

988
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,000
But in Australia,

989
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,960
it's not the season for Sun Muscat.

990
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:11,320
So Xing Zhizhi is definitely not in Australia.

991
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,590
He's with Xixi.

992
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:15,300
Is this your evidence?

993
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:16,340
So what?

994
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,180
They can't buy grapes in Australia;

995
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,730
they must grow their own grapes, right?

996
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:22,330
Well then, why don't we do another experiment?

997
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:25,490
[Qin Xiaofei]
[Decline] [Answer]

998
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:34,650
My God.

999
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,200
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

1000
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,260
Cheng?
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

1001
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:53,490
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

1002
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:54,300
Hello.
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

1003
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:54,320
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

1004
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,330
My sister told me you're in Australia.
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

1005
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:56,450
My sister told me you're in Australia.

1006
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,200
We received the grapes you sent.

1007
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,530
They taste pretty good.

1008
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:02,040
They weren't sent by me.

1009
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:02,890
They were sent

1010
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,520
by a girl named Xixi.

1011
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,090
She said this year's grape harvest is bountiful

1012
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,970
and that Ms. Qin Fei must try some.

1013
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:08,990
These grapes

1014
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,970
look exactly like the ones from your neighbor.

1015
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:12,970
I thought they were sent by you.

1016
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:15,910
How could I send you grapes from Australia?

1017
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,420
So you've been abroad for so many days.

1018
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:18,690
Have you gone out to have some fun?

1019
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:18,780
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]
Have you gone out to have some fun?

1020
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:18,800
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

1021
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,620
Have you been to the Sydney Opera House?
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

1022
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,590
Send some photos for us to see, will you?
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

1023
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:22,820
Send some photos for us to see, will you?

1024
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,430
The hospital schedule is busy.

1025
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:26,230
I don't have time to go out at all.

1026
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,290
What a pity.

1027
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,430
So, in Australia, you...

1028
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,450
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

1029
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:32,560
Don't listen to his nonsense.
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

1030
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,620
Rebellious phase.
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

1031
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,160
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

1032
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,040
I can tell.
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

1033
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:35,070
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

1034
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,030
Just like you.
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

1035
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:36,930
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

1036
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,230
Xiaofei,

1037
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,110
have you finished your homework?

1038
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:43,420
Of course!

1039
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,410
I've been studying according to your plan.

1040
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,740
I've already come to solid geometry in math.

1041
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:48,800
[Mic on] [Speaker on] [Camera on]
I've already come to solid geometry in math.

1042
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:48,830
[Mic on] [Speaker on] [Camera on]

1043
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:50,670
I only got two questions wrong today.
[Mic on] [Speaker on] [Camera on]

1044
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:51,430
I only got two questions wrong today.

1045
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,320
I found

1046
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,880
solid geometry

1047
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,230
easier than functions.

1048
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,480
It just requires proving perpendicularity

1049
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,590
or parallelism;

1050
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,550
there's no need to memorize any formulas.

1051
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:02,590
Hurry up.

1052
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:05,350
Xiaofei,

1053
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:06,430
why did it suddenly go dark on your end?

1054
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:07,290
What happened?

1055
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:10,160
Nothing. It just lagged for a moment.

1056
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:11,990
It's raining here today.

1057
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,730
How's the weather on your side?

1058
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:17,320
It's a bright sunny day in Sydney.

1059
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:18,930
The stars look beautiful here,

1060
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,840
just as beautiful as they were when we went camping.

1061
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,070
Oh, I...

1062
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,120
I want to see it.

1063
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:23,250
I've never seen

1064
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:23,930
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]
I've never seen

1065
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:23,960
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

1066
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,470
the starry sky in Sydney.
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

1067
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:26,290
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

1068
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:27,040
Sure.
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

1069
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:27,480
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

1070
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,050
Wait. Let me show you.
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

1071
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:30,140
[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

1072
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:39,970
Look.

1073
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:41,540
Is it beautiful?

1074
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:44,720
Yes, it is.

1075
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:46,400
Xiaofei,

1076
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:48,900
What is the next line after

1077
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:51,270
"The bright moon rises over the sea, and at this moment, we share the same sky?"

1078
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:52,860
Dr. Xing,

1079
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,990
if you're going to do a surprise check,

1080
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:56,650
I'm going to hang up the phone.

1081
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,480
The next line is:

1082
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:00,650
Xiaofei,

1083
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,050
I miss you.

1084
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:06,170
What kind of odd poem is this?

1085
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,300
It neither has parallelism nor rhymes;

1086
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,900
only the central idea and meaning are okay.

1087
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,510
Alright.

1088
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:14,050
Let's call it a day.

1089
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:15,770
You should go to sleep early.

1090
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:17,120
I need to study too.

1091
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,370
I'll call you tomorrow.

1092
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,560
Okay.

1093
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:22,250
Go to sleep early, good night.

1094
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:36,210
Why do you have that smile again?

1095
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,110
It's sunny in Sydney,

1096
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:38,300
and it's sunny where Xing Zhizhi is.

1097
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,630
What's wrong with that?

1098
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:41,280
Fei,

1099
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:42,360
I don't even know whether to say

1100
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,250
that Xing Zhizhi is too smart or that you are too foolish,

1101
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:47,620
or that he's treating you like a fool.

1102
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:49,800
You can't see something so obvious.

1103
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:51,240
Come on, follow me.

1104
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:54,510
What are you up to now?

1105
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:00,150
Look.

1106
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,570
Look at the moon.

1107
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,660
The waxing crescent moon is in

1108
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,960
the first half of the night during the first half of the month,

1109
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,350
with its surface facing west and located in the western sky.

1110
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:11,070
The waning crescent moon is in the last half of the night during the last half of the month,

1111
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:12,070
with its surface facing east

1112
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:13,750
and located in the eastern sky.

1113
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:17,010
This mnemonic applies to the moon phases in the Northern Hemisphere.

1114
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:18,800
The moon seen in the Southern Hemisphere

1115
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,920
should be the opposite of what we see in terms of up and down, left and right.

1116
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:22,230
This is today's moon phase in Australia.

1117
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:24,080
[Australian Moon Phase: Waning Gibbous]
This is today's moon phase in Australia.

1118
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:24,370
[Australian Moon Phase: Waning Gibbous]

1119
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,090
But what about the moon that Xing Zhizhi showed you earlier?

1120
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:32,450
[Australian Moon Phase: Waning Gibbous]

1121
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:36,800
Do you understand now?

1122
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:39,320
Xing Zhizhi is not in Australia at all.

1123
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,190
He is also in the Northern Hemisphere like you.

1124
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:43,880
Moreover, Xing Zhizhi's moon is on his west side,

1125
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,660
while ours is on the east side.

1126
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:47,940
This means his local time is later than yours,

1127
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,890
and his longitude is also smaller,

1128
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,840
placing him further west.

1129
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:53,740
For example, the grape-producing area,

1130
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:54,620
Linkang County.
