00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,870
I really can't leave my family right now.

7
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,800
I can't do the on-site assignment.

8
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,530
I know you need to coordinate.

9
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:46,900
Alright.

10
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,680
I'll wait for further notice then.

11
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,630
What's wrong, Qian?

12
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,840
Why are you sighing?

13
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,280
It's about the 'Rescue Operation'.

14
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,430
the on-site assignment for the show.

15
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,560
I had already agreed with the medical department

16
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,710
that I'd go for a few days.

17
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,520
But unexpectedly, something came up at home.

18
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,650
I can't get away now.

19
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,990
I see.

20
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,250
It's really a troublesome situation.

21
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,390
How about this?

22
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,310
You tell the medical department

23
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,500
that I'll go in your place.

24
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,410
Really?

25
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,630
I'm so grateful to you.

26
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,520
We're colleagues.

27
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,840
Everyone has emergencies sometimes.

28
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,030
You can make it up next time, right?

29
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,280
Okay, I'll give them a call then.

30
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,920
Okay.

31
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,340
I'll definitely treat you to a meal later.

32
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,080
It's me, it's me.

33
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,410
I've found someone to replace me.

34
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,090
Okay.

35
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,030
Come on in.

36
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,840
We've been talking about you.

37
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,240
Please, come in, come in.

38
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,250
Let me introduce,

39
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,530
this is our show's

Xiao Jie.

42
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,010
Ms. Xiao.

43
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,910
And this is

44
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,680
the expert from the rehabilitation department,

45
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,590
Mr. Xing,

47
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,840
Hello,

48
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,800
I'm Xing Zhizhi.

49
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,160
Hello,

00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,920

[The last thing I need right now]

52
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,560
Fei, what are you doing?

53
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,760
I'm trying on makeup.

54
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,370
Come here.

55
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,260
Help me check my makeup, quickly.

56
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,770
Look at my makeup.

57
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,120
Does it give the impression of someone

58
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,120
putting on a brave face while suffering from illness?

59
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,960
Fragile,

60
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:32,430
but without losing a strong vibe.

61
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,930
Fei, you're being crafty.

62
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,870
Putting on such careful makeup,

63
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,880
are you trying to take the chance to

64
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,380
win over Dr. Xing?

65
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,440
Ke Feifei, come on.

66
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,430
I injured my back, not my head.

67
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,840
You think I'm like you?

68
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,870
I absolutely won't fall into the trap of love.

69
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,400
I won't cross that line.

70
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:51,570
Then why are you putting on such careful makeup?

71
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,000
Didn't Xiaoxiao secure

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,020
a week for us?

73
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:56,880
We can't just

74
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,110
leave the production team hanging.

75
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,740
I can't just lie here by myself.

76
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,530
I'm being discharged tomorrow.

77
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,420
Go and pack up.

78
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:02,970
Tomorrow?

79
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,660
Alright, hurry up and pack.

80
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,080
Don't be in a rush tomorrow.

81
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,480
-No, I...
-Don't bother.

82
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,270
Putting on makeup?

83
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:11,930
Not bad.

84
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,350
You look quite lively.

85
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,310
I'll wait for you outside the ward.

86
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,920
Something urgent.

87
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,870
Dr. Xing, I'm going out to buy stuff.

88
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,370
Please take care of Fei for me.

89
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,130
Alright.

90
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,630
Dr. Xing,

91
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,890
thanks for your care recently.

92
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,210
After I'm discharged,

93
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,310
I'll definitely have Ren Siqi

94
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,240
send you a banner of appreciation.

95
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,380
It will say

96
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,380
'Miraculous Healing'

97
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,210
or

98
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,970
'Benevolent Doctor &amp; Skills.'

99
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,090
What are you doing?

00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,550
[Name: Qin Fei]
[Responsible Doctor: Xing Zhizhi]

101
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:06,950
Ms. Qin, as your

102
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,190
attending doctor during your hospital recovery,

103
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,630
I'm telling you clearly

104
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:11,270
that given your current physical condition,

105
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,720
[Name: Qin Fei]
[Responsible Doctor: Xing Zhizhi]
that given your current physical condition,

106
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,070
that given your current physical condition,

107
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,970
tomorrow is not suitable for discharge.

108
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,670
So, your banner of appreciation

109
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,550
should be saved for a month later.

110
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,110
Dr. Xing,

111
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,720
what if I insist on being discharged tomorrow?

112
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,130
Will you force me to stay?

113
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,400
As far as I know,

114
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,220
the hospital doesn't have that authority, right?

115
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,680
I still feel uneasy.

116
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,370
Maybe I should go check on her.

117
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,580
Coffee,

118
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,200
I've figured it out.

119
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:50,870
When you're by my side,

120
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,200
you can never sit still.

121
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,390
You delivered food to Fei,

122
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,190
but you haven't eaten, have you?

123
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,560
As for Fei,

124
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,270
Xing Zhizhi is taking care of her.

125
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,950
And I'll

126
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,530
take care of you.

127
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,030
Eat with peace of mind.

128
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,080
Eat.

129
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,800
Come on, eat more.

130
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,460
You've lost weight recently.

131
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,270
You eat too.

132
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,160
Eat more meat. Have some meat.

133
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,800
Here.

134
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,750
It's full.

135
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,300
Oh, right.

136
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,700
There's something Xing Zhizhi wanted me

137
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,830
to discuss with you.

138
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:54,650
What is it?

139
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,300
During the time Fei is hospitalized,

140
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,260
could you be on the same side as him?

141
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,800
What do you mean?

142
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,090
He's afraid Fei won't behave

143
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,180
and stay in the hospital properly.

144
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,090
So he's thinking about

145
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,220
finding someone to keep him informed?

146
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,240
Yu Zhecheng,

147
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,700
you want me to be a traitor?

148
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,150
Coffee,

149
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,930
blind loyalty is not advisable.

150
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,480
Do you know that if her lumbar spondylolisthesis

151
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,830
gets worse,

152
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,830
what consequences it might lead to?

153
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,190
Are your legs numb?

154
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,710
Since you were admitted,

155
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,540
apart from the persistent lower back pain,

156
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,230
have you been experiencing pain

157
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,090
from your legs down to your heels?

158
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,540
I fell and now my whole body aches.

159
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,180
What's wrong?

160
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,100
Nothing.

161
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,510
You have lumbar spondylolisthesis.

162
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,510
In mild cases, there are no obvious symptoms.

163
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,700
Some patients experience persistent lower back pain,

164
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,600
or lower back pain accompanied by

165
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,190
radiating pain in the lower limbs

166
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,450
and numbness, among other symptoms.

167
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,280
Just like what you're experiencing now.

168
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,490
Dr. Xing,

169
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,120
I've injured my back before.

170
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,160
I've been feeling this way for a while now.

171
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,960
It doesn't affect my life at all.

172
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,040
Your current degree of lumbar spondylolisthesis

173
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,910
is between grade one and two.

174
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,490
If you don't take it seriously and rest,

175
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,080
and let it continue to worsen,

176
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,480
you're likely to develop spinal stenosis,

177
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,700
resulting in neurogenic intermittent claudication

178
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,690
and abnormal walking posture when bending or flexing your hips.

179
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,750
Do you understand?

180
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,710
I don't understand any of this medical jargon.

181
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,670
I know my own body.

182
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,550
You don't need to scare me.

183
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,770
Scare you?

184
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,020
What are you doing?

185
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:54,960
Don't move.

186
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,130
Now you feel the pain.

187
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,260
Do you still think I'm just trying to scare you?

188
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,150

00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,390

379
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,780
Dr. Xing signed it?

380
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,880
Is this real? You wrote it yourself, didn't you?

381
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,430
How could I possibly write it myself?

382
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,020
I've already said I'm fine.

383
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:34,880
Tell the production team

384
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,540
I can return to work tomorrow.

385
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,260
I don't agree.

Anyway,

388
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,220
the production team has stopped work

389
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:45,970
for reorganization.

390
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:46,640
They can wait.

391
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,540
No, Ren Siqi,

392
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,210
you need to understand.

393
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,490
Whether the production team waits for me or not

394
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,760
depends on Ms. Xiao's arrangements.

395
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,260
But whether I return and when I return

396
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,460
shows my attitude.

397
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,270
I'm going back one way or another.

398
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,550
You might as well take the chance

399
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,480
to create an positive image of me being not afraid of illness

400
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,120
and returning to the show despite being injured.

401
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,860
Perhaps this kind of professional spirit

402
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,320
could bring the company some

403
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,960
possibilities for future cooperation.

00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,650

You're injured,

407
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,120
and I'd use this to make a fuss

408
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,320
and create hype?

409
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,970
I'm not asking you to hype it up.

410
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,480
It's precisely because I want to give it my all

411

and leave no regrets.

412

"Don't think that just because we kissed,

00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,870
favor either.

558
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,070
How old are you?

559
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,350
Do you find it interesting

560
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,390
speaking like me?

561
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,530
I'm 27.

562
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,710
What do you mean 27?

563
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,720
I'm 27 years old now.

564
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,320
I'll be 28 after my birthday.

565
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:42,550
What... what does your age have to do with me?

566
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,610
I'm 27 years old,

567
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,240
which proves

568
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,040
I've been an adult for a long time.

569
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,330
Where

570
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,920
or on whom

571
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,870
I waste time

572
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,300
is none of your business.

574
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:20,620

♫Longing for you to become the air I breathe♫

585

586

-It hurts here.
-Yeah.

587
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,350
Slowly move up

588
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,950
until you reach the limit.

589
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,610
Yes, that's the first movement.

590
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:17,150
Repeat three to five times daily.

591
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:19,310
The second one involves both hands.

592
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,640
Both hands, imagine I'm the wall.

593
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,680
In this position.

594
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,000
Then slowly lean your body forward.

595
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,270
-Forward.
-Yeah.

596
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,270
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

597
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,400
I can feel that stretching sensation.

598
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,110
Is your back okay?

599
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,880
My back is fine.

600
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,960
But I was scared to death.

601
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,750
Why are you walking so quietly?

602
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,920
Slowly lower down.

603
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,050
Then repeat about three to five times.

604
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,130
I was wondering what you were looking at so intently.

605
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,400
Turns out you were checking out a handsome guy.

606
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,800
Who's that young doctor?

607
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,680
I don't know him.

608
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,830
Stop pretending.

609
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,350
Ms. Xiao already told me.

610
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,680
You specially invited him from Hexi Hospital.

611
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,660
He'll be rotating to stay with the team in the future.

612
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,550
Him?

613
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:01,680
Stay with the team?

614
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,420
I get so annoyed just seeing him.

615
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,410
I need to take a call.

616
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:05,950
Excuse me.

617
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:06,640
Go ahead.

618
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,620
Hello?

619
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,270
Dr. Xing.

620
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,650
I've been

621
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:16,670
overexercising lately.

622
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,300
My muscles are really sore.

623
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,230
Could you check for me?

624
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,330
Sure.

625
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,340
Let's go to my RV then.

00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:24,780
Come on, let's go.

627
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:26,160

629
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,530
You're going to be annoyed.

630
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,240
Dr. Xing,

631
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,480

I've noticed that Jin Weiwei

I was foolishly thinking

that he came to the film set because he was worried about me.

772

Turns out he came specifically to annoy me.
