This time, don't you dare let me down.

9
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,120
I've gone through so much trouble

10

It's like this.

71
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:22,810
When suturing,

72
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,140
you need to insert the needle vertically.

73
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,290
Use the strength of your wrist

74
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,400
to curve out.

75
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,470

When someone's teaching you, focus on learning.

79

Didn't you lie to me too?

124
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,730
You said you don't like me.

125
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,560
But if you really don't like me,

126
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,420
why are you so concerned about me?

Although this game was started by you,

00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,110
only I can call it off.

130
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,480
Admit it.

131

Your body has betrayed you.

132
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:30,660

In your eyes,

134
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,330
is this how love is?

135
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,430
Treating sincerity as a bargaining chip,

00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:45,680
When you get scared,

140
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,040
I have to keep my distance.

141
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,510
When you're not satisfied, I have to give in.

142
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,840
When there are no feelings left, the game is over, is that it?

143
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,430
I originally thought

144
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,940
that after all you've done,

145
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,400
you could at least become a bit more serious.

146
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,800
But now it seems I was thinking too much.

147
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,720
You're still only thinking about winning or losing.

148
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,720
To win,

149
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,920
you can treat others' concern as a joke.

that you would never come to see me again?

327

00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,910
You seem to be taking it well.

367
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,190
Then why were you crying?

368
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,550
I just feel

369
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,750
that I wasted a month

370
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,580
on a meaningless show.

371
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,200
It feels quite regrettable.

372
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,240
I really

373
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,200
don't have much talent for acting.

374
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,550
But I endure hardships when I need to,

375
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,910
and diet when I need to.

376
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,870
I can face myself with a clear conscience.

377
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:46,750
It's just a pity

378
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,610
that the audience can't see this.

379
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,360
However,

380
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,630
if you randomly find someone on the street

381
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,360
and ask if they are satisfied with their job,

382
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,010
they probably won't be.

383
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,360
I'm just getting scolded.

384
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,760
I'm already quite lucky.

385
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,120
Your instinct is smarter than your reason.

386
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,360
Of course.

387
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,270
Your interruption

388
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,380
made me forget

389
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:13,470
that I need to work hard for my supporting actress role.

390
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Eat up.

391
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,600
Did you just insult me?

392
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,020
What do you mean by

393
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:25,930
'instinct is smarter than my reason'?

394
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,000
Xing Zhizhi!

395
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,840
Eat up, eat up.

396
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,480
Yes, loop it.

397
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,180
Senior.

398
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,810
Why are you so nice to me?

399
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,910
Say your line.

400
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,290
Because you

401
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,690
are just like how I was before,

402
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:55,130
coming to medical school with nothing,

403
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,830
wanting to become a doctor,

404
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,890
wanting to make something of myself.

405
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,570
This knot is wrong.

406
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:04,950
Here.

407
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,390
Do you have more thread?

408
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,240
Nope.

409
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,930
Coffee only gave me this much.

410
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:17,480
What are you doing?

411
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:19,880
Back when we were in school,

412
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,680
we would occasionally use girls' hair

413
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,750
to practice tying knots.

414
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,210
You need to practice more.

415
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,220
What girls' hair?

416
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,860
Was it your girlfriend's?

417
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,640
I've never been in a relationship.

418
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,120
That's such a shame.

419
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,700
I heard that medical school

420
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,390
takes seven or eight years.

421
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,020
You missed the opportunity?

422
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,680
When I started university,

423
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,000
I was only fifteen years old,

424
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,330
the youngest in the class.

425
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,440
Who would date me?

426
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,750
You're a genius.

427
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,610
Then why aren't you performing surgeries anymore?

428
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:53,050
Never mind if you don't want to talk about it.

429
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,810
Because of these hands.

430
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,110
Before,

431
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,270
when I was participating in medical aid,

432
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,530
there was an accident.

433
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,070
Whenever I got on the operating table after that, my hands would start shaking.

434
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,070
For safety reasons,

435
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,470
I switched specialties.

436
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,900
So I can really understand

437
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,960
how you felt when you gave up dancing.

438
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,730
Go ahead, pull them out.

439
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,750
Pull out a few more.

440
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,150
Whether tomorrow's audition is successful or not

441
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,160
depends on these hairs

442
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,070
and you.

443
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,640
Then I'll

444
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,110
choose a few long ones.

445
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,310
How come you already have white hair?

446
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,640
Don't talk nonsense.

447
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,830
It's impossible.

448
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,950
Okay, okay.

449
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,510
Coffee knows the passcode.

450
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,640
I'll go check.

451
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,790
Who is it?

452
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,280
Xiaoxiao?

453
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,640
Xiaoxiao, what brings you here?

454
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,640
Come in quickly.

455
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,900
Did you watch the show?

456
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,310
Are you okay?

457
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,790
I was worried that after watching the show,

458
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,880
it might affect your mood

459
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,830
and you'd be nervous about joining the crew tomorrow.

460
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,030
I came over specially

461
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,480
to help you relax a bit.

462
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,920
You still don't know me well enough.

463
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm experienced.

464
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,690
There's nothing to be nervous about.

465
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,620
But you,

466
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,030
do you have something on your mind?

467
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,790
What could I possibly have on my mind?

468
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,780
Can't I just care about you?

469
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,750
How are things going

470
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,750
with your Xing?

471
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,200
What's wrong?

472
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,710
I'd like to know that too.

473
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,100
Dr. Xing,

474
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:30,960
you're here.

475
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,890
Hello.

476
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,160
Alright.

477
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,500
I guess I don't need to ask my question anymore.

478
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,720
No, he's here to—

479
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm just here to teach her a few surgical procedures.

480
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,460
She'll need them for her audition tomorrow.

481
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,510
Late-night lessons.

482
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,750
The night is perfect with a man and a woman alone.

483
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,880
Diligent study and practice, very good.

484
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,310
I admire your professional dedication.

485
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:53,960
I...

486
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,870
I'll go open this bottle of wine.

487
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,200
Alright, stop teasing him.

488
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,830
To be honest,

489
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,690
what step have you progressed to?

490
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,400
It's going smoothly.

491
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,220
Do you have any tips to share?

492
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,000
Four words.

493
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,590
Advance step by step.

494
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,400
Love can't be hidden.

495
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,000
What? Have you been reading "Romance of the Three Kingdoms"?

496
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,530
What are you talking about?

497
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,790
Alright.

498
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,250
The wine is ready.

499
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,670
I'll leave the glasses here.

500
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,170
You two chat. I'll head back first.

501
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,920
No way. I can leave, but you can't.

502
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,590
You must stay

503
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:38,660
for her to be successful tomorrow.

504
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:39,450
Right.

505
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,750
Our great actress has spoken.

506
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,550
No one's allowed to leave today.

507
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,690
Dr. Xing.

508
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,720
Let's have a confession session today.

509
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,360
Be honest.

510
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,940
How many girlfriends did you have in college?

511
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,270
I didn't have any.

512
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,720
It's a confession session. You're not being honest.

513
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,120
It's true.

514
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,480
When I was in school, apart from studying,

515
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,350
I just liked to sing and daydream.

516
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,400
As for dating,

517
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,640
I wasn't interested.

518
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,310
You like singing too?

519
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,030
Can you sing Jerry Chou's songs?

520
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,680
Back then, so many girls

521
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,350
turned his lyrics into love letters.

522
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,550
It was so romantic.

523
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:33,720
So you had

524
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,640
such a girlish phase before?

525
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,640
Is that not allowed?

526
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,230
Of course it is.

527
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,770
Things were better when we were young.

528
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,350
People were innocent.

529
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,070
Now it's all different.

530
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,400
Men have become bad.

531
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,640
They get close to you,

532
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,510
then ignore you.

533
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,750
Let me tell you,

534
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,170
look at me.

535
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,600
What do they say?

536
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,830
I've thought about it.

537
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,310
I don't think we're suitable for each other.

538
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,310
We weren't suitable five years ago,

539
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:06,160
and we won't be suitable five years later.

540
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,550
If you say we're not suitable, then fine.

541
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,830
Why did he send me a cake?

542
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,680
He sent a cake but then ignored me again.

543
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,680
What does he want?

544
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,240
Why do you think he's doing this?

545
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,480
I know the answer to this one.

546
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,400
This is called keeping a distance.

547
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,160
Isn't that right, Dr. Xing?

548
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:22,220
I think he might have his reasons,

549
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:22,950
right?

550
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:27,160
Dr. Xing, you're like this too?

551
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,200
I... I...

552
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,790
You can't bully my Qin Fei.

553
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,590
Honey, you…

554
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,680
you need to teach him a lesson.

555
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,960
Teach him a lesson.

556
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,380
I don't know how to teach.

557
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,630
I'll teach you.

558
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,110
Let me show you an example.

559
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,100
Where's my phone?

560
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,240
Where's my phone?

561
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,830
I don't know.

562
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:48,440
Here it is.

563
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,640
Hello?

564
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,440
Liu Yanze.

565
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,440
Who do you think you are?

566
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,680
You stinky man!

567
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,070
You pretend to be mute every day.

568
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,070
Do you think that's hot?

569
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,310
Do you think you're in an idol drama?

570
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,070
You're nothing.

571
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:12,920
How can you be such a fake?

572
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,030
What brand of trash bag are you?

573
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:14,790
Give me a link, will you?

574
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,960
I'll buy it all.

575
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,240
Where are you?

576
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,000
Where am I?

577
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,110
Where I am is none of your business.

578
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,070
Does it matter?

579
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,030
I'm with a handsome guy.

580
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,000
Handsome guy wants to talk on the phone.

581
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,960
Give me your phone.

582
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,100
Have a good chat.

583
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,650
Liu, it's me.

584
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,420
Where is she?

585
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,000
We're at Qin Fei's place.

586
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,830
She just got drunk. Don't worry.

587
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,440
However,

588
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,350
you should come over quickly.

589
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,790
I really can't handle the two of them alone.

590
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,920
Send me your location.

591
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,880
I'm coming over right now.

592
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,230
I'll send you the address in a moment.

593
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,130
Hurry up.

594
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,590
Stop drinking.

595
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,480
You can't drink anymore.

596
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,640
You're joining the crew tomorrow.

597
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,480
You're… not…

598
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,680
Liu Yanze, why are you here again?

599
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,960
You deserted me, and disappeared,

600
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,830
and then refused to repent.

601
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:56,600
You're unforgivable. Your crimes are heinous!

602
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,120
You're drunk.

603
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,880
I can stand steady on my feet.

604
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,770
Liu Yanze.

605
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,030
Don't touch me, you.

606
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,750
Get away from me.

607
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:14,100
What brand of trash bag are you?

608
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,070
You look like Liu Yanze.

609
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:23,290
Go away, go away, go away.

610
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,350
Go away!

611
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,860
You big log.

612
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,150
Clumsy oaf.

613
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,750
Liu Yanze, a show-off.

614
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:32,870
If you keep pretending to be asleep,

615
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,070
I'm going to kiss you.

This scared me!

639
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,200
All men are the same.

640
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,260
They deliberately get close to you and then ignore you.

641
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:00,560
If you ignore me, then we'll ignore you.

[Personal Bodyguard Employment Contract]

643
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,290
We're almost there.

644
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,120
Come in.

645
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:20,800
Hello, Zhao,

646
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,850
about Miss Luo's personal bodyguard,

647
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:23,980
I've accepted it.

648
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,400
Let me emphasize it again to both of you.

649
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,400
We're playing resident doctors, so our makeup and costumes

650
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,370
must be simple.

651
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:45,290
The director hates nothing more than

652
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:46,680
heavy makeup and flashy looks nowadays.

653
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,360
Come.

654
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,880
Coffee, help them carry this.

655
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,150
Here, take it easy.

656
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,570
You can change your shoes here.

657
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,680
Um...

658
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,020
I just remembered something.

659
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,000
I need to talk to Qin Fei

660
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,030
about a work-related matter.

661
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,640
We need to discuss it privately.

662
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,160
Coffee, please take the two staff

663
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,270
downstairs for some refreshments.

664
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,110
Alright?

665
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,680
Just leave these things here.

666
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,110
Come.

667
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:08,830
Here, you can put your things here.

668
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,070
Here, here, put them here.

669
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:10,880
Let's go, shall we?

670
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,920
Yes, have something to eat.

671
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,350
Come back up later.

672
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,790
Mr. Ren, you...

673
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,750
Dr. Xing,

674
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,000
it hasn't been long since we first met,

675
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,590
has it?

676
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,110
What's going on between you two?

677
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,510
Dr. Xing, how old are you

678
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,270
this year?

679
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,340
Twenty-eight.

680
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,350
Younger than Qin Fei.

681
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,070
Yes.

682
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,750
And your education level?

683
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,510
Ph.D.

684
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,590
That's too high.

685
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,750
Much smarter than Qin Fei.

686
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,550
So, how many romantic relationships have you had?

687
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:09,790
None.

688
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,880
Twenty-eight years old and never been in a relationship?

689
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,480
Is there a problem with that?

690
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,440
Dr. Xing, please sit down.

691
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,200
Sit, sit.

692
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,040
Here's the thing, Dr. Xing.

693
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,880
The entertainment industry

694
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,590
is quite different from other industries.

695
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,400
Qin Fei is an actress

696
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,950
and also a public figure.

697
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:35,460
Dating her would be very complicated.

698
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,010
It might affect you,

699
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:40,070
and it would definitely affect her even more.

700
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:42,350
So there needs to be many rules.

701
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,400
If you can't meet

702
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,720
the following conditions,

703
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,030
as the owner of the agency

704
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,510
and her manager,

705
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,750
I

706
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,110
won't agree to you two being together.

707
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,310
Please go ahead.

708
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:57,020
Whether you're dating

709
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,320
or you've broken up,

710
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,920
you cannot disclose any information about your relationship

711
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,230
on any social media platform.

712
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,360
That's the first condition.

713
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,150
Second,

714
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,230
you cannot reveal your relationship

715
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,670
to anyone.

716
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:11,480
You must maintain complete privacy

717
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,790
and not acknowledge it publicly.

718
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:14,480
Of course, you don't need to deny it either.

719
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,880
That's not all. There's a third condition.

720
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,020
No matter the circumstances,

721
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,510
Qin Fei

722
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,230
can unilaterally

723
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,960
break up with you.

724
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,580
And you cannot have any objections.

725
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,320
If you can meet these three conditions,

726
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,400
our agency

727
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,440
will agree to you being together.

728
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,550
Mr. Ren,

729
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,840
I have problems too.

730
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:49,440
See, I told you.

731
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,040
Not dating at twenty-eight,

732
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,590
you're...

733
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,070
First,

734
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,630
as Qin Fei's manager,

735
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,320
have you taken any effective measures

736
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,650
to counter the attacks after watching her

737
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,550
being constantly criticized and attacked

738
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,550
on various social media platforms?

739
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,170
Second,

740
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,880
Qin Fei risked paralysis

741
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,360
to film Rescue Operation,

742
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,760
which was then maliciously edited.

743
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,760
You couldn't help her at all.

744
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,880
What makes you think

745
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,230
you're still qualified to be her manager?

746
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,030
Third,

747
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:21,180
Qin Fei is just your artist.

748
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:22,320
Who she dates

749
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,190
doesn't need your approval.

750
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:25,760
Clear logic.

751
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,400
Serious and firm about his feelings for Qin Fei.

752
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,630
Perfect.

753
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,800
Come.

754
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,240
Come, Dr. Xing.

755
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:38,590
Drink some water.

756
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,990
So, you guys...

757
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:46,880
How did you get this?

758
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,940
Three times a week?

759
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,170
This…

760
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,150
Occasionally.

761
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:53,630
I have a question.

762
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:54,880
I also have a workout routine,

763
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,590
you know.

764
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,470
But...

765
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,610
I know about the upper part, the upper bundle, right?

766
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,400
I know about the incline press and middle bundle too.

767
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,710
But this, this outer edge...

768
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,790
Right here.

769
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,950
This area.

770
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,160
How do I exert force here?

771
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,160
I don't know how to apply force here.

772
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,670
Why are you so nice to me?

773
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:22,360
Because you're just like how I was before,

774
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,960
coming to medical school with nothing,

775
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,760
and wanting to become a doctor.

776
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,760
Senior,

777
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,590
you inspired me

778
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,360
to become an excellent doctor.

779
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,590
Thank you.

780
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,190
Okay, cut!

781
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,150
Qin Fei.

782
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,200
Yes.

783
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,480
You acted quite well.

784
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,230
It's just that

785
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:48,920
at the end,

786
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,400
that face-cupping gesture wasn't necessary.

787
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,760
If you could

788
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,280
internalize the emotion a bit more,

789
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,610
the effect would be better.

790
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:56,410
I understand.

791
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,850
The surgical movements were very professional.

792
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:01,110
You must have put in a lot of effort, right?

793
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:01,840
How about this?

794
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,320
You've worked hard today.

795
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,660
We'll discuss it further when we get back.

00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,110

797

Thank you.

No problem.

799

Alright.

800
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,240
Thank you, director.

801
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,540

802
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,510
Let's go.

803
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,230
Goodbye, director.

804
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,230
See you next time.

805
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,030
Goodbye.

806
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,320
Sir, we're done here.

807

Please come pick us up soon.

808

Okay.

809
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,360
How did I do just now?

810
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,840
Oh, Fei!

811
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,480
You were absolutely amazing!

812
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,240

I have some good news for you.

816
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,960
Mr. Ren just called me.

817
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,570
He said you and Xing Zhizhi are a perfect match.

818
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,330
But, Fei,

819
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,110
next time Xing Zhizhi stays at your place,

820
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,590
you should let me know in advance.

821
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,630
Otherwise, it's too awkward.

822
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,100

827
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:09,070
Did Coffee tip you off again?

Let's talk about it later.

832
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,070
I need to check my schedule.

833
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,740
Alright, then it's settled.

834
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:18,890

Yes, it can.

839

What animal would you like?

840
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,250
A white horse and

841

a hedgehog.

842
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,840
Alright, no problem.

843
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,040
But I'd like to make the hedgehog myself.

844
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,710
Is that okay?
