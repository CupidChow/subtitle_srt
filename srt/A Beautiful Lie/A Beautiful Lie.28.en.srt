[Happy birthday, Qin Xiaofei.]

00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,650
Chubby,

7
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,850
what are you doing?

8
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:27,940
Nothing.

9
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,920
I heard you prepared a birthday gift for me.

10
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,000
No, I didn't.

11
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,940
Don't lie to me. Mei already saw it.

12
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,530
It's a colorful box.

13
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,180
I really didn't.

14
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,400
How would I know when your birthday is?

15
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,200
Seriously? You didn't even know that?

16
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,060
And I was thinking of inviting you to my dance competition!

17
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,190
Friendship is over!

You must be here!

Alright, sit here and rest for a while.

27
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,720
I'll handle this.

28
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,480
No.

29
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,240
Just go get some rest and leave the rest of it to me.

30
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,830
It's just an instruction manual, right?

31
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,710
Don't worry.

32
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,300
I've got this.

33
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,400
Lu Yicheng.

34
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,750
What?

35
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,120
Come here and install this.

36
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,640
Why should I?

37
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,220
What's your mom's phone number again?

38
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,400
Fine, fine.

39
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,330
Give it to me.

40
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,950
I'll leave it to you.

41
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,590
Let's go.

42
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,950
Come here.

43
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,440
I'll finish it with Cheng. It'll be quick.

44
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,290
No.

45
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,510
Come here.

46
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,220
Be good.

47
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,210
You sit here and rest well.

48
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,540
Don't worry.

49
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,210
He's very smart.

50
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,290
Dr. Xing,

51
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,160
you've always taken care of me,

52
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,040
and now it's my turn to take care of you.

53
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,990
I promise.

54
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,390
You won't even have to lift a finger.

55
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,330
Xiaofei, you...

56
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,150
Do you...

57
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,960
have some misunderstandings?

58
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,580
I need to take a call.

59
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,660
Go ahead.

60
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,090
Hello, Uncle Li.

61
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:54,840
Yeah.

62
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,410
My sister has already sent me your information.

63
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,210
I've discussed it with my colleagues in oncology.

64
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,600
I've also sorted out some information

65
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,610
about late-stage liver cancer.

66
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,610
-Late-stage liver cancer?
-Yes.

67
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,410
Yes,

68
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,600
we still need to

69
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,840
go to this specialized hospital.

70
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,750
In addition to the basic treatments,

71
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,440
we should also make adjustments

72
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,080
for mental health and diet.

73
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,140
Right.

74
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,650
A positive attitude is very important.

75
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,020
You're welcome. It's okay.

76
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,650
Feel free to call me anytime if you need anything.

77
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,530
Alright.

78
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,330
Goodbye.

79
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,600
Late-stage liver cancer?

80
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,040
Uncle Li?

81
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,960
He's... my father's friend.

82
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,710
Xiaofei, you don't think that I have...

83
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,070
Wait...

84
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,010
Xiaofei, Xiaofei.

85
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,300
Fei, do I still need to set up this tent?

86
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,630
No, you're free to go!

87
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:50,810
Serves him right.

88
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,450
Xiaofei.

89
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,970
I had no idea that you thought...

90
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,240
I got...

91
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,160
I mean...

92
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,410
Xiaofei.

93
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,310
Fei, here's the latest news.

94
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,920
Yu Zhecheng said that Ge Anpei asked him

95
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,710
to keep an extra eye on Dr. Xing.

96
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,580
He said

97
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,320
Ms. Ge wouldn't say that

98
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,540
unless something serious was going on.

99
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,580
Say it.

100
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,400
If it's not cancer,

101
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,350
what exactly happened to you?

102
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,820
Say something, will you?

103
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,350
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,270
Sorry, sorry...

105
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,320
All you know is saying sorry.

106
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:53,650
Do you know

107
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:54,810
that I could have easily not come?

108
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,590
I could have ignored it, not listened,
not asked, not cared,

109
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,270
and just walked away!

110
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,620
But because it's you, Xing Zhizhi!

111
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,460
Because it's you...

112
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,970
...I, Qin Fei...

113
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,360
...actually became afraid.

114
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,670
Because I'm afraid you'll leave me,

115
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,490
that you'll stop telling me things,

116
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,490
and we'll just drift further apart.

117
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,670
Xing Zhizhi,

118
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,070
is this really...

119
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,850
the end of us?

120
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,080
Xiaofei.

121
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,240
Xiaofei...

122
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,040
Did I come...

123
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,390
at a bad time?

124
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,010
It's nothing.

125
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,290
Qin Fei...

126
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,200
how is she doing?

127
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,670
I read a novel before

128
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:50,150
and it's called "The Gift of the Magi".
Have you heard of it, Dr. Xing?

129
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,580
Yes, it's a short story by O. Henry.

130
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,510
It's quite interesting.

131
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,480
You're right, it's quite interesting.

132
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,480
Some say this story is meant to

133
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,220
celebrate pure, beautiful love,

134
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,390
while others think

135
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,340
it tells a message that

136
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,520
true love is about selfless giving.

137
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,680
But I don't think either of those is correct.

138
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,950
Two lovers

139
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,440
did things out of love,

140
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,220
but in the end, it lost its meaning.

141
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,470
What's the result?

142
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,100
Bitterness,

143
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,480
regret,

144
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,260
or self-blame?

145
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,600
Whichever it may be,

146
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,540
it's far from their original intention

147
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,890
of wanting the best for each other,

148
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,440
right?

149
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,320
Hair will grow back,

150
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,220
but a wounded heart might leave a scar.

151
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,840
Instead of doing

152
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,150
what you think they need,

153
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,050
maybe honesty and communication are what really matter.

154
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,670
Dr. Xing,

155
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,280
your friend Liu Yanze is very much like you.

156
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,670
Thank you.

157
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:00,790

Captain,

173
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,710
what happened?

174
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,190
You haven't said a word all night.

175
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:58,950
You just keep...

176
00:13:58,950 --> 00:13:59,840
drinking silently.

177
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,670
Did you break up with that nurse?

178
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,150
Did she break your heart?

179
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,570
I'm telling you, our captain

180
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,140
is just too nice.

181
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,960
Look at these people.

182
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:10,910
They could be together today

183
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,860
and break up tomorrow.

184
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,240
That's just how it is now.

185
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,640
Don't take it to heart.

186
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,540
Take it easy on the drinking.

187
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,180
Let's get the check and go.

188
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,270
Let's go.

190
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,700
please don't tell my brother

00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,290
that I'm here playing games.

192
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,630
I couldn't care less about

193
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,090
all the drama going on in your family.

194
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,450
You're the best.

195
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,390
Do you like me?

196
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,450
Stop right there.

197
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,570
I'm only interested in mature women.

198
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,330
Who is she?

199
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,520
Does Luo Xiaoxiao know about this?

200
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,710
It's none of your business.

201
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,370
Why are you so concerned about Luo Xiaoxiao?

202
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,550
Who is she to you?

203
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,200
Let me tell you who she is to me.

204
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,850
What are you doing?

205
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,000
What's going on?

206
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
What are you doing?

207
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,830
Boss Chen.

208
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,610
Everyone stay out of this!

209
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,360
-Stay out of it!
-What are you doing?

210
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,140
Clear the area.

211
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,430
All of you, get out of here!

212
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,960
This is personal business.

213
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,630
Judging by the look of it,

214
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,640
this won't be over anytime soon.

215
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,380
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

216
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,020
Aren't you worried about your friend?

217
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,290
Our friend?

218
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,620
Our friend is a former special forces soldier,

219
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,480
so you should be more worried about your friend.

220
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,550
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

221
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,630
I...

222
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,660
Do you still want to fight?

223
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,090
No more fighting.

224
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,270
I can't win.

225
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,160
I just don't understand.

226
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,180
What did Luo Xiaoxiao see in you?

227
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,060
Yeah,

228
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,410
her judgment really isn't rgreat,

229
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,330
or she wouldn't fall for someone like you,

230
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,380
letting you string her along.

231
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,100
You just won't let it go, will you?

232
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,490
I've already told you,

233
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,570
she's just like a little sister to me.

234
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,750
That better be true.

235
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,210
If I find out you're mistreating her,

236
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,540
I'll come for you again.

237
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,760
Me? Mistreat her?

238
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,350
Right.

239
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,780
It's me who's mistreating her.

240
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,010
It's my fault.

241
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,510
I'm the one who has her disappearing all the time,

242
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,830
parking outside your building

243
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,320
and staying there all night.

244
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,130
I'm the reason she spends her birthday every year

245
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:17,720
at some tiny restaurant,

246
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,180
eating alone,

247
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,510
while everyone else gets to enjoy their birthdays.

248
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,430
Yeah, it's me.

249
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,890
I'm the one mistreating her,

250
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:25,690
so every time she drinks, she just ends up in tears.

251
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,660
Is it really me though, Liu Yanze?

252
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,050
Is it me?

253
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,010
I wish it were me!

254
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,710
I've been there for her,

255
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,440
hoping, waiting, begging,

256
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,360
just to replace a jerk!

257
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,750
And in the end, I still lost.

258
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,960
Why?

259
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,360
Liu Yanze, tell me why.

260
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,310
Tell me why!

261
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,370
Why?

262
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,500
Have some shame, will you?

263
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,650
You think the booze at my place is free?

264
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,400
Liu Yanze, let me tell you.

265
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,050
If you still have feelings for her,

266
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,370
then go for it.

267
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,090
If you don't love her,

268
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,900
please tell her yourself,

269
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,930
then stay away from her.

270
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,710
Stop wasting her time, okay?

271
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,940
I'm begging you.

272
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,710
[Yunzhong Guesthouse]

273
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,060
Where's the paper?

274
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,160
This one.

275
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,460
Isn't Xiaoxiao here?

276
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,330
She said this morning she wanted to go for a walk.

277
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,630
She hasn't come back yet?

278
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:02,620
I can't reach her on the phone.

279
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,100
Do you think something might've happened to her?

280
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,820
Why don't we go out and look for her?

281
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,710
The mountain paths are tricky.

282
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,950
She might get lost.

283
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,820
We'll go find her too.

284
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,050
Yes, yes.

285
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,500
Then I'll go with you.

286
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,460
I want to go, too.

287
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,270
You? What's the point of that?

288
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,440
Even if we’re going to look for someone,

289
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,680
we don't need a kid like you.

290
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,590
If anything happens to you,

291
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,750
how would I ever explain it to your parents?

292
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,750
Go back inside!

293
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,580
Watch your tone.

294
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,740
Go back, be good.

295
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:27,740
I have a task for you.

296
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:28,700
We're going out to look for her.

297
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,650
You stay here and keep an eye on Xixi,

298
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:30,690
did you hear me?

299
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,110
But I...

300
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,000
Lu Yicheng.

301
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,790
Alright, alright.

302
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,440
What are you guys waiting for?

303
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,750
Hurry up and go search for her!

304
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,440
Mind your tone!

305
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,230
What are you spacing out for?

306
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,760
Do you really want to go out that badly?

307
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,800
I want to help too.

308
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,420
Fei told me you hurt your leg before,

309
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,270
so to be safe,

310
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,790
it's best if you stay inside.

311
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,120
What if you get hurt again?

312
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,300
Here.

313
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:06,190
I don't want to be treated like someone who needs protection.

314
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,520
Xiaoxiao!

315
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,880
Xiaoxiao!

316
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,310
Xiaoxiao!

317
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,750
Xiaoxiao!

318
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,260
Are you okay?

319
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,300
It's none of your business.

320
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,100
Xiaoxiao!

321
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,750
Xiaoxiao!

322
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,560
You'll scare her if you shout like that.

323
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,940
How am I supposed to find her if I don't shout this loud?

324
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,420
Xiaoxiao!

325
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,790
Xiaoxiao!

326
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,320
Hurry up and search!

327
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,250
Xiaoxiao!

328
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,680
Xiaoxiao!

329
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,640
Xiaoxiao?

330
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,330
Xiaoxiao!

331
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,860
Xiaoxiao!

332
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,200
Xiaoxiao!

333
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,830
Where is she?

334
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,200
Xiaoxiao!

335
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,140
Xiaoxiao!

336
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,720
Help!

337
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,540
Is anyone there?

338
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,880
Help!

339
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,990
Help...

340
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,730
Is anyone there?

341
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:36,060
Is anyone there?

342
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,710
Help!

343
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,430
Help me!

344
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,060
Is anyone there?

345
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,280
Xiaoxiao.

346
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,280
Xiaoxiao?

347
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,230
Where could she be?

348
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:54,800
Xiaoxiao!

349
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,140
Xiaoxiao!

350
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,280
Help!

351
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,960
When are you going to change that watch?

352
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,590
It's blinding me every day!

353
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:28,090
Don't underestimate it.

354
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,420
It can send signals

355
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,910
by reflecting light.

356
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
If you reflect

357
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,590
in a pattern of long flashes and dots,

358
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:36,090
it turns into Morse code.

359
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,930
I don't get it.

360
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,560
To put it simply,

361
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,020
if you're out filming

362
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,750
and get lost in the wild,

363
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,880
you can use reflected light

364
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,220
to send a distress signal,

365
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,240
and it'll increase your chances

366
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,040
of being found.

367
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:54,440
Help!

368
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,180

I lost signal on the GPS halfway

How about this? I'll tell you a joke.

00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,710
When I was in college,

458
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,350
there was a couple

00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,020
"And never let go." Then,

463
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,840

00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,910
that Ms. Qin Fei actually cares about you a lot.

561
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,580
You're always jealous of Mr. Xing,

562
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,850
picking on him every day.

563
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:40,890
You're only making Ms. Qin angry.

564
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:44,220
Think about it yourself.

565
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,460
I'm leaving.

566
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,070
What kind of spell has Xing Zhizhi

567
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,890
put on you guys?

568
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,680
He's just a little better-looking,

569
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,300
taller, and more educated.

570
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:59,160
What's so special about that?

571
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,820
Yes.

572
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,260
I haven't seen Xiaojia these days.

573
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,780
And Qin Fei is here.

574
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,450
She's been sleeping late as well,

575
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:08,810
but she's not having nightmares anymore.

576
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:11,070
Qin Fei is here, so does she know about it?

577
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,270
Xiaofei dosn't know yet.

578
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:15,920
I have a consultation these days

579
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,480
and it's less than 100 kilometers

580
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,230
from your current location.

581
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,440
If it's convenient at the time,

582
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,020
we can meet up.

583
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:24,340
Okay, I'll think about it.

584
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,510
If we’re going to meet,

585
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,420
are you coming here, or should I come to you?

586
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,910
You should come to me then.

587
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,420
Alright, got it.

588
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,960
Qin Fei doesn't know,

589
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,590
and he's going to have a date?

590
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:38,820
Xing Zhizhi.

591
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,920
I caught you red-handed.

592
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,570

593
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,620

Hydrochloride...

598
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,490
Trazodone?

599
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:04,340
Trazodone Hydrochloride?

600
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,880
No, that's not it.

601
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:10,250
Hydrochloride.

602
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,840
This medication is for treating depression

603
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,000
and is effective for both patients

604
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,040
with and without anxiety.

605
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,990
It's designed for mental health treatment.

606
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:33,280
This is the last load of drinks.

607
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:35,230
-Once it's done, we're all wrapped up!
-Let me help you.

608
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,320
It's okay, I can handle it.

609
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,480
It's okay, let's do it together.

610
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,400
It'll be faster that way.

611
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,550
Okay.

612
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,230
Should I put it here first?

613
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:40,800
Right, just put it here.

614
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,920
Okay.

615
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,190
Mr. Xing,

616
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,780
I think you and Fei are a perfect match.

617
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:47,530
Why don't you debut as well?

618
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,460
What do you mean, debut?

619
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,620
I'm so ugly.

620
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:50,920
What are you talking about?

621
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,110
I think you're pretty handsome!

622
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,500
Thank you.

623
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:55,050
You're welcome.

624
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:55,720
The green one.

625
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,720

627
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,050
Lu Yicheng!

628
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,250
What are you doing?

629
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:27,670
Why are you taking Mr. Xing's phone?

630
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,660
I call this getting rid of a public menace.

631
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,230
I need to find proof that he's up to something shady.

632
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,590
You're invading his privacy.

633
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,840
I don't care about his privacy!

634
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,830
It's about my sister!

635
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,260
She's naive and easy to fool.

636
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,660
She talks tough,

637
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,220
but she's actually easier to persuade than anyone.

638
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,510
That's why she's so easily deceived.

639
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,840
Hand me my phone.

640
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,430
Hand me my phone!

641
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,040
Hold on.

642
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:50,240
Here, here.

643
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,780
Here you go, here you go.

644
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:56,010
What have you done to Mr. Xing's phone?

645
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:56,820
Nothing.

646
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:58,060
I just... just took a casual look.

647
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,450
You can return the phone now.

648
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:01,000
Lu Yicheng, I'm warning you.

649
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,260
Tonight is important.

650
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:04,540
Everyone is busy preparing for Mr. Xing and Ms. Qin's event.

651
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,650
You better not mess it up.

652
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:06,520
Did you hear me?

653
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,880
Qin Fei and that guy?

654
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,320
Don't talk about Mr. Xing like that!

655
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,160
Anyway,

656
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,250
tonight's romantic movie

657
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,200
is definitely going to bring them closer.

658
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,380
If you mess this up, I won't let you off!

659
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,980
Bring them closer, huh?

660
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,490
I heard him on the phone with a woman earlier,

661
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,710
and he was acting all suspicious.

662
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,710
That doesn't mean you could do that.

663
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,480
You can talk principles with a decent person,

664
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,650
but trying to do that with a cheater?

665
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,270
That's just stupid.

666
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,880
If Xing Zhizhi didn't cheat,

667
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,690
then none of this would be an issue.

668
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,020
But if he actually did something

669
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,580
to hurt Fei,

670
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:37,070
would you just stand by and let her be fooled?

671
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,610

00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:43,880

I mean it, I'm really fine. See?

00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,600
I can walk, and it doesn't even hurt.

683
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,420
I'm going out for a walk now.

00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,550
