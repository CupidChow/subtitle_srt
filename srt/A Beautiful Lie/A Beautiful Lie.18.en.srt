Hello?

Liu Yanze.

5
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,580
When you were with Luo Xiaoxiao,

6
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,990
did...

7
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,800
did she ever film any kissing scenes?

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,860
What?

10
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,180
Qin Fei is going to film a kissing scene?

11
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,300
Right now. I'm still at the scene.

Masochist.

14
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,080
I wouldn't go to the scene to watch her kiss someone else.

15
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,560
At most, I'll just

16
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,430
exercise the rights of a boyfriend.

17
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,630
After she gets home,

18
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,450
I'll ask her how many times she kissed in the play.

19
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,520
Then, I'll kiss her

20
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,550
ten times more

21
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,080

22
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:21,930
Okay.

23
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,080
I understand.

[Next time you do a kissing scene, I'll kiss you ten times more.]

25

We're about to start filming, Fei.

26
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,620
Will you be uncomfortable here?

27
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,330
Why don't you wait in the RV?

28
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,810
Didn't you ask me to come watch your filming?

29
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,050
Why don't you go buy me a cake?

30
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,290
I suddenly want to eat cake.

31
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,240
Now?

32
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,570
I just have a craving all of a sudden.

33
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,340
I want to eat that cheesecake.

34
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,870
But if there's no cheesecake,

35
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,360
then red velvet or black forest will do.

36
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,190
Anything is fine.

37
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,450
Can you go buy it for me?

38
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,700
Don't you usually avoid eating these?

39
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,170
And cakes are so high in calories.

40
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:50,900
How about...

41
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,120
I just really crave it right now.

42
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,490
Women are like this, you know, fickle.

43
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,190
How... how... how about waiting until this scene is done?

44

00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,890
I'll be waiting for you.

46
00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,750
Fei,

47
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,610
you're really clever.

48
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,290
It's really dangerous.

49
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,620
Once I start filming later,

50
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,140
keep an eye on him for me.

51
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,610
If he comes back early,

52
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,090
make sure to stop him.

53
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:09,940
Don't worry,

54
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,900
I've got it covered.

55
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,500
Go.

56
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,600
Please, stop rinsing your mouth.

57
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,260
If you keep rinsing, your mouth will be pickled.

58
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,700
What do you know?

59
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,120
This is the basic manners to an actress

60
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,450
before a kissing scene.

61
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,910
I've seen you film so many kissing scenes before,

62
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,260
but you've never been this attentive.

Why are you here?

66
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,970
I came to see you.

67
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,390
If Xing Zhizhi can visit the set,

68
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,560
why can't I?

69
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,020
Coffee.

70
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,610
I feel like since you joined the crew,

71
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,940
you've been growing more distant from me.

72
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,880
That's not what I meant.

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,160
It's mainly because I have a task right now.

74
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,480
Can I accompany you later?

75
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,360
What task?

76
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,410
To stop Dr. Xing.

77
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,950
Didn't Fei ask him to come?

78
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:16,970
Why are you stopping him?

79
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:17,570
Yes.

80
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,300
A scene was added to Fei temporarily.

81
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,380
What kind of scene?

82
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,810
What are you thinking?

83
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,730
It's a kissing scene.

84
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,870
That's quite exciting.

85
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,300
Then Xing must take a look at this.

86
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,750
Yu Zhecheng, what's with this attitude?

87
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,340
You usually get along well with Dr. Xing,

88
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,500
don't you? What's going on?

89
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,420
Are you two just pretending to get along?

90

93
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,530
listen to me.

but in the end, they're not settled.

Do you know what's missing in between?

98
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,760
What's missing?

99
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,300
A spark.

100

No!

194

One more take!

No!

197

I love you, Wang Hui.

198

Do you love me?

00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,370
Good.

201

This one passed.

202
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,170
Let's move to the next scene.

203
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,870
That therapist hasn't left yet?

204
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,540
Therapist?

00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:58,160
Jun,

206
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,910
you really believed Ms. Qin when she said he was a therapist?

207
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,110
Everyone knows,

208
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,330
except you.

209
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,800
He's obviously her boyfriend,

210
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,390
coming to visit her on set.

211
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,600
But I heard from Luo Xiaoxiao that Qin Fei is still single.

212
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,060
You even asked about that?

213
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,960
How could she have a boyfriend?

214
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,750
Jun,

215
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:24,560
what's wrong with you?

216
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,160
Is your heart bothering you?

217
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,880
What you meant this morning was

218
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,970
I've fallen for Qin Fei,

219
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
but I didn't even realize it myself?

220
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,760
I didn't say that.

221
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,050
You'd better not have.

222
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,320
Jun,

223
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,010
where are you going?

224
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:43,740
To rehearse.

So you went back to the RV and rest.

228
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,240
You're jealous?

229
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,660
Didn't you say you were mentally prepared?

230
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,470
Xing Zhizhi,

231
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,890
it's just a kissing scene today.

232
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,980
There will be romantic scenes in the future

233
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,820
with other actors.

234
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,470
Moreover,

235
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,960
I often spend months away from home filming.

236
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,320
I can't be with you.

237
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,980
We can't date freely

238
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:22,040
or make our relationship public.

239
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,400
I don't even know when

240
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,680
I'll be exposed to inexplicable gossip.

241
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:31,680
All of this will affect your life.

242
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,330
Can you accept that?

243
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,160
Qin Fei,

244
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,090
do you have a moment?

245

I'd like to rehearse a scene with you.

Didn't we finish all our

-Is your therapist…
-Mr. Hao.

Apart from filming,

256
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,570
shouldn't we avoid other topics?

257
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,730
Didn't you tell me

258
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,310

and you're already rejecting me.

some of it I've thought about,

They both have feelings for each other.

I need you to give him a push.

About the differences

422
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:17,760

423
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,190

Luo Xiaoxiao and Liu Yanze's situation

425
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,540

426
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,690

00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,140
even with such a lesson,

428
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,350
as long as there are still feelings,

429
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,140
there's still a possibility of reconciliation.

430
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,340
Are you sure it's reconciliation,

431
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,090
not completely giving up?

432
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,690
I believe that as long as there's love,

433
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,280
all problems can be solved.

434
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,850

00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,900
I'm lost in everything I do.

558
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:51,250
Both in love

559
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,530
and work.

560
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,960
So I really want to see

561
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,020
an idealist shines

562
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,820
when they've found what

563
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,550
they're good at and

564
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,050
what they love.

565
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,880
Qin Xiaofei,

566
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,050
you look very charming

567
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,510
when you work hard.

568
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:13,800
Don't be too hard on yourself.

569
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,640
You're already excellent.

570
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,400
Do you want me,

571
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,200
your family member, to go or not?

572
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,130
Family member?

573
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,860
Of course I do.

574
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,020
Family member.

575
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:29,570
Family member.

576
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,530
Family member.

577
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,190
Family member.

578
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,150
Family member, have this.

579
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,590
Family member, eat something.

580
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,510
Have a shrimp, okay?

581
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,350
Sir,

582
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:45,220
the hotel can't show surveillance footage to guests,

583
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,550
so I took a screenshot

584
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:47,890
to show you.

585
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,120
You absolutely can't tell anyone about this.

586
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,010
I understand.

587
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,460
Look at this guy.

588
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,770
I'm certain that

589
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,650
he's not an employee of our hotel.

590
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,500
The card he used to open the door

591
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,390
was probably a universal card

592
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,940
that was issued illegally.

593
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:17,940
Thank you, Captain Liu.

594
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,580
Who's staying in this room?

595
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,230
Mr. Wei,

596
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,360
the guest in room 26

597
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:32,000
checked out and left last night.

598
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,450
The room is empty now.

599
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,770
He's gone.

600
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,530
He must have sensed something.

601
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,200
He wouldn't have gone far

602
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,800
without achieving his goal.

603
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,240
I'll go inform Xiaoxiao.

604
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,040

Xiaoxiao,

630
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:38,700
seriously,

631
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:41,750
did that person really follow you?

632
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,250
If this is true,

633
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,960
we must report it to the police.

634
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,770
Don't make a fuss.

635
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,990
I'm not sure either.

636
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,870
He might just be jogging at night.

637
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,440
Maybe because of

638
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,770
the incident with the surveillance camera,

639
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:56,100
I'm a bit on edge.

640
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,470
I might be scaring myself.

641
00:33:58,910 --> 00:33:59,760
I know.

642
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,590
You're worried about affecting the crew's schedule.

643
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,040
That's why you didn't call the police.

644
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,770
But you should at least have a bodyguard with you.

645
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,590
Is Liu Yanze not doing his job well?

646
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:13,380
I'll call his boss.

647
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,100
It's not his fault.

648
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,420
I didn't tell him myself.

649
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,090
He said this is called... what was it?

650
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,540
Breach of contract.

651
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,260
Yes, breach of contract.

652
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,970
I just don't understand.

653
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:37,110
You insisted on hiring him in the first place.

654
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,750
We finally got him,

655
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,430
and now you won't let him stay by your side.

656
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:41,720
What?

657
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,550
Are you worried he'll get tired?

658
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,520
Not at all.

659
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,610
Stop smiling.

660
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,260
You're clearly unhappy.

661
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:03,120
No, I'm not.

662
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:08,830
I just feel a bit tired.

663
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,570
Five years.

664
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,600
Now it seems like

665
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,040
no matter how obvious I do,

666
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,880
hints, confessions, or throwing myself at him,

667
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,070
but he

668
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:27,640
has already made up his mind.

669
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:29,660
There's no going back.

670
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,200
This is his answer.

671
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:35,220
I'd rather he let go.

672
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,740
I'd rather he didn't love me anymore.

673
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,140
But he hasn't.

674
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44,440
He hasn't.

675
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,230
It's so embarrassing.

676
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,830
I've embarrassed myself in front of you again.

677
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,800
There's nothing embarrassing about crying in front of me.

678
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,460
Xiaoxiao, don't worry.

679
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,520
No matter what happens,

680
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:30,720
I'll always be by your side.

681
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,690
Come on.

682
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,490
Just vent your feelings today.

683
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,450
Let's continue.

684
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,500
Just cry and fight

685
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:43,470
however you like.

686
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,760
Do whatever you want.

687
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:45,580
Okay?

688
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,280
Wait a moment.

689
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:53,000
I'll make a call to buy some insurance.

690
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,520
What?

691
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:57,160
Today, you can beat me as hard as you want.

692
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:57,780
Come on.

693
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:59,670
-I’ll beat you to death.
-Come on.

694
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,820
I won't regret it at all.

695
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,190
I won't regret it.

696
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,290
Xing,

697
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,940
do you know

698
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,970
why I can't be with Xiaoxiao?

699
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:12,690
You think

700
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,770
the gap between you two

701
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,460
is getting bigger and bigger?

702
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,440
At first, yes.

703
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,740
I was very immature back then,

704
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,970
arrogant,

705
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,140
and full of myself.

706
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,970
Later, you realize

707
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:36,080
you're just one of the most ordinary

708
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,910
and average people in the crowd.

709
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:39,560
As for Xiaoxiao,

710
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:41,860
she became an actress while still in school.

711
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,810
She got movie contracts,

712
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:43,890
commercials,

713
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:44,770
endorsements,

714
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,960
and so on.

715
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,530
As a result,

716
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,820
we spent less and less time together.

717
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,670
I think

718
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:00,720
for her...

719
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,260
Are you trying to say

720
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,270
this is a good thing for her?

721
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,450
Of course it's a good thing.

722
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,670
What kind of person do you think I am?

723
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:17,520
But on one hand, I'm happy for her,

724
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,980
on the other hand,

725
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,160
I increasingly feel

726
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,310
that I am

727
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,810
nothing.

728
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,230
You know,

729
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,450
sometimes

730
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:35,880
when I see Xiaoxiao looking at me

731
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,550
with such loving eyes,

732
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:39,530
I...

733
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,550
I just wonder,

734
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,080
why?

735
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,860
Why would such a beautiful

736
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:48,560
and talented girl

737
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,000
like me?

738
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,180
Why?

739
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,540
Dude, where's my value?

740
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,010
Later on,

741
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,890
I went overseas on a mission

742
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,660
and experienced some things—

743
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,450
life,

744
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,020
death,

745
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,270
and farewells.

746
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,580
And my thoughts changed a bit.

747
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,880
I seemed to have found

748
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,090
a little bit of my own value,

749
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,650
which is the so-called

750
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,980
sense of mission

751
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,720
and ideals.

752
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,900
Ze,

753
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,980
listen to me,

754
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:37,800
I think

755
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,590
she might be able to understand your ideals.

756
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,810
But how could I let her?

757
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:47,730
You know,

758
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:54,900
when I held my comrade's urn in my own hands

759
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,910
and sent him home,

760
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,670
I saw his family

761
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,880
crying their hearts out in front of me.

762
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,300
At that moment, I understood

763
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,640
I couldn't let her go through the same pain.

764
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,740
So,

765
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,260
since I've chosen this path,

766
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,410
leaving

767
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:22,310
is better for both of us.

768
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:27,610
Let's drink.

769
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,540
Coming.

770
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,290
Xing Zhizhi?

771
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:58,820
What's wrong?

772
00:40:58,910 --> 00:40:59,990
Are you drunk?

773
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,190
Xiaofei,

774
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,720
Liu Yanze and Luo Xiaoxiao haven't reconciled.

775
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,470
Why did you drink so much?

776
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:07,380
Don't move, don't move,

777
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,710
let's get inside first.

778
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:11,220
Don't move.

779
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,360
Let's go.

780
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,930
If...

781
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,440
-they fail...
-Watch out.

782
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,530
-Sit down.
-fail...

783
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:23,300
to reconcile,

784
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:26,160
will you still come and listen to me

785
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,060
as a family member?

786
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,580
What's between us

787
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:31,270
has nothing to do with others.

788
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,740
That Liu Yanze

789
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,480
is really infuriating.

790
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,770
He said he didn't regret breaking up with Luo Xiaoxiao.

791
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,320
He said "no regrets" many times.

792
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,320
But I...

793
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,620
I can see...

794
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,610
I can see that

795
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,510
he actually regrets it very much.

796
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:56,960
He regrets it terribly.

797
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,380
But Qin Fei,

798
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,080
we won't become the second

799
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,610
Liu Yanze and Luo Xiaoxiao,

800
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:05,740
right?

801
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,610
We definitely won't.

802
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,810
Trust me.

803
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,020
Don't think too much, okay?

804
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:24,820
I'm overthinking it.

805
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:28,730
At least they were together before.

806
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,710
We...

807
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,970
haven't even started yet.

808
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,310
Haven't even started yet.

809
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:42,180
Don't sleep yet, don't sleep yet.

810
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:43,870
I'll help you to bed. Let's go.

811
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,140
Xing Zhizhi,

812
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,150
you can't handle your alcohol well.

813
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:50,000
Why did you drink so much?

814
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,620
Come here and sit down.

815
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:58,590
Let me take off your clothes. Don't move.

816
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:03,740
Come here.

817
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:13,190
Xiaofei,

818
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:15,740
trust me.

819
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:17,680
We won't.
