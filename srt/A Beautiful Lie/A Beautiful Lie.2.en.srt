Be careful with what you say

731
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,910
and what you do.

732
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,410
I'm begging you.

733
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:07,850
Okay?

734
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:10,640
Just sail through these two weeks

735
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,080
and take a few photos

736
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:12,920
at the donation ceremony.

737
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,280
Then we'll be all good.

738
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,270
[A pinch of cordyceps flowers, which are subtly fragrant and color-enhancing.]

739
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,260
Do you hear me?

740
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,610
Angelica and wolfberry?

741
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:21,770
Hello?

742
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:21,720
[Ren Siqi]

743
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:22,550
What wolfberry?

744
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,610
I'm talking to you.

745
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,550
Do you hear me?

746
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,090
Okay, I got it.

747
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,630
[Ren Siqi]

748
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:45,280
[Be careful]

749
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,120
Dr. Xing.

750
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:49,180
Sorry.

751
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:51,910
[Don't waste food.]

752
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,130
Why are you apologizing to me?

753
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,320
I'm apologizing

754
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,880
because I've been bad to you

755
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,080
in the past two days.

756
00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:00,220
[Don't waste food.]

757
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,650
Actually, deep down, I know

758
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,540
you're the one who's put in the most effort.

759
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,270
[Don't waste food.]

760
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:04,830
After all, doctors are humans, not gods.

761
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:08,940
I'm so concerned about Xixi,

762
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,130
not because I want to appear caring

763
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,760
or because I saved her.

764
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,200
I just know how much pain she's in.

765
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,240
I used to be a dancer.

766
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,180
On the day when I competed

767
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,090
in the most important contest in my life,

768
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,960
a terror attack happened.

769
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,300
After that,

770
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,540
I couldn't dance anymore.

771
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:34,430
So I often wish that

772
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,550
that guy hadn't saved me

773
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,040
and had just let me die in that explosion.
