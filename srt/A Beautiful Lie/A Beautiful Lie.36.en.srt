00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:41,790
Go ahead and eat.

7
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,020
You ordered the Western food.

8
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,020
Have more.

9
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,510
You're not... not going to scold me?

10
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,050
Why would I scold you?

11
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,050
The director called you back from out of town.

12
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,440
Aren't you mad?

13
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,510
Did you do it wrong?

14
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,700
What did you do wrong?

15
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,780
I shouldn't have embarrassed the teacher in public.

16
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,010
But you don't know.

17
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,530
He's really annoying.

18
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,470
Girls avoid him when they see him.

19
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,990
Well, there you have it.

20
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,270
You didn't do anything wrong. Let's eat.

21
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,690
Are you really not mad at me?

22
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,900
I'm really not mad at you.

23
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,110
You know what?

24
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,400
When I first met Mr. Xing,

25
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,530
he was just a doctor in the rehabilitation department.

26
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,360
I didn't even take him seriously.

27
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,470
But later, when there was a landslide in Linkang County,

28
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,080
Xixi was buried underneath

29
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,940
and almost lost a leg.

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,020
It was Mr. Xing who overcame all obstacles

31
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,620
and finally saved Xixi.

32
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,120
Well,

33
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,710
I know it, Fei.

34
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,070
You've told this story more than 800 times.

35
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,510
I'm trying to tell you one thing.

36
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,720
A truly capable person

37
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,410
doesn't need to seek attention.

38
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,890
Being low-key is the mark of a true hero.

39
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,970
You're just love-struck.

40
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,200
What hero?

41
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,920
Come on, eat more.

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,160
When is your hero coming back?

43
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,780
It should be soon, I guess.

44
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,520
He might make it back for next week's

45
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,050
Dance Night Awards Ceremony.

46
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,210
Let me tell you,

47
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,760
when he comes back, you better behave yourself.

48
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,880
Do you hear me?

49
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,840
Come on, he hasn't even contacted you.

50
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,500
When is he really coming back?

51
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,240
I kind of miss him.

52
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,110
Why don't you try to find a way

53
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,040
to get some information?

54
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,630
Hurry up and eat.

55
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:26,520

Xiaofei,

60
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,140
how are you doing?

61
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,540
I'm okay.

62
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,780
Where's Xing Zhizhi?

63
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,260
I've filed a case with the police,

64
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,580
but there's no news yet.

65
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,890
Missing person notices have been posted.

66
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,570
I've called in everyone who can help to search.

67
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,280
Still no news.

68
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,540

94
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,520
mind the gap between the train and the platform.

00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,720
Did my advice work?

107
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:03,100
She's visited every temple, ancient and modern, local and foreign,

108
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,830
and bought a bunch of bracelets and necklaces.

109

Luo Xiaoxiao isn't love-struck.

You see,

183
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,660
Dr. Xing isn't here,

184
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,420
and there's no one to share your burden.

185
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,710
You can't take care of a child alone.

186
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,690
I disagree with that.

187
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,310
Aren't you criticizing Fei?

188
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,700
Why can't her?

189
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,410
Her TV series achieved 3% audience rating,

190
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,240
and her dance troupe won the best dance troupe award.

191
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,760
Fei excels at everything she does.

192
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,680
No, what I mean is,

193
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,950
people should be

194
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,000
thought about.

195
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,020
If you keep thinking about him,

196
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,880
he might come back.

197
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,110
How's he doing recently?

198
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,940
I don't know.

199
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,590
Maybe it's hard to get in touch there.

200
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,030
The new TV series are doing well now.

201
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,160
Is the company preparing to go public?

202
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,450
I haven't decided yet.

203
00:10:58,890 --> 00:10:59,720
Why?

204
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,900
Just like you.

205
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,860
I don't want to take the usual path.

206
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,480
Imitating me?

207
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,740
What's wrong?

208
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,990
You look unhappy.

209
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,470
Who upset you?

210
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,350
Fei, will you come with me to try on wedding dresses?

211
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,790
[MISS KING]

212
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,880
Ke Feifei, you look beautiful.
[MISS KING]

213
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:51,900
[MISS KING]

214
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,040
This dress is really nice. It suits you so well.
[MISS KING]

215
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,500
This dress is really nice. It suits you so well.

216
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,970
Fei, this Yu Zhecheng is really driving me crazy.

217
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,840
He was the one who insisted on getting married in the first place.

218
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,800
And now look,

219
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,010
it's all become my responsibility alone.

220
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:07,510
Booking the banquet, planning the wedding reception, and arranging the honeymoon.

221
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,400
I did it all by myself.

222
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,290
He promised to accompany me to try on wedding dresses today.

223
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,800
But then he said he has another surgery

224
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,250
and can't make it again.

225
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,200
Fine then.

226
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,330
Whether we get married or not, I'm the one being played.

227
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:20,260
Fei, why did I agree to get married in the first place?

228
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,410
Our Feifei has really suffered a lot.

229
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,010
That rascal Yu Zhecheng.

230
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,200
When he comes, I'll scold him for you.

231
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,130
Coffee.

232
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,880
Actually, there's something I've been wanting to ask you.

233
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,430
Didn't you say you'd never get married?

234
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,560
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

235
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,160
Have you thought it through?

236
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,710
It's because of you.

237
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,330
Because of me?

238
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,240
Do you remember

239
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,210
when Xing Zhizhi went to Suman?

240
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,310
You went along with him at that time.

241
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,290
I was thinking

242
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,530
if either

243
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,120
Yu Zhecheng or me

244
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,910
had an accident or fell ill,

245
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,050
would I be willing to be the one

246
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,340
to stay by his side during the most difficult times?

247
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,410
Coffee.

248
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,440
You made the right decision.

249
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,530
Fei, do you really support me?

250
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,320
Alright, let's try on the next dress.

251
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:20,660
[MISS KING]
Alright, let's try on the next dress.

252
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,270
[MISS KING]

253
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,150
You should try it on too.
[MISS KING]

254
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,680
You should try it on too.

255
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,670
Me?

256
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,200
I thought about it.

257
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,660
Ren was right.

258
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:30,790
You should think more often

259
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,910
so that Dr. Xing can come back sooner.

260
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,320
When he comes back, you two should hurry up to

261
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,120
get your marriage certificate

262
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,410
and wedding done.

263
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,160
The earlier you prepare, the more at ease you'll be.

264
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,290
Forget it.

265
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,700
Even if I try,

266
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,390
the first person who sees me in a wedding dress

267
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,150
have to be Xing Zhizhi.

268
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,810
Fei, whenever you mention Xing Zhizhi,

269
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,240
you start prioritizing love over friendship.

270
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,510
Ke Feifei.

271
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,690
Alright, I won't try on any more. Let's go with this one.

272
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,090
The one you picked must be the best.

273
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:54,620
[MISS KING]
The one you picked must be the best.

274
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,200
[MISS KING]

275
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,960
Coffee.
[MISS KING]

276
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,070
[MISS KING]

277
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,730
You look really beautiful.

278
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,460
What are you doing here?

279
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,820
I'm about to change.

280
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,330
[MISS KING]

281
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,700
I'm sorry, Fei.

282
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:11,960
There was an emergency at the hospital.

283
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,790
I really...

284
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,240
Thank you.

285
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,470
You're not trying on any more?

286
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,470
No, I'm done.

287
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,240
It doesn't matter to you anyway.

288
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,300
So why should I bother trying on more?

289
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,910
I'll just prepare a sack for you then,

290
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,200
so you can put it on.

291
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,890
Come on, Fei. Let's go have dinner.

292
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:32,720
No, no, no.

293
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,270
I'm not going to be a third wheel.

294
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,910
Take your wife away quickly.

295
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:36,710
Alright then.

296
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,120
No, Fei...

297
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,240
Let's go.

298
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,960
What are you doing?

299
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,750
How did your fitting go just now?

300
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,440
Yu Zhecheng, I'm telling you, you're dead meat.

301
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,550
No, I really had something at the hospital just now.

302
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,550
Ms. Qin Fei,

303
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,770
why don't you choose one to try on as well?

304
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:57,870
Okay.

305
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,580
[MISS KING]

306
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,630

Could you help me grab my phone?
[MISS KING]

309
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:21,490
Could you help me grab my phone?

310
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,590
Sure, Ms. Qin Fei.

311
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,740
Thank you.

312
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,270
Here you go.

-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

There are over 100 people.

340
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:55,410
No exaggeration, no sentimentality.

341
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,200
Keep it simple, keep it real.

342
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,170
First of all,

343
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,530
I'm very grateful to the company for giving me this opportunity

344
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,920
to stand here.

345
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,490
Mountain flowers in full bloom, willows swaying gently.

346
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,120
Who wrote these overly sentimental words?

347
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,670
You don't have to say this.

348
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,880
Most importantly,

349
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,950
it's all because of

350
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,860

They are a group of self-reliant dancers.

355
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,490
In this glamorous world,

Six hours.

489
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,390
You're quite interesting.

490
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,720
I don't even need to hypnotize you.

491
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,050
You come here, lie down,

492
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:07,020
and sleep the whole afternoon without waking up.

493
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,280
You're treating my place like a hotel, huh?

494
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,940
I can't help it.

495
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,240
I can't sleep at home.

496
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,900
Actually, I understand.

497
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,310
Thank you.

498
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,790
Ren Siqi and I had a dog,

499
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,060
called Anji.

500
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,280
You know that, right?

501
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,890
I've heard Ren Siqi mention it.

502
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,350
He said Anji was very cute.

503
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,430
Ren Siqi and I don't have children.

504
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,600
Anji was like our child.

505
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,010
Not long ago,

506
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,520
Anji left us.

507
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,550
Yes, it passed away.

508
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,410
Oh,

509
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,960
Ren Siqi didn't tell me about that.

510
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,620
It's not a big deal, really.

511
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,110
Anji was old.

512
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,720
It was only a matter of time before it left.

513
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,000
It's inevitable.

514
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,790
When Anji was around,

515
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,410
Ren Siqi and I used to argue a lot,

516
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,450
every day.

517
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,760
Later,

518
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,970
Anji left.

519
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,480
The day Ren Siqi and I sent it off,

520
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,870
we hugged each other and cried our hearts out.

521
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:16,730
Suddenly remembering all our previous arguments,

522
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:20,070
we realized none of it mattered anymore.

523
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,540
Qin Fei,

524
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,370
life is precious

525
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,670
and also fragile.

526
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,020
Every minute and second

527
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,100
slips through our fingers like this.

528
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,090
We should cherish what we have,

529
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,800
and for what we've lost,

530
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,290
no matter how sad or reluctant we are,

531
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,140
we must learn to let go

532
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,120
and accept.

533
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,180
Because that's all we can do, isn't it?

534
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,850
I understand.

535
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,680
I'll be going then.

I'm starting to cook now.

When

540
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,950
