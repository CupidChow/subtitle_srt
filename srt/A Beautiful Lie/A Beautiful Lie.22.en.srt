00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,110
I'd like the chef’s special,

188
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,640

-Thank you.
-Okay. Please wait a moment.

190

Speaking of steak,

191
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,240
I just remembered this funny story.

192
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,090
When I was studying abroad,

193
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,530
the locals really loved

194
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,870
their beef rare.

195
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:37,550
One day, a friend of mine

196
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,200
took me out for beef tartare,

197
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,530
and they served this raw

198
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,800
minced beef.

199
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,600
It was just like the dumpling filling,

200
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,790
exactly the same.

201
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,130
And you were supposed to mix it with a raw egg.

202
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,100
When I took a bite,

203
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,310
I just spat it out!

204
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,450
Everyone was staring at me,

205
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,550
and I was so embarrassed

206
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,690
that I wanted to find a crack in the ground

207
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,400
and crawl into it right away.

208
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:03,610
Is this...

209
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,850
really edible?

210
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,820
It should be fine, I guess.

211
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,000
You try it first.

212
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,960
No way! Is it really that bad?

213
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,790
But it's expensive.

214
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,030
It's not bad.

215
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,480
See, you're meant to dip it in raw egg yolk,

216
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,310
and it's pretty fresh and sweet.

217
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,960
Are you serious?

218

this steak is so tender.

231
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,680

Just stick with me.

369
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:29,680
Relax.

370
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,300
Don't be nervous.

371
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,960
Listen to some music.

372
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,640
[Message] [Weather]

373
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,550
Here's a quick update on local news.

374
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,510
Just now, an explosion occurred at the electronics factory in our city,

375
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,400
causing a large fire.

376
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,440
The city's fire department and the Xiaoyun Rescue Team

377
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,070
rushed to the scene for rescue efforts immediately.

378
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,160
Now, let's check in on the situation at the scene.

379
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,920
The accident site is extremely cramped,

380
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,110
with thick smoke filling the area.

381
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,500
So far, eight people have been rescued safely.

382
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,300
As of now,

383
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,030
there have been three fatalities

384
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,160
and two serious injuries,

385
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,560
but details about those affected haven't been released yet.

386
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,190
I think you're more nervous than I am.

387
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,210
Don't worry.

388
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,670
I'm mentally prepared.

389
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,440
Will he go?

390
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,250
Will Liu Yanze go there?

391
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,160
I don't know.

392
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:42,750
Where are you going?

393
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,170
Everyone's here, right?

394
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,280
Let's do another check

395
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,930
to see if anyone's injured.

396
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:10,810
We're fine.

397
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:11,860
Everyone's okay.

398
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,910
But your face...

399
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,850
Don't joke around.

400
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,880
Go get some rest quickly.

401
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,130
Chemical plants are particularly prone to secondary explosions.

402
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,390
If they need anything from us,

403
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,160
we're always on standby.

404
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:25,680
Understood?

405
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,400
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, captain.

406
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,070
Dismissed.

407
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:27,550
Okay.

408
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,800
Captain Liu.

409
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,690
Someone is looking for you.

410
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:31,880
Who is it?

411
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,240
He said his name is...

412
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,350
Chen Shen.

413
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,360
[Liu Yanze]

414
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,720
[Liu Yanze]
[Decline] [Answer]

415
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,340
Thank you.

416
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,430
It's normal for you to care about him.

417
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,440
I... let's go quickly.

418
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,170
Your mom and dad must be getting anxious waiting.

419
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,670
When I was a kid, I loved mooncakes,

420
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,170
especially the mixed-nuts ones.

421
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,550
Each one only costs two or three yuan,

422
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,000
and they're super sweet.

423
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,440
My mom always said they were too sugary and unhealthy,

424
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,340
so she wouldn't let me have them.

425
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,810
The more she tried to stop me,

426
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,420
the more I wanted to eat them.

427
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,030
I yearned for them for years.

428
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,030
Now that I'm grown up,

429
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,320
my mom can't control what I eat anymore.

430
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,950
But suddenly, I feel…

431
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,380
I'm sorry, Xiaoxiao.

432
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,170
I changed my mind.

433
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:50,460
I'm not going to take you to meet my parents today.

434
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,440
I'm sorry about today.

435
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:35,110
Please give the gifts to your mom and dad for me.

436
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,070
Xiaoxiao.

437
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,830
If one day

438
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,750
I suggest that we break up,

439
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,840
will you say no?

440
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,790
What brings you here?

441
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,640
Who else did you think it would be?

442
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,590
Xiaoxiao?

443
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,030
You've prepared so much liquor.

444
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,670
What a waste of food.

445
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,430
Chen Shen,

446
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,590
you put way too much lemon

447
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,270
in this margarita!

448
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:00,270
It's so sour! Who would want to buy it?

449
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,900
Are you just here to drink my booze?

450
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,360
Or are you here to watch me embarrass myself?

451
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,050
What's wrong? You and Xiaoxiao...

452
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,640
No way!

453
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:16,000
Did I actually guess that right?

454
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,350
Didn't you tell me that

455
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:19,030
you wanted to take Xiaoxiao to meet your parents?

456
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,350
Just a few days ago, I told Xiaoxiao

457
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,480
how quickly you two were progressing.

458
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,850
If you have something to say, say it.

459
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,850
Otherwise, just enjoy your drinks.

460
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,120
Do you know this person?

461
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,320
Li Changjiang from Chenxing Group.

462
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,740
He's Ren Siqi's sponsor.

463
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,770
Why are you looking for him?

464
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:51,050
I'm not planning to renew my contract with Ren Siqi.

465
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,880
Three years ago,

466
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,480
I signed a bet-on agreement with Li Changjiang.

467
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,550
The first year's profit needs to reach 10 million,

468
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,550
and in the following 2 years,

469
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,880
it needs to increase by 30% each year.

470
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,160
If we can pull that off for 3 years in a row,
it'll be seen as a successful bet.

471
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,440
Then, Chenxing Group Holdings

472
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,030
will acquire our Xingyi Group,

473
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:09,880
and we'll be able to go IPO and get some dividends!

474
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,350
Isn't that a good thing?

475
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,400
It's a good thing if we achieve it,

476
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,640
but if we don't,

477
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:16,010
we'll lose the company.

478
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,550
Not only that,

479
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,550
but we'll also owe them

480
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,350
tens of millions

481
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,070
from their Series A and B round funding.

482
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,470
Where am I supposed to find that much money?

483
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,920
For the first two years,

484
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,610
we barely met the target.

485
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,880
And this year we're really running out of steam.

486
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,480
We can't rely on artist management alone

487
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,400
to meet the agreement.

488
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,550
That's why the company is shifting to production

489
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,010
and putting you in charge.

490
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,050
We need to use

491
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,470
all our artist resources

492
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,980
if we want to have a chance to achieve our goals this year.

493
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,040
Do you understand?

494
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,560
Let me put it this way,

495
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,600
if we fail to meet the bet-on agreement,

496
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,560
the company will be done.

497
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,340
You and I will both end up losing money.

498
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,620
Yeah, that's it.

499
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,070
How much?

500
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,000
50 million.

501
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:56,890
We'll have to pay Li Changjiang 50 million.

502
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,920
It's not just us losing money.

503
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,550
All those employees outside, including Coffee,

504
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,610
they are all going to lose their jobs.

505
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,710
Zhao from finance

506
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,130
just had his second kid this year.

507
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:09,240
His whole family depends on him for a living.

508
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,480
Wang from PR has a child,

509
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,880
with type 1 diabetes,

510
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,400
who needs meds every day.

511
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,310
Sure,

512
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,110
you can survive without acting.

513
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,370
But what about others?

514
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,830
What do you expect them to do?

515
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:21,960
Your mother

516
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,760
likes running a clothing store.

517
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,720
I helped find the place

518
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,400
and the suppliers.

519
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,560
And as for the loan guarantor,

520
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,490
I'm sorry to say,

521
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,830
that's also me.

522
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,100
If Xingyi and I collapsed,

523
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:35,370
your mom's store will be in trouble too.

524
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:36,920
Cheng

525
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,510
will be in

526
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,400
high school

527
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,070
and college soon,

528
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,670
maybe even studying abroad.

529
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,810
Anyway, that's all I wanted to say.

530
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:46,210
Think about it yourself.

531
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,590
Have you really thought it through?

532
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,910
Actually, I'm still thinking about it.

533
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,550
If I renew the contract,

534
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:04,230
it would be a full ten years...

535
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,770
of having no control over my life.

536
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,850
Every day I'll wake up

537
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,710
thinking about performing targets,

538
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,570
millions, even tens of millions.

539
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,980
But if I don't renew,

540
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,580
the whole company

541
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:17,290
will end up paying the price.

542
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,650
I know

543
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,960
there's no such a thing

544
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,110
as having it all.

545
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,000
But in the future,

546
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,920
I want to do what I love

547
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:34,020
and try to get back

548
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,810
the things

549
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,310
I've lost before.

550
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,340
That's ambitious.

551
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,160
You're being sarcastic!

552
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,960
I didn't expect you to be so idealistic.

553
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,770
It's rare to find someone who doesn't care about money

554
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:51,700
these days.

555
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:52,980
You're impressive.

556
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:55,520
Aren't you the same?

557
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,350
If you weren't idealistic,

558
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:00,310
would you have waited for Xiaoxiao for so many years?

559
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,640
But being an idealist

560
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,970
can really make you crash hard sometimes.

561
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,030
Chen Shen,

562
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,400
what exactly happened between you and Xiaoxiao?

563
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,590
Why don't you tell me about it?

564
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:14,120
I can help you get in touch with Li Changjiang,

565
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,440
but you've got to promise me one thing.

566
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,370
Alright, go ahead.

567
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,440
I trust you.

568
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,640

569
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,770

570
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,490
who's more important right now,

571
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:35,010
me or Liu Yanze?

572
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,950
It's quite childish, isn't it?

573
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,660

574
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:42,730

Just close the door when you leave.

599
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,190
I was just with Qin Fei.

600
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:15,100
I asked her to call you for me.

601
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:16,000

602
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:24,240
Well,

603
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,230
earlier today,

604
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,080
when I said we should break up...

605
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,430
I didn't mean that.

606
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,070
I just saw Liu Yanze and...

607
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:33,960
I don't know why,

608
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,880
I just lost my mind.

609
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,510
Don't take it personal.

610
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,750
I take it back.

611
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,160
Chen Shen, I'm sorry.

612
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,790
You're right about everything.

613
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,030
Some things...

614
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,440
when you can't have them,

615
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,840
you find them become especially alluring.

616
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,200
You start adding all sorts of filters to them,

617
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,690
and you fall deeper and deeper,

618
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:05,680
whether it's mooncakes or people.

619
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,030
-It's the same.
-Xiaoxiao.

620
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,000
I really didn't mean it that way.

621
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,590
We've put in a lot of effort

622
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,920
to be together.

623
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,070
And I know you've been trying hard

624
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,070
to have feelings for me.

625
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,960
I know all this. I'm not stupid.

626
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,050
Can we not just give up so easily?

627
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:23,170
That whole mooncake metaphor

628
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,850
was just me being dumb and impulsive.

629
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:26,310
I got caught up in the moment, saying a bunch of nonsense.

630
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,790
Don't take it personal.

631
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,340
Okay?

632
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,440
It's not like that.

633
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,480
I'm not talking about you.

634
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,940
I'm talking about myself.

635
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,960
You've seen how things have been these years, right?

636
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,130
I just can't...

637
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,010
move on and let go of him.

638
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,480
And honestly, I'm only getting deeper into him.

639
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,880
If we keep going

640
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,000
like this,

641
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,260
it'll only make you feel like you're sacrificing too much,

642
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,080
and that's not fair

643
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,220
or responsible to you.

644
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,280
Then what will it take

645
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,440
for you to move on?

maybe when the time comes,

650
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,360
and I've grown a bit,

651
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,920

736
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,550
You can tell me,

737
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,190
and I can give you the insider discount.

738
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,190
How about this one?

739
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,850
This is called emerald.

740
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,310
And this one looks great too.

741
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,060
What's wrong, Auntie?

742
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,540
Did something happen to Xiaofei?

743
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:39,230
No.

744
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,360
She's just filming a show.

745
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,490
Just take a look at the bracelets first.

746
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:42,860
Enough, enough.

747
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,440
Every time you try to be nice,
there's always something suspicious behind it.

748
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,840
Let's talk about these.

749
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:51,340
You said I liked ceramics,

750
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,840
and specially found this for me as a gift,

751
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,280
didn't you?

752
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,360
And what happened next?

753
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,400
Then you told me that Xiaofei had gotten into trouble
with some big director,

754
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,480
and asked me to persuade her

755
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,590
to apologize to that director

756
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:02,110
and make peace.

757
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,880
And these,

758
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,550
this one,

759
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,000
do you remember?

760
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,510
When you gave it to me,

761
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,280
you were smiling so hard

762
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,960
that your face was twitching.

763
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,000
And in the end?

764
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,110
You said Xiaofei had some scandal online,

765
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,400
and asked me to go clear it up,

766
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,510
didn't you?

767
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:21,110
And what about this one?

768
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:21,760
Alright, alright.

769
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,510
That's enough, that's enough.

770
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,840
I know, I know.

771
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,400
Come on.

772
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,440
Come on, Auntie.

773
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,030
Who are you trying to fool?

774
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,920
You think I don't see what's going on?

775
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,550
Enough.

776
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,800
Just spill it.

777
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,320
What's Xiaofei up to this time?

778
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,400
Fine.

779
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,400
Auntie, then I'll

780
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,480
cut to the chase.

781
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,030
This time,

782
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,360
it's also my fault.

783
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,670
I didn't

784
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,030
manage things well...

785
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:50,920
with Xiaofei.

786
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,400
She...

787
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,230
she's not renewing her contract.

788
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:55,290
She doesn't even want to act anymore.

789
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:58,630
If she's not acting, what does she want to do?

790
00:41:58,630 --> 00:41:59,480
That's exactly the point.

791
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,000
That's why I'm here to talk to you.

792
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,630
Listen, I set up a huge lead role

793
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:04,960
in a big production for her.

794
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,360
And obviously, you can tell that the company is giving her

795
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,420
a lot of resources.

796
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,400
But she just turned it down.

797
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,480
What I'm about to say,

798
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,360
honestly, I shouldn't really tell you all this.

799
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,110
This year

800
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:16,000
is the final year of our bet-on agreement.

801
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,590
If we don't hit the profit target,

802
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:18,590
we're going to lose the bet.

803
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:20,550
And if we lose, we'll have to pay back

804
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:22,000
five times the investment.

805
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,590
Auntie, five times!

806
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:25,070
This is not a small amount.

807
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,760
We're talking about potentially over 100 million here.

808
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,960
What?

809
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,030
That much money?

810
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:29,800
Yeah!

811
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,630
Our company can't afford that.

812
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:32,510
Besides,

813
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,670
we have so many employees,

814
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:35,550
and everyone is counting on Xiaofei for their livelihoods.

815
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:36,800
If she walks away like that,

816
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,920
how are we supposed to keep going?

817
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,630
How's everyone supposed to make a living, Auntie?

818
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:42,150
This kid is going too far!

819
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:44,000
How can she bite the hand that feeds her?

820
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,510
She has no sense of responsibility at all!

821
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:46,190
Don't worry.

822
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:46,960
As long as I'm here,

823
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,620
she won't do anything stupid.

824
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:50,070
Auntie, please have a seat.

825
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,360
That's why I'm here, right?

826
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,150
Since I'm here,

827
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:54,030
you need to talk some sense into her.

828
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,440
She can't handle things like this.

829
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,670
If she doesn't renew her contract,

830
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:58,960
you and her

831
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,150
will both suffer losses.

832
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:02,610
We'll have to pay the money together, right?

833
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:03,880
Qi,

834
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:05,310
don't worry.

835
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:07,560
I will talk to her.

836
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:08,650
She wouldn't dare.

837
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:10,130
Auntie, you're so kind.

838
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:11,800
Alright, alright.

839
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,320
Stop flattering me.

840
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:15,400
Alright, alright.

841
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,500
Auntie, why don't you

842
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,960
pick a bracelet?

843
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:47,070
Zhang,

844
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,230
later,

845
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:49,880
schedule a meeting with Coffee.

846
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,920
Based on your consistent work performance,

847
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,510
the company is planning to promote you

848
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:54,800
to Director of Artists,

849
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,400
with a 50% salary increase

850
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,880
from your current base.

851
00:43:58,670 --> 00:43:59,670
Take a look.

852
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,710
What do you think?

853
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:06,360
I feel like I'm dreaming.

854
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:06,560
[Xingyi Entertainment]
I feel like I'm dreaming.

855
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,150
[Xingyi Entertainment]

856
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:08,440
This special promotion
[Xingyi Entertainment]

857
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,840
is due to
[Xingyi Entertainment]

858
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,850
your excellent work so far.
[Xingyi Entertainment]

859
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:11,280
your excellent work so far.

860
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,360
And the artists you've managed

861
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,760
have made huge contributions to the company.

862
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,630
That's true.

863
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,510
But,

864
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:18,590
there is a condition

865
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:20,720
attached to this promotion and raise.

866
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,510
What condition?

867
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,960
Convince Qin Fei to renew her contract.

868
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:27,880
The company has signed a bet-on agreement,

869
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,970
and the only way to meet the terms
is for Qin Fei to renew her contract.

870
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:33,530
If you can't convince Qin Fei,

871
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,000
not only will the promotion and raise be off the table,

872
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,400
but you might also lose your current job.

873
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,500
I understand.

874
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:43,610
You're threatening me.
