your mom came to see you at school,

but why are you dragging me here with you?

My mom doesn't allow me to play with you.

9
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,850
She says you hit children at school.

10
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,640
Kids who hit others are bad kids.

11
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,930
Well, well, Chubby.

12
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,260
Who saved you

13
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,640
when someone was chasing you to hit you?

14
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,310
It was I,

15
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,510
not your mom.

16
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,310
Tell me,

17
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,350
am I a bad kid?

18
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,030
So, tell me,

19
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,840
do you listen to your mom or to me?

20
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,730
I... I...

21
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,880
See? You can't answer, can you?

22
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,600
Well, then I'll make the choice for you.

23
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,750
You can listen to your mom

24
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,780
and stop playing with me.

25
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,290
As for me, I'll listen to my dad

26
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,290
and won't play with idiots like you.

27
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,770

28
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,430

What are you doing?

He's the one cheating on you.

32
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,000
Why are you kicking me out?

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,120
I'll buy you a flight ticket for tomorrow morning.

34
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,140
Hurry and leave!

35
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:33,710
Tell your mother,

36
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,420
I can't serve a young master like you!

37
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,470
You think I...

38
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,590
I want to meddle in this?

39
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,050
You've hated me since we were kids.

40
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,400
The more I followed you around, the more annoyed you got.

41
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,270
Later on, you... you didn't even come home anymore.

42
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:43,990
I know.

43
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,120
You just hate me.

44
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,020
You hate that I took your mom away from you.

45
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,350
Why are you saying all this?

46
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,310
What does this have to do with you

47
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,780
taking someone else's phone?

48
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,120
Was I wrong to check his phone?

49
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,390
He has been in contact with that woman.

50
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,070
They even meet regularly every week,

51
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,400

00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,520
right in Huhai.

53
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,330
Instead of thanking me for helping you cut your losses in time,

54
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,400
you're scolding me.

55
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,290
Lu Yicheng,

56
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,000
who told you that just because they meet regularly,

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,880
it means something's going on between them?

58
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,470
Besides,

59
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,710
even if there is, so what?

60
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,700
What does it have to do with you?

61
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,560
Let me tell you,

62
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,960
your mom won't discipline you, but I will!

63
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,360
If you dare to hack someone's phone again,

64
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,960
I'll call the police and have you taken to the police station!

65
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,810
Got it?

66
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,650
You're just lovesick!

67
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,500
Enough.

68
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,980
He's young

69
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,170
and doesn't know any better.

70
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,970
Just teach him slowly over time.

71
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,740
Cheng,

72
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,820
I won't comment on whether what you did was right or wrong.

73
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,900
I do keep something from your sister.

74
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,340
And I do meet with Ge Wu every week,

75
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,630
who is "that woman" you mentioned.

76
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,150
But I will explain this matter clearly

77
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,850
to your sister.

78
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,510
It's not what you think.

79
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,360
Let's go out for a walk.

80
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,150
Have you been to Suman?

81
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,590
I've heard of it,

82
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,080
but I've never been there.

83
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,090
I have.

84
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,480
It was about five years ago.

85
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,160
When I was traveling,

86
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,620
I stayed there for a while.

87
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,130
Suman is actually a very interesting place.

88
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,330
There are many small markets there.

89
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,260
The people there are very warm

90
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,980
and love lively atmospheres

91
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,410
and bright colors.

92
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,980
In that place,

93
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,180
I met a little boy.

114
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,600
you're Chinese too?

115
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,500
I haven't met a Chinese person in a long time.

116
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,800
Brother, come with me.

117
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,750
Where are we going?

118
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,420
I'll take you to see my mom.

119
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,250
Hurry, hurry!

120
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,450

are you being mischievous again?

125
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,660
So, your name is Xiaojia.

126
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,610
What a coincidence

127
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,690
to meet fellow Chinese here.

128

00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,210
what's your name?

130
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:45,910
Me?

131
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,790
My name is Xing Zhizhi.

132
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,150
Xing... Zhi...

133
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,390
What a tongue-twister of a name.

134
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,070
Oh, you.

135
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,800
Are you here on a trip?

136
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,430
I've just finished my internship,

137
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,140
so I wanted to travel around.

138
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,210
And I like Suman,

139
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,110
so I volunteered

140
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,120
at a hospital here for a while.

141
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,700
Brother,

142
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,550
you're a doctor?

143
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,310
Yes,

144
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,680
I heal and save people.

145
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,270
That's amazing.

146
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,480
Xiaojia,

147
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,430
you should study hard too.

148
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,600
So you can be like him in the future

149
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,970
and become a doctor who saves lives.

150
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,490
Oh, you.

151
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,470
Whenever studying is mentioned,

152
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,150
he becomes as quiet as a clam.

153
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,300
Xiaojia,

154
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,360
do you like cameras?

155
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,490
Can we take a picture together?

156
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,770
-Of course.
-Okay.

157
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,850
Come on.

158
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,490
Three, two, one,

159
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,720

00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,700
-Xiaojia.
-Dr. Xing, please save my child.

164
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,660
I know.

165
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,640
-Xiaojia!
-Save my child.

166

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,600
Please save...

169
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,970
my...

170
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,330
child.

172
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,350
Stay awake!

173
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,140
Stay awake!

174
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,210
Xiaojia, stay awake!

175
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,270
Xiaojia, wake up.

176
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,910
Don't sleep just yet; stay with me!

177
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,090
Xiaojia, Xiaojia!

178
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,360
Calm down. Calm down.

179
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,150
The shrapnel is lodged in his heart. It's too dangerous.

180
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,650
-Let's go! Go!
-Calm down.

181
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,080
-Calm down!
-Or it'll be too late.

182
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,680
Come on, go, go, go.

183
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,480
Xiaojia's mother saved my life.

184
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,590
But I couldn't fulfill her last wish.

185
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,110
Xiaojia's life

186
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,270
slipped away on my operating table...

187
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,990
in my hands.

188
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,280
It's not your fault.

189
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:39,870
I've been

190
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,550
trying so hard to tell myself,

191
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,260
to convince myself

192
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,950
that I really did my best.

193
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,290
To tell myself that what killed Xiaojia

194
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,470
was that bomb that made it impossible

195
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,210
for me to continue the surgery.

196
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,620
But the name "Xiaojia"

197
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,160
has still become a burden in my heart.

198
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:00,550
Since that time,

199
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,150
I haven't been able to hold a scalpel steadily.

200
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,690
So, you chose to come here...

201
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,710
to solve this problem.

202
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,480
My hands shake, and I can stop performing surgeries,

203
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,720
but...

204
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,670
Do you remember that traffic accident

205
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,240
before I left Huhai?

206
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,210
The car suddenly swerved,

207
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,450
not because I was too tired

208
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,710
nor was there a mechanical malfunction,

209
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,300
but because I saw Xiaojia.

210
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,150
Xiaojia is still alive?

211
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,500
I don't know.

212
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,390
But I'm certain that what I saw that day

213
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,160
wasn't the real Xiaojia.

214
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,880
It was a hallucination.

215
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,320
Qin Fei.

216
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,820
I'm sick.

217
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,780
Since I saw Xiaojia again

218
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,710
at the welfare home

219
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,420
five years ago,

220
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,840
I've been sick.

221
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,680
What about medication?

222
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,990
Medication can relieve it, right?

223
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,720
Most medications

224
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,240
can only relieve my symptoms.

225
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,550
Once I stop taking them,

226
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,080
the symptoms worsen.

227
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,080
Ge Wu thinks the triggers

228
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,320
for my worsening condition

229
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,520
are all related to performing surgeries.

230
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,850
She wants me to try to see

231
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,910
if completely leaving the hospital environment

232
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,910
could make Xiaojia stop appearing.

233
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,700
If that's really the case,

234
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,810
then I wouldn't need treatment anymore.

235
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,140
I just have to leave the hospital forever.

236
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,500
I've told you everything you wanted to know.

237
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:48,890
But...

238
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,900
But, actually, I've always had a question that I wanted to ask you.

239
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,280
If...

240
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,390
if my illness can't be cured...

241
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,990
would you...

242
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,610
No.

243
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,050
That still wouldn't stop me from being angry with you.

244
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,360
Do you know why?

245
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,350
Because I lied to you.

246
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,560
And?

247
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:39,740
Xing Zhizhi.

248
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,340
You told me before

249
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,240
that if there was a problem,

250
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,570
we should solve it together

251
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,760
and trust each other.

252
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,090
But look at what you did.

253
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,130
When you had a problem, you ran away by yourself,

254
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,560
leaving me there.

255
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,240
You even lied to Xixi, saying you were giving me a surprise.

256
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,960
Do I look surprised now?

257
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,440
Cat got your tongue again?

258
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,400
Xiaofei,

259
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,820
I wanted to apologize to you,

260
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,780
but I...

261
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,300
I was afraid that if I said it, you'd get angry again.

262
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,980
Just talking about your mistakes isn't enough.

263
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,240
You need to make up for them with actions.

264
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,100
How can I make it up to you?

265
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,650
Well, I brought the review materials with me anyway.

266
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,520
♫Star in your eyes♫

from now on,

276
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,350

The projector is broken.

295

Aren't you good?

296
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:30,920
Fix it.

297
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,290
My sister wants to kick me out.

298
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,110
I'm not in the mood.

299
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,310
Serves you right.

300
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,520
Ms. Ge Wu is a psychologist.

301
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,060
She treated me before as well.

302
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,240
Mr. Xing must have some serious business with her.

303
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,300
It's definitely not about cheating, like you claimed.

304
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,160
Well, I don't know that woman

305
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,470
is Xing Zhizhi's...

306
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,170
Yes.

307
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,870
Xing Zhizhi doesn't cheat on Fei.

308
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,310
You're right to scold me.

309
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,530
I'm the bad guy.

310
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,080
I deserve to be disliked.

311
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,140
You don't have to push me to leave.

312
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,450
I'll buy my own ticket.

313
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,800
I'll leave tomorrow.

314
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,160
Tell your Mr. Xing Zhizhi

315
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,680
that I'm sorry.

316
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,660
Don't worry.

317
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,100
I can guarantee

318
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,660
that your sister won't let you leave.

319
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,490
Really?

320
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,620
Really.

321
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,350
You two are indeed siblings.

322
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,500
Even your way of being stubborn is the same.

323
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,660
Of course.

324
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,790
We're siblings by blood.

325
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,720
Xiaoxiao?

326
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,650
What's wrong? You didn't even turn on the lights.

327
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,050
What's the matter?

328
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,470
Qin Fei,

329
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,140
do you know?

330
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,130
Something big has happened.

331
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,570
You mean that matter with Cheng earlier?

332
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,700
I'm sorry, but I've taken care of it.

333
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,330
No, you don't know.

334
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,280
It's Liu Yanze.

335
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:57,730
He's gone crazy.

336
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,550
He just grabbed me and said

337
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,280
that he had come this time to...

338
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,390
get back together with me.

339
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,920
Isn't that normal?

340
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,160
What else would he be here for?

341
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,430
To pick grapes?

342
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,410
You don't know him.

343
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,440
At first, I thought

344
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,160
even if he came to ask me to get back together with me this time,

345
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,640
he wouldn't say it so quickly.

346
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,760
But who knows?

347
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,200
He's gone insane.

348
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,400
So?

349
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,720
So...

350
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,550
So...

351
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,590
should I have just agreed to it directly?

352
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,870
Agree, my foot!

353
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,830
And here I thought you had some sense.

354
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,270
I thought you wanted to discuss

355
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,030
how to give him a hard time.

356
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,070
But you, my dear,

357
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,620
you're ready to agree right away.

358
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,820
I don't even know how to respond to that.

359
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,510
Luo Xiaoxiao, I really can't understand.

360
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,890
You're an aloof movie queen,

361
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:45,680
an artistic goddess.

362
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,110
How could you let someone like Liu Yanze

363
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,460
have you wrapped around his finger?

364
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,610
He says let's get together, and you're on board, and it's over when he says it's over.

365
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:51,470
What about you?

366
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,860
Don't you have any feelings?

367
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,800
You just accept whatever he does?

368
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,820
I'm not really targeting him specifically,

369
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,050
but for your own good,

370
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:12,270
we should at least test him a bit, right?

371
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,060

00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,300
It's not like you.

559
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,640
How come? This isn't working either.

560
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,160
No response at all.

561
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,440
I think you're still not fixing it right.

562
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,670
It shouldn't be.

563
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,410
There... there is no response.

564
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:23,570
Doesn't that mean there's electricity?

568
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:37,550
you deliberately dragged me here, did you?

569
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:38,650
No, I didn't.

570
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,210
I'm going to find Xiaoxiao.

571
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,760

573
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:46,440
okay?

574
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,230
Besides,

575
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,520
I've been missing you.

587

When I said I didn't love you before,

588
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,800
it was just out of spite.

589

592

593
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,510

594
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:25,820

596
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,630
Just a few minutes,

597

and then I'll leave.

598
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:35,860
Actually, all these years,

599
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,960
I haven't gone a single moment without thinking about you.

600
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,720
Do you remember once

601
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,800
that I finally mustered the courage to message you?

602
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:49,130
But the next second, I got a mission call from the team.

603
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,330
I thought

604
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:56,230
maybe it was heaven's way of telling me not to bother you.

605
00:33:57,690 --> 00:33:59,140
All these years,

606
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,010
I don't know why,

607
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:03,810
but every time I see you,

608
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:05,940
I get nervous...

609
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,800
scared...

610
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,600
timid,

611
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,960
and hesitant.

612
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:14,870
Later,

613
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,340
I saw you with Chen Shen.

614
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,520
You looked happy.

615
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:22,740
I was jealous,

616
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:25,010
so I spoke without thinking.

617
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,480
I thought you two would be happy together,

618
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:30,100
but later I found out that you weren't.

620
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,840

but you won't even tell me

658

Are you mute? Are you a wall?

666
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,650
Because I felt that I wasn't good enough for you.

667
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,680
I felt inferior.

690

I gave a fair price,

691
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,750
not a penny more nor a penny less, right?

692
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,340
With grapes as good as ours,

693
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,150
how could we worry about selling them?

00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:29,060
How could we possibly not?

695
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,720
As soon as the big boss heard the price,

696
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,610
he didn't say a word.

697
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,700
If I hadn't begged and pleaded,

698
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,980
they would have left long ago.

699
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,490
They said there would be many big clients at this trade fair.

700
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:41,130
I thought all of our grapes would be bought up.

701
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:43,850
But in the end, only one came,

702
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:46,340
and he didn't even want to sign a single contract with us.

703
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,260

but there are just too many.

709
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,020

There are so many

711
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,990
that we can't even finish picking them all.

712
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:02,080
With so much around, prices go down.

713
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,780
Last year, it was a hundred yuan.

716
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:07,800
And even that's considered expensive.

717
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,940
How can anyone afford to sell at this price?

718
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:10,960
At this rate,

719
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,960
even if I sold all the grapes from my entire yard,

720
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,400
it still wouldn't be enough to cover the mortgage on these few rooms.

742
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,550
let's sit down and chat first.

743
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:33,960
Okay, thank you, Aunt.

744
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,840
Mr. Wang, we've been waiting for you for a long time.

745
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,880
We were afraid you wouldn't come.

746
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,150
Mr. Wang is here!

747
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:48,350
Mr. Wang, please take the seat of honor!

748
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,250
Miss Luo is here too?

749
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:55,220
Fate keeps bringing us together; there's no stopping it.

750
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,130
Yunzhong Guesthouse.

751
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,860
This is really a nice place.

752
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:01,360
A small place, but it's got quite the celebrity, huh?

753
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,290
Mr. Wang,

754
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,480
hello.

755
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:06,510
Hello, hello, hello.

756
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,710
What are you doing?

757
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,050
Who is he?

758
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,590
My personal bodyguard.

759
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,810
He's got a bit of a firm grip;

760
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:14,340
please don't take offense.

761
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:18,700
-Please have a seat.
-Let's eat and chat. Let's eat and chat.

762
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:21,120
Come on, have a seat. Sit.

763
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,540
Miss Luo,

764
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:27,180
are you still angry with me?

765
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,830
Just because of the mangoes last time?

766
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,110
You never told me you were allergic to mangoes.

767
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:34,640
How was I supposed to know,

768
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:35,210
right?

769
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,130
Come on, come on.

770
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:37,820
Let me make a toast to you

771
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:39,850
as an apology.

772
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:44,300
Don't be angry, Miss Luo.

773
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:46,640
I didn't mean to do that last time,

774
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,310
right?

775
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,370
Let me make it up to you

776
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,630
with this wine.

777
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:52,300
Alright? Come on.

778
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:54,030
Anger doesn't suit you.

779
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:54,970
Come on, come on.

780
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:56,260
Let me toast you, okay?

781
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:57,540
Come on, come on.

782
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:03,910
What's the meaning of this?

783
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:04,760
You lousy bodyguard,

784
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,710
I didn't hold that against you just a moment ago.

785
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:07,540
You're getting cocky, huh?

786
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:09,340
Lousy bodyguard?

787
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,370
What's wrong with being a bodyguard?

788
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:11,670
Let me tell you, I happen to like lousy bodyguards.

789
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:13,600
I can't stand someone as filthy as you!

790
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,460
Luo Xiaoxiao, how dare you insult me!

791
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,460
So what?

792
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:18,420
I'll hit you, too, if I feel like it.

793
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:20,970
Fine, you've got guts.

794
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:22,120
Let me tell you!

795
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:23,950
I'm putting it out here right now:

796
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:25,350
I won't buy a single grape

797
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,060
from your family this year!

798
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,180
Look at you, flaunting your money.

799
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,070
Let me tell you!

800
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,290
I wouldn't sell my grapes to you,

801
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:32,550
even if you wanted them!

802
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:33,630
And now, I'm going to...

803
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:34,400
I'm even going to teach you a lesson!

804
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,260
Why are you hitting me?

805
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,250
-Let me tell you!
-I will...

806
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,320
You keep that up, and I'll call the police!

807
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,280
You scoundrel!

808
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,140
Go ahead; call them!

809
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:46,110
Are you alright?

810
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,990
I'm fine.

811
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,190
Why are you smiling?

812
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:55,910
He insulted you, and you're still smiling?

813
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:57,350
Didn't you just say

814
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,960
that you liked lousy bodyguards?

815
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,560
As a lousy bodyguard, can I be happy about that?

816
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,540
Come with me then.

817
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:20,100
What are you doing, you lousy bodyguard?
