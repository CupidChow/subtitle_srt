00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,240
Dr. Xing, why are you here?

378
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,120
I happen to have time to visit you.

379
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,690
Try not to lower your head when doing this exercise.

380
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:40,730
Dr. Xing.

381
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,380
You care so much about me.

382
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,430
After all, you always ask for me as your doctor.

383
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,990
If I don't satisfy you,

384
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,260
you might replace me in no time.

385
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,500
I was just kidding.

386
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,330
Are you free tonight? Let's have dinner together.

387
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,900
I'm really sorry.

388
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,180
I have an appointment

389
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,230
with my colleagues at the hospital foundation tonight.

390
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,870
We need to talk about the Gamma Knife donation

391
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,750
for a paired assistance hospital.

392
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,060
It's just a knife.

393
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,260
I'll donate it.

394
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,750
We'll talk about it during dinner.

395
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,870
Really?

396
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,150
How much is this knife?

397
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,390
We're short of 2 million.

398
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:13,440
Of course,

399
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,310
for a successful person like you,

400
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,640
that should be nothing.

401
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:18,400
This is

402
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,500
our hospital foundation's public account.

403
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,470
There's the donor's WeChat account below.

404
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,470
Why don't you send a friend request?

405
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,790
Two million, friends.

406
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,520
Our Dr. Xing settled it just like that.

407
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,100
Linkang County's Gamma Knife

408
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,010
is in the bag.

409
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,340
Amazing! Amazing!

410
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,410
This is the act

411
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,280
of a hero.

412
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,390
Enough.

413
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,070
Let me tell you again.

414
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,950
It's not confirmed yet.

415
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,460
What's not confirmed yet?

416
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,240
A rich woman

417
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,710
is spending big money

418
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:51,380
to donate a Gamma Knife

419
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,970
so she can pursue Dr. Xing.

420
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,250
Don't listen to her.

421
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,220
Please get back to work.

422
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:56,910
Please.

423
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,720
Please, okay?

424
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,560
Please.

425
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,470
Go, go.

426
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,000
Let's go, let's go.

427
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,510
Really?

428
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,210
No.

429
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,400
Don't listen to their nonsense, okay?

430
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,840
I'm still working on it.

431
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,350
National Comprehensive Cancer Network.

432
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,790
Latest non-small cell lung cancer...

433
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:17,960
I chanced upon it.

434
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,600
You haven't performed surgery for five years.

435
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,190
Don't you miss it?

436
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,960
Your skills and expertise are wasted here

437
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,310
at the rehabilitation department.

438
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,490
When are you coming back to the thoracic surgery department?

439
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,300
No thanks.

440
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,780
I'm doing well in the rehabilitation department.

441
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,980
I don't want to be

442
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,560
as busy as you.

443
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,250
Alright.

444
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,580
Huang and I have something to discuss.

445
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,340
I'm leaving.

446
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,630
Don't look for me if there's nothing urgent.

447
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,600
Don't look for me if there's something urgent either.

448
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,530
You're leaving?

449
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,510
-Dr. Xing.
-Iâ€™m done.

450
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,140
Mr. Ren.

451
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:08,140
I'm a staff member of the Hexi Hospital Foundation.

452
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,600
Hello.

453
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:09,280
Have a seat.

454
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,390
Please have a seat.

455
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,000
Please have a seat.

456
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,320
Dr. Xing told me that

457
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,780
Ms. Qin donates to our

458
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,080
hospital foundation every year.

459
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,110
I checked the records.

460
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,540
She donates one million yuan

461
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,770
to the hospital foundation every year.

462
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,480
Yes.

463
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,240
Well...

464
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,580
this year,

465
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,260
will she do it again?

466
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,020
Do what?

467
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,960
What do you mean? Just say it.

468
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:39,880
Just say it.

469
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,080
Mr. Ren,

470
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,330
don't think too much.

471
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,360
Here's the thing.

472
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,000
We want to

473
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,680
help our paired assistance hospital

474
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,680
and donate a Gamma Knife to them.

475
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,020
But there's indeed a shortage of funds.

476
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,220
Our colleagues at the foundation learned that

477
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,420
Ms. Qin has been kindly donating to us

478
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,440
every year.

479
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,900
He wants me to introduce you two

480
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,430
and have a chat, that's all.

481
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,010
Yes, Mr. Ren.

482
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,190
Actually, there are only two things.

483
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,780
First of all,

484
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:08,130
it's about Ms. Qin's donation this year.

485
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,830
Can you change it to a targeted donation?

486
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,100
A targeted donation?

487
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,240
That's not a problem at all.

488
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,260
What's the second thing?

489
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,240
The second thing is...

490
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,310
Can you change the donation amount

491
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,350
to two million?

492
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:33,090
Two million?

493
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:33,740
Yes.

494
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,320
Multiplied by two.

495
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,900
If it doesn't work...

496
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:46,580
Mr. Ren.

497
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,050
Here's the thing.

498
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:48,770
We

499
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,270
have another request.

500
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,010
So there's a third thing.

501
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,320
Let me finish.

502
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,580
Our hospital

503
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:58,520
would like to invite Miss Qin Fei as a celebrity volunteer

504
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,980
to go with the medical team

505
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,440
and personally pass the Gamma Knife

506
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,570
to the patients in Linkang County

507
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,210
before attending the ribbon-cutting ceremony.

508
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,670
This is to cooperate with our PR department.

509
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,590
What do you think?

510
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,930

511
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,330

512
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,120
Yes.

515
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,490
Sure.

516
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,100
It's settled then.

517
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:27,780
Alright?

518
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,080
No changing the terms.

519
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,500

520
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,580

566
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,120
You just called her an old woman.

567
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,600
She's really pretty.

568
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,250
Dr. Xing, did we wake you up?

569
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,100
Qin Fei, right?

570
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,110
Let me see.

571
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,630
I thought it was you.

572
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,730
How is that possible?

573
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,190
Dr. Xing.

574
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:28,540
You're quite the joker.

575
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,690
Really.

576
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,390
The only difference between you and this photo

577
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,260
is that the photo is quiet.

581
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,330

Dr. Chen asked me for help.

586
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,240
He asked me to train

588

But he looks very familiar.

754
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:24,390
Don't come in.

755
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,360
The structure is unstable.

756
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,120
Wait outside.

757
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,280
No, let me help you.

758
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,780
How about this?

759
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,920
Find something for bandaging.

760
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,320
Anything is fine. Hurry.

761
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,420
Coffee!

762
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:55,450
Get me my luggage!

763
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,110
Okay.

764
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,150
She's still alive.

765
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,720
No obvious trauma.

766
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,650
Can I help with anything?

767
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:10,570
No need.

768
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:15,160
Her rib cage and spine are fine.

769
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:18,580
Her abdomen is fine.

770
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,730
The pelvis is fine.

771
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:23,250
Fei!

772
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:24,880
Open it for me.

773
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,570
Open the luggage case.

774
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,390
You two,

775
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:29,650
send the injured to the county hospital

776
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:30,750
-Get help. Hurry.
-Okay.

777
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:31,380
Coffee, you go.

778
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,320
I'll stay here with him.

779
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,510
You two go together!

780
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:34,930
Fei, come with me.

781
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:36,280
Don't worry. I can take care of myself.

782
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:36,950
Off you go.

783
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,700
Dr. Xing, please take care of Fei.

784
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,830
Give me the towel.

785
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,530
Okay.

786
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,340
It's okay.

787
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,580
I can do it alone.

788
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,050
Go and help me

789
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,660
get that plank of wood.

790
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,780
From here.

791
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,590
Yes, this one.

792
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,730
Let me do it.

793
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:49,100
Don't move.

794
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,680
It's raining.

795
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:56,500
She can't get wet.

796
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,420
Find something.

797
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,070
Find something.

798
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:58,880
Cover her.

799
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,750
Hurry.

800
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:05,940
I'll be ready soon.

801
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:07,210
Wait for me.

802
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:32,350
â™«Once more, I meet youâ™«

803
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:40,610
â™«No doubt I've decided to love youâ™«

804
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,150
â™«Your eyes light up the pastâ™«

805
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,660
â™«Light up the heartâ™«

806
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:53,020
â™«So I'm not aloneâ™«

807
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,250
â™«When I dream of all the seasonsâ™«

808
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,520
â™«I wanna be with youâ™«

809
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:05,900
â™«Till the sunlight so deeply falls in lineâ™«

810
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,310
Xing Zhizhi.

811
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,140
Her hands are so cold.

812
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:30,080
Rub her hands and keep her warm.

813
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,990
Like this.

814
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:33,390
Rub it like this.

815
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:34,670
Yes.

816
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,710
She's awake.

817
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:49,030
Little girl.

818
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,490
-Little girl.
-Little girl.

819
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,180
Wake up.

820
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,850
-Wake up.
-Little girl.

821
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,000
Don't sleep.

822
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,080
Wake up.

823
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,000
Little girl.

824
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,050
My leg hurts.

825
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,890
Little girl, you hurt your leg.

826
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,680
Don't move.

827
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,900
Don't worry.

828
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,920
Big brother here is a doctor.

829
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,530
You will be fine.

830
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:19,010
Yes.

831
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:21,720
But I'm an athlete.

832
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,930
Can I still run?

833
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,330
Of course.

834
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:27,210
The rescue team will be here soon.

835
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:30,930
Little girl, don't sleep.

836
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:32,570
Don't let her sleep.

837
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:35,110
-Donâ€™t sleep.
-Donâ€™t let her sleep.

838
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,170
What's your name?

839
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,290
My name is Xixi.

840
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,420
How old are you?

841
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:43,700
I'm ten years old.

842
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,940
-Don't sleep.
-Well...

843
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,750
Let me sing you a song.

844
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:56,950
What a beautiful jasmine flower.

845
00:40:56,970 --> 00:41:02,750
What a beautiful jasmine flower.

846
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:08,740
Blooming all over the branches.

847
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:14,810
It's fragrant and popular.

848
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,320
Let me

849
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:20,640
pluck you off

850
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:25,260
and gift you to someone else.

851
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:31,490
Jasmine flower, jasmine flower.

852
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,000
The rescue is here.

853
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,140
Fei! The rescue team is here!

854
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:18,310
â™«You occupy my sightâ™«

855
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:25,910
â™«Light up every momentâ™«

856
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:33,930
â™«When I keep thinking about youâ™«

857
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:40,650
â™«The whole world has fallenâ™«
