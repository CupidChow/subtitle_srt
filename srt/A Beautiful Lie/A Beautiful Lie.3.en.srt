Are you okay?

00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,130
How are you?

5
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,800
Hang in there.

6
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,080
I'll save you.

7
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,130
Don't sleep.

8
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,240
Don't sleep.

9
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,280
You must not sleep.

Listen to me.

You're safe here.

16
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,740
I'll go save others first.

17
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,390
I'll come back for you.

18
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,310
Are you okay? Okay?

00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,210
Come on! Come on!

[Sorry, Qin Xiaofei.]

28
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,740
So I often think

29
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,350
if he didn't save me,

30
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,500
it would have been better to let me die in that explosion.

31
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,380
D-Do you really think so?

32
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,060
You don't want him to save you?

33
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,360
It's all in the past.

Help me taste the chicken soup.

36
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,530
This is my first time cooking it.

37
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,150
But I forgot the female ginseng and wolfberry.

38
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,260
Is it too late to put them in now?

39
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,310
Or does Xixi not like to

40
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,510
eat something so strong tasting?

41
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,010
Are you okay?

42
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,290

This is called four point kneeling.

45

With opposing upper and lower limbs

46
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,920
as support,

47
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,870
the other limbs are lifted at the same time.

48
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,510
Strengthen your waist

49
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,160
and hold for 10 to 20 seconds

50
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,590
before you put it down.

51
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,070
This movement mainly trains

52
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,390
the core strength

53
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,620

54
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,410

Put both your hands on your waist,

and bend your knee at 90 degrees

62
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,280

Did you do it on purpose?

Not bad.

What are you smiling at?

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,800
Look.

Isn't she beautiful?

122

She's a superstar.

There are stairs.

00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,240
Why are we resting again?

This is so nice.

It's quiet.

138

Are you here to take care of the patients

139
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,370
or to waste your time?

140
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,620
I'll complain to Dr. Xing.

I can't send anything.

I don't have any signal either.

What's going on?

156
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,440
Is something wrong with the signal tower?

157
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,440
Am I able to watch

159
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,240
Do you want to see it?

160
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,550
You have an way?

161
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,660
You'd better be nice to me.

162
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,130
After all, I am now

163
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,160
your only connection to the entertainment industry.

What are you doing now?

165
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,960
Your old mosquito tent is old and yellowed.

166
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,680
So I got you a new one.

167
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,440
Tell me.

168
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,320
What do you need from me this time?

169
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:39,710
Your phone!

No.

171
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,450
My sister has been working really hard

172
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,950
helping Mr. Xing these days.

173
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,260
You know that, right?

174
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,420
That's not his problem.

175
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,080
That's not what I mean.

176
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,490
My sister is a really nice person.

177
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,720
Dr. Yu, can you do me a favor

178
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,310
and allowed my sister to

179
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,520
take these two days off?

180
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,910
Otherwise, people will keep coming to look at her.

181
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,220
That's so awkward.

182
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,980
I don't want to cause trouble to the hospital either.

183
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:10,920
You're right.

184
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,810
I'm counting on you.

185
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,720
That's indeed troublesome.

186
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,500
By the way,

187
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,680
at 10 p.m. tonight,

188
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,970
there will be no water or electricity in the hospital.

189
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,630
Remember to tell your sister.

190
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,450
Got it?

191
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,460
Okay.

192
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,040
All done.

193
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,370
You can take care of the old mosquito tent.

194
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,180
I'm counting on you.

195
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,380
Coffee. I'm going to go wash my hair

196
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,490
since there's no one now.

197
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,370
Fei!

198
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,480
What's wrong? Say something.

199
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,970
I forgot what I wanted to say.

200
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,480
You'd better not work out.

201
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,680
Eat some walnuts to nourish your brain.

202
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,750
What was I going to say?

203
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,340
Forget it. It's probably not something important.

204
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,580
That's it.

205
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,040
There's no water?

206
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,580
How unlucky...

207
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,470
Who is it?

208
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,710
It's him?

209
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,980
Xing Zhizhi?

210
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:34,330
Why is it always him when I'm in a bad situation.

211
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,640
Hello?

212
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,130
Who are you?

213
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,070
Hello.

214
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,390
Do you need help?

215
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,700
No.

216
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,120
I can do it myself.

217
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,750
You really don't need my help?

218
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,110
No, thanks.

219
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,090
What's wrong?

220
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,620
Nothing.

221
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,350
Everyone in the hospital knows you now.

222
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,930
If they see you in such a mess,

223
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,810
you'll become even more popular.

224
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,930
How about I help you out?

225
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,230
Where did you get the water?

226
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,480
I saved it in advance.

227
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,750
Don't you know there's a water and power outage at 10 p.m. tonight?

228
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,020
If I knew,

229
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,700
would I be like this now?

230
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,910
Let me add some warm water for you.

231
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,110
Or you'll catch a cold when you wash your hair.

232
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:48,980
Thank you.

233
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:50,990
Done.

234
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,790
Test the water temperature.

235
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,380
Is it okay?

236
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,370
It's okay.

237
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,180
Here.

238
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,090
This is the shower head?

239
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,950
You're the pole?

240
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,740
I think

241
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,710
you are really suitable to be a pole.

242
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,950
Wash it yourself.

243
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,580
No, no.

244
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,450
I'm sorry.

245
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,750
I was just kidding.

246
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,330
Hurry up.

247
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,520
Come, sit down.

248
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,860
Here.

249
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:26,910
Done.

250
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,180
Okay?

251
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,210
Dr. Xing.

252
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,550
A girl needs a lot of water to wash their hair.

253
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,030
Is this enough?

254
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,090
Hurry up. My arms are getting sore.

255
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,720
When you asked me to help you give a medical demonstration today,

256
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,120
why didn't you think my legs would get sore?

257
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:51,210
Do you have to take revenge on me now?

258
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,150
Fine then.

259
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:54,680
I'm sorry.

260
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,120
I was wrong. Hurry up.

261
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,990
You have a bad temper.

262
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,190
Then hurry up.

263
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,020
That's all the hot water we have.

264
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,270
I got it.

265
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,260
I suspect you did it on purpose.

266
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,700
It's almost all gone.

267
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,510
I got it. I'll be done soon.

268
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,810
Done!

269
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,510
I'm done.

270
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:14,560
Just right, it's all used up.

271
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,200
That's all.

272
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,820
Mr. Xing. Thank you.

273
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,070
Seafood instant noodles.

274
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,150
You want some?

275
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,560
Wait.

276
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,280
You don't have hot water anymore.

277
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,740
It's the water left over from your hair wash.

278
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,410
Put on that coat first.

279
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,280
Or you'll catch a cold.

280
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,460
It'll be done soon.

281
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,710
You're asking me to wear your coat?

282
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,590
Are you interested in me?

283
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,110
Dream on.

284
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,660
Boyfriend style.

285
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,930
It's just a coat.

286
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,950
It's not a loss for you to get a boyfriend from that.

287
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,020
Yeah, right.

288
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,500
I didn't expect you to like seafood instant noodles too.

289
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,810
Every time I go on a business trip,

290
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,020
I'd get Coffee to buy me a big box of it.

291
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,920
Actually,

292
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,730
I wanted to apologize to you.

293
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,170
I asked you to do the demonstration,

294
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,380
and now everyone knows you.

295
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,710
You can't go about with your life anymore.

296
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,860
It's okay.

297
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,270
I'm used to it.

298
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,450
Besides,

299
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,040
I haven't thanked you

300
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,270
for treating me to such delicious food.

301
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,330
You don't have to thank me for this.

302
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,640
I have to.

303
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,850
These noodles are difficult to get here.

304
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,210
You really don't have to.

305
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,750
These noodles are yours to start with.

306
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,420
Coffee gave it to Zhecheng secretly.

307
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,820
He then gave it to me.

308
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,310
That ungrateful lass.

309
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,890
So you're apologizing to me with my own noodles?

310
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,960
You can say that.

311
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,670
In a way or another, right?

312
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,250
Eat it while it's hot.

313
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,450
Aren't you eating?

314
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:08,900
I'm not hungry.

315
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,020
Well, since everyone recognizes you,

316
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,480
what do you plan to do?

317
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,040
I don't know yet.

318
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,590
Yu Zhecheng told me

319
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,640
he wants me to stay in the warehouse for a day.

320
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,570
It won't cause any chaos like that.

321
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,070
Well, I think...

322
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,270
Do you know how many people are in the hospital now?

323
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,440
I hand out lunches every noon.

324
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,940
There are about 100 servings.

325
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,830
That means there are

326
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,110
at most 100 people here.

327
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,180
Right?

328
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,600
The number of patients in the hospital are quite fixed.

329
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,100
There are just about 100 people

330
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,410
who'd come see you.

331
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,120
So why don't you let them just watch?

332
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,610
Even if it's a celebrity, people will get tired of looking after a while,

333
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:56,710
right?

334
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,800
Really?

335
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,680
But I don't get tired of looking at myself.

336
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,280
I keep wanting to see myself.

337
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,760
Okay, right.

338
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,830
You're right.

339
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,770
I mean

340
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,030
you're hiding all day long now.

341
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,500
Instead of making them more curious,

342
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,720
why don't you just let them

343
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,030
look at you?

344
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,610
Let me think about it.

345
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,200
I've provided you with a solution.

346
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,440
We're even now.

347
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,720
What do you mean?

348
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,140
You have to return the noodles to me.

349
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,620
Didn't you eat them all?

350
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,920
You treated me to this.

351
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,580
[Linkang Hospital]

352
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:03,200
-Hello?
-Hello?

353
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,010
Hello?

354
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,600
What kind of stupid signal is this?

355
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,490
My signal is good though?

356
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,560
Hello?

357
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:13,710
Hello?

358
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,450
Can you hear me?

359
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,170
Can you help me find Jin Na?

360
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,030
Or her agent's

361
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:19,860
contact.

362
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:20,640
I need to talk to her.

363
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,810
Jin Na? Don't you have her WeChat?

364
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,440
I blocked her long ago.

365
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,130
Why are you looking for her?

366
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,290
I saved a little girl here.

367
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,810
She's Jin Na's fan.

368
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,030
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

369
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,990
I want Jin Na to record a video

370
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,620
to encourage her.

371
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:36,440
Qin Fei.

372
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,360
I know you are kind.

373
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,000
But can you try changing

374
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,500
this bad habit of being nosy?

375
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,180
Don't you know how much you've suffered from that?

376
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:45,940
Also,

377
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,240
you know her relationship with Jin Na.

378
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,940
What if she sets you up again?

379
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,310

00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,950
I've prepared a

573
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,500
Mid-Autumn Festival Gala for you today.

574
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,060
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for waiting.

575
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:35,100
The Mid-Autumn Gala shall begin now!

576
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,180
First of all,

577
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:41,790
[Mid-Autumn Festival Gala]

578
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,720
let's welcome Ms. Qin Fei.

579
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,360
What is she doing?

580
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,420
Is she

581
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,310
up to something again?

582
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:20,300
â™«I'll compose a song with my thoughts and look at the stars and moonâ™«

583
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:24,680
â™«The moonlight shines in the nightâ™«

584
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,720
â™«My love is deep and serious, I strike a promiseâ™«

585
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,400
â™«We can't part in this lifeâ™«

586
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,270
Your sister's singing skills...

587
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,880
â™«Dreamingâ™«

588
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,480
-It sounds good.
â™«Walking into my heartsâ™«

589
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,240
What do you think

590
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,950
of this singing skills?

591
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,080
She only has emotions...

592
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,300
And no techniques.

593
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,870
How... How can she sing so badly?

594
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:56,870
[Mid-Autumn Festival Gala]

595
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:58,310
â™«From now on, we shall love each other and will no longer be aloneâ™«

596
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:03,650
â™«As time goes by, I'll spend the rest of my life as I wishâ™«

597
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:08,440
â™«Reading the romantic words in the books, it doesn't resonate with meâ™«

598
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:13,780
â™«In the slow time, let's hold hands and write an oathâ™«

599
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:19,140
â™«Don't ask for the way back; I just want to be with you for the rest of my lifeâ™«

600
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:23,420
â™«Let's make a promise for the rest of our livesâ™«

601
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:26,310
Your sister's crying made the sky cry.

602
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,650
Do you have an umbrella? My  sister's makeup will run.

603
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:30,400
I'll go get the umbrella.

604
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,370
Hurry up.

605
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:33,730
But I want to watch Qin Fei sing.

606
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,740
Thereâ€™s a pavilion over there.

607
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,590
Let's go to the pavilion then.

608
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,240
Let's go.

609
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,460
Fei.

610
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,260
Stop singing and come down.

611
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,750
It's raining!

612
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,370
It's okay, it's okay.

613
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:48,120
â™«I'll compose a song with my thoughts and look at the stars and moonâ™«

614
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,350
â™«The moonlight shines in the nightâ™«

615
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:19,540
â™«Once more, I meet youâ™«

616
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:27,460
â™«No doubt I've decided to love youâ™«

617
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:32,910
â™«Your eyes light up the pastâ™«

618
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,880
Xing did quite well this time.

619
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,470
â™«Light up the heartâ™«

620
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,700
â™«So I'm not aloneâ™«

621
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,110
It's raining! It's raining!

622
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:43,990
â™«When I dream of all the seasonsâ™«

623
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,640
â™«I wanna be with youâ™«

624
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,590
â™«Till the sunlight so deeply falls in lineâ™«

625
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,690
â™«When you're down, while waiting or smilingâ™«

626
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,270
â™«I'll be with youâ™«

627
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,690
â™«It's time to goâ™«

628
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:09,020
â™«The stars shining for youâ™«

629
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:12,720
â™«I need to be with youâ™«

630
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,420
â™«No matter whatâ™«

631
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,060
â™«Answer my callâ™«

632
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,130
â™«Dreaming, lonely, feelingâ™«

633
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,680
â™«Let me be with youâ™«

634
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:30,520
â™«It's time to goâ™«

635
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:35,900
â™«The stars shining for youâ™«

636
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:39,960
â™«I need to be with youâ™«

637
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,380
â™«No matter whatâ™«

638
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,240
â™«Answer my callâ™«

639
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,920
â™«Dreaming, lonely, feelingâ™«

640
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:53,290
â™«Let me be with youâ™«

641
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,950
â™«Because I cannotâ™«

642
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:04,170
â™«Without you in my heartâ™«

643
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,040
This was only one-tenth of my setlist.

644
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,990
That was not enough.

645
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,170
Sister, you sang so well.

646
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:23,900
Here, have some water to moisturize your throat.

647
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,920
Sister.

648
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,310
Let's sing less

649
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:30,280
in public.

650
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,550
Luckily there's no Internet.

651
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,680
Otherwise...

652
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,530
Otherwise what?

653
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,830
What do you mean?

654
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,010
Didn't you see

655
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,910
how happy everyone was to interact with me?

656
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,410
Even that piece of wood, Xing Zhizhi

657
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:42,850
interacted with me.

658
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,920
Guess what

659
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,920
they're talking about now?

660
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,950
They must be thinking

661
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,630
Qin Fei is such a good singer.

662
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,020
Why is she an actor?

663
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,900
Why didnâ€™t she become a singer?

664
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:03,140
Send me the video of me singing.

665
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:04,670
What video?

666
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:05,850
The video of me singing.

667
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,370
Didn't you just record it?

668
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,610
No, no, no.

669
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,140
Coffee.

670
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:30,870
My eye makeup ran when I was singing.

671
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,790
Didn't you tell me

672
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:36,470
my eye makeup was fine on the stage?

673
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,930
Don't worry.

674
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,870
Your singing was so terrible.

675
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:43,070
No one would care about your eye makeup.

676
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,160
My stomach hurts.

677
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,110
I need to use the toilet.

678
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,730
I'm going to deduct all your salary this month.

679
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,830
My eye makeup ran so badly?

680
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:07,780
This is so embarrassing.

681
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:11,410
How can I raise my head in the hospital?

682
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,720
Don't worry.

683
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,110
They were far away.

684
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,640
They couldn't see clearly.

685
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,350
You, come here.

686
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,250
You were close to me on the stage just now.

687
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:30,400
Why didn't you remind me?

688
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:35,220
You just want me to make a fool of myself, right?

689
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,720
I'm telling you, that's impossible.

690
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,940
We artists

691
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:42,660
just complete our work.

692
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,070
We don't care

693
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,670
about anything else.

694
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,330
I can still sing now.

695
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:53,670
Iâ€“

696
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,330
They are all asleep.

697
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:56,740
Don't disturb them.

698
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,480
You're right.

699
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,270
If they want to hear it again,

700
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,820
they have to pay.

701
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,630
What's wrong?

702
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,680
You don't have a fever.

703
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,030
But why...

704
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:34,620
are you blushing?

705
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,200
Because I performed too hard just now.

706
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,510
You saw it, didn't you?

707
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,480
I really don't know where you found

708
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,330
a volunteer as responsible as I am.

709
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:50,040
It's just a minor injury.

710
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,810
I am able to balance both entertainment and health.

711
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,360
It was so tiring.

712
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,840
What a pity... I didn't get to see

713
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,300
any of Linkang's views.

714
00:35:58,330 --> 00:35:59,590
Let me show you around.

715
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:00,940
Can you?

716
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:02,280
But I heard

717
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,880
a batch of new medicine hasn't been sorted yet.

718
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,920
You're pretty impressive.

719
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,580
To think of holding a Mid-Autumn Festival Gala.

720
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:16,060
Is this your way of going against the current?

721
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,590
You gave me this idea.

722
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,030
It worked well.

723
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,960
They won't fawn over your anymore.

724
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,700
Rest early.

725
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,050
Dr. Xing.

726
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,970
Were you

727
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,770
thinking about me problem all night?

728
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:41,020
You're blushing.

729
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,500
But you don't have a fever either.

730
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,720
I worked too hard

731
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,080
to complement your performance, just like you.

732
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,330
As you can see.

733
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,670
It must be that.

734
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,840
Dr. Yu.

735
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:27,490
Iâ€™m here to bring you tea.

736
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,650
[Chinese Tea]

737
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,820
Ms. Coffee.

738
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,370
You always come to me

739
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,320
when you have something to ask for.

740
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,560
Go ahead.

741
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,740
What is it this time?

742
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:42,300
It's nothing.

743
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,410
I just want to

744
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,730
communicate with you.

745
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,730
Speak your mind.

746
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,030
I'll go ahead then.

747
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,300
Your best friend,

748
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:54,120
Dr. Xing,

749
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,540
he keeps doing that.

750
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:56,630
Doing what?

751
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,490
Getting very close with girls.

752
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,060
Boiling water to help girls wash their hair,

753
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:00,590
holding up an umbrella for them,

754
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,980
and laugh with them what not.

755
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,190
Don't talk nonsense.

756
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,800
My best friend is a decent man.

757
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,790
I've never seen him truly care about anyone.

758
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:09,050
My sister neither!

759
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,790
She always does whatever she wants.

760
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,450
She never holds herself back.

761
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:14,650
Hold herself back?

762
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,550
What's going on?

763
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,630
Tell me!

764
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,510
Come on, spill it.

765
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,830
I'll stop at that.

766
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:21,870
Tell me,

767
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,470
does Xing Zhizhi have a girlfriend now or not?

768
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,810
How many girls has he dated?

769
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:26,630
Does he have a dark history?

770
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,760
Is he a jerk?

771
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,040
I can't let my sister be cheated by a scum.

772
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,420
He would be the one cheated if anything.

773
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:34,430
He has never been in a relationship.

774
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,370
How is that possible?

775
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:37,750
He...

776
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,610
He's so handsome and popular.

777
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:42,230
How could he have never been in a relationship?

778
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,030
What are you thinking?

779
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:47,510
But...

780
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,590
I do know one thing about Xing Zhizhi.

781
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,730
Although he doesn't have a girlfriend,

782
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:52,560
there is

783
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,270
a female star very much.

784
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,130
Qin Fei?

785
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,270
There are so many female stars.

786
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:57,270
Itâ€™s not Qin Fei.

787
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,610
Who is it then?

788
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,130
I'm not telling you.

789
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,460
I don't want to know anyway.

790
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,500
Are you done communicating?

791
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,500
Bye bye.

792
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,970
Bye bye.

793
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:41,550
I didn't expect there to be

794
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,410
somewhere this pretty on the way.

795
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:51,590
Why doesn't the flower smell at all?

796
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:00,960
Tell me.

797
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,750
Why did you bring me along

798
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:06,050
as an assistant to a neighboring county's medical conference?

799
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,650
You're the only one in the hospital who's free.

800
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,400
Really?

801
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,310
Not to take me out for a breather?

802
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,320
Really.

803
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,370
Are you okay?

804
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:20,430
How is it?

805
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:25,860
Are you okay?

806
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,120
No.

807
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,060
It's rare that I got the chance to be close to naure.

808
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,770
But I

809
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:34,840
sprained my ankle.

810
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:41,960
Dr. Xing.

811
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,230
Thank you.

812
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,980
I didn't expect doctors

813
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,610
to be so strong.

814
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:48,550
But I mean,

815
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,060
I guess I'm light.

816
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,630
Wait, let's take a photo.

817
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,540
You're walking so shakily.

818
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,500
Look, my photo is blurry.

819
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:05,300
I...

820
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:42,400
â™«Once more, I meet youâ™«

821
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:50,320
â™«No doubt I've decided to love youâ™«

822
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,220
Done.

823
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,460
Try standing.

824
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:55,970
â™«Your eyes light up the pastâ™«

825
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:58,250
How is it?

826
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,570
â™«Light up the heartâ™«

827
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:03,070
â™«So I'm not aloneâ™«

828
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:01,620
It's fine!

829
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,780
Why didn't you fix it for me from the beginning?

830
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,220
â™«When I fall orâ™«

831
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:10,190
We haven't been there yet.

832
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,800
Xixi, time to eat.

833
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:44,830
Did you hide your phone?

834
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,190
Why did you hide your phone

835
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:48,080
when you saw me?

836
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,110
Are you looking at something you shouldn't be?

837
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:50,820
It's nothing.

838
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,760
Just some funny videos.

839
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:54,500
Show me the funny videos.

840
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:56,550
You asked for it.

841
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:05,150
Isn't this the video of me singing yesterday?

842
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,790
What's so funny?

843
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:08,080
My goodness.

844
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:09,780
The song you sang yesterday

845
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:11,910
should be about the tough everlasting love between two people.

846
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:12,970
But with how off tune you were,

847
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:15,600
their love fell into a ditch.

848
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:17,710
It's so inappropriate.

849
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:20,130
You're exaggerating.

850
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,770
Seriously?

851
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:23,590
This is the first time

852
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:24,510
seeing a tone deaf

853
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:26,440
in my life.

854
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,710
You sound so worried.

855
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:30,360
I remember you were

856
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,070
listening to me very seriously.

857
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:33,550
You even turned on your phone's flash light

858
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:34,440
and waved it to

859
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,480
my music.

860
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,410
I didn't.

861
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:39,230
You didn't?

862
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,960
You couldn't hold back your smile.

863
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,320
-I didnâ€™t.
-How so?

864
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:42,840
Qin Fei!

865
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,710
I didnâ€™t!

866
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:45,280
You're really here.

867
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,550
There's a call from the county

868
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:48,030
saying you have a package.

869
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:49,220
My package?

870
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:50,650
I'll go get it right away.

871
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,010
I'm leaving. Stop playing your phone.
