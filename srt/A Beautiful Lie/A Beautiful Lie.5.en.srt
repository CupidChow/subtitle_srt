â™«Into my dream, my loveâ™«

191
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,000
Then,

192
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,910
I'll make a wish and give it a try.

193
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,230
â™«Stay with me, my loveâ™«

194

197
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,320
It's okay.

198
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,820
Wait for me a moment.

199
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,830
I have a power bank.

200
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,720
It's good I have a power bank.

201
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,960
It'll be ready soon.

202
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:07,510
It's okay.

203
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,550
I've got another power bank in my dorm.

204
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,150
Let me go grab it.

205
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:09,810
Don't bother.

206
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,050
I'll be right back.

207
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,720
Xing Zhizhi!

208
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,050
It doesn't matter if I can't see the stars.

209
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,950
Qin Fei.

210
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:24,730
I know

211
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,170
you really have a very bad day.

212
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,120
But it's okay.

213
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,630
There's always a way out of difficulties, right?

214
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,290
Let's figure it out together.

215
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,110
You know.

216
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,260
Actually, for a moment today,

217
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,510
I almost believed it.

218
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,450
I thought my luck wasn't so bad after all.

219
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,270
I thought maybe the wish I wanted to come true

220
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,950
could actually happen.

221
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,650
However...

222
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,840
it seems that my wishes and reality...

223
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,050
are still going in opposite directions.

224
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:09,660
No,

225
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,210
it's not been settled yet.

226
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,560
And the reality isn't as bad as you think.

227
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,490
Trust me,

228
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,630
things won't always take

229
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,360
the worst possible turn.

230
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:17,970
Won't they?

231
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,200
They really won't.

232
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,880
I recommended a lawyer to a friend of mine,

233
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,250
but I got a ton of false accusations in return.

234
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,890
I volunteered here,

235
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,830
but I encountered a landslide.

236
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,590
I went to pick up a package but nearly got blown up.

237
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,350
I saved someone,

238
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,030
but now I don't know if I've

239
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,510
contracted HIV.

240
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,150
I just want to see the stars before leaving,

241
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,110
but there aren't any.

242
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,310
I'm going to get the power bank now.

243
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,740
You'll definitely see the stars today!

244
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,460
Don't do anything anymore!

245
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,610
Xing Zhizhi,

246
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,330
I see everything you've done for me.

247
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,990
But please, stop doing anything for me.

248
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,830
Because I...

249
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,920
am just an extremely unlucky person.

250
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,480
You might think

251
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,660
that I don't care about anything,

252
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,140
but the truth is, I'm terrified.

253
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,360
â™«The silence of night, the breath of rainâ™«

254
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,920
Because I know

255
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,130
things will always turn out badly for me.

256
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:31,130
â™«They became pleasant because of youâ™«

257
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,270
So really, you don't have to tell me

258
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,080
that everything's okay.

259
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:39,090
â™«I never told you how much I missed youâ™«

260

I'm here with you.

00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,340
No matter what happens,

265
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,570
I'll always be here for you.

I've got a signal!

279
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,740
I got my test results back!

280
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,910
The report says it's negative.

281
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:46,890
We're both fine.

282
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,450
Wait, wait; don't hug her just yet; hold on.

283
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,750
Hold on; don't rush to hug. Wait a moment.

284

What are you talking about?

285
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:53,600
I was dying for this report.

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,920
The test results are good.

287
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,510
No, what are you talking about?

288
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,440
It's negative.

What do you mean?

290
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,550
It's negative.

291
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,010
He just said his test result is negative.

292
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,530
Xing Zhizhi, I'm okay now.

00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,260

You know what?

You're my lucky charm.

00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,660
you were my little sidekick, right?

that the father got into a car accident

You actually took it seriously?

So, you've been obsessed with me ever since?

00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,710
You're leaving, Coffee?

745
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:20,150
Let me do it, Fei.

746
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,310
Fei, let me do it; let me.

747
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:23,310
There's really no farewell ceremony, huh?

748
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:24,100
I...

749
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:26,630
I even prepared a farewell speech.

750
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,360
-It's okay.
-Qin Fei.

751
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,220
Coffee.

752
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:33,000
You're leaving now?

753
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,120
Make sure to be safe on your journey.

754
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,110
I need to get back to work.

755
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:37,730
Bye-bye.

756
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,420
Bye-bye.

759
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,870
Everyone's just too busy.

760
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,190
Let me do it.

761
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:50,140
Come on.

764
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,830
That Yu Zhecheng didn't even come to send me off.

765
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:09,100
Why are you so late?

766
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,240
Even though I don't need a special farewell,

767
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,280
after all...

768
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,550
After all,

769
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:18,810
you and I have a different relationship.

Xing Zhizhi and I

771
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,150
are just classmates from over a decade ago.

772
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,150
We barely keep in touch as it is. Why even bother saying goodbye?

773
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:26,210
What kind of relationship do we have?

774
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,540
A fan and a celebrity.

775
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,800
Ms. Qin, I think you've misunderstood.

776
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,090
I just came to let you know

777
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,000
that Li Meilan and the others

778
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,850
originally wanted to give you a farewell surprise,

779
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:43,110
but they were too busy.

780
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:45,250
They believe that only one-time encounters

781
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,990
deserve grand gestures,

782
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:48,640
but since your relationship will continue,

783
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,440
they've decided not to give you a formal send-off.

784
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,150
Dr. Xing,

785
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:57,540
then, between you and me,

786
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,380
is this a one-time encounter

787

Make sure she does regular rehabilitation exercises.

00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,760
