00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,460
Stop eating.

4
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,100
The teachers have already said

5
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,960
that eating while walking on campus is not allowed.

6
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,900
It's fine. School's already out.

7
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,760
The teachers won't care about it.

8
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,180
What are the chances of being that unlucky?

9
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,760
Hurry up!

10
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,900
Slow down!

Who is this?

12
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,590
It's not even raining.

13
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,250
Why are you using an umbrella?

14
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,770
Hello, Madam.

15
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,840
Oh, it's Zhizhi.

16
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,930
Go home quickly.

17

Keep coming in first place

18
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,240

[Challenge the Rescue Operation Together]

22
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:04,630
Mr. Chen,

23
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,870
Xiaoxiao is already recording.

24
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,070
Recording what?

25
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,670
Didn't I tell you to bring her out here?

26
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,280
Where is she?

27
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,310
I called her,

28
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,140
but Xiaoxiao wouldn't come out.

29
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,140
Besides, the contract has already been signed.

30
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,380
If we breach it now,

31
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,060
wouldn't it be bad for Xiaoxiao's image?

32
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,530
Now you're worried about her image?

33
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:19,630
Why didn't you think of that

34
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,290
before signing the contract?

35
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,400
Well,

36
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:22,910
Mr. Chen,

37
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,280
didn't you say this yourself before?

38
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,900
You said that whatever Xiaoxiao says

39
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,050
carries the same weight as if you had said it.

40
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,280
So, we'd do

41
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,110
whatever Xiaoxiao said, right?

42
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,480
Fine.

43
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,430
According to what you're saying,

44
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,280
it's my fault then.

45
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,610
I should be the one to apologize to you.

46
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,820
From now on, when Xiaoxiao signs contracts,

47
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,590
please make sure

48
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,580
to inform me about them,

49
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,330
okay?

50
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,680
Okay?

51
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:42,910
Ok...

52
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:44,750
ay?

53
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,290
Mr. Chen!

54
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,490
For example,

55
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,690
now try to reach out with one hand

56
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:35,780
to grab me.

57
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,390
Slower.

58
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,740
Let me demonstrate.

59
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,780
Now it's your turn.

60
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,060
Get up and try it.

61
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,110
Xiaoxiao.

62
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,310
-You didn't hear me, huh?
-It tickles.

63
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,270
You didn't hear me, right?

64
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,310
You're annoying.

65
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,800
Come on, get up and practice.

66
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,160
No.

67
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,410
I'm already so tired from filming.

68
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,470
I don't want to practice.

69
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,070
Why do I have to practice this?

70
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,830
Be good.

71
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,580
The main thing is, I can't always be by your side.

72
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,970
For example, you have to go out to film.

73
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,230
Knowing some self-defense techniques

74
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,160
would help me worry less about you.

75
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,380
But I'll have bodyguards in the future.

76
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,890
Bodyguards can't be with you at all times either, right?

77
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,570
It's more reassuring

78
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,500
to learn the skills yourself, right?

79
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,670
Bodyguards can't, but...

80
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:32,820
you can.

81
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:34,630
How about this?

82
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,290
In the future, I'll make money

83
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,400
and hire you

84
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,820
as my 24-hour personal bodyguard.

85
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:42,340
How's that?

86
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,250
I'll think about it.

87
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,540
But you must finish this move first.

88
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,850
No more talking; I'm sleepy.

89
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,100

91
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,480

108
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,000
This is enough. No, no, no.

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,240
-This one.
-Okay.

110
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,000
Quickly, help me put it on.

111
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,160

Fei is fine.

117
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,600
It's just that she accidentally pulled a muscle

118
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,260
during the body slam just now.

119
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,040
Okay.

120
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,950
I heard that when Director Chen saw this photo,

121
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:02,950
he immediately decided that you'd be the lead actress

122
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,680
in "Flower Sea,"

123
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,070
which was also your first drama.

124
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,270
Many people say that the look in your eyes in this photo

125
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,030
is like gazing at a lover.

126
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,270
Xiaoxiao, could you tell us

127
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,720
the story behind it?

128
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,220
This photo was taken by my first love.

129
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:35,570
Oh, so it's a romantic story after all.

130
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,840
Usually, romantic stories don't end well.

131
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,830
Why don't we change the subject?

132
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,070
I can't believe this.

133
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,880
What kind of people did the production team find?

134
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,080
Miss,

135
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,620
I don't care how you found me.

136
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,830
I advise you to give up this idea as soon as possible.

137
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,360
Don't think that just because you're bordering on pretty,

138
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,710
you can seduce me.

139
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,920
I'm not interested in someone like you.

140
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,640

You're crazy.

Well, if it isn't Mr. Fancy Pants gracing us commoners.

145
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,210
Is your money burning a hole in your pocket,

146
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,400
so you come here looking for a pet project?

147
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,550
If you're crazy, go see a shrink.

148
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,360
Don't start spouting nonsense as soon as you open your mouth.

149
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,850
One of my actresses is here recording a show.

150
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,200
Which actress would be so clueless

151
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,080
to sign with your agency?

00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:46,990
What's wrong?

154
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,000
Don't mess with me.

155
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,390
A big award-winning actress signing with you? Is she insane?

156
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,520
She is quite insane.

157
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,670
If she weren't, would she come here

158
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,870
to record the same show with you?

159
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,670
Hilarious.

160
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,030
Attention, all actors,

161
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,910
we're about to start the next shoot.

162
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,030
Please hurry back to the set!

163
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,910
They're calling you.

164
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,180
Hurry up and go.

165
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,830
If you don't go now, it'll be too late.

166
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:06,920
You can't shut up.

167
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,930
How could you hit me?

168
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,130
I'll hit you to death.

169
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,200
What kind of person is this?

170
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,940
Hey, Mei.

171
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,360
Make sure you take good care of Xiaoxiao

172
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,920
while you're with her.

173
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,320
Afternoon tea for the production team

174
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,360
and any other perks—

175
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,820
handle them as you see fit.

176
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,700
The company will cover all expenses.

177
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,590
This is about our Xiaoxiao's reputation.

178
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,860
So make sure it's done properly,

179
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,770
got it?

180
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:43,260
Also,

181
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,740
no matter how big or small the issue is,

182
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,080
as long as it's related to Xiaoxiao,

183
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,540
you call me immediately.

184
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,620
Do you understand?

185
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:50,770
Xiaoxiao,

186
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,820
we need to do a retake of the promotional video.

187
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,550
Okay.

it will help protect your back.

you can't wear the plaster for too long.

262

I've prepared a topical anti-inflammatory cream for you.

264

The hospital must be quite busy, right?

557
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,280
You should hurry back to work then.

Could you please see Dr. Xing out for me?

Okay.

Have I somehow offended you?

00:29:58,610 --> 00:29:59,500
Is it because last night...

566
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,260
No!

567
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,220
Dr. Xing, you've been so kind to me,

bringing me medicine and even coming to check on me.

569

Dr. Xing,

573

Fei needs to rest now.

574
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,430
Why don't we go out?

575
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,030
Okay.

Dr. Xing,

577
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,120
I'm sorry.

578
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,710
You know Fei's temper.

579
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,000
Don't take it to heart.

between you and her?

583

Well, that's a pretty bold question.

584
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,580
You should go back now

585
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,640
and take care of her.

586
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,350
Make sure she rests.

have Qin Fei's test results come out?

not too serious.

597
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:25,740
Her lower back has sustained some external trauma from the impact,

598
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,540
but it's not serious either,

599
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,860
just some bruising.

601
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:30,880
with her lumbar vertebrae,

Ms. Xiao,

640

this is Qin Fei's CT scan.

641
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,110
This part is the pelvis,

642
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,960
and this part above...

643
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,870
Don't talk to me about this nonsense.

644
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:55,530
Mr. Ren, let me remind you.

645
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,670
We have a contract.

646
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,700
I can arrange for her to do fewer dangerous stunts,

647
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,120
but halting the recording is absolutely out of the question.

648
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,000
Yes, we don't want that either,

649
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:07,100
but we at least need to wait for her to recover,

650
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:07,620
right?

651
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,570
Then tell me how many days you need.

652
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,280
Anyway, whether Qin Fei can return or not,

653
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,880

If she can't come back, we'll terminate the contract.

Ms. Xiao,

681
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,850
my experience is only useful on the premise

682
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,330
that you listen to me.

00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,590

So, I've made you worried too, huh?

702
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,000
Or are you saying

703
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,460
that you don't consider me a part of the team?

704
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,260
No, that's not it.

705
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,590
Alright, alright. Don't be mad.

706
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,880

You know, it's a large team,

709
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:02,320
so it's inevitable that a few people may be a little clueless.

710

You've been in this industry for so many years;

711
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,920
surely you wouldn't let them get to you,

712
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,520
would you?

713
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,590

714
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,360

Regarding Qin Fei,

718
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,120
in the next day or two,

719
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,000
I'll talk to her about terminating the contract and replacing her.

720
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,350
It'll not cause any delays in your filming schedule.

721

722
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,550

I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

730
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,710
I've already said I'm fine.

733
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,360
All it took was a few words from Xing Zhizhi,

734
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,360
and you brought me to the rehabilitation department.

735
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,150
And now I have to stay in bed for an entire month!

740
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:10,010
I can walk just fine.

741
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,720
Yes.

742
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,030
Help me answer the phone.

Hello, big movie star.

751
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,040
Is Producer Xiao

752
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:34,330
telling you to let me know that I'm fired?

753
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,250
You can still joke around.

754
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:37,180
Seems like you're doing okay, huh?

755
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:38,400
Alright.

756
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,080
I've already spoken to Ms. Xiao.

757
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,120
She's willing to pause production for a week until you're back.

758
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,450
There's no rush; take your time to recover.

759
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:45,170
Really?

760
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,730
What did you say to her?

761
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:49,030
I just told her the truth.

762
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,670
It's not easy to find another actress of your caliber

763
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,970
at such short notice.

764
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,630
Moreover,

765
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,360
you were sort of injured during the recording.

766
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,080
If they replace you because of this,

767
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,210
it'll impact the show's

768
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,770
promotion and reputation.

769
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,380
You've really helped me out big time.

770
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,770
But...

771
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,470
because of me

772
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,230
pushing the schedule back by a week,

773
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,830
how's that going to affect your film schedule?

774
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,880
Don't worry about it, Qin Fei.

775
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,150
I'm on vacation now,

776
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:19,080
so nothing will be delayed in a week.

777
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,590
And I've already spoken with

778
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,710
Jin Na and Jin Weiwei.

779
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:24,210
They're both willing to wait for you to come back.

780
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,800
I believe what you say about Jin Na,

781
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,510
but as for Weiwei, forget it.

782
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,900
When it comes down to it,

783
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,500
you're the one who helped me.

784
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,520
I owe you a big favor.

785
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,580
I don't know how I'll ever repay you.

786
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,670
Enough of that.

787
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,070
If it weren't for you today,

788
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,650
I would be the one lying in the hospital right now.

789
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:40,800
Rest well and recover.

790
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,870
I won't bother you anymore.

791
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:42,870
See you in a week.

792
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:44,480
Bye-bye.

793
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,240
Have some water.

00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,210

795
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,970
Do you need anything?

796
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,930
You came all the way here to find me?

797
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:14,580
Just now...

798
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,030
thank you.

799
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:21,150
Would you like some chocolate, Instructor Liu?

800
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:23,040

806
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,280
haven't you been pretending not to know me?

807
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,200
I haven't.

808
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:51,080
Today is the seventh day since I joined the team.

809
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,740
Have you greeted me even once?

810
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,760
I thought...

811
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,640
you didn't want everyone to know.

812
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,050
What if I did?

813
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,500
If I wanted everyone to know,

814
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,420
how would you introduce me?

00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,300
It's better to pretend we don't know each other,

820
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,180
right,

821
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,480

00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,580
