Remember?

10
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,350
It's the online pickled cucumbers store

11
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,510
that used your photo for advertising.

12
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,500
After we warned them at that time,

13
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,720
they not only refused to apologize,

14
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,390
but also pleaded poverty.

15
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,830
It made Mr. Ren furious.

16
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:56,740
So later,

17
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,620
we directly went the legal route.

18
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,240
I do remember something like that.

19
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,870
Only you could be so nonchalant about it.

20
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,840
But all these matters afterwards

21
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,170

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,870
they have to 180,000 yuan for economic losses.

No, wait.

25
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,680
It's 18,000 yuan?

26
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:19,840
This...

27
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,030
Why is it so little?

28
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,520
This is such a rip-off.

Fei, this is your commercial image.

If everyone does this,

00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,710
you'll end up advertising for them for free.

that yesterday was our first

I hope the situation isn't bad.

Well,

00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,490
the rough draft is quite different from what we expected.

00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,850
It's just not good.

86

Anyway, I think

97
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,240
your performance this time

98
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,840
was much better than before.

don't you understand your own

105
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,630
When you said something would do well,

106
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,490
it all flopped.

107
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,750
But when you said it wouldn't work,

108
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,490
it became a huge hit.

109
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,350
Maybe

110
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,270
our drama this time could be a big success.

111
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,430
So you're saying my taste

112
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,870
is the opposite of

00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,870
the entire TV industry?

114
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,600
What I mean is,

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,120
you have some luck on your side.

116
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,000
For example, that time

117

he said Rescue Operation

118
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,070
could turn my reputation around,

119
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,040
but in reality,

120
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,830
after it was edited,

121
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,310
I got blasted.

122
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,040
What does this mean?

123
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,720
It means you're

124
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,310
a guiding light for this industry.

125
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,430
Mr. Ren is so pessimistic about the show this time,

126
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,430
so maybe, Fei,

127
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,390
you could win Best Supporting Actress.

I'll treat the whole company to a trip,

130
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,770
but Mr. Ren will foot the bill.

131
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,000

You've honed your abilities.

So, making a move now

215
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,720
is just perfect timing.

What a coincidence.

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,480
When she was at Linkang County Hospital,

401
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,960
she had already met Captain Liu.

402
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,200
She still remembers you even now.

403
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,240
Don't be so nervous, Captain Liu.

404
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,390
Since you have such a connection,

405
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,670
why don't you add each other on WeChat?

406
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,360

She's a nice girl.

415
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,980
She asked me before if you had a girlfriend.

and I wasn't sure what to give you.

431
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,750
I heard from Dr. Xing

432
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,640
that you're the captain of the Xiaoyun Rescue Team.

433
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,290
You often go on missions and such,

434
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,820
so it's easy to get injured.

Is it inappropriate to give this as a meeting gift?

00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,310
When the time comes,

555
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,310
she'll know I got

556
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:05,410
such a great deal from Xing Zhizhi...

557
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:06,530
[Mic on] [Speaker on] [Camera on]
such a great deal from Xing Zhizhi...

558
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:06,720
[Mic on] [Speaker on] [Camera on]

559
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,610
Yu Zhecheng.
[Mic on] [Speaker on] [Camera on]

560
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:07,910
Yu Zhecheng.

561
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:08,880
Explain it to me clearly.

562
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,750
What do you mean by "don't let me hear about it"?

563
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,880
What deal did you get from Xing Zhizhi?

564
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,070
This isn't my fault.

565
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,930
You were the one yelling about it.

566
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,470
Come clean.

567
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,750
It's nothing.

568
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,150
I'm just working normally at the hospital.

569
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,510
Coffee,

570
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,290
come to the office for overtime work tomorrow morning.

571
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:35,070
Send the clothes that need alterations to the studio.

572
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,300
Also, ask the magazine team

573
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,300
why they're so slow with the images.

574
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,370
Oh, right.

575
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,490
I'm going to the suburbs tonight to watch that

576
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:42,960
jewelry show or whatever it is.

577
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,400
I'll be staying overnight there.

578
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,400
And next week,

579
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,440
I'm going on a business trip to Tibet.

580
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,460
Wait, wait, wait.

581
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,750
I'll tell you.

582
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,270
Well, you see,

583
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,200
there's a very special case at the hospital.

584
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,720
Not many doctors in the country can handle it.

585
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,720
It just so happens that this was Xing Zhizhi's

586
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,790
main research direction before.

587
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,790
He even performed surgery with our professor once.

588
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,640
But our professor's eyesight isn't good anymore,

589
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,400
so they specifically requested

590
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,680
for Xing Zhizhi to do it.

591
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,880
But who would have thought he'd refuse?

592
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,730
But this is a 10-year contract.

593
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,110
Think about it again.

594
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:09,880
Alright, alright.

595
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,410
I can make my own decisions.

596
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,270
What's that smell on you?

597
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:13,710
Go take a shower now.

598
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,200
Go, go, go!

599
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,390
You stink.

600
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,880
Disinfectant.

601
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,340
Hey, Coffee.

602
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,160
Can you prepare

603
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,070
those red high heels for me?

604
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,290
I want to match them with my beige dress.

605
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,510
Of course.

606
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,640
Career is a lifelong pursuit.

607
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,830
It's a dream,

608
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,750
right?

609
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,340
Hello everyone.

610
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,400
Entertainment Star Dialogue,

611
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,630
the inside scoop with celebrities.

612
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:06,920
Today, we have

613
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,480
invited a celebrity guest for everyone.

614
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,680
Who is she?

615
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,110
That's right.

616
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,590
It's our beloved Qin Fei.

617
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,590
Come on, say hello to everyone first.

618
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:15,440
Hello everyone,

619
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,720
I'm Qin Fei.

620
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,030
Welcome, Qin Fei.

621
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,310
W-What's wrong?

622
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,470
What are you doing?

623
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,430
Working.

624
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,110
Can you take a look at this with me?

625
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:36,790
Come.

626
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,240
Well, as far as I know,

627
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,550
in the previous drama,

628
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,480
you played the role of a medical student.

629
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,160
Yes.

630
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,350
Can you share a bit about that with us?

631
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,920
Actually, my ability to play this role well

632
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,650
was thanks to a good friend of mine.

633
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:49,510
He used to be

634
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,240
an excellent surgeon,

635
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,200
but due to certain circumstances,

636
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,400
he can no longer perform surgeries.

637
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,270
However, he has never given up.

638
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,720
He's been working hard

639
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,900
to return to the operating room.

640
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,970
I think

641
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,860
this must be what a dream entails.

642
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,470
The word "dream" seems distant,

643
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:08,420
but

644
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,680
it's always happening around us.

645
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,240
Well said.

646
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,860
I really envy Qin Fei too.

647
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,420
Yu Zhecheng has already told you?

648
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,580
Why did you refuse that surgery?

649
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,790
Why did you

650
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,150
refuse to return to the thoracic department after the hospital asked you to?

651
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,350
I like the rehabilitation department.

652
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,100
You like the rehabilitation department?

653
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,200
Then what are you doing?

654
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,130
Why are you making surgical plans?

655
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,110
I don't...

656
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:39,960
Don't tell me

657
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,110
you don't want to return to the operating table.

658
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:41,880
Don't tell me

659
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,630
you don't want to go back to thoracic surgery.

660
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,790
I know you want to.

661
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,650
You want it more than anyone else.

662
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,590
You prepared so much.

663
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,160
Now that you finally have a chance,

664
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,240
why can't you take a step bravely?

665
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,610
Xing Zhizhi,

666
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,290
everyone has desires.

667
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,190
Look at me.

668
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:00,610
I like beautiful handbags,

669
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:01,900
jewelry, and shoes.

670
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,480
So, I have to work hard

671
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,280
to fulfill my desire to buy them.

672
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:07,880
Don't you have any desires?

673
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,550
Don't you want a promotion and a raise?

674
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,070
Don't you want to become a professor?

675
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,530
Don't you want to become an industry expert?

676
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,550
You must take this brave step forward.

677
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,960
Learn from me.

678
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,880
Forge ahead for your dreams.

679
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,150
Your dreams are

680
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,460
shoes, bags, jewelry, and gems?

681
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,680
Xiaofei.

682
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,960
If it were you,

683
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,310
what would you choose?

684
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,760
What would you do?

685
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,680
If I had a chance,

686
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,830
I'd definitely move forward bravely.

687
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,200
Can you let go

688
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,680
what you have now?

689
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,000
There's nothing to be afraid of.

690
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,820
Then let go of me first.

691
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,560
You continue to forge ahead,

692
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,510
and I

693
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,960
will continue to prepare

694
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,740
the surgical plan for Yu Zhecheng.

695
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,680
Xing Zhizhi,

696
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,830
did you understand what I was saying

697
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,160
or not?

698
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,310
I told Xing Zhizhi

699
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,480
that one must have desires,

700
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,110
and absolutely cannot lie flat and give up.

701
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,960
One should be like me,

702
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,270
facing life's ideals

703
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,570
and forging ahead bravely,

704
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:11,980
taking that courageous step forward.

705
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,320
Don't you agree?

706
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,640
Yes.

707
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:17,790
You know what?

708
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,550
Usually, Xing Zhizhi is the one lecturing me,

709
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,510
but yesterday, I gave him a good lesson.

710
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,000
I told him

711
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,160
that one can lie flat for a while,

712
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,300
but one absolutely cannot lie flat for a lifetime.

713
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,180
That's right.

714
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,590
People absolutely cannot lie flat.

715
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,100
So, Qin Fei,

716
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,530
have you looked at the contract renewal?

717
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,310
It's okay, here's the thing.

718
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,310
If you think there's any problem,

719
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,110
just change it as you see fit.

720
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:37,920
Don't worry about the legal department,

721
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,030
or anyone else.

722
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,720
We're on the same side.

723
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,720
Take a look at the contract as soon as possible.

724
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,920
Let's sign it. Time is tight.

725
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,000
Okay?

726
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,370
I feel like you're on the same side as the legal department.

727
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:50,400
No, just sign first.

728
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,640
Mr. Ren.

729
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:54,440
Mr. Ren,

730
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,240
this is for you.

731
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,430
Don't run.

732
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,550
My heart is racing.

733
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,200
Next time, can you wear

734
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,680
a pair of less noisy high heels?

735
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,480
Alright.

736
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,440
What's this you're showing me now?

737
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,830
No, not this.

738
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,160
Here.

739
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:07,280
Why is it a copyright infringement again?

Why is it a copyright infringement again?

741
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:08,860
Why is it a copyright infringement again?

742
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,510
Fei is

743
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,270
really getting more and more popular now.

744
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,310
Have they contacted our company?

745
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,710
Have they contacted you?

746
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:14,570
No.

747
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,640
Go to the legal department

748
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,170
and see how to resolve this.

749
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,240
Alright.

750
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,150
Don't run.

751
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,950
See, you're popular now.

752
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,830
Another one.

753
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,000
Take a look at the contract quickly.

754
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,530
Sign it as soon as possible.

Hello.

774
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,590
Excuse me, are you the current director of Zhongkun?

775
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,400
Yes.

776

Are you Qin Fei?

Yes, that's me.

How did Zhongkun end up like this?

789
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,830
Where's Director Wang?

790
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,830
What about Liu Mengna and Xu Yilin,

791
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,200
the lead dancers?

792
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,240
Why aren't they in the brochures anymore?

793
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,300
Director Wang retired two years ago.

794
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,310
The market hasn't been good these past few years.

795
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:29,310
There are fewer and fewer performance opportunities.

796
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,570
The performers in the troupe have left one by one.

797
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:34,370
Now, we're left with just a group of young dancers.

798
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,440
I don't have Director Wang's talent.

799
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,960
I can't choreograph good dances,

800
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,590
and we can't get

801
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:41,310
performance projects from the city or province anymore.

802
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,160
Now,

803
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,110
things are different.

804
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,830
We have to be financially self-sufficient.

805
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:47,500
The dance troupe is barely hanging on now.

806
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,880
This might be our

807
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,120
last performance.

I'm really sorry,

816
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,250
but I have a management contract.

817
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,510
It's not something I can decide on my own.

You've completely given up on dancing long ago

You've completely given up on dancing long ago

and forgotten your former self.

825
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,240
But how can you be so heartless?

826
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,920
Before Director Wang left,

827
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,550
she said her biggest regret

828
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,720
was that in France back then,

829
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,180
she couldn't protect you.

830
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,520
I have to go now.

831
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:29,590

I have to go now.

[Haibin Zhongkun Modern Dance Troupe]

833
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:53,420
Fei.

834
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:56,020
This is the brand's latest design this year.

835
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,640
They said it's tailored to match your aura.

836
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,870
The designer

837
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,490
specifically created it for you.

838
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,440
Take a look.

839
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,180
Beautiful.

840
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,520
Oh, by the way, Fei.

841
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:13,880
Mr. Ren has been urgently pushing these past few days,

842
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,270
asking you to sign the contract as soon as possible.

843
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,610
Please remember to give it to me after you sign,

844
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:18,130
so I can report back to him.

845
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,350
Before Director Wang left,

846
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:24,000
she said her biggest regret

847
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,110
was that she couldn't protect you

848
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,550
back then in France.

849
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,130
What's wrong, Fei?

850
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,590
Is there an issue with the contract?

851
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,510
Mr. Ren shouldn't

852
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:41,200
set any traps in the contract, right?

853
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:43,960
But business is business.

854
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,200
If you have any concerns,

855
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,640
why don't we hire a lawyer?

856
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,640
After all, it's a 10-year contract.

857
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,820
Coffee,

858
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,310
if you're no longer an executive agent one day,

859
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,510
what do you plan to do?

860
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,070
Well, of course,

861
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:57,440
I'll continue to get promoted and become a manager,

862
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,880
then the director of management,

863
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,630
and finally become the boss.

864
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,440
Once I become the boss of a talent agency,

865
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,200
I must

866
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,440
invest in a group of handsome guys to form a boy band.

867
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,720
Alright, let's go.

868
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,240
Fei, your bag.

869
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,480
In this new drama,

870
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,350
the medical student you played

871
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,920
is quite different from your previous roles.

872
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,960
Are you intentionally trying to change your acting path?

873
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,310
Actually, actors nowadays

874
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,750
can't completely decide

875
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,490
the roles they can play.

876
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,680
As for me,

877
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,070
I'm still at the stage where I'm being selected.

878
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,030
And for me,

879
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,830
I don't have much talent for acting.

880
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,030
I guess I'm a slow learner,

881
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,350
so I need to start early.

882
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,440
I have to do a lot of homework,

883
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,400
like watching

884
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,750
doctors' living habits

885
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,000
and also a lot of

886
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,400
these kinds of documentaries.

887
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,790
Is this a kind of passion for acting?

888
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,440
I don't think it's passion.

889
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,200
It's actually quite painful.

890
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,390
When it comes to acting, I can definitely

891
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:50,200
see my limitations.

892
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,270
Painful?

893
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,110
Then why do you choose to act?

894
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,950
I think

895
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,280
it's for money, for a living.

896
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,460
Ms. Qin Fei, you're really humorous.

897
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,540
I think everyone here is the same.

898
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,890
Who isn't working for a living?

899
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,110
When I first started acting,

900
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,660
it was actually quite difficult at that time.

901
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,760
I didn't understand what acting was.

902
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,880
But as I slowly started acting,

903
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,900
I discovered

904
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,230
whether it's the lead role

905
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,660
or a supporting role,

906
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,070
they all have their own lives,

907
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,390
their own stories.

908
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,900
As I gradually immersed myself in the roles,

909
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,760
I found that

910
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,320
you fall in love with these characters.

911
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,760
From that moment on,

912
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,070
I was no longer just

913
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,760
acting for a living.

914
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,070
Then what is it for?

915
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,470
[Dream]

916
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,470
For my dream.

917
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:53,650
[Dream]
For my dream.

918
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:54,480
[Dream]

919
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:54,810
If you had to choose between
[Dream]

920
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:55,670

Yes, I didn't expect that.

947
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,070
It seems you have

948
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:47,330
gained some real insight and understanding about acting.

949
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:49,800
Okay, so here's what we'll do.

950
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,590
Coffee, let's figure out a way

951

954
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:57,990
You can take a few years of classes.

What would you do?

959

If I had a chance,

960
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,560
I'd definitely move forward bravely.

961
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,800
Can you let go

962
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,530

963
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,760

What is this?

969
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,630
It's for calming nerves and aiding sleep.

970
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,560
I found this recipe online for you.

971
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,710
It contains

972
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:56,710
lily bulbs, red dates, sour jujube seeds, and porias.

How's the preparation for the surgical plan going?

Yu Zhecheng and I are still working on it.

976
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,350
Next, I'll lead him to simulate

977

potential issues that might arise during the surgery.

00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,360
What I told you the other day

was all for nothing, wasn't it?

I remember.

981
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:17,920
I have to have desire,

00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:19,010
and forge ahead bravely.

983

984

Xiaofei,

985
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,590
as humans,

986
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:26,150
we need to accept failure,

987
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,800
accept being ordinary,

988
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,280
accept reality,

989
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,840
and even accept becoming

990
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,670
the person we dislike the most.

991
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,840
I really don't understand.

992
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,130
Why?

993
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:37,510
There are still plenty of things

you don't understand.

Let me ask you this.

If you were given a chance

998

to dance again,

999
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,120
could you give up acting without hesitation,

1000
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,230
and give up the 10-year contract

1001
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,800
that Ren Siqi offered you?

1002
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:55,070
There's so much honor here,

1003
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,390
so much glamour,

1004
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:58,380
so many branded jewelry, bags,

1005
00:37:58,410 --> 00:37:59,640
gems, and clothes.

1006
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:03,080
You can support so many Xingyi Entertainment companies,

1007
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,010
giving jobs to people like Coffee.

1008
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,020
Can you just give it all up so easily?

1009
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,530
Okay,

1010
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,020
even if you have the courage to give up everything,

1011
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,220
are you really willing to be

1012
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,220
an ordinary person,

1013
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,760
work nine to five every day,

1014
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,700
and squeeze into the subway during rush hours?

1015
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,130
Can you really do all that?

1016
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,900
I've been away for so long.

1017
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,560
Can I go back?

1018
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,240
With dreams,

1019
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,490
it's very likely

1020
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,720
that they're the most beautiful before

1021
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:42,800
they come true.

1022
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,360
I specially picked that lipstick for you.

1023
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,800
Chen Shen insisted it was too plain.

1024
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,230
He wanted to pick a black one for you.

1025
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:06,480
Don't you think he had ulterior motives?

1026
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,710
How are you two doing?

1027
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,070
Pretty good.

1028

1030
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,930
and we also tried paragliding.

1032

really try that one with Xing Zhizhi.

1034
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,150
Didn't you tell me to be happy?

1035
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,790
How about you?

1036
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:43,350
I heard you're renewing your contract.

1037
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,710
It's pretty much a done deal.

1038
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,300
But come to think of it.

1039
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,470
The contract period is really long.

1040
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,580
It's a full 10-year commitment.

1041

He's good at talking,

1047
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,590
but the content...

1048

00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:32,230
I need to talk to Ren Siqi.

1104
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,440
Alright then.

1105
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:40,480
Sir, let's head back to Xingyi first.

1106
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:56,710
What's wrong?

1107
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:58,570
Why did you suddenly come back to see me?

1108
00:42:58,570 --> 00:42:59,120
What's the matter?

1109
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,450
I made a decision.

1110
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:01,930
I must tell you right away.

1111
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,300
What decision?

1112
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:06,330
I won't renew the contract.
