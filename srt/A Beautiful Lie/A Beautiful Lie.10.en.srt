00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,080
Hello, Fei.

3
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:37,240
How's your training going lately?

7
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,420
It's been pretty exhausting lately.

8
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,580
The physical demands are really high.

9
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,590
But compared to real rescue workers,

10
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,840
what we're doing is nothing.

11
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,230
They really work so hard.

12
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,440
It's really tough for them.

13
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,840
I hope that through our show,

14
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,310
people can see just how hard their jobs are.

15
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,680
And maybe they'll also

16
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,200
learn some basic first-aid skills.

17
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,150
It's really meaningful.

18
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,520
Fei,

19
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,840
do you ever have any arguments

20
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,200
with Weiwei in daily life?

21
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,200
How's your relationship?

22
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,630
We get along really well.

23
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,190
We're really coming along.

24
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,230
Babe,

25
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,240
what are you doing?

26
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,630
We're filming some behind-the-scenes stuff.

27
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,690
Don't mess around.

28
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,310
Am I disturbing you guys?

29
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,610
Hello, everyone. I'm Weiwei.

30
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,740
You two seem super close.

31
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:18,810
With

32
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,430
more competitive challenges coming up,

33
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,470
are you worried

34
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,950
it might affect your friendship?

35
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,540
Of course not.

36
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,810
We can keep our relationship and the competition separate.

37
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,700
Weiwei,

38
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,480
if you lose,

39
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,980
don't get mad.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,380
I wouldn't.

41
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,720
You better not either.

42
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,580
Come on, give me a kiss.

43
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,900
Come on.

44
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,750
Okay, cut!

45
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:47,870
Very good, good.

46
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,870
Thanks, both of you.

47
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,930
Thanks, Director.

48
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,160
Fei, have some water.

49
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,990
I can't. I'm feeling gross.

50
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,710
So gross.

51
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,320
What's wrong?

52
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,830
What do you mean?

53
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,460
My acting made me feel gross.

54
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,560
I need to find a place to calm down.

55
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,880
Fei, it's for work.

56
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,190
It's all for the work.

[Episode 10]
[Qin Xiaofei, let me hold the umbrella for you from now on. My promise won't change, okay?]

58
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,340
Come.

59
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,910
Here.

60
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,490
What does this mean?

61
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:21,650
Are you thanking me?

62
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:22,450
Proposing a toast to me?

63
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,070
Respecting me?

64
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:23,930
Or admiring me?

65
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,470
Xing Zhizhi.

66
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,680
Thank you.

67
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,210
You must have spent a lot on this.

68
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,950
Why didn't you come back to watch it with me?

69
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,590
It's a waste to watch it alone.

70
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,120
It is enough.

71
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,340
On my way back from overtime work today, I was thinking

72
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,860
if you'd notice.

73
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,530
The whole world knows now.

74
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,890
So this is the secret between you and Xixi?

75
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,620
She drew all of it.

76
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,890
She wants to tell you

77
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,180
that you are important

78
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,970
and deserve to be seen.

79
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,460
This little rascal.

80
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,300
Ren Siqi told me

81
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,850
the effect was really amazing.

82
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,530
Because of this,

83
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,130
some variety shows have invited us.

84
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,860
Really? That's great.

85
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,070
But I don't want to go.

86
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,610
I want to stay with Xixi

87
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,240
until she fully recovers.

88
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,340
Qin Xiaofei,

89
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,510
Xixi and I both hope

90
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,510
that you can go and make a beautiful comeback.

91
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,570
As for Xixi's legs,

92
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,660
leave it to me.

93
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,360
I'm a professional rehab doctor.

94
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,470
Make a beautiful comeback.

95
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,720
Cheers.

96
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,230
Perfect.

97
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:23,940
Here.

98
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,480
Xing Zhizhi.

99
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,220
You're such a warm person.

100
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,750
My warmth

101
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,230
comes from someone named Qin Xiaofei.

102
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,630
Although she left without saying goodbye,

103
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,390
and made me worry for a long time,

104
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,740
she eventually came back to my side.

105
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,420
Heaven has been fair to me after all.

106
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,450
Qin Xiaofei,

107
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,760
you really made me wait for a long time.

108
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,870
So, can you tell me now

109
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,690
what exactly happened that day?

110
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,240
Chubby.

111
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,710
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,280
I didn't mean to not show up

113
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,370
in the singing competition that day.

114
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,400
My father passed away in a car accident

115
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,230
that day.

116
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,240
[Morgue]

117
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,910
After that,

118
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,800
I kept moving with my mom

119
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,090
and changing schools.

120
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,670
Later, she got married again.

121
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,150
To be honest,

122
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,970
I found it hard to understand her at that time.

123
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,480
But thinking about it now,

124
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,960
it must have been difficult for her to face

125
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,670
the days without my father.

126
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,970
I shouldn't have blamed her for her choices.

127
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,740
However,

128
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,370
I really struggled to fit into her new family.

129
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,710
So I used dance lessons as an excuse

130
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,320
to leave home and come to Huhai.

131
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,380
Unfortunately, things didn't go as planned.

132
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,210
In the end,

133
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,330
I couldn't keep the promise I made to my dad.

134
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,830
So, Xing Zhizhi,

135
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,310
do you get it?

136
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,880
Promises

137
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,790
don't mean much to me anymore.

138
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,570
The future is always changing,

139
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,760
and dreams that aren't fulfilled

140
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,410
never come back.

141
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,850
That's why I want to stay away from anything that might hurt me

142
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,720
while I can still bear it.

143
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,080

I've finally bought everything.

Are you Qin Fei's mother?

Yes, I am.

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,840
Okay, Auntie.

190
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,590
Here, have some water.

191
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,000
So you're Xiaofei's friend?

192
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,000
Not exactly.

193
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,090
Then...

194
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,880
Boy...

195
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,580
Assistant, male assistant.

196
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,480
-A male assistant?
-Thank you, Auntie.

197
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,860
Even male assistants are so handsome these days.

198
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,410
You know, Xiaofei

199
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,030
just doesn't date.

200
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,450
Look at you.

201
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,440
Your features are so delicate.

202
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,680
You look so festive.

203
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,760
Thank you, Auntie.

204
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,580
Well, you know our Xiaofei.

205
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,850
She...

206
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,150
She's so careless.

207
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,440
We're not always by her side.

208
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,180
So please, look after her a bit, alright?

209
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,200
Don't worry, Auntie.

210
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,320
It's my job.

211
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,870
If there's nothing else,

212
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:01,760
I'll be going now.

213
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,400
Oh, right.

214
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,640
She asked me

215
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,140
to remind you to try on this outfit.

216
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,210
Okay, okay.

217
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,780
Then I won't keep you any longer.

218
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,930
I'll be going then, Auntie.

219
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:09,930
Goodbye, Auntie.

220
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,640
-Thank you.
-No problem.

221
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,630
Come on.

[Time: 2022-11-04, Female's shirt]

223
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:37,740
I have an urgent matter.

224
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,000
I won't be coming over.

225
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,190
Let's eat.

226
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,350
We won't wait for my sister?

227
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,550
What's the point of waiting? Let's eat!

228
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,230
She's just being stubborn.

229
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,370
She clearly planned to come.

230
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,590
You shouldn't be here.

231
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,180
Then where should I be?

232
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,390
They're probably

233
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,290
heading to the airport by now.

234
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,630
There are still

235
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:18,630
three hours until the flight takes off.

236
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,430
What does that have to do with me?

237
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,080
She actually cares about you a lot.

238
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,750
You've only met her once,

239
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,110
and you already know she cares about me?

240
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,530
You know her so well?

241
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,230
I don't know her

246
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,490
Absolutely not.

Hurry up, keep up!

248
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,360
Stop.

Why can't you walk properly?

-Okay. Stop playing.
-I'll confiscate it. Seriously.

-Brat.

let's go first.

256
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,180
We'll wait for you at the boarding gate.

257
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,390
Talk nicely.

258
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,260
Let's go.

259
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:11,680
Come on.

Let's go.

263
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,350
I heard from your assistant

264
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,370
that you've been quite busy lately.

265
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:47,970
Pretty busy.

266
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,380
Busy.

267
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,200
Looks like you've got some work.

268
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:56,150
I heard you ran into some trouble when I came.

269
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,690
Now,

270
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,180
have things settled down?

271
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,420
You don't need to talk to me in that sarcastic tone.

272
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,550
I got this job through my own hard work.

273
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,000
Yes,

274
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,180
you've got skills.

275
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,780
You can make money when you're young,

276
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,510
but what about when you're old?

277
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,580
When things are going well, it's all fine.

278
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,300
But when trouble comes,

279
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,510
you're the only one suffering.

280
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,460
Look at you.

281
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,570
You're always living on the edge.

282
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,290
Can I keep you in check for a lifetime?

283
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:22,770
Can I come here every time?

284
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,820
What have you ever done for me?

285
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,440
Isn't it because you're bored at home?

286
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,800
And now you're blaming me?

287
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,460
Do you know how to talk?

288
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,750
Do you have any conscience?

289
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,590
I don't know how to talk and I have no conscience.

290
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,250

Do you know anything about this industry?

293
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,430
Do you know what I'm thinking?

294
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,210
Yes,

295
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,510

I really

don't know anything about your industry.

00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,850

It's my fault.

00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,000
what do you think?

348
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,370
Do you even need to ask?

349
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,640
My opinion is

350
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,920
that you should take the initiative.

351
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,420
He shouldn't take the initiative.

352
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,190
Honestly,

353
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,640
I think Dr. Xing's gentle approach

354
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,030
is very wise.

355
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:05,210
Really?

356
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,200
But

357
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,060
didn't they live together for a while to take care of Xixi?

358
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,000
Such a good opportunity,

359
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,160
and Xing didn't even confess.

360
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,240
Now

361
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,900
Qin Fei's career is back on track,

362
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,130
and she's moved out of his place.

363
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,510
When she gets even busier,

364
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,240
Xing

365
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,370
will find it even harder to pursue her.

366
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,790
I should call

367
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,110

do you know Fei better than I do?

370
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,830
She has philophobia, okay?

371
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,760
W-What phobia?

372
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,300
She can't be in a relationship

373
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,000
for more than three months.

374
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,430
Do you know why?

375
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,330
Because she's

00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,280
a heartbreaker?

377
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,610
Are you looking to get hit?

378
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,880
Talking bad about Fei.

379
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,900
Didn't you ask me to guess?

380
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,010
Then why is it?

381
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:44,790
Fei

382
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:47,310
is like a kitten I had

383
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,550
when I was little.

384
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,590
When you ignore her,

385
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,530
she likes to

386
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,710
scratch you a bit

387
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:52,990
and tease you a little.

388
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:53,960
But

389
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,110
once you want to

390
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,750
play with her,

391
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,350
she

392
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,640
will hide back in her cat bed.

393
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:03,070
At the beginning of a relationship, everything goes smoothly.

394
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,270
But as soon as she realizes

395
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,070
the other person wants to get serious,

396
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,100
she starts to

397
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,840
get nervous and scared

398
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,260
and then backs away,

399
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,480
testing to see if he'll chase after her.

400
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,180
That kind of hot-and-cold attitude is hard to deal with.

401
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:15,940
Exactly.

402
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,100
So usually at this point, the other person

403
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,820
just gives up.

404
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,400
However,

405
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,550
I think Dr. Xing

406
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,580
might still have a chance.

00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:31,230
Thank you.

410
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,350
Come again next time!

411
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,200
I'd better get back to the film set then.

412
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,430
Yu Zhecheng.

413
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,200
While I'm gone,

414
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,090
you'd better behave yourself.

415
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,370
If I find out

416
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,860
you've been fooling around with other women,

417
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,970
I'll...

418
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:46,890
Coffee,

419
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,390
am I that kind of person?

420
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,440
Also,

421
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,640
while you're on set,

422
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,150
not only do you need to take good care of Fei,

423
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,000
but you also need to take care of my girlfriend.

424
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,410
If I find out

425
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,300
she loses weight,

426
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,710
then I'll...

427
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,750
You'll what?

428
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,070
I'll take her out for all the best food and drinks

429
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,200
to make up for it all.

430
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,450
Good answer.

431
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,650
I'm off then.

-No.
-No.

Alright.

Is Qin Fei out of her mind?

467
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:11,020
This is way too extreme.

new member Jin Na has been unlocked.

Congratulations to Qin Fei

471
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,210
for completing the challenge!

472
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,850
I've been working so hard just to unlock her.

473
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,710
It's indeed a surprise.

474
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:33,520

475
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:37,920
Feifei,

476
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,030
you're so amazing.

477
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,050
I didn't expect it to be you.

478
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,820
You've worked hard.

479
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,200
Okay.

480
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,160
Would the two guests please

481
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,480
look at our camera together

482
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,310
with our signature pose?

483
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:54,760
Okay.

484
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,980
Both guests, please look at our camera.

485
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,160

490
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,270
go!

00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:11,170
Alright, everyone take a break.

495
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,400
Okay, thank you all for your hard work.

496
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,750
I've prepared some coffee here.

497
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,990
Help yourselves.

498
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,030
Thank you all for your hard work.

499
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,200
Thank you, thank you very much.

500
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
Take care of this.

501
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:21,440
Mr. Ren,

502
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,120
why is Jin Na one of the guests?

503
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,100
Did Fei know?

504
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:26,910
She didn't know.

505
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,010
If she knew, she wouldn't have come.

506
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:29,300
Then we're in trouble.

507
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,110
When Fei finishes work and comes back,

508
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,040
she's definitely going to blow up.

509
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,010

513
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,030
Go, go, go.

514
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,430
You can't leave.

515
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,570
You caused this trouble yourself.

516
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:50,500
Don't make me take the fall for you.

517
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,190
You kid, let go of me.

518
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,040
I won't let go.

519
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,060
Nothing.

520
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,840
Ke Feifei,

521
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,630
I'll fire you, do you believe me?

522
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,850
I'll count to three, let go of me.

523
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:06,500
One.

524
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:08,730
Fei, Fei, Ren Siqi is bullying me.

525
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,550
-Fei! Fei!
-Where are you going?

526
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,030
Great.

527
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,400
You're so skinny.

528
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,750
How come you're so strong?

529
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,940
Stop it.

530
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:20,680
Now explain to me about Jin Na.

531
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,340
I'm giving you three minutes.

532
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:26,300
Think carefully before you speak.

533
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,050
If I hear one word of nonsense,

534
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,110
you'll be on the front page tomorrow, got it?

535
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,960
On the front page for what?

536
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,360
Qin Fei Beats Up Agency Boss.

537
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,960
How's that for a headline?

538
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,730
I knew Jin Na would come.

539
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,680
But you're both in the same industry.

540
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,720
You'll have chances to collaborate sooner or later.

541
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,770
What's the point of avoiding it?

542
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,530
When did I ever say I was avoiding her?

543
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:54,480
When did I say I wouldn't work with her?

544
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,660
The main thing is, that you should have given me a heads-up.

545
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,250
If I had known the guest was Jin Na,

546
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,470
would I have acted like I just did?

547
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,150
I would have done even better.

548
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,840
I thought you acted quite well just now.

549
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,390
Really.

550
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:05,670
That's because I'm good at improvising.

551
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,830
This isn't a reason for you not to tell me.

552
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,390
It's not an excuse to treat me like a fool.

553
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,450
Treat you like a fool?

554
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,720
Qin Fei, think about it clearly.

555
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,420
Jin Na

556
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:18,450
set you up before,

557
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,400
not the other way around.

558
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,430
If someone has to be removed from this show,

559
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,200
it should be her, Jin Na.

560
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:24,960
Understand?

561
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,720
Mr. Ren,

562
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:30,290

I'm talking about you.

751
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,590
Your eyesight is failing.

752
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,650
Your ears can't hear clearly either.

753
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:25,180
Weiwei,

754
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:26,380
I suggest you go to the hospital

755
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,830
and get a thorough check-up.

756
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,960
After all, this show is quite dangerous.

757
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,940
If you take a hit or fall,

758
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,240
with your physical condition,

759
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,830
you definitely won't be able to handle it.

760
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,090
Right, Sister Weiwei?

761
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,000
Who are you calling sister?

762
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:42,410
I...

763
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:47,700
If you like doing makeup so much,

764
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,360
feel free to sit there longer.

765
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:50,180
Let's go.

766
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,060
I'm a born beauty, I don't need it.

767
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,150
Your fighting spirit was off the charts today.

768
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,610
You totally shut down that Jin Weiwei

769
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:08,410
with just a few words.

770
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,880
Fei, I feel like you're in a completely different state this time on set.

771
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,920
You seem so confident.

772
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,570
Your whole aura

773
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:15,170
is just elevated.

774
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,030
Really?

775
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:17,230
Yes.

776
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,970
But Fei, what about your makeup?

777
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,440
Just do a simple makeup.

778
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,540
Let's not be too harsh on others.

779
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:24,670
That's true.

780
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:37,250
Everyone, assemble!

781
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,390
Hello, everyone.

782
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:41,780
My name is Liu Yanze.

783
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:43,980
I'm the special instructor for this show.

784
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,250
Starting from today,

785
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,160
I will be

786
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,240
training all of you

787
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,270
in combat techniques for two weeks.

788
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,140
Thank you all.

789
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:53,740
Welcome, Instructor.

790
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:54,940
Report.

791
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:55,840
Speak.

792
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,110
Instructor,

793
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,930
this is a rescue show.

794
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,150
You're teaching combat techniques.

795
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:03,150
Are you sure you're on the right set?

796
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,070
Jin Weiwei?

797
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,110
Trainee Jin Weiwei,

798
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:18,330
step forward!

799
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,870
Combat techniques training

800
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,980
enhances not only self-defense

801
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:29,480
but also your ability to handle emergencies

802
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,990
in dangerous situations.

803
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,080
Do you understand?

804
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:34,870
I understand.

805
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,920
Does everyone understand?

806
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,800
Yes, sir!

807
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,070
Return to your position.

808
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:40,810
Yes.

809
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,590
Next,

810
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,400
everyone pairs up for the training.

811
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,400
Those without a partner, come to me.

812
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,360
Instructor Liu...

813
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,110
Instructor,

814
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,100
Qin Fei and Jin Na are paired up.

815
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:54,780
I'm left without a partner.

816
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,990
How about we team up?

817
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,520
Mo.

818
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,560
This trainee is without a partner.

819
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,060
When we start training in the hall,

820
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,220
you'll pair with Weiwei.

821
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,300
Go easy on her.

822
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,520
Don't hurt her.

823
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,330
Yes, sir.

824
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,450
Now that everyone is paired up,

825
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:18,070
let's head to the training hall.

826
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:18,850
Let's go.

827
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,550
Qin Fei.

828
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,660
Let's go.

829
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,060
Let's go.

830
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:31,530
[Challenge the Rescue Operation together.]

831
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,300
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

832
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,070
Are you okay?

833
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:39,600
I'm fine.

834
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,630
Pass.

835
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,490
Okay.

836
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:45,090
How is it?

837
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,590
No problem.

838
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:48,290
About that move just now,

839
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,630
your hip needs to be really close to hers,

840
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,800
and keep your center of gravity low.

841
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,130
Twist your waist.

842
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,140
And if your hips aren't close to hers, you could get hurt.

843
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,030
Plant your feet firmly,

844
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:57,740
then do this body slam.

845
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,270
Alright.

846
00:38:58,290 --> 00:38:58,850
Again.

847
00:38:58,870 --> 00:38:59,590
Here.

848
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,540
Let's do it.

849
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,230
Are you alright?

850
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,210
Are you okay?

851
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,990
Hold on, stop for a moment.

852
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:19,960
Stop.

853
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:20,970
You'll pair up with

854
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:22,650
Jin Weiwei for practice.

855
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:23,430
Okay.

856
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,660
Qin Fei, take a break.

857
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,260
Report, instructor.

858
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,390
I don't need a break.

859
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,710
Whether you need a break or not

860
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,940
is for me to decide.

861
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:31,780
Go on.

862
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,440
Chin, chin, a bit lower.

863
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:46,240
Right, don't use your hands yet.

864
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,720
No grabbing.

865
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:50,730
Are you alright, Fei?

866
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:51,760
I'm not doing great.

867
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,550
Come on, take it slow, Fei.

868
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:53,400
Let's take off the waist support first.

869
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,590
Okay, okay, okay.

870
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,400
Slowly now.

871
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,230
Does it hurt?

872
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,190
Can you massage it for me?

873
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,150
Sure, sure, sure.

874
00:39:59,150 --> 00:39:59,880
T-There's a chair over there.

875
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,880
Let's go sit there for a while.

876
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,770
Take a rest.

877
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,030
Careful, careful.

878
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,360
Careful.

879
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,870
I-I'll massage it for you.

880
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,270
Does this hurt?

881
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:10,940
No.

882
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:11,770
The left side.

883
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:12,900
How about here?

884
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,230
I'll let go, I'll let go.

885
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,110
Be gentle, be gentle.

886
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,000
I'll be gentle, I'll be gentle.

887
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,730
Right there.

888
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,670
Fei, you must have

889
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:23,000
strained it during that body slam earlier.

890
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,130
I'll be gentle. Let me know if it hurts.

891
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,590
I told you not to push yourself so hard during the training,

892
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,530
but you wouldn't listen.

893
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:30,970
It's just a show.

894
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,410
Why don't we go to the hospital?

895
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,960
Are you crazy?

896
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:36,780
We finally got this chance to be on camera.

897
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,510
We can't go to the hospital now.

898
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:40,510
That's true.

899
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:41,940
But are you sure you're okay?

900
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,080
Don't push yourself too hard.

901
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,210
Don't worry.

902
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,100
Give me the plaster Xing Zhizhi gave me.

903
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:46,760
I'll use it.

904
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,690
Fei, I left it in the room.

905
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:50,350
I'll go get it now.

906
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,150
Wait for me.

907
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,790
Ke Feifei.

908
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:57,520
How many things can you actually keep track of in that head of yours?

909
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,070
Alright, everyone gets ready.

910
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,370
Three, two, one.

911
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:04,680
Action!

912
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,460
Well,

913
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,990
the moves you just learned.

914
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,050
Show me what you've got.

915
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,380
Just try to take me down.

916
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,320
Come on.

917
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,700
How is this possible?

918
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,400
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

919
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,760
It hurts so much!

920
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:27,750
Come on,

921
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:29,010
come on.

922
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:31,470
Remember, for this move,

923
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:32,400
you first need to

924
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:33,630
bend your hips,

925
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:35,520
not your back.

926
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,130
Second, you need to grab firmly.

927
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:37,860
Understand?

928
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,040
You're amazing,

929
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,000
Instructor Liu.

930
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,850
I'm going to take a rest.

931
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,270
I'm exhausted.

932
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:47,770
Well.

933
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,320
-Thank you.
-If anyone can

934
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,760
take me down with that last move,

935
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,120
they'll be considered qualified.

936
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,690
Is there anyone who wants to try?

937
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:54,580
I'll do it.

938
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:07,290
♫You occupy my sight♫

939
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:14,810
♫Light up every moment♫

940
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:23,040
♫When I keep thinking about you♫

941
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:29,530
♫The whole world has fallen♫

942
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,860
♫My heart♫

943
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:37,770
♫I just want to stay by your side♫

944
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:41,320
♫My love♫
