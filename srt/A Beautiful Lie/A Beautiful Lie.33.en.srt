[One day ago]

4
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,110
Give me another one.

5
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,090
Is the same as mine okay?

6
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,260
Jie,

7
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,020
another one, the same as mine.

8
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,740
No problem.

9
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,590
Do you remember Li Xi?

10
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,690
-Who?
-Li Xi.

11
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,800
You know, my buddy.

12
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,530
The one who said he got you to date him.

13
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,210
He brought you to the bar to show off to us.

14
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,810
Then you got angry.

15
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,170
Without a word, he asked the bartender to open

16
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,690
a bottle of Louis XIII.

17
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,150
Louis XIII?

18
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,380
I remember now. Why bring him up?

19
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,920
It's nothing.

20
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,590
It's just that the independent

21
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,560
and beautiful Miss Qin from before

22
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,560
is now sitting here, drowning her sorrows in alcohol.

23
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,010
Hey, Chen Shen.

24
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,500
If you're sick, go see a doctor, okay?

25
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,590
How do I have relationship troubles?

26
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,110
Xing Zhizhi and I are doing fine.

27
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,090
You're talking nonsense.

28
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,090
You're paying for the drinks today.

29
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,230
I'm leaving.

30
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,740
I didn't say you had relationship troubles.

31
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,550
You gave yourself away.

[Episode 33]
[Xiaofei, let’s break up]

33
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,480
That hair dye from yesterday was definitely problematic.

34
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,490
You know what?

35
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,920
To salvage my image,

36
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,080
I went to another place

37
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,710
and specially gave my hair a massage.

38
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,650
They gave me this bottle of hair conditioner.

39
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,090
It works really well.

40
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,550
Look at my hair.

41
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,010
Isn't it much better now?

42
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,290
Yes, yes.

43
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,880
Honey, this was worth it.

44
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,200
-It’s hot.
-Right? It’s good.

45
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,570
-I’ll go cook.
-Okay.

46
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,490
Are you alright?

47
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,560
I'm great.

48
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,360
I didn't expect Auntie to be unlucky along with me.

49
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,390
Alright, unlucky girl.

50
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,080
Let's go to the bathroom. I'll help you wash your hair.

51
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,710
No need, Auntie. I can do it myself.

52
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,640
Mom, don't worry about it. I'll help her wash.

53
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,000
No need. I can go by myself.

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,310
I'll dry it for you later.

55
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,250
These two lovebirds are quite affectionate.

56
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,400
Isn't it good to be affectionate?

57
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,200
Of course it's good.

58
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,130
Your brother's lifelong happiness

59
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,610
has finally been settled.

60
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,000
Be careful.

61
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,630
Done? It's really not bad.

62
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,640
Much more natural than before.

63
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,640
Looks good.

64
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,000
Xiaofei, have some fruit.

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,630
Dad, don't bother.

66
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,800
I'll handle it.

67
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,380
You're really careless.

68
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,890
You're not attentive at all.

69
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,270
Your son has

70
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,180
already prepared Xiaofei's fruit separately for her.

71
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,120
Just for this,

72
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,560
he made a special trip home this morning.

73
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,800
He carefully prepared a small box

74
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,720
and put it in the fridge.

75
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,740
He even told me

76
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,110
that Xiaofei likes cold food.

77
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,500
Isn't that right?

78
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,160
How come I never knew my brother

79
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,680
was so thoughtful?

80
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,260
Mom,

81
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:15,510
where's that old photo album I asked you for yesterday?

82
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,860
It's in the room upstairs. I've already prepared it for you.

83
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,120
I'll take you to see the photo album.

84
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,810
They just came down, and now they're going up again.

85
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,170
Let them stay a bit longer.

86
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,660
Dinner will be ready soon.

87
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,120
What dinner?

88
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,680
Didn't we just start cooking the soup?

89
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,170
Come here.

90
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:58,570
Xing Zhizhi.

91
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,720
Aren't you trying to

92
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,320
show off a bit too much today?

93
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,830
Don't I dry your hair and

94
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,510
slice fruit for you at home too?

95
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,870
That's at home.

96
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,920
Aren't we here to meet

97
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,250
your parents today?

98
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,080
I should be the one making an impression.

99
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,380
But look at you.

100
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,820
First, you drag me to the bathroom.

101
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,600
Then, you pull me here to look at the photo album,

102
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,560
and now we're eating

103
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,190
alone in this room.

104
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,170
You've done all these things.

105
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,570
How am I supposed to bond with your parents?

106
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,760
You're right.

107
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,730
How did I not think of that?

108
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:29,860
How about this?

109
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,120
Let's take the photo album downstairs.

110
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,240
No, no, no.

111
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,280
Going out now would make it seem even more deliberate, wouldn't it?

112
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,050
It was all so genuine before.

113
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,220
Now you've made it a bit awkward for me.

114
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,510
I'm sorry, Xiaofei.

115
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,120
Dr. Xing,

116
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,400
why are you acting so strange today?

117
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,900
Our emotionally intelligent Dr. Xing,

118
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:58,280
why are you so silly and clumsy today?

119
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,810
It's nothing. I'm fine.

120
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,560
Maybe I'm nervous, maybe.

121
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,160
Why are you so nervous?

122
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,070
Shouldn't I be the nervous one?

123
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,210
What should we do now?

124
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,930
Let's just go with it. Show me.

125
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,030
Alright.

126
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,950
This was from when my parents got married.

127
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,420
This was my sister when she was little.

128
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,630
Cute.

129
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,900
This was me when I was little.

130
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,320
Why were you so chubby?

131
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,170
I was chubby when I was little.

132
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,730
Later, as I grew up,

133
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,030
I got taller and slimmed down.

134
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,750
This was from January of 2023.

135
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,580
During Spring Festival, right?

136
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,230
Look at your smile.

137
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,390
Looking at these photos,

138
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,220
I suddenly realized something.

139
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,610
What did you realize?

140
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,910
I realized

141
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,330
there's a reason why I fell in love with you.

142
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,870
I'm a pessimistic person,

143
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,020
unlike you.

144
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,410
You're warm, kind,

145
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,800
able to find beauty in life,

146
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,700
and capable of warming everyone around you.

147
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,430
Thank you, Chubby.

148
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,150
Come, Xiaofei, eat more.

149
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,890
-This is also delicious. Eat more.
-Enjoy.

150
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,150
-These are all my signature dishes.
-Okay.

151
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,060
Mom,

152
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,480
I'm your real daughter.

153
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,710
You're making me feel extra.

154
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:13,410
When you stop controlling my sugar intake,

155
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,370
I'll be all lovey-dovey with you.

156
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,990
You have diabetes, don't you know?

157
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,680
What's wrong with having diabetes?

158
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,830
If there's no sweetness in life,

159
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,790
how tasteless would life be?

160
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:24,940
Right?

161
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,260
Here, let Dad serve you some.

162
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,980
-Dad is the best.
-My dear daughter.

163
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,220
Xiaofei.

164
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,760
-Auntie.
-What’s wrong?

165
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,860
Doesn't it taste good?

166
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,120
It's nothing.

167
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,480
By the way, Auntie,

168
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,270
why

169
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,910
was Xing Zhizhi named Zhizhi?

170
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,320
There's a saying I don't know if you've heard of before.

171
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,290
By knowing your goal, you can then be steadfast.

172
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,800
By being steadfast, you can then be tranquil.

173
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,030
By being tranquil, you can then be content.

174
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,150
By being content, you can then ponder.

175
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,640
By pondering, you can then receive.

176
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,490
When I was reading this passage,

177
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,940
it really resonated with me.

178
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,420
I thought

179
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,630
people shouldn't just be content.

180
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,240
They should also know their goals.

181
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,190
I thought to myself,

182
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,920
if I ever had a son,

183
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,060
I'd name him Zhizhi.

184
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,690
That's how he got his name.

185
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,270
Auntie, you're so knowledgeable.

186
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:25,000
No wonder you've raised such an outstanding son.

187

If you want to talk about that,

193
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,670
I have a long story to tell.

Right, Chubby?

196
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,670
Chubby.

197
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,500
That's true.

198
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,120
I don't know what good food

199
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,680
I always made him when he was a kid.

200
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,610
-He was round like a ball.
-He got too many nutrients.

201
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,290
What delicious food?

202
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,160
Back then, he took advantage of being round...

207
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,840
what you call "unusual" behavior?

208
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,400
It was this time when he brought me home.

209
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,090
During the meal,

210
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,420
I felt that he was acting very strangely.

211
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,500
It was like he had become a different person.

212
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,070
Even his smile seemed insincere.

213
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,130
And his reactions were delayed.

214
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,950
When you mentioned adverse reactions,

215
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,890
do you mean these behaviors

216
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,940
are all side effects of him taking medication?

217
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,760

with Dr. Li from the psychiatric department?

220
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,050
I mentioned it during the follow-up appointment.

221
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,450
What was the conclusion?

222
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,060
It's the adverse effects of the medication.

223
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,400
He believes that in my current condition,

224
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,530
I should maintain the original dosage.

225
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,500
Is there any way to alleviate this?

226
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,280
What can I do to help him?

227
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:55,070
Understand, accept, and accompay him.

228
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,700

Psychological treatment

239
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,390
is inherently a complex

240
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,150
and lengthy process.

241
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,780

242
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,110
facing a loved one who suddenly changed

243
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,150
is also a challenge.

244
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,600
Few people can have enough patience

245
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,600
and accompany them for a long time.

246
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,830
You say few people can,

247
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,550

The car is still at the dealership.

277
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,830

that we couldn't go camping?

287
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,140
Of course not.

288
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,400

I think it's time

337
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,980
to move on to the next stage of our lives.

338
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,880
I remember you said before

339
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,380
that you envied the romance

340
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,830
when Xing Zhizhi confessed to Qin Fei.

341
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,150
I admit I haven't been good at being romantic.

342
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,430

344
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,390
I've learned it. It's not very smooth,

345
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,950
but at least I managed to sing it through.

346
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,160
So, Ke Feifei,

347
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,190
are you willing to

348
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,340
spend the rest of your life with me?

349
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,300
Spend the rest of our lives together.

350
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,270
Yes, Ke Feifei, will you marry me?

351
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:16,830
Coffee, you don't need to kneel.

352
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,510
I should be the one doing this.

353
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,490
Haven't I told you that I don't want to get married?

354
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,360
W-What do you mean?

355
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,440
I know you've put a lot of effort into this

356
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,370
and I'm very grateful, but...

357
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,070
But I just don't want to get married.

358
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,240
Coffee!

359
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:34,870
You never said you didn't want to get married.

360
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,680
You only said you weren't considering marriage.

361
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,680
We weren't dating at that time.

362
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,880
It was normal for you not to consider marriage then.

363
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,920
But now we're in a stable relationship.

364
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,180
You should be considering marriage now.

365
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:43,640
I'm sorry.

366
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,650

00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,720
About the promotional material,

369
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,510
I'll follow up on it later.

370
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,020
Here's the thing.

371
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,440
It's good for a woman to be career-oriented,

372
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,270
of course.

373
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,200
But your love life

374
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,760
is also a very important part of life.

375
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,710
Look at me. I'm talking to you.

376
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,370
I am a bad example.

377
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,000
Don't be like my wife

378
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,830
and definitely don't be like me.

379
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,410
That young man is quite good. He's tall and handsome.

380
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,120
Ke Feifei,

381
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,240
if you want to break up with me,

382
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,160
you can just say it directly.

383
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,930
I don't want to break up with you.

384
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,060
Then why won't you accept my proposal?

385
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,920
Well, you never mentioned before

386
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,440
that you wanted to get married. Besides,

387
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,680
not wanting to get married and breaking up are two different things.

388
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,030
It's the same thing.

389
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,350
Ke Feifei, I'm already 30.

390
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,080
My family has been pressuring me to get married.

391
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,060
I didn't bring it up before because I thought

392
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,530
a man should establish his career before starting a family.

393
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:23,620
I wanted to get my professional title before proposing to you.

394
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,950
It's not that I've never thought about it.

395
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,310
Or is it that

396
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,730
you've never considered it at all?

397
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,660
I really don't want to get married.

398
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,530
But why?

399
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,540
Do you think I'm not good enough in some way?

400
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,080
I don't meet your expectations?

401
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,020
Or is it because you've been getting busier with work lately

402
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,370
and feel our relationship has cooled off?

403
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,320
No.

404
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,070
I don't think you're lacking in any way.

405
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,130
And

406
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,880
I'm happy dating you.

407
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,680
I don't feel our relationship has cooled off either.

408
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,430
As long as you don't bring up marriage,

409
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,510
everything is fine.

410
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,410
Then you're a DINK.

411
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,940
You don't want children, so

412
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,010
you don't want to get married.

413
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,950
We can discuss everything in detail.

414
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,500
We can have children,

415
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,530
but I just don't want to get married.

416
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,980
But I... I...

417
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,070
I don't understand what you're saying.

418
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,400
Can you put it in terms I can understand?

419
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,880
Hello?

420
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:30,130
Feifei, I'm getting married.

421
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,400
Can you come?

422
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,410
Your wedding? Okay, I'll go.

423
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,830
Are you free on Friday?

424
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,250
Would you accompany me to a wedding?

425
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,290
I'll tell you why.

426
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,280
Yes, yes, yes.

427
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,330
Who is that person?

428
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,080
Is it the person who didn't want to get married?

429
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,470
Did he hurt you before?

430
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,060
Ke Feifei, let me tell you,

431
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,090
I absolutely won't let you

432
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,360
be hurt in any way again.

433
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,960
As for marriage...

434
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,240
Alright.

435
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,290
So we'll go with this set of promotional photos.

436
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,750
Also, tell the photographer

437
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,350
not to only take photos of the main leads.

438
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,730
The supporting roles should be photographed too, right?

439
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:09,770
Okay.

440
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,540
You're wearing this to the wedding?

441
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:16,890
How is it?

442
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,660
Who's more handsome, him or me?

443
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,540
You, I guess.

444
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,690
Why the "I guess"? It's definitely me!

445
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,620
I'm going there today to make you look good.

446
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,210
I want him to know that losing you

447
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,120
is the biggest mistake

448
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,430
he's ever made in his life.

449
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,460
Then I'll take you

450
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,350
to bid farewell to the past.

451
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,440
Stop, stop, stop.

452
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,490
Who lost me?

453
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,740
What past are we bidding farewell to?

454
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,640
Your ex-boyfriend, of course.

455
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,400
Who told you I'm going to

456
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,460
my ex-boyfriend's wedding today?

457
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,370
Then whose is it?

458
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,480
Feifei, why aren't you here yet?

459
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,020
The ceremony is about to start.

460
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:56,830
The relatives

461
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,640
and Dad's colleagues are all here.

462
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,400
Today is Dad's big day.

463
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,870
Dad is serious this time.

464
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,990
When were you not serious?

465
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,500
Wait, I feel like my brain is about to explode.

466
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,540
Today

467
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,970
is your dad's wedding?

468
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:12,750
Which time is this?

469
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,540
Counting the time with my mom before I was born,

470
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,790
it's the fifth time.

471
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,550
I'm used to him getting married.

472
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,010
It's like a revolving lantern.

473
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,610
Every time he gets married again, my mom says,

474
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:27,070
"The village is getting a new person again."

475
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:29,730
I find it quite boring.

476
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,710
I know you've put a lot of effort into this

477
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,640
and I'm very grateful, but...

478
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,540
I just don't want to get married.

479
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,380
Coffee, do you still want to go?

480
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,580
But my dad has already called 800 times.

481
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,560
Let's not go. I'll take you somewhere else.

482
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,530
Get out of the car.

483
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,960
Where is this?

484
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:19,620
Do you see it?

485
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,020
That building.

486
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:25,520
Building 18, Unit 3, Room 903.

487
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,260
What about it?

488
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,020
That's our marital home.

489
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:35,050
I was planning to bring you here

490
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,880
after you accepted my proposal.

491
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,550
I don't want it.

492
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,030
Take this, Coffee.

493
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,970
Coffee, I understand you now.

494
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:53,800
I will never mention the word "marriage" again.

495
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,750
But I just want to give this to you.

496
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,550
Yu Zhecheng, you're very good,

497
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:09,690
but...

498
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,720
Don't say that.

499
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:11,750
Stop right there.

500
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,880
But you want to get married.

501
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,860
You prepared the proposal so carefully,

502
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,270
with the cake and the ring.

503
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,270
But I...

504
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,950
Coffee, you're mistaken.

505
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,890
It's not that I want to get married.

506
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,620
I want to marry you.

507
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,300
I want to build a family with you.

508
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:27,640
It's because I believe

509
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,790
family is synonymous with happiness.

510
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,920
But it turns out you lived in a

511
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,920
family that wasn't happy.

512
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,320
The family isn't a happy place for you.

513
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,840
It might be a place of

514
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,080
chaos,

515
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,270
or somewhere that frightens you.

516
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,350
This goes against my original

517
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,830
intention for proposing.

518
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:56,030
But your parents are still pressuring you to get married.

519
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,130
They also want me to be happy.

520
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,870
But my happiness is being with you,

521
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,800
in whatever form that takes.

522
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:14,330
Yu Zhecheng, you're such a good man.

523
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,790
Wait a sec.

524
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,940
When have I not been one?

525
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,160
Come on, let your man show you the new place.

526
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,980
What do you think I should give Coffee and Yu Zhecheng

527
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:58,350
as a housewarming gift?

528
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,720
Should it be this set of vintage appliances,

529
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,930
or this smart home system?

530
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,870

00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:35,700
of our upcoming new life together.

550
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,760
What new life?

551
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,070
You're playing dumb, aren't you?

552
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,690
Didn't you promise me before

553
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,480
that you'd propose to me once you got better?

554
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,140
Are you trying to back out now?

555
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,910
I was wondering why we've been browsing for so long.

556
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,910
So, this is what you've been waiting for.

557
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:51,440
Alright, let me see what you've picked out.

558
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,420
Look at this one. This is a set of

559
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,750
vintage home appliances.

560
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:58,030
I think these matching sets of furniture

561
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,390
create a really nice atmosphere.

562
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:01,130
It feels very homey and romantic.

563
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:04,170
And this one is a smart home system.

564
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,470
Smart furniture feels very convenient to use,

565
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,810
but it can feel a bit cold.

566
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,970
It might feel less like a home, right?

567
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,490
Help me decide.

568
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,180
I'm sorry, sir.

569
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:19,270
The Love for Life design is currently

570
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,110
sold out in all stores in this city.

571
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,700
If you like this design,

572
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,720
I can check

573
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,250
the inventory in other cities

574
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,640
and transfer it over. It will probably

575
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,200
take one to two months.

576
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,420
Would that be okay with you?

577
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,470
That long?

578
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32,590
Why don't we look at something else?

579
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,950
Then let me show you some other designs.

580
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,640
These are all new designs for this year.

581
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,650
They're currently our best-sellers.

582
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,440
They're very popular among young couples.

583
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,890
You two can take a look.

584
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,780
No need.

585
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,520
Well...

586
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,310
I still want this first design.

587
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:48,360
Could you please ask for me?

588
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,210
See if they can expedite the transfer of goods.

589
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:51,240
I'm willing to pay extra if needed.

590
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:51,880
Certainly.

591
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,720
Please wait a moment, gentlemen.

592
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,030
-I’ll ask for you.
-Thank you.

593
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:59,190
Xing.

594
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:00,480
I'm not trying to criticize you, but

595
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,040
Qin Fei doesn't care about the style of the ring.

596
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,560
She cares about the person giving the ring.

597
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,830
I know.

598
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,120
But Qin Fei and I

599
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,220
have been waiting for this day for too long.

600
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,580
In this matter,

601
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:16,050
I want to make everything the best

602
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,050
and most perfect.

603
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,230
Alright.

604
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,000
A lifetime of true love, right?

605
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,060
This is the one.

607
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,620
Is your proposal video

608
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:50,790
ready?

609
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,940
Let me take a look.

610
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,640
I swear

611
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,130
this is...

612
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,030
This is

613
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,770
the most...

614
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,390
Hello?

615
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:15,540
Hey, Xing,

616
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,420
why aren't you responding to my messages?

617
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,140
How's that proposal video coming along?

618
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,970
I need to use it tomorrow.

619
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,920
It's not ready yet.

620
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,130
It's just a short video.

621
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,760
How many days have you been fussing over it for?

622
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,190
Honestly.

623
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,760
why are you this nervous

624
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,320
about proposing to Qin Fei?

625
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,560
I'm busy, gotta go.

But why do I feel so unsure?

717
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:20,590
Is he really going to propose to me?

718
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,360
Check if he's brought a ring.

719
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,880
Then you'll know.

720
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,590
I'm driving.

721
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,630
I felt something. Felt like a ring box.

722
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:25,190
[Angel's]

723
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:57,780
Xiaofei,

724
00:35:58,330 --> 00:35:59,730
will you marry me?

725
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,280
Why did you go to the bathroom

726
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,630
for so long?

727
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:17,900
I took a call. It's nothing.

728
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,000
Why did you suddenly bring me to such a formal place?

729
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,800
Do you have something to tell me?

730
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,800
Excuse me.

731
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,110
Mr. Xing, can we start now?

732
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,260
We can start now.

733
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,060
This is so beautiful.

734
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:53,300
Thank you.

735
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,210
Xing Zhizhi,

736
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,440
I think I'm very touched now.

737
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:18,590
If there's anything,

738
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,970
hurry and tell me now.

739
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,520
Put it on me quickly.

740
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,430
Are you sure you want to propose?

741
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,090
Do you think you can give her a perfect

742
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:43,220
marriage life?

743
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,460
Don't you know how your

744
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,610
current condition is?

745
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:46,280
You can pretend for a while,

746
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,210
but can you pretend for a lifetime?

747
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:49,210
Go ahead.

748
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,820
Xing Zhizhi, go propose.

749
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:54,330
Take Qin Xiaofei with you

750
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,520
until one day,

751
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,060
she faces reality.

752
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,820
Put it on.

753
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,690
Xiaofei,

754
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:29,820
let’s break up.

755
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,070
Don't joke around. At a time like this,

756
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:50,600
-it's not appropriate to joke.
-I'm serious.

757
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,680
After the last treatment,

758
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:56,710
I had a severe adverse reaction to the medication.

759
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:00,580
It might not be possible to alleviate it anymore.

760
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,880
If you're talking about this,

761
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,620
I don't agree.

762
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,070
And you'll get better, won't you?

763
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:09,900
What if I don't?

764
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,730
You definitely will. Don't scare yourself, okay?

765
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:13,310
What if I really don't?

766
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,480
Do you know

767
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,140
what this means?

768
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,110
I might never be able to understand

769
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,200
your lies again.

770
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,490
I won't be able to feel your love anymore.

771
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,720
And I won't be able to love you either.

772
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,370
And that's not fair to you.

773
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,700
I don't care.

774
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,560
You might not care now.

775
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,790
You might even be fine for a month, two months,

776
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:45,110
a year, or two years.

777
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,960
But what about in the long run?

778
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,480
Can you really do it?

779
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,450
Can you really spend a lifetime

780
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,350
with an emotionless robot?

781
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,650
I can.

782
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:06,580
I said I can.

783
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:22,820
Do you see?

784
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,720
This is the realest version of me right now.

785
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,640
I can't feel your emotions.

786
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,470
I can't even feel my own.

787
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,560
I don't understand anymore.

788
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,750
Actually,

789
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,260
during this time,

790
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:44,130
I've hoped more than anyone that I could get better.

791
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,630
I've been trying hard with you.

792
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,980
I was wondering why it took so long to choose.

793
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:05,040
So, this is what you were waiting for.

794
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,080
Okay, let me see what you've picked.

795
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,990
Look at this.

796
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:10,700
This is vintage.

797
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:13,440
I really like these matching sets of furniture.

798
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,270
Because I feel it's very cozy

799
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,820
and homey.

800
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,200
And this one.

801
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,360
This one

802
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:20,960
is a smart home system.

803
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:23,510
Happy birthday.

804
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,070
Do you think my wish will come true?

805
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:32,690
If you say your wish out loud, it won't come true.

806
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,400
I'm just kidding.

807
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,500
But in the end,

808
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,780
every attempt told me

809
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,230
I may never get better.

810
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,390
I really tried hard.

811
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:06,470
I wanted to give you the perfect proposal.

812
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:09,290
But only now do I understand

813
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:11,770
that I am the biggest flaw.

814
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:16,970
I'm sorry, Xiaofei.

815
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:20,690
I may not be able to love you anymore.

816
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:26,780
I...

817
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,390
can't let your future

818
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:33,540
be spent with a wooden husband.

819
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,240
I'm sorry.

820
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,170
Don't go.

821
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,820
Xiaofei,

822
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,310
I want you to be happy.

823
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:07,300
I hope you live a joyful life,

824
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,420
without regrets.

825
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,480
This is what I should do for you now.
