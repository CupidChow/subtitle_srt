[17 years ago]

3
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,770
Dear friends and family,

4
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,000
thank you so much

5
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,480
for attending the wedding of Lu Dawei and me.

6
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,730
Dawei and I

7
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,400
each had our own journeys

8
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,050
in the first half of our lives.

9
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,540
Because of fate,

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,440
we are united as a family

11
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,810
for the rest of our lives.

12
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,400
I am deeply grateful to my husband,

13
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,380
Lu Dawei,

14
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,480
for giving me

15
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,280
and my daughter, Xiaofei,

16
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,210
a complete family.

17
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,660
From today onward,

18
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,040
you

19
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,880
are Xiaofei's father,

20
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,570
and Xiaofei is your daughter.

21
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:16,950
Thank you.

22
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,790
Xiaofei. Xiaofei?

23
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,350
She was just sitting there a moment ago.

24
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,170
Xiaofei?

25
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,030
Xiaofei?

26
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,700
Xiaofei?

[Episode 8]
[Some relationships, if left to go with the flow, may gradually fade away over time]

28
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,700
Can you do it or not?

29
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,420
Does it still hurt?

30
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,570
It's alright.

31
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,310
It doesn't look serious to me.

32
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,820
Do you still need to go to the hospital?

33
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,660
No need.

34
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,680
This little injury is nothing.

35
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,780
I'll just keep applying the ice. That's all.

36
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,400
Alright, alright.

37
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,740
You do it yourself.

38
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,670
By the way, let's talk about your thing.

39
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,600
Why do you insist on seeing Qin Fei?

40
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,360
No particular reason.

41
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,240
I just find her interesting.

42
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,170
Mei said

43
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,370
you two are old acquaintances.

44
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,420
How about helping me set up a dinner with her?

45
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,080
I'm afraid that if I just reach out to her

46
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,040
out of the blue,

47
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,700
it'll scare her.

48
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,230
Scare her?

49
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,320
It'd be lucky if she doesn't scare you.

50
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,850
She's like a hedgehog—

51
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,750
crazy and unpredictable.

52
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,260
If you say something wrong and make her angry,

53
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,680
all her spikes will stand up

54
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,280
and hurt everyone in her way.

55
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:44,860
What do you mean?

56
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,220
Do you have some kind of issue with her?

57
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,730
There was a small misunderstanding before,

58
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,330
but it's all in the past now.

59
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,190
If there's any issue,

60
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,520
it's more that she thinks I'm the problem.

61
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,610
Anyway, getting involved with her won't do you any good.

62
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,810
Why do you insist on getting to know her?

63
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,780
There's no reason.

64
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,160
I'd rather you two didn't know each other.

65
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,760
Alright. I'll think of another way.

66
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:12,670
Well, um...

67
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,130
Where are you going?

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,750
I'm leaving.

69
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,630
Where to?

70
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:17,530
Home.

71
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,440
Well...

72
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,410
Aren't we taking a vacation in a few days?

73
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,550
Do you want to go out and have some fun?

74
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,940
We can go abroad for a few months.

75
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,600
Go by yourself.

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,730
I want to do something I want during the vacation.

77
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,020
How about this?

78
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,390
Take me to the hospital now,

79
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,270
okay?

80
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,820
Wait, where are you going?

81
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,630
I'm not leaving.

82
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,630
I'm getting you a new ice pack.

83
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,230
That one isn't cold anymore.

Hey.

86
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,810
Drinking when you're unhappy

87
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,470
will only make you feel worse.

88
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,160
Xing Zhizhi,

89
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,590
just because I'm talking to you now

90
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,630
doesn't mean I've forgiven you

91
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,790
for taking advantage of the situation this morning to ask for my WeChat.

92
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,790
Understand?

93
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,230
If you don't mind, I'll sit here.

94
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,870
Dr. Xing.

95
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,220
Are you drinking this beer because you're happy or unhappy?

96
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,920
The older you get,

97
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,880
the fewer happy moments there are.

98
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,010
Alright.

99
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,850
Just for that,

100
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,300
let's have a toast.

101
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,320
When did you start growing up?

102
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,580
Me?

103
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,320
It was around elementary school, I guess.

104
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,310
At that time,

105
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,040
I met a really good friend

106
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,120
who I really liked and trusted.

107
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,050
But she didn't keep the promise between us

108
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,590
and left without saying goodbye.

109
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,830
What a coincidence.

110
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,100
That friend of yours who didn't keep her promise

111
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,250
also grew up around that time.

112
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,950
Her father passed away.

113
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,700
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know.

114
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,430
There's nothing to be sorry about.

115
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,790
It's been so long already.

116
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,510
It doesn't matter anymore.

117
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,810
By the way, Xing Zhizhi.

118
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,500
There's something I want to talk to you about.

119
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,100
Can we postpone Xixi's counseling

120
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,450
for a bit?

121
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,760
Why?

122
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,160
Didn't Xixi say she didn't want to go?

123
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,410
I've grown up and I'm not happy.

124
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,060
But if there's a chance,

125
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,700
I want Xixi to be a child a little longer.

126
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,320
Even if it's just for one day,

127
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,790
I'd like her to be willful and happy.

128
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,940
I happen to be going to the mall tomorrow.

129
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,820
I want to take Xixi with me

130
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,990
to buy her some things she likes,

131
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,900
like pretty clothes

132
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,890
or drawing supplies.

133
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,080
I want to do everything

134
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,800
that can make her happy.

135
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,970
Sounds good.

136
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,670
I'm off tomorrow,

137
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,750
so I'll go with you.

138
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,080
Are you serious, Xing Zhizhi?

139
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,210
I should warn you, I tend to attract trouble.

140
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,730
If you go out with me

141
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,420
and anything happens,

142
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,320
I won't take responsibility.

143
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,660
It's fine. I'm happy to.

144
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,800
Whatever.

145
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,440
Oh, Chubby,

146
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,550
don't wait for me for dinner tomorrow night.

147
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,080
I need to go back to my place.

148
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,560
Alright.

That man is so handsome.

150
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,050
So handsome.

151
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,220
Which color do you like?

152
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,180
That pink one.

153
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,510
The pink one?

154
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,870
Pink really suits you.

155
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,200
Let me put it on you.

156
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,640
It looks great.

157
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,020
Let me try this one.

158
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,220
It looks good on you too.

00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,700
Xixi,

160
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,060
can you check for me

161
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,690
if those two people behind me are looking at me?

162
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,680
Slowly, Xixi. Slowly.

163
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,440
Ms. Qin Fei, I think you're overthinking it.

164
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,930
They don't seem...

165
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,520
to be looking at you.

166
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,870
Then what are they looking at?

167
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,430

He looks so tall.

172

Check out, please.

174
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,360
Okay, ma'am.

may I help you?

182

No.

183
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:12,960
Are we done now?

184
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,790
Yes.

185
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:14,990
Thank you.

186
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,120
Hold this for me.

187
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,650
Put this in the bag, okay?

188
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,080

372
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,300
Hello, Mr. Ren, I'm watching a movie.

373
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,070
Alright, stop watching.

374
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,350
Something's happened with Fei.

375
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,880
Come back now.

376
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,650
Okay, I'll head back right away.

377
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,770
What happened?

378
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,160
Something happened with Fei.

379
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,720
I need to get back quickly.

380
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,670
I'll give you a ride.

381
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,230
Let's go.

382
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,630
Thank you.

383
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:55,200
Excuse me.

384
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:03,480
Silly.

385
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,250
You really like this doll?

386
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,040
Well, it's yours now.

387
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,710
Mine?

388
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,300
Why?

389
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:12,000
Don't tell me, let me guess.

390
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,400
It must be because

391
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,060
I'm Xixi's idea of a unicorn—

392
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,360
pure and dreamy.

393
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,700
Most importantly,

394
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,730
I look just as good as it does.

395
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,020
Ms. Qin, you're not a white horse.

396
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,580
You're a hedgehog princess.

397
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,690
Mr. Xing is the real Prince Charming.

398
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,190
Him?

399
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,780
Prince Charming?

400
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,380
Wait a minute.

401
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,340
If he's Prince Charming,

402
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:39,170
why did you give this to me?

403
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,140
A prince should be with a princess.

404
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,040
Come on, Ms. Qin.

405
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,380
Why haven't you confessed to him yet?

406
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,440
Little rascal, you're making less and less sense.

407
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,070
Don't ask just any questions.

408
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,180
So do you love him or not?

409
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,750
How old are you?

410
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,060
Do you even know what love is?

411
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,170
Love is liking someone

412
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,970
and wanting to see him every day.

413
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:02,340
So do you like this?

414
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,090
Yes.

415
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,300
Do you love it?

416
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,790
But toys aren't people.

417
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,770
It's the same.

418
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,420
Liking isn't loving, and loving isn't just liking.

419
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,410
Overall, both of them are quite complicated

420
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,600
and require a lot of time and energy.

421
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,970
Even if I had the intention,

422
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,740
I don't have the energy to think about these things right now.

423
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,720
So do you not love me anymore?

424
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,600
I love you.

425
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,430
I will always love you.

426
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,930
But this love isn't the same

427
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,510
as what you just mentioned.

428
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,850
Oh, right.

429
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,970
You're just a child.

430
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:39,470
Don't spend your days pondering these things.

431
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,920
I need to talk to you about something serious.

432
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,990
We didn't go to

433
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,260
Dr. Ge Wu's today, so tomorrow…

434
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,700
I'm not listening!

435
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,150
You get angry too easily, Xixi.

436
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,710
Alright.

437
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,210
I'll head out then.

438
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,840
I'll come back later to keep you company, okay?

439
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,770
Silly Xixi.

440
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,120

445
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,190
It's... in my pocket.

446
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,700
Sorry about that.

447
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,830
I'll take the car now. Thanks.

she'll kill me.

479
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,350
You're usually so close with Fei

480

that it feels like you're one person,

481
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,880

482

497
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,840

500
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:11,670
and we bought it for your promotion,

501
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,210
but you refused and aren't happy about it.

502
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:15,160
You even directly closed our laptop.

503
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,490
What were you thinking?

504
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,760
Is this what you like?

505
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,440
When others criticize you,

506
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,550
you feel happy and excited, right?

507
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,540
You told me to speak my mind.

508
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:29,790
I did tell you to speak your mind,

509
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:32,640
but I didn't tell you to insult me indirectly, did I?

510
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,550
Ren Siqi,

511
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,960
I know you want me to turn things around. I get it.

512
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,680
But shouldn't we think about others too?

513
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,030
We can't just push Xing Zhizhi into a trap ahead

514
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:42,070
when we know it's there.

515
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,240
And there's Xixi.

516
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,970
She's there for rehabilitation.

517
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:46,450
If you expose her in the press,

518
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:48,210
won't that be inappropriate?

519
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,980
Think rationally and answer calmly.

00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,010

00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,140
But Qin Fei,

523
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,360
you are an artist,

524
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,880
not a volunteer.

525
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,940
You're concerned about Dr. Xing

526
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,010
and Xixi,

527
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,030
but what about yourself?

528
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,600
What about your career and work?

529
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,300
Do you still want them?

530
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,220
Yes.

531
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,760
But not through this.

532
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,420
You don't have to step back.

533
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,170
I just want to apologize to you.

534
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,860
I really should apologize to you.

535
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,350
Regarding this matter, I've caused you

536
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,350
a lot of trouble from the beginning.

537
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,350
We've known each other for quite a few years now.

538
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,930
Besides our colleague relationship,

539
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:35,650
we could say that we're each other's friends, right?

540
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,170
So now,

541
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,360
as a friend, I want to ask you

542
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,620
to help me.

543
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,440
You've put it that way,

544
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,960
so what else can I say?

545
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,140
Thanks.

546
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,210

552

553
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,080
Just friends.

554
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,830
It doesn't seem like that to me.

555
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:08,430
This Dr. Xing... Well,

556
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,440
I think he's quite handsome.

557
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,710
You've been protecting him all along.

558
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,590
Do you maybe have a bit of a crush on him?

559
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,550
Come on, Ren Siqi,

560
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,680
can you not think about this so superficially?

561
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,920
What do you mean by that? How old are we?

562
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,310
The reason I'm acting like this

563
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,510
is that he's a doctor.

564
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:33,360
I believe he has value and contributes to our society.

565
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,830
If I get him involved in this,

566
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:38,430
I'd be worried that heaven might punish me by shortening my life.

[Something urgent happened, so I won't be coming]

You're back.

573
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,680
How was it? Is everything okay?

574
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,510
Everything is fine.

575
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,860
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

576
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:34,090
Let me heat up the dinner for you.

577
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,500
Eat up.

578
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,060
What about Xixi? How is she doing?

579
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:02,060
She's asleep.

580
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,030
During dinner,

581
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,390
I tried to test the waters.

582
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,990
She still doesn't want to go.

583
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,090
But Xixi's counseling

584
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:13,070
can't be delayed for too long, right?

585
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,240
Right, theoretically.

586
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:17,540
But I actually think

587
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,060
your approach

588
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,610
is worth keeping on trying.

589
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,580
Really?

590
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,050
Slow and steady wins the race.

591
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,890
Did Gu Wu say not to rush it

592
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,750
and put too much pressure on her?

593
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,330
Let her do things that make her happy.

594
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:33,280
That's what I'm good at.

595
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,700
With your approval,

596
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,410
I'll take Xixi, ignoring everything else,

597
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,120
and just focus on having fun.

598
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:40,410
Eat up.

599
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,440
Did your mom come to Huhai?

00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,960
You were planning to go home tonight, weren't you?

601
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,490
How did you know?

602
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,720
Don't tell me you can read fortunes.

603
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:07,300
I guessed it based on the things you bought.

604
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,760
Did something hold you up?

605
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:10,900
Kinda.

606
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:12,720
No, I'm just going with the flow.

607
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,070
Going with the flow.

608
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,090
Some relationships, if left to go with the flow,

609
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,410
may gradually fade away over time.

610
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,360
Dr. Xing,

611
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,360
I'm a pretty clueless person.

612
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,380
Can you just say what's on your mind?

613
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:32,760
Why so serious?

614
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:35,050
I just feel that

615
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,950
wanting to go with the flow

616
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,770
means you have expectations

617
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,170
but are afraid your efforts will be in vain,

618
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:42,070
so you said you're just going with the flow.

619
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:42,880
In fact,

620
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:44,660
it's a form of escapism.

621
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,460
Are you trying to persuade me?

622
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,950
No, I'm just concerned about you.

623
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,510
I didn't expect our Dr. Xing to have the potential

624
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,970
to be the main character in a romantic drama.

625
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,140
Should I introduce you to acting?

626
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:02,510
If I weren't acting,

627
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,260
would you dare to respond to me?

628
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,060
I don't have the luck to be the main character,

629
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,350
nor am I interested.

What do all these mean?

638
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,520
There isn't a single one I can understand.

639
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,710
What exactly is wrong with Xixi?

640
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,680
Xixi said she really likes marathons.

641
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,380
Before, she even made a pact with her dad

642
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,190
to participate

643
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:45,740
in the city's marathon together when she grows up.

644
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,740
But now...

645
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,950
So it's because she loves it too much

646
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,540
that she's afraid?

647
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:54,050
This is also a form of allergy?

this is Qin Fei.

651
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:10,150
I'm sorry to bother you so late.

652
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:13,130
I'd like to ask you some things about Xixi.

653
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:18,090
What is psychological allergy?

654
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,850
And what is systematic desensitization?

655
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:23,390
I think it might be very helpful for Xixi.

656
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:40,740
The fried eggs are ready.

657
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,290
Xixi.

658
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,050
You should eat it fully cooked.

Qin Fei,

660
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,640
do you prefer your fried eggs

661
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,410
fully cooked or runny?

662
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,110
Me? I don't mind.

663
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:56,030
You're all about "I don't mind," or "going with the flow."

664
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,510
Come on.

665
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,390
What are you mumbling about?

666
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,670
Nothing.

667
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:05,430
About what I said last night,

668
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,510
I was just kidding.

669
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,410
Don't take it to heart.

670
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,180
What?

671
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,130
Nothing. Let's eat.

00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:17,550
If anyone can book the venue

00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,070
please contact me ASAP.

Thank you.

676
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,960
I forwarded this right away.

677
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:36,250
It's really hard to book the venue there.

678
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:46,290
Ms. Qin,

679
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:49,990
are we going to the park for a picnic today?

680
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,980
Yes, the picnic.

681
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:54,470
I remember.

682
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,880
Hello, Qin Fei,

683
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,100
this is Liu Yanze.

684
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,120
I checked for you,

685
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,610
and there's a day available.

686
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:11,340
You can go check it out anytime.

687
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:15,340
That's great, Captain Liu.

688
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,870
I'm available anytime.

689
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,180
Where are you? Where are we meeting?

690
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:19,950
Liu Yanze?

691
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,860
When did you add Liu Yanze on WeChat?

692
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,130
I added him when we were in Linkang County.

693
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:26,000
Xixi, I'm sorry.

694
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,490
I have something come up today,

695
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,930
so I can't go camping with you.

696
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,560
Ask Mr. Xing to go with you.

697
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:32,960
I'm sorry.

698
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:34,520
I'll make it up to you later.

699
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,940
It's okay, I'll go with you.

700
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,960
This way, Ms. Qin.

701
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,110
This is our theater,

702
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,920
which can accommodate four hundred audience members.

703
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,960
The rental fee is this amount.

704
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,050
So expensive?

705
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:58,900
Fei, are you spending so much money

706
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:00,530
to rent this venue to make a comeback?

707
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:01,720
Keep your voice down.

708
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,880
You have no idea how hard it is to book this venue.

709
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,980
It's already good enough that we can sort it out with money.

710
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,690
Ms. Qin, you know the business.

711
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:08,880
You're a friend of Captain Liu,

712
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,820
so that makes you my friend too.

713
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,870
I've known Captain Liu for many years.

714
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:12,650
When there was a fire here before,

715
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:14,690
Captain Liu saved many people.

716
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,400
So for that reason,

717
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,570
we'll rent this venue to you today, no matter what.

718
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:19,210
Really?

719
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,080
However, regarding the rental fee for this venue,

720
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,650
our company needs to...

721
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,760
That's fine.

722
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,490
Okay.

723
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,960
Then take a look around, and I'll prepare the contract.

724
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,110
Okay. Thank you.

725
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,410
Where are we going to get so much money?

726
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,440
You've already lost so much money.

727
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,420
With no job and no income,

728
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:42,390
how are you going to get so much money?

729
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:44,870
Do you have to be so specific?

730
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,440
Xixi.

731
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,440
How's your painting? Let me take a look.

732
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,230
Here.

733
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,160
Here, have some water first.

734
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,810
Here.

735
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,250
Xixi,

736
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,670
isn't this lying?

737
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,280
Ms. Qin Fei is clearly not here.

738
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,800
Why is she in the painting?

739
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,170
Just this once, please.

740
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,940
Ms. Qin used to be around every time.

741
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,380
Is everything in your painting real?

742
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,780
If you don't believe me, look.

743
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,820
Let me see.

744
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:23,810
This is Ms. Qin buying food for us in the county town.

745
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,730
[Mid-Autumn Festival Gala]

746
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:26,430
This is Ms. Qin singing for us
[Mid-Autumn Festival Gala]

747
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,070
This is Ms. Qin singing for us

748
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,930
at the Mid-Autumn Festival Gala.

749
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:33,000
This is when I met Ms. Qin at the hospital

750
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,680
when I first came to Huhai.

751
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:38,430
And this is Ms. Qin taking me to the supermarket.

752
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,290
Do you like them, Mr. Xing?

753
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,410
I do.

754
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:44,790
Do you like the paintings or Ms. Qin?

755
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:53,110
Xixi, I think

756
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,280
you really paint well.

757
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,810
And you have a gift for that.

758
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:57,030
But I have a question.

759
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,170
Look. You painted this Miss Hedgehog

760
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,680
so beautifully,

761
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,240
but this Prince Charming...

762
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,480
How is this anything like a prince?

763
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,500
You didn't even bother to give him clothes.

764
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,460
It's just too ugly.

765
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:09,070
Maybe it's because I, like you,

766
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,590
really like Ms. Qin.

767
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,770
That's true.

768
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:16,510
Xixi,

769
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:19,380
since you like Miss Hedgehog so much,

770
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:21,490
why do you refuse to listen to her

771
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,050
and go for rehabilitation?

772
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,690
Because she is too nice.

773
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,570
She surely doesn't understand that some things,

774
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:34,450
no matter how hard you try, you just can't do well.

775
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,230
Are you talking about rehabilitation?

776
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,840
Xixi,

777
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,020
but I feel like

778
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,770
what you said isn't entirely correct.

779
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,100
Everyone has things they can't achieve,

780
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,990
but we can still try our best.

781
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,490
Ms. Qin Fei also has her difficulties.

782
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,870
She doesn't want everyone to see them,

783
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:57,790
so she's always smiling.

784
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,570
Why doesn't she want us to see?

785
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:04,390
Because she's afraid we won't understand.

786
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:08,290
Alright.

787
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:10,050
Let's not talk about this anymore.

788
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:10,820
Xixi,

789
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:11,870
let's go over there and take a look.

790
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:12,940
Okay.

791
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,000
Captain Liu,

792
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:18,150
thank you.

793
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:18,920
It's nothing.

794
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,030
I'll be going then.

795
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:21,030
Bye.

796
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:21,770
Bye.

797
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:29,210
Fei, are you still thinking about the venue rental fee?

798
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,690
You spent so much money for a dance.

799
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:33,340
Who are you going to dance for?

800
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:34,740
For you.

801
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:36,710
Come on. Can you stop asking?

802
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:38,360
Why are you so curious?

803
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,920
Actually, as long as you ask,

804
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:44,200
Mr. Ren will surely agree.

805
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:45,610
And this money is yours.

806
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,150
It's just temporarily in the studio account.

807
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:50,210
How could he possibly refuse to sign?

808
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:51,950
Ke Feifei,

809
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:55,220
I found you can be quite persuasive behind the scenes.

810
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:57,360
Is this your first day knowing Ren Siqi?

811
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,650
He holds grudges.

812
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,610
The photo incident just happened.

813
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:03,190
Asking him for money right now

814
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,770
won't end well.

815
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,850
It would be tricky.

816
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:10,510
I just wanted to comfort you.

817
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:17,260
Here.

818
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:32,060
It's so beautiful.

819
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:33,510
I really like it here.

820
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:35,440
Mr. Xing, thank you for bringing me here.

821
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,160
Next time,

822
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,480
I'll make sure to paint Prince Charming super handsome,

823
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,520
and I'll make Miss Hedgehog just a tiny bit ugly

824
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,940
to make Prince Charming look even better.

825
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:42,610
How about that?

826
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:43,300
Xixi,

827
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,550
you should make Miss Hedgehog look good too

828
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:47,240
so that they'll match, you know?

829
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,230
You admitted it, didn't you?

830
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:49,760
You also want to be a good match for Ms. Qin.

831
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,880
No, no. That's not what I meant.

832
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:51,750
I mean

833
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,710
that Miss Hedgehog and Prince Charming should match,

834
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:54,450
not that I want to match...

835
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:55,300
I...

836
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:56,850
This kid...

837
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:01,540
What's wrong?

838
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:04,750
Your Qin Fei is in trouble.

839
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,860
What's going on?
