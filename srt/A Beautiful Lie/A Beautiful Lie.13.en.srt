00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,160
that's when your acting is the worst.

183
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,800
Alright,

184
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,580
are you trying to make me cry?

185
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,670
Also, if something's bothering you,

186
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,720
don't carry it alone.

187
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,500
When the sky falls, there's always someone taller to hold it up.

188
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,860
You still have me, and you have him.

189
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,890
Whatever is weighing on you,

190
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,610
you need to say it out loud; don't bottle it up inside.

191
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:17,760
Ms. Qin Fei,

192
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,570
my father used to tell me:

193
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,420
Don't be so afraid of not placing in a competition

194
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,180
that you don't even have the courage to compete.

195
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,700
And you,

196
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,820
you're the one who told me not to run away when things get tough—

197
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,330
to face challenges head-on.

198
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,590
But what happened?

199
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,170
You fed me all that motivational talk,

200
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,500
but you can't even follow your own advice.

201
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,830
Ms. Qin Fei,

202
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,610
I'm not scared anymore.

203
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,200
After everything you and Mr. Xing did for me,

204
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,460
I'm going to work hard.

205
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,960
I'll get better.

206
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,030
This brave heart;

207
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,200
I'll give it to you.

208
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:55,940
Remember,

209
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,160
you have to miss me!

210
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,920
I'll miss you too.

211
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,630
I won't miss you.

212
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:02,630
If you don't miss me,

213
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,940
I won't tell you my little secret.

214
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,120
What secret could you possibly have?

215
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,400
I don't even want to hear it.

216
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,250
Not even Xing Zhizhi's secret?

217
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,000
Alright, tell me then.

218
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,970
What were you two talking about?

219
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,860
Just park the car by the roadside.

220
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,050
You didn't say a word the whole way.

221
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,660
What did Xixi say to you?

222
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,120
Xixi told me a secret,

223
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,570
and it's about you.

224
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,520
Mr. Xing went to learn acupuncture from an old master

225
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,870
just to help with your old injury.

226
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,450
He even practiced on himself in secret,

227
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,790
leaving his arms full of needle marks.

228
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,190
So don't avoid him anymore.

229
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,090
He really does care about you.

230
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,830
It's fine.

231
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,880
But please stop doing these pointless things,

232
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,280
and don't be so good to me.

233
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,200
There's no future for us.

234
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,680
Qin Xiaofei,

235
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,130
sometimes I feel really confused.

236
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,830
I feel like there's something between us,

237
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,400
but why when every time

238
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,750
I try to take a step forward,

239
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,870
you take a step back?

240
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,140
Why?

241
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,580
You always say I don't understand what you're saying,

242
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,710
but do you understand what I'm saying?

243
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,390
Qin Xiaofei,

244
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,940
I like you.

245
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,250
Can you tell me

246
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,550
what I need to do

247
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,460
for you to open up to me?

248
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,340
Xixi said she likes me too.

249
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,670
She said she'd send me WeChat messages

250
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,920
and call me every day.

251
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,100
I like Xixi too.

252
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,850
That's why every time I see something nice, I want to buy it for her.

253
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,370
But you know what?

254
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,100
In less than three months,

255
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,620
she'll start contacting me less and less.

256
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,090
She'll meet new friends,

257
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,450
just like when she first met me.

258
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,850
I'll gradually become

259
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,540
insignificant in her life.

260
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,550
And one day,

261
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,110
this precious connection

262
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,390
will turn into a burden.

263
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,420
Why do you think that way? It won't happen.

264
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,450
Won't it?

265
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,070
For me, it's always been the same—

266
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,180
family, friendship, they all end up like this.

267
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,970
Why should love be any different?

268
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,170
Xing Zhizhi,

269
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,090
there's nothing

270
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,070
in this world that doesn't change.

271
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,970
Nothing can withstand the passage of time.

272
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,600
Time is like plain water—

273
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,410
it dilutes every color in life

274
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,920
until it fades away.

275
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,400
No matter how profound something seems,

276
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,740
it will eventually be forgotten.

277
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,960
One day, you'll look back on what you're doing now

278
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,160
and realize how meaningless it all was.

279
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,370
Are you really so afraid of loss?

280
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,690
Afraid of the unknown future,

281
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,970
so much so

282
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,210
that you won't even take the first step?

283
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,390
Yes.

284
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,310
Why can't I be?

285
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,640
You can.

286
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,590
And honestly, hearing you say that makes me happy.

287
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,320
At least I know

288
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,030
you're afraid of losing me.

289
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,660

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,120

Dr. Xing.

345
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,240
What's wrong?

346
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,160
Are you in a bad mood?

347
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,090
No, I'm fine.

348
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,900
Lying is bad, you know.

349
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,400
You taught me that.

350
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,950
Was it the person on the phone last time?

351
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,220
She sounded pretty mean then too.

352
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,750
Did she get mad at you again?

353
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,850
Maybe I just oversimplified things.

354
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,930
Didn't you say before

355
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,700
it's like having a box of chocolates with different flavors?

356
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,200
Just think of this one

357
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,690
as a spicy chili flavor.

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,590
If you can't hold on any longer,

545
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,070
leave with the medical staff.

546
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,330
This match will be considered a forfeit.

547
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:08,150
I still want to hold on.

548
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,640
Are you sure? Don't push yourself.

549
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,500
I'm sure.

550
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,860
Try standing up and see how it feels.

Come on, I'll help you up.

It's okay.

you really shouldn't be doing any strenuous activities with your back.

You've helped me time and again

without asking for anything in return. Why?

666
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,600
Because you're good-looking.

Okay?

670
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:45,110
I've been thinking while I was in the hospital these past few days.

671
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,800
What have I done

672
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,250
to deserve having a superstar like you,

673
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:50,310
a literal goddess, watching over me?

674
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:51,540
Then I figured it out.

675
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,260
Maybe it's got something to do

676
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,430
with the person

677
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,430

The person you can't seem to let go of—

680
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,480
it's him, right?

681
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,600
Keep going. What else did you figure out?

682
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:09,970
I also realized something else.

683
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,450
The reason you went on that reality show and helped me out…

684
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:12,880
It must all be because of him.

685
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,860
You don't seem like you're secretly in love.

686
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,250
And it doesn't feel like you're in a secret relationship either.

687
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,250
So, he must be

688
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,620
an ex.

689
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:24,050
Don't look at me like that. You're scaring me!

What are you thinking?

691
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,870
I'm thinking...

692
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,950
How long have you been in the hospital?

693
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:28,790
Three days.

694
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,900
If you stay idle for a week,

695
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,090
you're probably going to

696
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:33,810
dig up all of my history with him.

697
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:35,310
You're quite honest, aren't you?

698
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:37,310
You are not going to hide it anymore?

699
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,430
Qin Fei,

700
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,090
I'll apologize first.

701
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,550
When I first approached you,

702
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,740
I had some ulterior motives.

703
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:47,910
But after that, I really didn't.

704
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,850
I truly grew to like your personality.

705
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:51,920
And I genuinely

706
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,610
wanted to be friends with you.

707
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,340
I believe you.

708
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:57,330
When it comes to charm, I, Qin Fei,

709
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,490
haven't lost to anyone

710
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,970
—except you.

711
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,580
You're so full of yourself.

712
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,060
Alright, just spill it.

713
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,600
What's really going on?

714
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,950
It's been five years since the breakup.

715
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:09,360
It's all ancient history.

716
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,630
It's not something pleasant to talk about.

717
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:13,400
You still haven't moved on after five years?

718
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,020
Maybe because

719
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:21,820
I was the one who got dumped.

720
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,280
Am I hearing this right?

721
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:26,070
You—our big movie star—got dumped?

722
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,810
You heard it right.

723
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:32,770
I was indeed dumped by him.

724
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,080
Why are you here?

725
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,300

727
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,660
Pretty amazing, huh?

728
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:45,750
Congratulations.

729
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,710
How many days off do you have this time?

730
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,550
I was thinking of

731
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,090
clearing my schedule

732
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,570
and taking you to Sanya

733
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,510
to celebrate.

734
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,330
There's a new Atlantis resort there that just opened...

735
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:56,620
I'm leaving soon.

736
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,180
What's wrong?

737
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,780
Is it because of the rumors about Chen Xu and me?

738
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:07,340
You really believe all that nonsense?

739
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:09,630
Actually, I've been meaning to tell you…

740
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,490
We should break up.

741
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,630
At first, I thought he wanted to break up

742
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,590
because of the rumors about me and Chen Xu.

743
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:27,510
I figured I'd wait for him to calm down, and then we could talk.

744
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,620
But when I went to find him again,

745
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,400
he had already deleted

746
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,070
all my contact information.

747
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,950
I went to his workplace,

748
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,270
and his boss told me he'd left the job.

749
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:41,040
No one could get in touch with him.

750
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,170
He vanished,

751
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,270
just like that.

752
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:51,370
Your situation isn't that complicated.

753
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,450
Do you still love him?

754
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:53,450
I do.

755
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,420
But I also hate him.

756
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,110
Then it's even simpler.

757
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,610
Here's what you should do—

758
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,470
go find him and get back together.

759
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,360
It doesn't matter.

760
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,400
In the grand scheme of things,

761
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,310
nothing is more important than your own happiness.

762
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:06,930
Love or hate, you'll eventually get an answer.

763
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:07,710
Worst case?

764
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,090
He breaks up with you again.

765
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:11,350
It's not like it hasn't happened before.

766
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:14,880
You're really good at this advice-giving. But what about you?

767
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,540
If you like someone, why don't you just go for it?

768
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:21,170
I'm not like you.

769
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,070
My relationships never last.

770
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,110
I know what you've got.

771
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,800
It's called avoidant attachment.

772
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:32,670
The more you like someone, the more you avoid them.

773
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:35,740
Alright then,

774
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,540
I'm throwing caution to the wind.

775
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,690
I'll accompany you.

776
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,910
I'll go after Liu Yanze,

777
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,390
and you—you go settle things with Xing Zhizhi.

778
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,710
Let's make a bet—whoever wins them over first.

779
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,590
What do you say?

780
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,230
No way.

781
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,150
I don't have the guts to face him.

782
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:51,460
I said some pretty harsh things to him the other day.

783
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,870
And yet, you two

784
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,030
are still ambiguously "friends"?

785
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,070
You've got the guts for that?

786
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:55,550
Let me tell you,

787
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,750
you two can't be just friends.

788
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:59,470
Let's not dwell on this anymore.

789
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,450
I've already put myself out there.

790
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:02,780
You're Qin Fei. What are you afraid of?

791
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,320
You're right.

792
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,950
I think you're right.

793
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,370
We shouldn't call it quits

794
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:13,240
before we've even tried.

795
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,150
It's unfair to both of us.

796
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:16,200
In my life, I, Qin Fei,

797
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,860
should be brave at least once.

798
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,350
So, let's both go for it!

799
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,870
We'll fight for our love.

800
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,300
We'll win them over,

801
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:23,700
together!

[Mic on] [Speaker on] [Camera on]

803
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:48,370
See? I told you I wasn't lying.

804
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,230
Aren't I walking much steadier now?

805
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:52,500
But… I still feel like…

806
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:53,960
Let me watch you walk another round.

807
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,960
Go to that spot over there—

808
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,720
right behind you on the right.

809
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:57,890
Ms. Qin, you've made me

810
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:00,020
walk in circles five or six times already.

811
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,120
If you want to see Mr. Xing,

812
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,410
why don't you call him yourself?

813
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,900
Did he block you?

814
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:06,880
You can't call him?

815
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,890
Did he dare to?

816
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,550
But since he came here,

817
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,590
he hasn't mentioned you at all.

818
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:14,560
Why are you so concerned about him?

819
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,610
You miss him?

820
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:19,150
Stop with the nonsense.

821
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,440
Mr. Xing,

822
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:23,440
Ms. Qin Fei said she misses you!

823
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,200

00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:25,860

[Xing Zhizhi] [Qin Fei]

830
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,960
you shouldn't be chatting with such boring people

Xing Zhizhi, you're really funny.

835
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,490
Who's boring or immature here, huh?

836
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:41,890
Fei,

837
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,940
it's not a good start.

838
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:46,220
It only took me a few minutes to make a phone call.

839
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,190
What do you mean by "start"?

840
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,720
I haven't even started yet.

841
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,630
Xiaofei.

842
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,990
What are you up to now?

843
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,470
Eating grass all alone in the bushes?

844
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:00,150
Do you think you're humorous?

845
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,440
You were on that phone call for quite a while.

846
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,640
What's this? Are you catching feelings?

847
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,590
You sure do stick your nose in a lot of business, huh?

848
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,050
Did you even figure out my schedule for this month?

849
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:09,970
You're just drifting around,

850
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:11,300
drifting, drifting...

851
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,060
Seems like she really is catching feelings.

854
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,800
Mr. Liu,

855
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,860
I'm sorry.

856
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:39,300
The restaurant's fully booked today.

00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,360
Your birthday cake will be packed

858
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,010
and sent to you shortly.

859
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,870
We apologize for the inconvenience. Thank you for your understanding.

860
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:44,750
Alright.

861
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:50,480
Welcome.

862
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,890
Mr. Chen, please come in.

863
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,880
I have to ask, Xiaoxiao,

864
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,590
why do you always pick this place

865
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,050
for your birthday every year?

866
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,080
No flair at all.

867
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:09,200
Why are you always so annoying every year?

868
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:10,710
I didn't beg you to come.

869
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:14,630
I'm not saying this for no reason.

870
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:17,690
Why do you always throw yourself into hopeless causes?

871
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:20,300
I won't even get started on Liu Yanze.

872
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,530
Now there's Qin Fei.

873
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:24,200
What about Qin Fei?

874
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,160
It's not about the issues between us from the past.

875
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:28,920
But why are you insisting on

876
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,820
casting her as the second lead in your new drama?

877
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,080
It's just not realistic.

878
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,540
The production company won't agree either.

879
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:36,900
Others might not be able to get this done.

880
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,630
But you, Mr. Chen, are different.

881
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,920
Just give it a try.

882
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,840
I really think

883
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,150
she's perfect for this role.

884
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,500
She can pull it off.

885
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:45,530
I guarantee it.

What good is your guarantee?

887
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,650
Just give it a shot. Talk to them.

00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,580

889
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,740
Instructor Liu is also here for dinner?

890
