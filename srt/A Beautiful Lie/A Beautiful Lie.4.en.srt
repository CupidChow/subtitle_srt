I still need to see you in 3 days?

193
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,570
Why should I come if you're so reluctant?

194
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,510
You don't have to come to me.

195
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,020
Just let it stink.

196
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,320
Doctor,

197
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,530
I think you need to improve your skills.

198
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,850
Open your hand.

199
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:34,910
Done.

200
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,120
Fei,

201
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,750
how are you?

202
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,360
What happened to your hand?

203
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,940
Drink some water, drink up.

204
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,160
You scared me to death.

205
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,690
Can you please let me know before you go out next time?

206
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,450
Your life is my career.

207
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,790
Don't end it so easily.

208
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,740
I get it.

209
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,940
What's wrong with Xing Zhizhi?

210
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,370
He has a short temper.

211
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,280
He just got mad and left without a word.

212
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,990
He was probably worried about you.

213
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,320
As soon as he heard you weren't back,

214
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,590
he immediately

215
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,060
rushed out to find you.

216
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,650
Really?

217
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,610
Be gentle.

218
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,910
It hurts?

219
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,170
Tell me what happened.

220
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,630
How did you suddenly show up?

221
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,490
Our rescue team

222
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,240
was training in the neighboring county.

223
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,660
We just heard about the sudden landslide in Linkang County.

224
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,870
So I rushed over to see

225
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,610
if there was anything I could help with.

226
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,080
That foreigner

227
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,810
is also from your Xiaoyun Rescue Team?

228
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,230
No, he's not.

229
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,200
Seems like he's some kind of

230
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,150
big social media influencer.

231
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,200
A news guy.

232
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,340
He was just going the same way,

233
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,680
so I brought him along.

234
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,160
How is he?

235
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:52,640
He's fine,

236
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,670
but he hasn't woken up yet.

237
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:54,690
You handled it well.

238
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,520
Of course.

239
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,680
I learned it all from you.

240
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,360
Alright, let's not talk about him.

241
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,550
Let's talk about you.

242
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,380
Well, good for you.

243
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,840
It's only been a few days since I last saw you,

244
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,360
and you're already taking advantage of the situation.

245
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,510
If I hadn't shown up in time,

246
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,840
I wouldn't have known you'd gotten close to someone already.

247
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,270
What are you talking about?

248
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,130
Don't play dumb with me.

249
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,110
You two.

250
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,230
What's between you?

251
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,660
Who?

252
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,870
What do you mean?

253
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,460
She doesn't know?

254
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:25,400
Yes.

255
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,570
She still doesn't know?

256
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,960
Well, that makes sense.

257
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,150
You guys haven't seen each other in years.

258
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,290
Zhizhi,

259
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,880
why don't you just tell her directly?

260
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,220
Are you crazy?

261
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,170
How am I supposed to say that?

262
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,270
I am crazy.

263
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,860
If you think this is

264
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,300
just friendship,

265
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,720
then just say it openly.

266
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,670
The fact that you're not saying anything now

267
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,460
means you have something to hide.

268
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,370
-Iâ€¦
-Your problem is here.

269
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,070
You...

270
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:52,890
Let me tell you,

271
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,060
now you should...

272
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,160
I'm coming in.

273
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,120
Why are you here?

274
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,700
Your lunch.

275
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,390
Xing Zhizhi.

276
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:10,020
I need to talk to you.

277
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,440
Can you come out with me for a moment?

278
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,180
Now?

279
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,770
When else?

280
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,640
How about tomorrow?

281
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,640
Would the day after tomorrow work?

282
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,500
Why don't you dare to look at me?

283
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,100
Fei, you got my leg.

284
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:33,870
I'm sorry.

285
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:35,920
Let me

286
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,660
reintroduce

287
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:37,980
myself to you.

288
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,240
I'm Liu Yanze.

289
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,980
I do security work,

290
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,690
and my side job is

291
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,550
working at the Xiaoyun Rescue Team.

292
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,100
I'm good friends with Xing Zhizhi.

293
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,560
Xiaoyun Rescue Team?

294
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,630
Yes.

295
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:49,560
No wonder you're so tough.

296
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,880
Liu Yanze.

297
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,280
Why does this name sound so familiar?

298
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,360
[Qin Fei's Fan Club]

299
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,400
This is...

300
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,940
It's a gift from Liu Yanze.

301
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,430
You...

302
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,580
You're my fan!

303
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,940
You really know how to rescue people.

304
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:13,990
Fan?

305
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,990
I-I'm not your fan.

306
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,780
I'm a fan of Luo Xiaoxiao.

307
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,410
Xing Zhizhi told me you were my fan.

308
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,580
Let's talk outside, let's talk outside.

309
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,600
Don't tell me you've become a hater.

310
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,150
-Bye.
-Or did you

311
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,650
unfollow me?

312
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,980
Xing Zhizhi.

313
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,310
If Liu Yanze isn't my fan,

314
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,320
then which of your friends is my fan?

315
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,530
Normally speaking,

316
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,800
the friend you mentioned

317
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,790
is you.

318
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,640
You're my fan?

319
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,160
I'm not.

320
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,110
He's my fan,

321
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,940
but he won't admit it.

322
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,840
His name is Xing...

323
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,640
Don't shout! Don't shout!

324
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,070
Yes, don't shout.

325
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,650
How should I put this...

326
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,930
I'm kind of a fan,

327
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,430
but not entirely just a fan.

328
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,510
D-Do you understand?

329
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,470
I don't understand.

330
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,020
That sounds like being my fan.

331
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:01,920
What?

332
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,720
Are you afraid that the herd will know?

333
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,870
Well, you're only hearing half of what I'm saying.

334
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,480
You've saved me multiple times

335
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,870
and even shielded me from the rain,

336
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,320
because you've admired me for a long time?

337
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:14,890
I admire you?

338
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,270
Then why were you mad when I got hurt?

339
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,020
Why do you care?

340
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,930
Don't act cute with me.

341
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:37,920
Fei!

342
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,980
The French guy has woken up.

343
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,680
He says he might be HIV-positive.

344
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,290
Xing Zhizhi.

345
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,520
Am I going to get infected?

346
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,050
Don't jump to conclusions.

347
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,230
First, if you have an open wound,

348
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,650
contact with an HIV-positive person

349
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,930
does carry some risk.

350
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:12,610
However,

351
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,640
the actual chance of getting infected is really low.

352
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,420
Healthcare workers

353
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,370
who get pricked by a needle contaminated with HIV

354
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,660
only have a 0.33% chance of infection.

355
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,330
If it's just mucous membrane exposure,

356
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,840
the chance is 0.09%.

357
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,480
Can you stop with the technical stuff?

358
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,980
I don't understand a word of it.

359
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:28,740
Just tell me my chances of getting infected.

360
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,520
About one in a thousand.

361
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,940
One in a thousand.

362
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,680
One in...

363
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:36,620
One in a thousand.

364
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,070
And what's most important now is that

365
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:40,460
the foreigner

366
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,270
hasn't even been confirmed to have HIV yet.

367
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,360
It's just a suspicion.

368
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,220
The signal here is poor,

369
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,680
and the retest results aren't back yet.

370
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,070
If the retest results are negative,

371
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,390
then you'll be completely fine.

372
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,420
Don't worry.

373
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,250
You're right.

374
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,290
I can't be so unlucky, right?

375
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:00,110
Your gamma knife hasn't arrived yet.

376
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,930
So your donor shouldn't be leaving first.

377
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,670
Even if I become a ghost...

378
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,700
