Vitamins.

Here.

Give me one too.

7
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,780
You can't eat them.

00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,150
Why are you being so stingy today?

00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,370
Come on, just one!

10
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,180
No, really. You can't eat them. You'll gain weight.

Xing Zhizhi,

12
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,570
you think I don't have common sense?

13

Since when do vitamins make you gain weight?

14
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,900
Anyway, you can't have them.

15
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,250
These vitamins

16

Wow, Xing Zhizhi. Didn't expect this from you.

That's really not cool.

No, I'm fine.

Ever since Li Changjiang's surgery,

Don't you think

And don't you think something's... strange?

What do you mean?

106
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,760
It's been months,

and he hasn't explained anything.

108

110
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,900
Think about it—

111
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,780
Dr. Xing just came back to the cardiothoracic department,

112
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,870
pulled off an extremely difficult surgery,

113

and his career is about to take off.

114
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,420
Taking leave now?

115
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,360
That must be due to some unavoidable reason.

116
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,200
His career's fine, right?

117
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,890
So it must be family-related.

He and Qin Fei are doing great.

119
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,260
And just recently, Qin Fei

120
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,190
publicly announced she wasn't renewing her contract

121
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,770
and isn't taking on new roles.

122
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,190
It's like she doesn't plan to show up in the spotlight again.

123

125
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,030
That can't be possible, can it?

126
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,080
It's possible.

127
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,450
It must be.

128
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,620
If you look at the timing,

129
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,720

meet the parents,

132
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,200
throw a wedding.

143
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,190
Not bad.

144
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:35,940
Pretty good.

145
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:38,780
How is it?

146
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,300
Isn't it a lot more freeing since you left the industry?

147
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,800
Yeah, I feel like before,

148
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,550
someone was always watching my every move.

149
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,430
Now,

150
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,770
I'm completely relaxed.

151
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,260
What about Xing Zhizhi?

152
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,820
Is anyone affecting his life?

153
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,420
Why would anyone bother him?

154
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,190
Do you know what people are saying online

155
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,740
about you quitting the industry?

156
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,620
No idea.

157
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,330
But I can take a guess.

158
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,610
They're probably saying

159
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,670
I sacrificed everything for my dreams,

160
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,220
or that I know how to let things go,

161
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,130
that I've moved on

162
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,430
without a care in the world.

163
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,950
Not that flattering.

164
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,100
So what are they saying?

165
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,250
Right now, they're calling you

166
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,170
a love-struck fool, brainwashed by Xing Zhizhi.

167
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,400
They say high-IQ types like him

168
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,480
are the best at brainwashing people.

169
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,150
You better keep an eye on him—

170
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,960
there are a lot of people curious about him now.

171
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,890
It could really mess with his life.

172
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:34,970
There's another rumor.

173
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,920
What is it?

174
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,370
They're saying Ms. Qin Fei is pregnant,

175
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:43,180
which is why you quit the industry so suddenly.

176
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,850
Honestly, isn't that great though?

177
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,410
Leaving the industry this way makes me feel even less burdened.

178
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,450
Let me know first if you do get pregnant, okay?

179
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,790
[Coffee]

180
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,430
Fei, are you pregnant?

181
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,600
How far along are you? Is it a boy or a girl?

182
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,510
So that's why

183
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,050
you rushed to leave the industry.

184
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,720

185
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,100
When's the wedding?

186
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,770
Can you pull it off by the end of the year?

187
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,070
Oh, and can I be a bridesmaid?

00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,160
But

376
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,540
for this trip...

377
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,160
I'm planning to go alone.

378
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,570
From a professional perspective,

379
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,000
I don't recommend you take this risk alone.

380
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:02,710
But since you have a clear sense of self-awareness now,

381
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,900
maybe a change of the environment

382
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,250
could be good for you.

383
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,880
In any case,

384
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,210
no matter what happens,

385
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,580
you must tell me.

386
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,130
Thank you.

387
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:52,780
Are you

388
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,520
packing again?

389
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,850
Your hand seems fine.

390
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,010
We should go in the next couple of days.

391
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:00,300
Xiaofei,

392
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,550
I might not be able to

393
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,550
go to Sanya with you to see the ocean.

394
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,460
The hospital...

395
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,900
They want me to go to Australia

396
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,860
in a couple of days for an exchange program.

397
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,950
So suddenly?

398
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,370
How long will you be gone?

399
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,220
Two months.

400
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,140
Two months?

401
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,280
Isn't there anyone else in your department?

402
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,850
I don't want to be apart from you for that long.

403
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,310
Yeah,

404
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,480
the exchange was supposed to be

405
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,450
for Song Ningyu from Thoracic Surgery.

406
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,810
But his wife had a premature delivery,

407
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,330
so he can't go.

408
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,340
The hospital arranged for me instead.

409
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,720
They said since I just got back to Thoracic,

410
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,020
they want me to make a good impression.

411
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,380
I really have no choice.

412
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,890
Alright then.

413
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,110
Looks like the universe

414
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:45,710
is telling me to focus on studying for the college entrance exam.

415
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,670
But Australia is so far away.

416
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,150
That's in the Southern Hemisphere, right?

417
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,310
What's the latitude?

418
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,800
What's the climate like there?

419
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,910
It's probably a continental monsoon climate, right?

420
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,040
Let me check.

421
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,680
I'm worried it'll be too cold for you.

422
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,600
About me pretending to go to Australia,

423
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,370
don't tell anyone,

424
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,730
especially not Coffee.

425
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,130
Got it.

426
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,060
But have you decided where you're really going?

427
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:22,910
Not yet.

428
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,050
Xing,

429
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,870
are you sure everything's okay?

430
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,600
If you're hiding something from me,

431
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,160
I won't keep it secret.

432
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:33,960
If you want me

433
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,400
to stay in Thoracic,

434
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,330
you'd better keep your mouth shut.

435
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,410
I won't say a word, I swear.

436
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,210
How did you know I was back?

437
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,640
You even came down to meet me.

438
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,160
I'm not here to meet you.

439
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,940
Fei, how are you?

440
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,930
Nice to see you.

441
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,420
Who is this?

442
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,570
This is Frank.

443
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,990
His Chinese name is Fu Erkang.

444
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,600
He's my English tutor.

445
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,270
-Hey, bro...
-I...

446
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,520
We don't greet people like this here.

447
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,970
You should start your lesson.

448
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:14,890
Come with me.

449
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:15,920
Okay.

450
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,000
You're ignoring me now?

451
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,930
What about me?

452
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,360
To buy

453
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,620
-a few...
-Eggs.

454
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,260
A few eggs. Right.

455
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,080
A few.

456
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,170
If we want to compliment

457
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:33,320
someone's looks,

458
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:36,080
we usually think of the word "beautiful," right?

459
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,200
But in English,

460
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,110
there are many other ways to express it.

461
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,070
For example,

462
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,370
you are very easy on the eyes.

463
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,080
It means you are pleasant to look at.

464
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,350
And also,

465
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,310
You take

466
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:53,110
my breath away.

467
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:56,010
Focus on the pronunciation and intonation.

468
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,730
You take my breath away.

469
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:02,970
You take my breath away.

470
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,270
Very good.

471
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,880
Here's another one.

472
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:08,530
You're drop-dead gorgeous.

473
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:11,270
You're drop-dead gorgeous.

474
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,300
Good.

475
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,970
Drop-dead gorgeous.

476
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:19,650
By the way,

477
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:20,840
I want to ask,

478
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,910
if I want to compliment a guy,

479
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,640
someone like you, a muscular type,

480
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,880
how should I say it?

481
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,100
You can say,

482
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,840
he's a hunk.

483
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,970
He's a hunk.

484
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,090
Meaning he's strong and sexy.

485
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:35,830
Here.

486
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,310
Drink something to soothe your throat.

487
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,470
Thank you very much.

488
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,160
The restroom's over there, that way.

489
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,590
First door on your left.

490
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,160
Yes, yes, yes.

491
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,400
The door is open.

492
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,130
What did you give him to drink that made him react like that?

493
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,500
Ban sha herbal tea.

494
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,420
My colleague brought it back from Guangdong.

495
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,550
It's good for reducing internal heat.

496
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,480
I'm so sorry.

497
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,420
This is Chinese herbal tea.

498
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,520
It might be a bit bitter.

499
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,860
I cannot adapt to it at once.

500
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,320
Okay.

501
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,610
It's about time.

502
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,740
That's it for today's lesson.

503
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:26,730
Okay.

504
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,620
I'll see you out.

505
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,040
Take care. Come again.

506
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:37,910
This way.

507
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,070
Look at that, our Dr. Xing is getting jealous.

508
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,000
How cute!

509
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,370
I'm not jealous.

510
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,370
I'm very generous.

511
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,800
Is he

512
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,060
really a hunk?

513
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,440
He's not. You are.

514
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:12,530
What are you doing?

515
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,280
I'm your tutor, aren't I?

516
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,050
I've planned out

517
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,960
a two-month study schedule for you.

518
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,560
It'll save you a lot of money.

519
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,690
Just thinking about you leaving for two months

520
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:26,010
makes me really miss you.

521
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,380
I want to kiss you,

522
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,020
but I'm still upset about you standing me up.

523
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:33,150
So, I'll save it for later,

524
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,500
when you get back.

525
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,120
Well then,

526
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,550
let me kiss you.

[China Diamond]

540
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,160
Look, this one is quite nice.

541
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,000
Yes, it is beautiful.

542
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,790
It looks really good.

543
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,160
This one's pretty.

544
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,900
It has a unique design.

545
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,110
Let's keep looking.

546
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:36,880
Alright.

547
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,020
Isn't the ring Miss Luo is wearing

548
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,960
one of this year's limited editions?

549
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,550
That's right.

550
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,290
It's not available on the market.

551
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,350
It's most likely a gift from Mr. Chen.

552
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,320
Who knows.

553
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,400
This diamond is big enough. It suits you.

554
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,260
Yeah, not bad.

555
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,750
Mr. Wang, look.

556
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,740
Xiaoxiao,

557
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,900
long time no see.

558
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,980
You've become even more beautiful.

559
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,930
Mr. Wang.

560
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,710
This ring doesn't suit you.

561
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,670
Let's go to the display over there.

562
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,740
I'll pick one out for you.

563
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,940
Are you interested?

564
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,260
No need.

565
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,010
I always thought

566
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:27,590
you didn't like dating people like us.

567
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:29,640
But it seems I was being too conservative.

568
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,870
I've always liked you,

569
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,600
just never dared to pursue you.

570
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,770
If you think Chen Shen isn't right for you,

571
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:35,970
you can always come to me.

572
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,060
You want to shoot an ad or act in a movie?

573
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,260
I have the resources.

574
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,700
Whatever script you want to perform,

575
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,540
just choose.

576
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:43,040
Whatever director you like,

577
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,120
I can get them for you.

578
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,020
What do you think?

579
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,730
But you'll need to have a drink with me.

580
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,510
I drove here, so it's not convenient for me to drink.

581
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,310
No...

582
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,750
Mr. Wang.

583
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,220
Be careful.

584
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,550
No, no, no.

585
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,870
It's nothing, it's nothing.

586
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,080
Nothing to see here!

587
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:01,080
Xiaoxiao,

588
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,660
you don't have to drink alcohol.

589
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:05,020
But surely you can have a soft drink, right?

590
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,330
So many people are watching.

591
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:08,330
Don't you think I'd be embarrassed?

592
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,990
We have drinks here.

593
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,650
Please.

594
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,750
Drink up.

595
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,900
You can't

596
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,540
refuse me again, can you?

597
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,220
Good.

598
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,430
That's the spirit.

599
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,540
I'm sorry, Mr. Wang.

600
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,570
But let me make it clear again:

601
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:40,010
I really don't like you.

602
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,580
Sorry for making things awkward.

603
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,100
I have an event tomorrow,

604
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,320
so I'll take my leave.

605
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,090
Mr. Wang,

606
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,450
she's just a minor celebrity. Don't worry.

607
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:56,250
Don't worry.

608
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,390
She'll have her embarrassing moment soon enough.

609
00:27:58,390 --> 00:27:59,660
What did you do?

610
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,300
I found out

611
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,080
she's allergic to mangoes.

612
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,900
Mr. Wang,

613
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,150
Are you following her?

614
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,000
Don't worry, sir.

615
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,030
I'm right on her tail.

616
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:26,830
The moment she gets out of the car,

617
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,260
I'll snap the photos.

618
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,000
Remember,

619
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,630
make sure you get her face,

620
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,970
and if her face is covered in rashes, even better.

621
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:35,320
Actresses care most about their looks, right?

622
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,870
Let's see how she goes on her show tomorrow.

623
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:37,910
Understood.

624
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,540
That's what you get for ignoring me.

625
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:46,120
Have I ever failed to win over a girl I've pursued?

626
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:48,130
My abilities speak for themselves.

627
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,950
[Emergency Call]

628
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,370
Hello, Xiaoxiao.

629
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,780
What's wrong?

630
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:50,310
Where are you? Speak slowly.

631
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,780
Hello?

632
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:08,790
Mr. Wang,

633
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,240
I've been waiting in the car for ages.

634
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,330
But Luo Xiaoxiao still hasn't gotten out.

635
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:15,500
Idiot! Use your head for once.

636
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,050
If she doesn't get out, why don't you go to her?

637
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,270
Okay, okay, I...

638
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,720
I got it, I got it.

00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:11,820
Xiaoxiao!

643
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:12,960
Open your mouth.

644
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,200
Speak.

645
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,550
Who sent you?

646
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,160
I'll talk.

647
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,030
I'll talk!

648
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,680
I'll tell you everything!

[Chen Shen]

650
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,130
Hello, Chen Shen.

651
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,410
Thanks for bringing me back last night.

652
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,650
I didn't scare you, did I?

653
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:37,010
What are you talking about?

654
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:38,380
I'm not in Huhai.

655
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:40,680
Weren't you at a jewelry gala last night?

656
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,280
You must have drunk too much.

657
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:44,120
Xiaoxiao.

658
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,540

659
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,320
Were you alright last night?

[Chen Shen]
Were you alright last night?

661
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:47,680
Were you alright last night?

662
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:48,740
What time did you all wrap up?

I thought you went for a late-night snack

667
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,240
with Patty and the others.

668
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,770
But I called around,

669
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,190
and no one saw you.

670
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,060
Alright, I got it.

00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,080

675
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:27,740
Sorry,

676
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:30,440
the number you've dialed is temporarily unavailable.

677
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,720
Please try again later.

00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,920

at a local electronics factory.

686

The city's fire department and the Xiaoyun Rescue Team

687
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,280
were dispatched immediately to the scene.

688
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,180
Now, let's take a look at the footage from the scene.

689
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,440
About twenty minutes ago, the electronics factory

690
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,840
experienced an explosion and caught fire.

691
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,480
We can see that rescue efforts

692
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,060
are currently underway.

693
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,510
Fortunately, most people have been safely evacuated,

694
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:01,000
though some rescue workers have been injured.

695
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,060
This way, this way!

696
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:03,740
Take it slow.

697
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,250
Careful, careful!

698
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,400
Be careful, slow down!

703
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,030
than ascending to the heavens

Alright, stop for a moment.

705
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,450
Drink this.

Aren't you leaving tomorrow?

707
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,180
Have you packed your luggage?

708
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,470
The five-grain powder in the fridge is almost finished.

709
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:46,670
This is a new batch I bought.

710
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,150
It has walnuts,

711
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,460
black beans, quinoa, chia seeds,

712
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,830
red dates, and yam.

713
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:51,880
Just take two scoops each day

714
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,470
and mix them with hot water.

715
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:56,220
It's good for your brain and memory.

716
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,090
Also,

717
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,320
stop staying up late.

718
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,590
You can't catch up in just a day or two.

719
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,860
And too many zero-calorie sweeteners are not great for your health.

720
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,420
That's why I added a little honey.

721
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,900
Stop eating takeout all the time.

722
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,720
If you're hungry,

723
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,010
I left some dumplings in the fridge.

724
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,560
Just heat them up.

725
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,210
Oh, and I reinforced

726
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,090
the flower rack on the balcony.

727
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,190
There's a typhoon coming,

728
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,130
and some of the old parts were getting loose, so it wasn't safe.

729
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:18,930
Don't spend too much time there.

730
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,030
Australia is only

731
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,280
two hours ahead of us.

00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,600
If you don't understand something while studying,

733
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,200
feel free to call me anytime.

734
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:28,560
Why are you suddenly being so naggy?

735
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,100
Your house is so big,

736
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,030
but it feels empty when I'm here alone.

737
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,190
It's really boring.

738
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,700
Oh, right.

739
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,990
I heard that Australia often has

740
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,200
wildfires and dust storms.

741
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,650
The animals there run wild.

742
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:42,150
Be careful. Don't get eaten.

743
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,750

928
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,710
I'm sorry

929
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,250
to let you down this time.

930
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:26,060
Yeah.

931
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,690
You should've told me this a long time ago.

932
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:35,110
Then I wouldn't have let you carry this burden for so long.

933
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:37,740
Pull yourself together.

934
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,550
It's not time to give up yet.

935
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:42,420
I'll give you time

936
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:47,340
to bring back

937
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:48,300
my best student.
