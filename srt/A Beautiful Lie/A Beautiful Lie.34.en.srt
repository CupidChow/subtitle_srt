00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,890
and signed up for a prenatal yoga class.

188
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,090
Of course,

189
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,070
I wasn't the only guy there!

190
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,350
I'm learning

191
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,690
as I go with

192
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,070
the books and yoga.

193
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,020
With me supporting you,

194
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,220
I hope to make things a bit easier for you,

195
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,150
both mentally and in terms of time.

196
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,890
So you already knew?

197
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,640
This morning,

198
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,070
you dropped it in the car.

199
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,800
You got me scared!

200
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,820
I thought you...

201
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,160
Okay, I'm done pretending.

202
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,210
Also,

203
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,450
the staff told me

204
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,490
that some exercise

205
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,520
during pregnancy

206
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,540
is really beneficial for your health.

207
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,580
Is that so?

208
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,000
You see, your scenes

209
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,380
involve dialogue with little action, right?

210
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,820
You should get moving a bit more.

211
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,400
It'll be great for the baby’s health!

212
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,250
As for me,

213
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,900
I've already asked Zhao for time off

214
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,920
and told him not to assign me any work
for the next few months.

215
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,380
Even if he does, I won't go.

216
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,840
When you join the crew next month,

217
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,970
I'll go with you.

218
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,950
I thought this was supposed to be a surprise.

219
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,260
It is a surprise!

220
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,260
Come on, eat while it's hot.

221
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,020
Otherwise, it'll get cold.

222
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,800
This one is yours.

223
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,230
And this one...

224
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,560
is for our baby.

225
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:23,680
[Domestic Arrivals]

226
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,770
Didn't you say you'd be here early?

227
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,580
Why show up so late?

228
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,600
Couldn't you have booked an earlier flight?

229
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,240
What's wrong with you? Stop!

230
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:32,960
Tell me, what's going on with you?

231
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,550
The floor was just mopped.

232
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,210
Couldn't you lift your suitcase?

233
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,360
Alright, alright, I got it.

234
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,360
What do you mean "I got it"?

235
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,720
Can you just watch your tone?

236
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,230
How could you...

237
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,050
What's wrong with you?

238
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:41,920
What are you doing?

239
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,770
Why are you pulling me?

240
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:43,560
She's my own daughter,

241
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,960
am I not allowed to scold her?

242
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,960
Just look at her,

243
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,930
she's carrying such a tiny suitcase.

244
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,550
Even the small suitcase bothers you?

245
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,850
She just got back, just leave her alone.

246
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:52,960
Bringing only such a small suitcase

247
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,620
means she only packed a few clothes,

248
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,620
showing that

249
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,730
she doesn't feel at home here

250
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,280
or see this place as her own.

251
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,120
Take it easy!

252
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,740
These are all my treasures.

253
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:05,390
If they're your treasures,

254
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,900
then why are you putting them in my room?

255
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,030
Don't put everything in my room, okay?

256
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,480
What's going on?

257
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,870
You came back and took it out on your brother.

258
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,480
You're not even living here,

259
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,930
so what's the big deal if he keeps his stuff in your room?

260
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,150
This is exactly why

261
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,770
I don’t want to come home.

262
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,360
Whether you come back or not is up to you.

263
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,620
I honestly don't care.

264
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,390
You...

265
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,150
Why are you here alone? Xing didn't come along?

266
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,560
Is Xing busy with something,

267
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,560
so he couldn't come back?

268
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,030
What has he been busy with lately?

269
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,920
You're so funny.

270
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,240
How can you change your attitude so quickly?

271
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,130
One might think he's your own son,

272
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,610
and I'm some kind of bullied daughter-in-law.

273
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,090
Alright, alright, let's not discuss this.

274
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,290
Tell me, why didn't Xing come with you?

275
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,440
-How is he lately?
-He's busy.

276
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,310
Judging by Fei's tone, don't tell me they broke up.

277
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,170
What are you talking about?

278
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,340
No way.

279
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,120
I got it right.

280
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,750
Tell me.

281
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,210
What's really going on between you and Xing?

282
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,020
You didn't really break up, did you?

283
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,890
What's wrong with you?

284
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,240
Wouldn't it be better to live peacefully?

285
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,480
Why did you have to make a fuss?

286
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,270
What's the point of all this drama?

287
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,230
Mom.

288
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,440
Didn't I already tell you

289
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,270
to stay out of our business?

290
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,320
I know I shouldn't meddle in your personal matters.

291
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,390
Do you really believe

292
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,440
I'll stay out of your personal matters?

293
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,200
When it comes to important life issues,

294
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,390
how can I not care?

295
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,540
I'm your mother!

296
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,270
You're so confused.

297
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,800
How can I not care about you?

298
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,110
Tell me, what's wrong with you?

299
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,720
Xing is such a good guy.

300
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,200
What right do you have

301
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,120
to break up with him?

302
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,270
You're bullying a decent man,

303
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,400
do you realize that?

304
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:35,960
I'm begging you,

305
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,030
please leave me alone.

306
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,150
You're making such a fuss here.

307
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,360
Then tell me why.

308
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,960
Why did you break up with him?

309
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,090
You won't tell me, will you?

310
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:42,760
Fine, just don't tell me.

311
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,080
If you won't tell me, I'll call Xing.

312
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,480
I'll ask him what's really going on between you two.

313
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,620
What are you doing?

314
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,710
I'm going to ask him about this.

315
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,720
-Don’t try to stop me.
-Mom!

316
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,270
It's all a mess.

317
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,530
How could you break up with him?

318
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,920
He dumped me!

319
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,240
The moment I get home, you have to bring this up.

320
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,640
He dumped me!
Go ahead, call him if you want.

321
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,670
You... you didn’t initiate this?

322
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,490
He's the one who broke up with me.

323
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,770
How...

324
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,440
How could Xing be like this?

325
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,440
Is... is there something wrong with his brain?

326
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,150
Yeah, I know you've got a bit of a temper,

327
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,930
and you can be a bit fiery sometimes, but...

328
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,670
you're kind, beautiful,

329
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,910
and independent!

330
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,480
What gives him the audacity to break up with you?

331
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,590
What... what's wrong with him?

332
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,480
No, I'm going to ask him.

333
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,560
Tell me about it.

334
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,480
-Leave me alone, okay?
-Just tell me.

335
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,600
-Please leave me alone.
-Tell me about it, okay?

336
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,750
Tell me what's really going on.

337
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,670
Just let me be alone for a while.

338
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,270
Tell me!

339
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,720
This is important!

340
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,240
Tell me, how should I...

341
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,390
I'm telling you, I'll go talk to him...

342
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,790
My phone, my phone!

343
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,840
Why did you take my phone?

344
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,300
Hey, give me back my phone!

345
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,380
I'm taking your phone,

346
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,800
or else you'll just call Xing Zhizhi.

347
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,100
I'm warning you,
if you don't give it back, I'll kick you.

348
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,790
Open the door!

349
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,850
We're out of garlic at home.

350
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:52,610
Cheng,

351
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,300
-let's buy garlic.
-Let's go.

352
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,690
Goodbye.

353
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,760

Yeah, look!

390
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,900
Her photo is on the alumni wall.

391
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,590
I heard she started a dance troupe,

392
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,640
and it's doing quite well.

393
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,030
-I even got the ticket to support her.
-Really?

394
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:04,780
Honestly, the troupe's way better than her TV show!

I'll give you candy.

Does your mom pick you up this late too?

408
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,060
I don't know when my dad will come to pick me up.

You can't go in here.

Why haven't your parents come to pick you up yet?

418
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,450
They're in Beijing.
They only come back once in a while.

419
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,430
What about your dad?

420
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,260
My dad went to buy me some plum candy.

421
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,100
What's the matter with you?

422
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,120
The teacher asked me
to represent our class in the singing competition.

423
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,670
But I'm still too scared to go on stage.

424
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:55,820
Why?

425
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,350
Because I'm scared.

426
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,760
It's okay.

427
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,280
I'll stand at the bottom of the stage then,

428
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,310
singing along with you,

429
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,800
just like we did in rehearsal.

430
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,470
You won't feel scared if you look at me.

431
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,540
-Really?
-Pinky swear.

432
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:14,580

and thereby we will not break our promise for a hundred years.

Over 10 years have passed,

444
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,050
and who would've thought we'd still be hiding here?

445
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:57,140
You probably don't remember, do you?

446
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,910
How could I forget?

447
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,970
I remember in elementary school when you got me to skip class,

448
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:05,010
and we hid here in this storage room.

449
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,130
Back then, you were

450
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:09,830
such a timid and chubby boy.

451
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,940
But hey, nothing bad happened, right?

452
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,470
You didn't get in trouble.

453
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,550
Later, the teacher found me

454
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,130
and made me write a pledge,

455
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,830
asked me to promise that I wouldn't hang out with you anymore,

456
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,190
said you were a bad influence.

457
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,200
Did you agree then?

458
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,730
But I didn't follow through.

459
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,310
That's more like it.

460
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,180
Have you been happy these days

461
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,530
while we've been apart?

462
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:41,790
I don't know.

463
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,830
Answer me honestly.

464
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,290
Do you really not

465
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:50,170
have any feelings for me anymore?

466
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,100
Xiaofei,

467
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,970
lately,

468
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,650
I've been feeling empty inside,

469
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,550
like something's missing.

470
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,180
I keep wondering

471
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,950
what you would have done

472
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,260
if this had happened before,

473
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,790
and how I would have reacted.

474
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,520
I...

475
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,570
I really don't know.

476
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,020
Can we not break up?

477
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,170
When we were little,

478
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,580
the teacher told you not to hang out with me,

479
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,010
you didn't agree.

480
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,680
Now you want to break up with me.

481
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,400
I guess that's how life goes,

482
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:45,700
going in circles, which is quite boring.

483
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,220
I'm leaving Huhai.

00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,620

And you, Qin Fei.

492
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:16,980
You're such a big star,

493
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,750
yet you're damaging school environment?

We...

497
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,880
You don't have to deny it so soon.

498
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,760
Do you guys really think I don't keep up with the gossip?

499
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,620
I can't believe I ran into such a big piece of gossip!

500
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,350

Do you want to be on trends?

504
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:45,150
Don't tell me you're planning to climb over the wall.

505
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,960
Come with me.

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,920
Let's go to the back door.

-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

You just said

510
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:21,060
you're going to Suman to look for Xiaojia.

511

The doctor I worked with in Suman,

512
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,270
Kevin, sent me an email

513
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,190
and said Xiaojia might still be alive there

514
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,410
in Suman.

515
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,640
I want to go find him.

516
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,810
But do you even know where he is?

517
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,510
I mean, what if...

518
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,740
what if you go all the way to Suman
and still can't find Xiaojia?

519
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,980
What would you do?

520
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:49,630
I have to give it a try.

521

♫Till the sunlight so deeply falls in line♫

549
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,480
that will officially mark the end for us.

Could you stay with me as my boyfriend
♫The stars shining for you♫

561
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,130
Could you stay with me as my boyfriend

562
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,360
and spend today together until it ends?

563
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:25,950
♫Once more, I meet you♫

564
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:34,290

♫When I dream of all the seasons♫
Cheers!

573
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,450
♫When I dream of all the seasons♫

574
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,340
You're drinking so little again.

575
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,740
Whatever!

576
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:02,590
-Excuse me.
-Hello.

577
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,270
Can you bring me two more bottles?

578
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:06,030
No need, thank you.

579
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,260
Don't drink too much.

580
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,590
Mind your own business.

581
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,970
It's been a long time since anyone cared about me.

582
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:18,500
It's nice to have someone care once in a while.

583
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:24,560
-Fifteen, fifteen, ten!
-Fifteen, fifteen, ten!

584
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:28,090
-Fifteen, fifteen, twenty!
-Fifteen, fifteen, twenty-five!

585
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,370
Xing Zhizhi.

586
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,900
Let's play the finger-guessing game they’re playing.

587
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,570
Whoever loses has to drink. Come on.

588
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,170
I don't know how to play that.

589
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:35,980
Boring!

590
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,490
Let's go home.

591
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,310
It's too late, and it's not safe.

592
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,490
You've been wanting to go home for a while, haven't you?

593
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,970
I got it. Let's go.

594
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:53,930
Check, please.

595
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,210
I've paid the bill.

596
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:38,500
Look at them.

597
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:42,710
They must be a couple who just graduated from college.

598
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,000
I guess they've been together

599
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,670
for about 3 years.

600
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,340
The guy really loves his girlfriend,

601
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:55,370
and she loves him too.

602
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,350
They probably don't argue much.

603
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,690
Look how happy they are.

604
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,420
Look at that married couple over there.

605
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:25,190
They probably just bought a house

606
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,290
and are feeling the pressure of the mortgage.

607
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,700
The wife...

608
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:36,200
is likely aiming for a promotion

609
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,620
and has been working overtime lately.

610
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:40,960
The husband feels for her,

611
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,030
especially goes to pick her up after work

612
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,660
so they can go home together.

613
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,150
I told you to wear more clothes.

614
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,620
Here, quickly, drink some hot water.

615
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,880
They...

616
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,620
must have been married for 50 years.

617
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,950
Although they occasionally argue,

618
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,520
their relationship has always been good.

619
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,830
Are you feeling better?

620
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:27,260
Their children are probably not around,

621
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:31,050
but as long as they have each other,

622
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,930
they'll never feel alone.

623
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:50,190
It's so beautiful.

624
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,360
Don't you think so?

625
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Indeed,

626
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,160
it's very beautiful.

627
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,620
Xing Zhizhi.

628
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,000
I want you to experience this happiness too.

629
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,260
When we're 70,

630
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,100
or even 80,

631
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,910
I hope we'll still be holding hands like we are now,

632
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,860
accompanying each other

633
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:36,090
so that neither of us ever feels lonely.

634
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,060
I want to be with you,

635
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,030
and I want to wait for you.

636
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,120
I'll wait for you to come back.

637
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,750
When you're well again,

638
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:04,270
I'll see you smile and hear you call my name.

639
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,590
Xiaofei, I...

640
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:14,190
The next stop is the West Side of Shilin Road.

641
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:16,810
Please exit through the rear door.

642
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,280
Let's get off here.

643
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,420
This place is really nice.

644
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,810
It hasn't changed at all, still so beautiful.

645
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:36,960
Xing Zhizhi,

646
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:40,050
do you know my favorite place when I was a child?

647
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,630
It was right here.

648
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,740
When I grew up a bit,

649
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,750
and started having those little romantic fantasies,

650
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,210
this was still the place I pictured.

651
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,690
Today,

652
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,050
the place I used to dream about has finally become a reality.

653
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,310
It's too dangerous.

654
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:02,240
We've got such a romantic vibe here.

655
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,170
Can you please not ruin it with those buzzkill words?

656
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:11,060
Alright, come here.

657
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,390
Sit down.

658
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:21,650
Raise your arm.

659
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,770
That's more like it.

660
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:41,010
What are Suman's

661
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,480
stars like?

662
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,330
Most of the time,

663
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,920
they're probably just like this.

664
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,270
But once in a while,

665
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,030
when the weather's just right,

666
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:55,130
the sky fills up with stars,

667
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,910
shining so brightly.

668
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,860
It's like the Milky Way is pouring down.

669
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,950
That sounds wonderful.

670
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,120
The way you describe it

671
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,270
makes me want to see it for myself.

672
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:10,440
It's cold in the winter and hot in the summer there.

673
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,780
You won't get used to it.

674
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,250
Xing Zhizhi,

675
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,130
we agreed to say a proper goodbye.

676
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,320
Can't you say something nice?

677
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:51,300
Make sure to take a jacket

678
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,560
when you go out,

679
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,680
especially in the fall and the winter.

680
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,020
Make sure to keep your knees covered.

681
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,280
And your old back injury,

682
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,420
remember to keep it warm.

683
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,710
Don't catch a cold.

684
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,980
If you don't pay attention to it for a long time,

685
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,440
it could lead to problems when you're older.

686
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,230
The funny thing about being so close is,

687
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,320
when you try to be romantic,

688
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:23,180
it just never comes out that way.

689
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,180
I'm sorry.

690
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,740
Am I being too naggy?

691
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,840
Yes, you are naggy.

692
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,220
But,

693
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:34,550
I won't be able to hear it anymore even if I want to.

694
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,080
We agreed on six hours,

695
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,880
and now it's almost over.

696
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,630
Xing Zhizhi,

697
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,700
I'm really happy tonight.

698
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:07,870
If I had to rate you as a boyfriend,

699
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:10,180
I'd give you a 99,

700
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,650
just 1 point short.

701
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,360
Did you bring that engagement ring you once said

702
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,750
you had prepared for me?

703
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,720
No.

704
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,410
Alright then.

705
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,080
It's a pity.

706
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,670
I was actually planning

707
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,490
to keep it as a gift.

708
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:33,020
And for that last point...

709
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,490
I'll give a kiss for you.

710
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,950
♫Into my dream, my love♫

711
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:49,730
♫Stay with me, my love♫

712
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:54,150
♫For one more time, one more second♫

713
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:57,450
♫Stay in your eyes♫

714
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:01,540
♫Till the last day of my life♫

715
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:06,570
♫Stay with me one more♫

716
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:15,140
♫Every moment to eternity, I keep it for you♫

717
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,680
Chubby,

718
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:43,040
let me borrow your shoulder just a bit longer,

719
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,650
you can go

720
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,370
when it's midnight.

721
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:43,750
Xing Zhizhi.

722
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,450
Xing Zhizhi.

723
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:49,770
Can we not break up?

724
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,870
Be quiet.

725
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,690
Over there.

726
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,880
Why are you so clumsy?

727
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,350
Keep it down.

728
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,400
Hurry... hurry up.

729
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,850
The room is back there.

730
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,690
Hurry up!

731
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,710
Mom, you're still awake?

732
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,060
Auntie,

733
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,030
Get in there.

734
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,410
Auntie...

735
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:04,440
You're here.

736
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,480
Did you cheat on her?

737
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:12,730
No, I didn't.

738
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,320
Then did our Xiaofei cheat on you?

739
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,300
Of course not.

740
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,130
Well, if nobody cheated,

741
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,600
then what's the reason for the breakup?

742
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,140
Auntie,

743
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:23,820
I...

744
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,320
I'm going abroad.

745
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,890
Going abroad?

746
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:30,690
Does going abroad mean you're not coming back?

747
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,280
Auntie,

748
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:35,580
Xiaofei and I do have some issues.

749
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:37,940
Of course, most of them are on me.

750
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:39,440
But I'm doing my best

751
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,920
to work things out.

752
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,530
When are you leaving?

753
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,400
Tomorrow.

754
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:45,400
So soon?

755
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:48,020
How long will you be gone? When will you be back?

756
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:58,710
It seems this issue is quite difficult to resolve.

757
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,720
So, you're saying you want to break up with Xiaofei

758
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,440
for her own good, right?

759
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:09,730
I know

760
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,070
my own daughter.

761
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:14,740
She might seem carefree

762
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,750
and a bit unpredictable,

763
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:17,900
but she's actually very committed.

764
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:19,910
When it comes to people she cares about,

765
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:22,640
once she makes up her mind, nothing can shake her.

766
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,560
Do you honestly think

767
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,080
she'll accept that you're breaking up

768
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,480
"for her own good"?

769
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:58,440
Did you bring that engagement ring you once said

770
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,550
you had prepared for me?

771
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:35,000
Xiaofei,

772
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,160
I wish you all the best.
