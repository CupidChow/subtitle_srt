But if a doctor doesn't perform surgeries,

00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,030
how can they save lives then?

10
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,320
It's not only by performing surgeries that one can save lives.

11
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,780
Besides, given my current condition,

12
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,070
if I were to operate again,

13
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,570
it would be irresponsible toward the patients.

14
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,100
Then you should tell them the reason.

30
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,750
she was trying to use me to pressure you into renewing your contract.

I hope you don't mind my asking,

but do you usually

134
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,560
Sit upright, and lower your head.

135
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,140
Lower your head and try to bend down as much as you can.

166
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,600
Your cooking skills are amazing, Auntie.

167
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,000
-I need to learn from you.
Right?

168
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,600
Using oyster sauce is better than light soy sauce, right?

169
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,310
Absolutely.

170
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,310
Auntie,

171
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,860
please try this dish I made.

172
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:50,800
How is it?

173
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,060
The flavor is good too.

174
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,750
However,

175
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,680
however,

176
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,180
if you had taken it out of the pan a bit earlier,

177
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,370
it would have been more tender.

178
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,100
I see.

179
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,810
Auntie, could you tell me more about

180
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,120
how to make

181

those... those meatballs?

182
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,910
The key to making meatballs is choosing the right meat.

183
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:03,900
You know pork shoulder, right?

184
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,390

Let me show you on my phone.

188
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:08,920
Okay, okay, okay.

189
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,570
I actually didn't know

190
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,160
how to prepare the pork shoulder.

191
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,560
Right,

192
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,000
let me tell you.

193
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,950
You're back.

194
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:14,690
Quick,

195
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,510
go wash your hands

196
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,190
and change your clothes.

197
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:16,830
Lunch's ready.

198
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,720
I'll go grab my phone for you.

199
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,720
Okay, okay, okay.

200
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,360
Xing Zhizhi.

201
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,720
Xing Zhizhi, what's going on?

202
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,210
Why have you become so close to my mom?

203
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,270
It's a secret.

204
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,850
Come on, eat more.

205
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:34,820
It's delicious.

206
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,220
Xing, let me tell you,

207
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,050
Our Xiaofei,

208
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,070
this girl

209
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,670
is not very good at housework.

210
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,010
She's usually quite careless.

211
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,640
You must have suffered a lot, haven't you?

212
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,690
No, no, she's wonderful!

213
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,970
Really wonderful.

214
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,030
Auntie,

215
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,890
y-y-you like scrambled eggs too?

216
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,450
You and our Xiaofei are basically twins.

217
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,690
Look, especially the eyes;

218
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:03,810
they're very, very similar.

219
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:04,850
-Xing Zhizhi.
-Really.

220
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:05,450
When have I ever

221
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,810
liked scrambled eggs?

222
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,490
And I don't look like my mom.

223
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,490
I look like my dad.

224
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,390
Your dad had monolids.

225
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,070
Auntie,

226
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,850
I remember when I was little,

227
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,810
I had... egg cakes.

228
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,080
It's a specialty from your hometown, right?

229
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,030
Could you teach me how to make it?

230
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,110
I'd like to learn too.

231
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,350
You want to learn how to make it?

232
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,440
I-I-I want to learn

233
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,990
so that I can make it for her.

234
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,520
Mom,

235
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,230
I know why you're here.

236
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,290
I've already made my decision.

237
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,950
It's no use even if Ren Siqi has sought your help.

238
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,200
You know what I'm going to say?

239
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,580
Of course, I know.

240
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,760
You're going to say that I'm impulsive,

241
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,180
that I lack a sense of responsibility,

242
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,610
and that I always quit halfway,

243
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:50,260
right?

244
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,520
Xiaofei,

245
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,730
since I walked in that door,

246
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,940
I haven't said a word.

247
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,900
When I stopped dancing back then,

248
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,660
didn't you say the same things?

249
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,420
Now that you mention this,

250
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,130
I'm actually a bit angry.

251
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,120
Tell me,

252
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,780
why didn't you tell your family

253
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,120
that you had such a serious injury?

254
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,060
Why didn't you tell me?

255
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,090
Because I knew

256
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,890
that telling you wouldn't make any difference.

257
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,030
Nothing would have changed.

258
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,910
How do you know

259
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,960
that nothing will change?

260
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,350
You don't say anything, so how can you know

261
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,280
the outcome couldn't change?

262
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,080
When I said I didn't want you to remarry

263
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,290
and that I couldn't accept a new family,

264
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,020
but that didn't matter, did it?

265
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,120
Xiaofei,

266
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,510
I've told you countless times

267
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,550
that everything I've done

268
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,720
is for you, for you!

269
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,720
Do you understand?

270
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,270
Auntie, Auntie,

271
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:39,870
don't, don't...

272
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,360
don't be anxious. Don't be angry; please don't be angry.

273
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,270
She... she didn't mean it that way,

274
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:42,630
right?

275
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,750
That's right.

276
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,440
It's not worth getting angry

277
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,640
after a long trip.

278
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,270
No one can do anything

279
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,200
to what I've decided anyway.

280
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,320
No, she, she...

281
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,440
-Auntie.
-Fine. Fine.

282
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:52,750
No.

283
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,960
I-I-I'll leave right now.

284
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,840
No, Auntie, Auntie,

285
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,440
we haven't finished lunch yet, Auntie.

286
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,560
Wait, you, you...

287
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,390
-Don't be angry.
-Xing, listen.

288
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,510
If you end up with her,

289
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,480
you'll have a lot to suffer.

290
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,240
No, that won't happen.

291
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,900
We can't even be

292
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,020
in the same house.

293
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,670
No, no.

294
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,340
Qin Fei,

295
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,250
you've made up your mind, right?

296
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,010
Fine.

297
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,970
Go ahead and do whatever you want.

298
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,660
I won't interfere.

299
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,950
And I cannot interfere.

300
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:14,700
Wait, Auntie.

301
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,900
Auntie, don't you...

302
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,320
Purse, Auntie!

303
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,180
You haven't taken your purse yet.

304
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,100
Auntie,

305
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,630
please don't be angry.

306
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,590
Where's my mom?

307
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,930
I've already sent her to the airport.

308
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,270
She's gone, back home?

309
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,630
She originally booked

310
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,830
a flight for tonight.

311
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:04,700
Xing Zhizhi,

312
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,660
what kind of spell did you cast on my mom?

313
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,260
Why does she like you so much?

314
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,320
Don't admire me too much.

315
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,570
Admire you for what?

316
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,640
This is simply impossible.

317
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,720
How could she, such a strong-willed person,

318
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,580
just let it go so easily like that?

319
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,520
But I think

320
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,670
she isn't as hard to communicate with as you say.

321
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,250
That's because you don't know anything.

322
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,560
When I was dancing, she disapproved,

323
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,200
and when I stopped, she still wasn't happy.

324
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,620
Later, when I switched to acting,

325
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,340
she scolded me again,

326
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,240
scolding our entire family

327
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,290
from top to bottom.

328
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,860
Now I suddenly say I'm not going to be an actress anymore;

329
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,390
how could she possibly not care?

330
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,320
What exactly did you say to her?

331
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,170
Alright,

332
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,420
Qin Xiaofei,

333
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,260
have more confidence in me, your mom,

334
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,840
and yourself, okay?

335
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:46,960
She came here specifically to see you,

336
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,670
not to come here

337
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,890
just to argue with you.

338
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,290
She's worried about you.

339
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,120
Just talk normally;

340
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,780
don't get handsy.

341
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:54,990
You've messed up my hairstyle.

342
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,590
Are you going to pay for that?

343
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,870
Your personality is exactly the same

344
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:58,870
as your mother's.

345
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:01,880
Alright.

346
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,850
Actually, I know.

347
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,590
Deep down, you understand.

348
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,000
You're just being stubborn.

349
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,610
Your mom is the same.

350
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,630
No matter how harsh she sounds,

351
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,340
it's all because she's worried about you

352
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,050
and cares for you, right?

353
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,560
You've accepted her favors,

354
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,560
and now you're indebted.

355
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,200
You've been bought off by my mom.

356
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,910
I haven't.

357
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,510
Alright.

358
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:41,120
I'm going to see Li Changjiang tomorrow

359
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,800
to talk to him in person about Xingyi's bet-on agreement.

360
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,010
Li Changjiang?

361
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,470
What's wrong?

362
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,390
Nothing,

363
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,390
just that the name sounds familiar.

364
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,370
He's a big name in the business world,

365
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,920
often in financial news.

366
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,860
Xiaofei,

367
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,480
Xing is a good man.

368
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,630
He cares about you.

369
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,330
You should treat him well too.

370
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,440
As for the contract renewal,

371
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,040
you can decide for yourself.

372
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,300
All these years,

373
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,950
I've been saving the money

374
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,080
you gave me.

375
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,870

Just now,

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,680
when you rejected me,

568
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,260
you were so direct...

569
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,840
and realistic

570
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,620
that I almost backed out.

that I want to give it another shot.

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,160
Lucky you.

748
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,870
You don't eat spicy food.

749
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,530
Our Qin Fei ordered it, right?

750
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:11,290
Alright,

751
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,390
you caught me.

752
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,540
Your Qin Fei

753
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:17,060
is worried you might get sick

754
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,010
from eating too many egg pancakes,

755
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:19,370
so she specially ordered this meal for you.

756
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:20,080
This is mine.

757
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,630
How is it?

758
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:22,220
Not worse than yours, right?

759
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,880
She thinks you've been too tired lately

760
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,720
and is worried about you.

761
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,020
Of course.

762
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,210
The great genius Xing

763
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,210
finally came up with a new plan.

764
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:29,380
As the lead surgeon,

765
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,330
I have to put in more effort, right?

766
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,110
Do you think

767
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,400
the practical operation and the plan

768
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,730
can work well together?

769
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,340
It can basically achieve the expected effect.

770
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:40,990
But you've really outdone yourself this time.

771
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,540
This plan is so groundbreaking.

772
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,130
Those two ventilators that Li Changjiang's going to donate

773
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,610
are definitely money well spent.

774
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:46,660
You've really gone all out

775
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,660
for our hospital.

776
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:48,960
Let's not talk about this anymore.

777
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,780
Hurry up and eat.

778
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,220
Let's go see him in a bit.

779
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,330
Stop.

780
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,430
I don't want to go.

781
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,900
He wants to see you, not me.

782
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:08,500

developed by the expert team.

791
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:22,050
I've reviewed a lot of materials

792
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,520
and consulted many experts.

793
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,770
They also say that if we want to

794
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:28,400
completely remove the cancer through surgery,

795
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,470
we have to

796
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,960
perform a pneumonectomy.

797
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:32,320
Meanwhile, preserving

798
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,920
both the upper and lower lobes of the left lung is very difficult.

799
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:39,920
Actually, I hope

800
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:42,350
that my wife not only survives

801
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,340
but also fully restores her lung function

802
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,310
and lives a completely normal life

803
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,020
as she did before.

804
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,720
Mr. Li,

805
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,520
I completely understand your feelings.

806
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:55,400
From my professional perspective,

807
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,290
this plan

808
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,240
is currently...

809
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:59,570
the safest approach.

810
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:02,300
If I only wanted a conservative approach

811
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:03,960
that couldn't preserve

812
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,960
the entire left lung,

813
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,760
then why do I insist

814
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:10,230
on having Dr. Xing perform this surgery?

815
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,610
Dr. Xing,

816
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,730
you should know very well in your heart

817
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,250
why you're taking on this surgery,

818
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,700
right?

819
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,390
There's another plan.

820
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,070
We can

821
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,510
remove the tumor

822
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,190
via a bronchial sleeve resection

823
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,080
using video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery.

824
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,540
However, since your wife's tumor is located

825
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,940
close to the left main bronchus

826
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,030
and the left lower lung opening,

827
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,250
which is rather deep,

828
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,700
it'll depend on the specific situation during the surgery.

829
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,050
But I need you

830
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,930
to promise me

831
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:51,230
that the surgery will be 100% successful

832
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,060
and without any complications.

833
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,490
Strictly speaking,

834
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,700
there's no 100% certainty in medicine.

835
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,030
However, we're quite confident

836
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:01,290
about the surgery's chances of success.

837
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,680
However, Mr. Li,

838
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:04,560
I must inform you

839
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,760
that this is a very complex operation.

840
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,190
I recommend letting Dr. Yu Zhecheng,

841
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:08,870
who has more surgical experience,

842
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,510
lead the operation,

843
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,940
and I will assist as the second surgeon

844
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,670
and participate throughout the entire surgery.

845
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:16,360

Did you threaten Xing Zhizhi with me?

883
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,480
What do you mean by "threaten"?

884
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,410
Dr. Xing is just doing his job, saving lives.

891
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:43,080
he only wanted Dr. Xing Zhizhi.

892
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,690
He specifically requested him and no one else!

893
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:45,640
Do you know that Xing Zhizhi

894
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,330
has his own considerations?

895
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,110
No, can he just

896
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,060
make an exception for you?

00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,360
there's a surgery.

932
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,760
You're going to operate?

933
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,790
Calm down.

934
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,240
I just came up with a plan.

935
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,810
Yu Zhecheng will be the lead surgeon.

936
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:03,900
What if Yu Zhecheng doesn't do well

937
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,070
and the surgery fails?

938
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,030
What will you do?

939
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,520
What about Qin Fei?

940
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,950
Do you think Li Changjiang will let her off?

941
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,180
Xiaojia,

942
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,180
don't panic.

943
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,150
Yu Zhecheng is very capable.

944
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,790
We work well together,

945
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,320
and I'll be in the operating room.

946
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,110
Don't worry.

947
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,400
Trust me;

948
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,610
I promise everything will go smoothly.

949
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:26,410
Okay?

950
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:32,470
[Dry Shares (Dividend Rights) Gift Agreement]

951
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:38,800
[Dry Shares (Dividend Rights) Gift Agreement]

952
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:42,050
[Article 5: Rights and Obligations of All Parties]

953
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:49,550
Could it be that Li Changjiang made concessions

954
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:52,450
because Xing Zhizhi agreed to perform the surgery?

955
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,730
[Zhizu]
[Decline] [Answer]

956
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:04,140
Hello,

957
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,290
Zhizu?

958
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,230
Qin Fei,

959
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,650
are you busy right now?

960
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:09,930
I have something I'd like to ask you.

961
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,200
You want to ask

962
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,790
about Xing Zhizhi, right?

963
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:13,560
Yes.

964
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,210
I heard

965
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,970
he was preparing to go back to the operating room.

966
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,980
I'm sorry, Zhizu.

967
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,110
I don't understand

968
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:34,670
why you apologized to me.

969
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,360
Xing Zhizhi originally

970
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,360
didn't want to take on this surgery.

971
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,480
But

972
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,320
I don't want to renew my contract with the agency, you know.

973
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,470
But I had no idea

974
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:46,910
that Xing Zhizhi's patient was the wife

975
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,870
of my agency's major investor.

976
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:51,160
I'm not sure if he agreed to this surgery

977
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,680
because of me.

978
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,850
But I don't want him

979
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:56,290
to do something he doesn't want to do for me.

980
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,930
Arterial bleeding.

981
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,400
Avoid malformed blood vessels.

982
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,910
Locate the bleeding point.

983
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:15,110
The bleeding point is on the right side of the left artery.

984
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,790
A person like him

985
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,750
is meant for the operating table.

986
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,360
He entered university at fifteen

987
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,820
and completed an eight-year continuous program.

988
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,260
He was the youngest

989
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,170
but most outstanding one in his class.

990
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:35,120
While others were still rotating through departments,

991
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,510
he was already assisting his mentor in performing surgeries.

992
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:37,710
in performing surgeries.

993
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,750
The surgery you just saw

994
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:40,590
already employed

995
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:42,360
the most difficult single-port thoracoscopic

996
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,800
sleeve resection technique.

997
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,680
His surgical technique was precise and meticulous,

998
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,590
all aimed at

999
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:50,050
allowing patients to have the best postoperative treatment.

1000
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:50,920
So,

1001
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,190
I think...

1002
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,010
you don't need to worry about whether he's doing this for you.

1003
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:56,140
I believe

1004
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:57,500
he definitely puts patients

1005
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,140
at his top priority.

1006
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,910
Let me show you something else.

1007
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:06,610
Throughout my life, may I

1008
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:09,130
never neglect my passion or treat it carelessly,

1009
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:12,040
nor betray any trust placed in me.

1010
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,620
Be a person who believes in life

1011
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,350
and holds onto hope.

1012
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,030
Don't you think

1013
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:20,080
it's a shame

1014
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:21,420
that all of his talent and gifts

1015
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,020
are going to waste like this?

1016
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:24,540
Actually,

1017
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:25,870
I'm not sure

1018
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,010
why he insisted on

1019
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:29,230
walking away from surgery at his peak.

1020
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:32,050
But perhaps

1021
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:34,020
he just needs someone

1022
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,750
who can give him a push

1023
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,950
and pressure him at the crucial moment.

1024
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:39,540
Maybe that push

1025
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:41,920
will help him return to his old self.

1026
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,330
This isn't for you;

1027
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:45,460
it's for him.

1028
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,520
You just need to

1029
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,630
believe in him...

1030
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:52,300
and support him.
