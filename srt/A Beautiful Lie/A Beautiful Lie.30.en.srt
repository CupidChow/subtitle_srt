00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,700
on a date, I guess.

361
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,870
He won't.

362
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,870
We agreed to sell grapes together.

363
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,470
Ze isn't that kind of person.

364
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,440
Are you allergic to romance or something?

365
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,630
They have just been through

366
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,790
a turning point in their lives.

367
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,960
You don't get it.

368
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,790
I think

369
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,630
someone hasn't been performing well lately.

370
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,490
Getting less and less proactive.

371
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,790
Linkang grapes!

372
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,510
Everyone, come and take a look!

373
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,390
You can have a look.

374
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,750
-You can try it.
-No, thanks.

375
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,480
Please, take a look.

376
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,390
No, thanks.

377
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,720
Fresh and cheap!

378
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,470
Everyone, come and have a look!

379
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:52,550
Hello!

380
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,870
You can try some.

381
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,790
Would you like to try?

382
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,720
No, no, no.

383
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,730
It's so cheap and fresh.

384
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,080
Alright.

385
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,220
Take a break.

386
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,170
Have some water.

387
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,600
It's okay.

388
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,320
It's okay if you can't do it.

389
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,320
I really can't do it.

390
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,600
Why don't you try?

391
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,720
Give it a try.

392
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,200
I... I don't know how.

393
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,500
I think you're better at it than I am.

394
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,160
What should I say? I...

395
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,030
I'll fan you.

396
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,480
You give out photos.

397
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,840
What should I give out?

398
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,500
Give out...

399
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:29,200
Buy grapes for a massage.

400
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,720
Doctor from the rehabilitation department of Huhai Hospital

401
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,200
offers free massage.

402
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:34,630
Ma'am,

403
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,200
would you...

404
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,000
Would you like a massage? No.

405
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,150
Would you like to buy some grapes?

406
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,790
Buy grapes and get a free massage.

407
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,720
Dr. Xing,

408
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,440
they don't know me.

409
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,910
Looks like they don't really know you either.

410
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,840
Great doctor from Huhai Hospital.

411
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,050
Massage with free grapes!

412
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,140

and two jin of grapes.

415

-Really?
-Really?

416
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,680
Yes, madam.

417
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,750
50 yuan once.

418
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,790
50 yuan for a massage

419
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,480
-and two jin of grapes.
-Really?

420
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,240
Of course.

421
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,070
I'm a doctor from the rehabilitation department of Huhai Hospital.

422
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,030
50 yuan for one massage

423
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,550
and two jin of grapes. Is that okay?

424
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,720
Yes. Yes.

425
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,390
Alright.

426
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:13,880
Line up, please.

427
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,480
One at a time.

428
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,680
One at a time, please.

429
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,500
Where did you go?

430
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,510
I saw you were out of tissues.

431
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,840
So I came to buy new ones.

432
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,690
What about you?

433
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:05,920
Me?

434
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,580
Just wandering around.

435
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,740
Don't worry.

436
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,600
I won't disappear again.

437
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,520
Let's go.

438
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,610
What are you doing?

439
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,990
There are a lot of people.

440
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,110
Excuse me.

441
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,070
Sorry about that.

442
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:39,720
What are you doing?

443
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,030
Excuse me.

444
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,160
Alright.

445
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,270
Take your grapes.

446
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:45,980
Okay.

447
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,430
It's your turn.

448
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,170
Ma'am.

449
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:50,960
Alright.

450
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,640
Is the strength okay?

451
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,550
It's fine.

452
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,240
Look.

453
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,700
Massage with free grapes.

454
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,200
You offered the massage.

455
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,840
You have to finish it.

456
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:09,030
Don't miss out, everyone!

457
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:12,480
We offer professional massages with free grapes here.

458
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,270
Come and take a look!

459
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,830
Relax a bit.

460
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,170
Young man, harder.

461
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,270
Okay.

462
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,180
[Total of grapes: 21,160 jin]

463
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:31,830
[Total of grapes: 21,140 jin]

464
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,800
Finally back.

465
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,480
Xiaoxiao, what's going on?

466
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,950
Aren't we stars?

467
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,810
Is the word "star" so useless now?

468
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,790
Indeed.

469
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,190
I never thought I'd

470
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,290
hear such a shocking saying as

471
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,510
"Five jin for Qin Fei. Ten jin for Luo Xiaoxiao."

472
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,350
in my lifetime.

473
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:02,210
I'm too embarrassed to face Uncle and Aunt now.

474
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,500
Why don't you take us

475
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,110
and let's run away?

476
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,790
You didn't sell the grapes,

477
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,920
and now you want to take away the truck?

478
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,070
What took you so long?

479
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,070
Our grape sale is trending.

480
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,790
The grapes were sold.

481
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,880
All sold.

482
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,720
Really?

483
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:19,350
[Sold out]

484
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:19,560
Really?
[Sold out]

485
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,240
[Total of grapes: 0 jin]
Really?

486
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:20,620
[Total of grapes: 0 jin]

487
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,000
Really sold out?

488
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,050
I told you we're popular.

489
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,520
You hit me so hard.

490
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,310
Come on.

491
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,350
As punishment, you have to carry all these back.

492
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:32,790
No way.

493
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,200
Hurry up and take them back, okay?

494
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:34,840
No.

495
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,880
These dishes

496
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,020
are all homemade by my wife.

497
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,380
To thank everyone

498
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,960
for helping us sell the grapes.

499
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,580
Please enjoy and take your time.

500
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,240
You can't say that.

501
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,510
Even if you didn't help us sell the grapes,

502
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,080
-I’ll treat you to this dinner.
-Yeah.

503
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,680
Right?

504
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,290
Uncle and Aunt's cooking must be delicious.

505
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,890
Let me propose a toast first.

506
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:50,960
Thanks to everyone,

507
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,000
all of you here for your great support,

508
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,150
and the help from our two big stars,

509
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,920
this livestream has been a complete success.

510
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,550
Cheers!

511
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,550
Thank you.

512
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,640
Cheers!

513
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,720
Thank you.

514
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:08,750
To thank our audience in the livestream,

515
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,030
have you decided

516
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,630
how to fulfill your promise?

517
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,160
Well,

518
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,640
if you don't say it, I will.

519
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,100
No, we're still thinking.

520
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,680
Well,

521
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,460
I do have an idea.

522
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,580
I just don't know

523
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,070
if Xiaofei would do it.

524
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,880
I have a dance video here.

525
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,480
I think it's quite easy to learn.

526
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,720
Let me show you first.

527
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,970
I think this dance is quite catchy.

528
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,510
I see the potential for it to go viral.

529
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,750
I want to see Ms. Qin Fei dance this.

530
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:58,400
But I've never danced like this before.

531
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,200
Can I do it?

532
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,120
It's just dancing.

533
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,450
As long as you're happy.

534
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,160
Fei,

535
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,460
you look good dancing anything.

536
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,100
Right.

537
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,550
Yes.

538
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,070
Right.

539
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,510
Qin Fei, you're a professional.

540
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,040
You'll definitely be fine.

541
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:12,880
Xiaoxiao,

542
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,480
that day,

543
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,610
you were in the livestream too, right?

544
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,990
Xiaoxiao,

545
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:23,720
I know

546
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,410
you've never been involved in this kind of activity,

547
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,110
but I believe you can do it.

548
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,920
I watched that video just now.

549
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,880
The dance is quite simple.

550
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,050
I think you can do it.

551
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,600
The most important thing is

552
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:33,920
people

553
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,440
need to be trustworthy.

554
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,270
You can't just abandon

555
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,680
our hard-earned relationship

556
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,110
for the sake of your public image, can you?

557
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,070
Qin Fei, you're emotionally blackmailing me.

558
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,160
Qin Fei.

559
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,120
Alright,

560
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,470
I agree to do it.

561
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,550
Really?

562
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:49,790
Yes.

563
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:52,110
Is there anything Luo Xiaoxiao can't do?

564
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,940
Then the stage...

565
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,110
I'll do it.

566
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:00,380
I'll do it.

567
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,380
I'll do it with him.

568
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,440
We'll make sure to complete the task.

569
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:07,640
Let's eat.

570
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,000
Come on.

571
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,430
Try it, try it now.

572
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,030
Here.

573
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,410
Let's take a break.

574
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,680
No need.

575
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,590
Let's just get to it.

576
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,480
Alright.

577
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,540
People nourished by love

578
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,440
are indeed different.

579
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,070
They seem to have endless energy.

580
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:40,400
I haven't seen you like this in a long time.

581
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,720
It's not that I'm nourished by love.

582
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,780
It's that you lack exercise usually.

583
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,870
Tell me,

584
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:52,960
why do you seem

585
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,520
to be in low spirits lately?

586
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,600
I'm not.

587
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,200
I'm doing fine.

588
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,350
This work is quite tiring.

589
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,480
You have to treat me.

590
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,880
Don't worry.

591
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,260
Anything you want.

How do you plan to design the stage?

610
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,090
I'm not telling you.

611
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,350
I'm begging you.

612
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,070
I swear

613
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,870
I'll keep it absolutely secret.

614
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:02,900
Alright.

615
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:06,050
Take a look at my masterpiece.

616
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,070
I want to design it

617
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,770
to look like this.

618
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,510
Yes.

619
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,510
Right on this platform.

620
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,910
Then the board goes here.

621
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,440
Impressive.

622
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,480
It's really good.

623
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,550
The final look.

624
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,270
How is it?

625
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,240
It looks great.

626
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,750
Really nice.

627
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:25,640
Of course it is.

628
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,720
Let me tell you,

629
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,480
I...

630
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,680
What's wrong?

631
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,390
Did you prick your hand?

632
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,510
It's okay. I think it's stuck in.

633
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,110
It's okay.

634
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,480
How could you be so careless?

635
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,760
It's nothing.

636
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,720
Chubby,

637
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:47,950
I've been reading a lot of love stories lately.

638
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,950
There's a man in one of them

639
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,310
who planted a tree

640
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,130
for the woman for 20 years.

641
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:54,790
He also

642
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,930
kept all the letters they've written,

643
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,320
and took them out

644
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,240
when they got married. So romantic.

645
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,000
Have you been reading novels again

646
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,200
instead of studying?

647
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,340
I need to combine study with rest.

648
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,400
Will we

649
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,220
have a romantic story

650
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,830
to tell everyone?

651
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,200
Alright.

652
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,070
All I know is

653
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,260
if you don't start studying,

654
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:21,690
there will be a melodramatic family drama.

655
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,140
Cheng will look down on you,

656
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,670
and your mom will scold you.

657
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,800
What about you?

658
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,130
In this family drama,

659
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,490
what role will you play?

660
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,880
I'll protect you anyway.

661
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,190
I'm counting on you, Chubby.

662
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,590
Are you ready yet?

663
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,720
We're all set

664
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,340
outside.

665
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,280
Come quickly.

666
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,450
So formal.

667
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,170
Of course it has to be formal.

668
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,590
Otherwise, how could it be worthy of

669
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,480
our goddess Xiaoxiao?

670
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,350
Stop teasing me. I'm so nervous.

671
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,950
I'm afraid it'll be awkward later.

672
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,080
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

673
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,280
Goddesses, are you ready?

674
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,080
Yes.

675
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,610

do you remember

726
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,230
you once told me about

727

a beautiful dream you had?

728
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,530

00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,070
you and I were

00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,110
I dreamed we were on

737
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,310
a beautiful lake, holding hands.

738
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:54,640
It's like we were

739
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,310
the only two people in the world.

740
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,830
Carefree and happy.

741
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,620
In a few years,

742
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,550
if one day

743
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,220
you want to propose to me,

744
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,590
choose a place like this.

745
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,460
I would definitely be very happy

746
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,520
and then

747
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,920
I would say yes, 100%.

748
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,120
Okay?

749
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,310
Okay.

750
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,770
I said it randomly,

751
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:20,880
and you still remember.

752
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,840
Yes.

753
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,600
You also told me

754
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,350
that you're very busy with work,

755
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:27,260
having no time to meet new friends,

756
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,320
and you don't want to spend time getting to know others.

757
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:33,380
So it's better to be with an old acquaintance.

758
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,420
So...

759
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,440
So I was joking,

760
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,460
but you took it seriously.

761
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,760
I know

762
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,820
this part

763
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:47,730
might be different from what you dreamed of,

764
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,530
but I took it seriously.

765
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,030
Xiaoxiao,

766
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,640
you once said

767
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,480
I'm like a wall,

768
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,450
impenetrable.

769
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,370
But I don't want to tear it down.

770
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,200
I want to turn it into a home,

771
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:06,990

00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,070
What's wrong?

917
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:43,710
Today,

918
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,840
I heard from Xixi's uncle and aunt

919
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,490
that they've been getting more guests at their guesthouse lately.

920
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:51,220
They want to expand but don't have money.

921
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,570
I want to invest.

922
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,110
I hope this place will always be here

923
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,480
for five years, ten years,

924
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,550
or even when we're old.

925
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,440
We can always hold hands

926
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:06,380
and sit by the lake where we got engaged.

927
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,410
What do you think?

928
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:08,920
Good, of course.

929
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,090
But about spending money,

930
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:12,100
let me handle it.

931
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,500
Let's talk about that later.

932
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,700
Right now,

933
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,440
there's something more important.

934
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,510
What is it?

935
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:24,540
Having a baby, of course!

936
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:27,580
I...

937
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,850
Didn't I mention before

938
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,800
that I would make you a

939
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,480
remote control system

940
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,670
to monitor pests and diseases in the orchard?

941
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,460
Look,

942
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,650
the blueprint is ready.

to see where there are pests

947
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,550
in the orchard.

948
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,200
I don't understand it.

949
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,010
But it seems impressive.

950
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,280
However, I don't know how to use it now.

951
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,530
You may not know how to use it now,

952
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:50,850
but you will in the future.

953
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,710
Besides, I haven't finished writing the program yet.

954
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:53,970
This is very difficult.

955
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:55,470
Self-study won't be enough.

956
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,680
I need to go to college

957
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,200
and specialize in programming languages.

958
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,360
The "future" you mentioned

959
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,090
seems too far away, doesn't it?

960
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,110
The future

961
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:05,610
won't be that far.

962
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,990
After all, I'm a genius.

963
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:08,070
I might even skip grades

964
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,670
and go to college before Fei.

965
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,760
When I finish it,

966
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,670
I'll teach you how to use it.

Once you've learned it.

00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,070
Uncle and Aunt will definitely be able to relax a lot.

969
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,020
Really?

970
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,770
Can I help them with some things?

971
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,080
Of course.

972
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,650
It's a deal then, little genius.

973
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,080
-Alright.
-You better work hard.

974
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,290

Try it and see

980
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:44,910
if I learnt the real skills from your mom?

981
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,010
I think

982
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,470
it's average, You still need more practice.

983
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:00,130
Well, as your girlfriend,

984
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,530
I'll just have to put up with it

985
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:03,780
and let you cook every day for practice.

986
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,200

Yes.

00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:11,280
Thank you.

991
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,690
Xiaofei,

992
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,550
I went to see Ge Wu.

993
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,640
I also went to the psychiatric department at the hospital.

994
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,170
When did you go?

995
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,450
Why didn't you tell me?

996
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,790
The expert suggested that I

997
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,910
take some medication to alleviate the symptoms

998
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,910
and start the follow-up treatment.

999
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:48,230
Of course you need to take medicine when you're sick.

1000
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,280
But next time you go,

1001
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:49,920
you must tell me.

1002
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,850
I'll go with you.

1003
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,340
The follow-up treatment

1004
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,700
is semi-closed.

1005
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:04,190
The whole course will probably take about two months.

1006
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,460
I'll go by myself.

1007
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,850
What does semi-closed mean?

1008
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,150
It means...

1009
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,630
during this period,

1010
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:18,100
I won't be able to see you.

1011
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:20,320
No phone calls or messages either.

1012
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,140
You're going to disappear and hide from me again.

1013
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,400
What did we say before?

1014
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,540
Didn't we agree to face it together?

1015
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,070
Why are you-

1016
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:25,600
Xiaofei,

1017
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:27,030
listen to me.

1018
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,930
I'm not disappearing

1019
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,330
or avoiding you.

1020
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,090
It's necessary for the treatment.

1021
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:33,920
I need to be in a

relatively closed environment,

1023
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,440
away from all close

1024
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,640
and familiar people,

1025
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,370
to keep my feelings and emotions

1026
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:42,220
in a calm state.

1027
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:43,130
Ge Wu also said

1028
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:43,840
that this might be

1029
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,070
the best approach

1030
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:46,310
for my treatment right now.

1031
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,860
Are you really not lying to me?

1032
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,050
You're not hiding anything from me, are you?

1033
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:51,050
No.

1034
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:53,970
But if I have to say,

1035
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:55,000
I do have a little bit of

1036
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,230
a selfish reason.

1037
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,720
I just want

1038
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,910
my image in your heart

1039
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,270
to always be perfect.

1040
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,650
Just consider it as me being willful for once, okay?

1041
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:16,280
Alright.

1042
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:19,710
Since you told me in advance,

1043
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:21,790
two months it is then.

1044
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:24,000
However,

1045
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:26,110
after two months,

1046
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:27,110
you need to return to me

1047
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,880
a healthy boyfriend.

1048
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,030
Pinky promise?

1049
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:32,370
Pinky promise.

1050
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:35,630
I promise you.

1051
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:40,500
Alright, let's eat.

1052
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,590
Oh, by the way,

1053
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:45,570
we're almost out of laundry pods at home.

1054
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:46,880
And some other daily necessities

1055
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,640
need to be bought gradually.

1056
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:50,180
I'll make a list for you

1057
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,580
and send it to your phone.

1058
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:53,800
Take good care of yourself while I'm away.

1059
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,090
I'm worried about you.

1060
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,000
Xing Zhizhi,

1061
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,030
I've lived this long before I met you.

1062
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:00,960
Don't worry.

1063
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,620
Just focus on getting better.

1064
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:05,300
I have my own things to do these two months.

1065
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:07,360
Xingyi is signing new artists,

1066
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,890
and I need to help with that.

1067
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:11,500
I believe in you.

1068
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:12,570
You're the best.

1069
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:14,040
Let's eat.

1070
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:18,970
Have some vegetables.

1071
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:21,400
Some shrimp as well.

1072
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,710
Okay, I got it.
