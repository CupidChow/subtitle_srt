It's still difficult to elicit his normal emotional responses,

9
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,180
and his reaction to the medication has been stronger than expected.

10
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,220
What if we don't rely on medication?

Dr. Xing,

186
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,610
I actually owe you a thank you.

187
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,410

188
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,330
If you hadn't treated me immediately back then,

today,

190
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,320
I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to stand up.

191
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,200
How else would I have the chance

192
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,080
to run and play with them?

193
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,450
It's what I was supposed to do.

194
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,190
It would be wrong not to do it well.

195
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,650
Doing what needs to be done well

196
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,650
is such a precious thing.

197

If it weren't for you, Dr. Xing,

198
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,560
there wouldn't be this story

199
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,290

200
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,000

00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,740
I want to be with you forever.

566
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,710
♫Till forever♫

567
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,860

♫Once more, I meet you♫

571
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:21,950
♫No doubt I've decided to love you♫

572
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,810
♫Your eyes light up the past♫

573
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:31,330
♫Light up the heart♫

574
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,380
♫So no more alone♫

575
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,670
♫When I dream of all the seasons♫

576
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,590
♫I wanna be with you♫

577
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:48,580
♫Till the sunlight so deeply falls in line♫

578
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,660
♫When you're down, while waiting or smiling♫

579
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,960
♫I'll be with you♫

580
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,650
♫It's time to go♫

♫The stars shining for you♫

582
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,900
♫I need to be with you♫

583
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,140
♫No matter why♫

584
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,950
♫Answer my call♫

585
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,080
♫Dreaming, lonely, feeling♫

586
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:21,320
♫Let me be with you♫

587
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,740
♫Because I cannot♫

588
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:32,240
♫Without you in my heart♫

589
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:43,890
Mom, you have no idea.

590
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,540
Xing changed several tailor shops

591
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,460
because of the suits.

592
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,360
He said since he'd maintained his figure so well,

593
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,230
he couldn't risk looking bad in ill-fitting clothes

594
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,760
at such an important moment.

595
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,090
Oh, right.

596
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,750
He sent over a lot of photos too.

597
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,350
-Let me see.
-Let me show you.

598
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:00,340
This is the orphanage there.

599
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:02,740
He's been helping many children there.

600
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,620
This one is the starry sky in Suman.

601
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,910
The stars there are so bright.

602
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,470
And the desert.

603
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:12,410
There are many camels and sheep.

604
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,480
This one is so cute.

605
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,800
So cute.

606
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,880
Why isn't he in any of the photos?

607
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,300
He said he doesn't like being photographed.

608
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,730
Isn't that annoying?

609
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,060
Oh, him.

610
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:37,690
Xiaofei.

611
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:41,250
Thank you.

612
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,200
He's so willful,

613
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,550
yet you're still willing to tolerate him.

614
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:47,670
Before,

615
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:49,330
he said he wanted to provide medical aid

616
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:51,660
in places around the world where he's needed.

617
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,390
I had nothing to say about that.

618
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,700
But now that

619
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:56,290
you're married,

620
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,820
and he's still like this.

621
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:59,010
Indeed.

622
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:02,900
But you know him;

623
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:04,740
he's kinder than anyone.

624
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,720
Whatever happens,

625
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,650
he's willing to take responsibility for everything.

626
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:09,570
Mom,

627
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,490
because the medical situation in Suman is particularly bad right now,

628
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:14,690
he plans to stay there for another year.

629
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,070
Another year?

630
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,300
He should at least

631
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,100
come back and discuss it with us.

632
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:23,920
The conditions over there...

633
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,480
Alright, Mom.

634
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,290
You know your own son best.

635
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,510
He acts on impulse.

636
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:29,630
He wouldn't have the mind

637
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,690
to come back and ask for your opinion.

638
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,960
You don't need to

639
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,940
defend him in front of us.

640
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,340
He's just being willful.

641
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:41,490
You can't talk about your brother like that.

642
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,000
See?

643
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,480
She can criticize him,

644
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,880
but we can't say anything bad about her son.

645
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,270
Xiaofei,

646
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,990
you must have a lot to do with your dance troupe, right?

647
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,070
Don't waste your time here.

648
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:52,960
Hurry back.

649
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,060
I've got this.

650
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,570
Don't worry about me; I'm fine.

651
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,620
Go back.

652
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,570
I'll be leaving now.

653
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:00,280
Okay.

654
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,280
Xiaofei,

655
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:06,810
you have a lot on your plate too.

656
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:09,430
You don't have to keep coming here to visit Mom.

657
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,030
Bye.

658
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,140
♫Star in your eyes♫
