Fei,

208
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,910
it's way too expensive.

209
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,910
We can't afford to rent it right now.

But it's in the slides.

211

you can't keep

217
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,700
Besides the venue, there are costs

Are you planning to cover everything?

Mr. Ren has approved the budget

and we should manage from there.

222

Absolutely not.

00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,220
I'll go get some water.

380
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,270
Xiaoxiao, I'll put your phone over there.

381
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,060
Okay.

382
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,350
Feifei,

383
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,350
is this ring the one

384
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,750
you're endorsing?

385
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,200
But this one isn't sponsored.

386
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,550
My husband bought it as our wedding ring.

387
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,270
Congratulations, Xiaoxiao!

388
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,150
You're getting married.

389
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,150
Congratulations, congratulations!

390
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,090
Wishing you happiness.

391
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,030
He's not in the industry,

392
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,140
so we're keeping it low-key.

393
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,540
I haven't made it public.

394
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,030
All set?

395
00:18:59,210 --> 00:18:59,720
Here.

396
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:00,790
Thank you.

They are here.

I'll head over myself

00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,600
after finishing my styling.

402
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,240
Okay, okay, okay.

403
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,430
Mr. Chen,

404
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,270
Xiaoxiao getting married is such big news.

405
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,960
Why didn't you tell us?

406
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,000
We almost said something wrong today—

407
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,590
it was so awkward!

Hey, Xiaoxiao.

Hey, Shen.

412
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,110
There's something I forgot to tell you.

413
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,640
What is it?

414
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,720
I got married.

415
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:32,640
Sorry,

416
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,160
I should've told you sooner.

417
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,000
No problem.

418
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,800
It's not too late now.

Thank you.

421
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,410
And I was thinking,

422
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,550
maybe I should bring on

423
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,450
an assistant manager now.

424
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,890
I get it.

425
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,550
I've already found someone,

426
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,790
and they're going through the onboarding process.

427
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,340
Thank you, Shen.

428
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,160
And as for PR,

429
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,690
I think we don't need to keep it a secret.

430
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,040
Let's just let it flow naturally.

431
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,240
I understand.

00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:01,660

there's no need to hide it.

Not yet.

Handle their onboarding as soon as possible.

00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,890
Most importantly,

468
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,350
it's at a bargain price.

00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,680

470
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,290
find such a deal?

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,740

See?

The ceiling height

479
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,960
is no less than five meters.

00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,720
The flooring

481
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,680
is already done by the owner.

482
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,040
How do you like it?

483
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,000
Let's check

484
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,160
the lighting.

485
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,510
It's 360 degrees,

486
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,720
bright from morning to night,

487
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,680
very transparent

488
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,420
from left to right.

489
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:55,400
This place used to be

00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,790
a bar,

491
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:59,000
originally a storage space for the owner.

492
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,720
Later,

493
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,160
the bar owner

494
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,360
expanded

495
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,520
and moved to a new warehouse,

496
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,000
so

497
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,160
they decided to

498
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,230
sublet this space.

499
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:08,920
Don't be fooled by the appearance.

500
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,190
It may not look new,

501
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,110
but it even comes with

502
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,870
its own dormitory.

503
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,760
It also has...

00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,440
Where did you find

505
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,640
someone so unreliable?

506
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,770
-There's a kitchen too.
-I...

507
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,860
And this lounge area

508
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,440
is quite...

00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,110
Stop bragging about this place.

510
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:23,610
It's so remote.

511
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:24,870
We're almost in the suburbs.

512
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:25,500
Miss,

513
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,080
being a bit farther is actually better.

514
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,140
It's outside the city,

515
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,730
so you can do

516
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,380
whatever you want—

517
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,250
play music,

518
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,380
and no one will complain.

519
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,230
Isn't that right?

520
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,670
But you told me on the phone

521
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,190

Look at this building.

527
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,670
The stairs feel like they could collapse at any moment.

528
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,150
I'm telling you, if we're going to rent it,

529
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,540
it needs to be cheaper than dirt cheap.

530
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,840
I want to ask about the owner here.

531
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,050
You said the owner here

532
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,320
is rich and a bit reckless.

533
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,400
Is his surname Chen?

534
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,160
Yes.

535
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,070
I see.

536
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,510
You've decided so quickly.

537
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,230
So, shall we settle on this?

538
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,210
No need; we won't rent it.

539
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,360
Wait, Miss,

540
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,160
We can

541
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,720
negotiate the budget.

542
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,590
This is double-headed abalone imported from South Africa.

543
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,510
Quick, try it!

544
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:14,310
I have a feeling

545
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,640
that after eating all this,

546
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,240
I'll just fall

547
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,930
into a big trap you've set?

548
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,550
We've known each other for so many years.

549
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:22,280
What nonsense are you talking about? Just try it!

550
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,270
Come on,

551
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,650
what's the matter?

552
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,310
As long as it's not illegal...

553
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:30,610
How could I let you break the law?

554
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,460
Qin Fei,

555
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,400
what exactly do you want to say?

556
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,160
Just eat! You try first.

557
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,030
This is a long story,

558
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,490
and I need to say it slowly.

559
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,020
Try it and see if it's good.

560
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,360
Are you alright?

561
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,390
It's a bit hot.

562
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,860
-Slow down.
-Go ahead.

563
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,750
You know I used to dance

564
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:55,630
before entering

565
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,290
the entertainment industry, right?

566
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,790
I was in a dance troupe called Zhongkun.

567
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,960
It's a very reputable dance group,

568
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,070
and I'm still good friends

569
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,810
with the dancers there.

570
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,430
And then?

571
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,530
Because the environment has changed,

572
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:11,710
Zhongkun disbanded

573
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:12,990
due to funding issues.

574
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,390
So, I took over the whole troupe.

575
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,790
Now I'm its manager,

576
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,590
and I've developed a great plan

577
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,000
for the group.

578
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,240
I believe it will do much better

579
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,570
than it currently does.

580
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,350
However,

581
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,400
starting anything is difficult,

582
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,650
and I need help from Mr. Chen.

583
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,700
The dance troupe lacks funds?

584
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,160
But honestly, I have no money right now.

585
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,070
You do have. Why wouldn't you?

586
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,110
Don't you have that abandoned warehouse

587
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:49,520
outside the north ring road?

588
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,520
You want to rent it?

589
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,400
And you want it cheap.

590
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,290
Name your price.

591
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,300
Ten thousand a month?

592
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,350
Ten thousand a year?

593
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,930
Qin Fei, aren't you being a bit unrealistic?

594
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:06,950
Ten thousand a year

595
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,220
comes to just over 800 yuan a month.

596
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,820
Why don't you just rob me?

597
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:10,720
No,

598
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,970
I mean I'll rent it for a year,

599
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,300
but won't pay you a dime.

600
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,940
However, I can endorse your bar for free for a year.

601
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,620
Isn't that a good deal?

602
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,360
I've checked your place out;

603
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,010
it's empty and poorly decorated.

604
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:23,880
I heard it hasn't been rented out in ages.

605
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,440
If you can't rent it out,

606
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,010
why not let me use it for free?

607
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:27,930
This way, you can be

608
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,190
my honorary investor,

609
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:29,740
right?

610
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,990
Come on, come on.

611
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,820
Take it, take it, take it.

612
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,480
This is a win-win for us.

613
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,110
Thank you.

614
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,590
My honorary investor.

615
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:38,660
Come on.

616
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,940
Drink up.

617
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:44,830
After this sip,

618
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,550
we'll be business partners.

619
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,550
Thank you.

620
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,590
You know, after knowing you for so long,

621
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,920
I feel like you're getting more handsome!

622
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,510
Qin Fei.

623
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,780
You really don't need to go through all this.

624
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,130
If you want to talk about it,

625
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:59,750
I can just give it to you directly.

626
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,610
I know you're a good person. Eat up.

627
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:02,270
Quick, eat.

628
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,820
Don't waste it.

629
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,560
What about yours?

630
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,610
I can't afford that much.

631
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,490
Eat up.

632
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:32,350
[Ms. Ge]
[Reject]

633
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,240
Hello, Qin Fei.

634
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,430
Hello, Dr. Ge.

635
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,350
Sorry

636
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,880
for disturbing you so late.

637
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,000
It's fine. What's up?

638
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,070
I wanted to ask

639
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,870
about Xing Zhizhi's condition.

640
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,110
I've been in touch

641
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,160
with his psychiatrist.

642
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,090
His recovery is going pretty well.

643
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:56,940
That's good to hear.

644
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,370
Thanks.

645
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,830
Sorry, Anji.

646
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,620
I forgot.

647
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:21,550
I got so busy

648
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:22,430
that I forgot to get you food.

649
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,060
I'll go get it right now.

650
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,580
Hello? Hello? Hello?

651
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:49,520
Ren Siqi.

652
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,040
Did you forget to buy dog food again?

653
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,570
Didn't I tell you?

654
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,720
What can I rely on you for

655
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,040
if you can't remember anything?

656
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,980
You forgot the milk

657
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,830
and forgot the veggies.

658
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,590
When can you

659
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,200
keep what I say in mind?

660
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,200
Next time,

661
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,160
when Anji goes to your place,

662
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,310
you need to do both internal and external deworming.

663
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,350
If you forget again,

664
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,710
we're not done here.

665
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:13,720
I really don't know

666
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,070
what's on your mind.

667
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,550
Five, six, seven, go.

668
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:25,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

669
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,160
Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

670
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,960
Good.

671
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:31,920
Good.

672
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,550
Arm extension.

673
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,790
Yes, little quick steps under your feet.

674
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,790
Alright.

675
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,530
Good.

676
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,030
One.

677
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,130
Stop, stop, stop, Ren Siqi.

678
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,270
I'm telling you, we're not taking

679
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,520
any of those commercial performances.

680
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,750
What do you think our dance troupe is?

681
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,280
I don't care who the boss is.

682
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,150
By the way,

683
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:50,570
I have to go to Guangzhou on Thursday,

684
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:51,550
then to Chengdu on Friday,

685
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,960
and I'll be back on Sunday.

686
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,830
Arrange things yourself during this period.

687
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,180
Alright, alright.

688
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,880
What do you think, Big Movie Star?

689
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,680
Not bad here, huh?

690
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,720
It's good.

691
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,260
How did you find this place?

692
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:09,820
This...

693
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:11,450
This logo looks so familiar.

694
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:13,320
It's for a reason.

695
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,910
You don't recognize it?

696
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,510
When Chen Shen was pursuing you back then,

697
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,240
he had a Zero Degree Bar.

698
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,200
This used to be the warehouse

699
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,550
for Zero Degree Bar.

700
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,960
Everything you see here,

701
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,400
including these training outfits,

702
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,550
was sponsored by Mr. Chen.

703
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,110
So he's turned to good deeds, huh?

704
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,790
What do you mean by good deeds?

705
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,970
This is a proper business cooperation.

706
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,110
Don't be fooled by

707
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,270
how unreliable Chen Shen seems;

708
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,540
his business sense

709
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,820
is really impressive.

710
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,230
Yeah, okay.

711
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:50,700
By the way,

712
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,450
how's Xing Zhizhi been lately?

713
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,750
We haven't been in touch recently,

714
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,700
so I don't know.

715
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:01,390
Haven't seen him in a while, have you?

716
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,630
Do you miss him?

717
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,830
It's 3:30 now.

718
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:10,960
I have a high school

719
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,070
math crash course at four-thirty,

720
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,030
so I'll head over.

721
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:13,640
I'm sorry.

722
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,460
Take a look around by yourself for a while.

723
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,050
I'm leaving.

724
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:15,660
Qin Fei.

725
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,020
Bye-bye.

726
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,640
Come eat.

727
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,610
Your favorite mustard greens filling.

728
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:49,170
Here.

729
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:58,590
I think something's off with Qin Fei.

730
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,270
Fei hasn't been

731
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,370
in touch with Xing Zhizhi

732
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,480
for two or three weeks

733
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,790
I don't know what's going on.

734
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,860
She's been so busy with

735
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,960
the dance troupe

736
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,280
and the crash courses,

737
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,380
and she's even talking with me

738
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,110
about performances every day.

739
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,500
Busy...

740
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:19,880
Isn't being busy a good thing?

741
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,000
What's good about it?

742
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,800
You didn't see how she was today.

743
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,030
She's keeping herself busy

744
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,620
to distract herself.

745
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:28,850
The busier she gets, the more it shows she has something on her mind.

746
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:30,920
I'm afraid she'll break down

747
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,860
before she even sees Xing Zhizhi.

748
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,390
How do you know?

749
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,350
Because of you,

750
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:40,930
my bodyguard who dumped me.

751
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,920
Liu Yanze.

752
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,370
I want to figure out a way to help Qin Fei.

753
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:47,440
How?

754
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,920
By finding Xing Zhizhi.

755
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,090
Xing Zhizhi?

756
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,750
But didn't the doctor say

757
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,150
during his recovery,

758
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,720
they shouldn't meet?

759
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:57,550
You silly.

760
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,000
That they shouldn't meet

is more about Xing Zhizhi can't see Qin Fei.

762
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,610
It doesn't mean Qin Fei can't see him.

763
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,700
The key is

764
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,550
we don't know

765
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,480
which rehabilitation center he's in.

766
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,140
Are you stupid? What's your mouth for?

767
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:14,870
We can ask.

768
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,230
My wife is so smart.

769
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,630
Come on, have some more.

770
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,880
No, no more.

about Xing Zhizhi.

How do you know?

781
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,510
Miss Luo,

782
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,600
I surf the internet too.

783
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,530
Aren't you and Qin Fei good friends?

784
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:39,350
Also,

00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,900
he just said everything

during hypnosis.

787
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,610
I fell asleep just now.

788
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,120
I just...

789
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,920
Really.

790
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,870
Tell the truth,

791
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,170
what's going on with you two?

792
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:05,570
We're fine.

793
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,110
If everything's fine, why were you there?

794
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,110
You're only being photographed together;

795
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,040
that's no big deal.

796
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,760
But you were seen

797
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,020
going to a psychologist.

798
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,620
Can it not raise suspicions?

799
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,470
Will these photos

800
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,390
affect Xiaoxiao's work?

801
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,260
Did she go there to accompany you?

802
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,400
Let them speculate if they want to.

803
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,230
I never planned

804
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,830
to hide our marriage anyway.

805
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,850
We can keep it private

806
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,110
and just do

807
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,760
what's best

808
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,630
for Xiaoxiao.

809
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,700
We'll talk about this later,

810
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,740
but I need to know why first

811
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,130
so I know what to do next.

812
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,330
We went to help Qin Fei.

813
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:50,210
She's worried about Xing Zhizhi,

814
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,720
which is why we went to find out

815
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,360
where he's being treated.

816
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,180
Anyway, now

817
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,770
we need to come up with a plan.

818
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:00,110
We can't let this involve Qin Fei

819
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:00,920
or Xing Zhizhi.

820
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,920
What should we do?

821
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,270
Here's the thing:

822
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:19,440
until this is resolved,

823
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,570
don't say anything.

824
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,960
I'll figure out how to handle it next.

826
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,400
please.

827
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,210
If I say

828
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,630
that keeping the marriage secret

829
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,100
is the best choice for Xiaoxiao's career,

830
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:45,960
are you really okay with that?

831
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,890
I'm fine with it.

832
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,550
What about me?

833
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,230
Do you mind

834
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,090
if I'm still Xiaoxiao's manager?

835
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,280
As long as it's good for Xiaoxiao's career,

836
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,140
I can accept it unconditionally.

do you remember what I told you

842
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,360
when I went to the inn to find you?

843
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,870
As long as I can be with you,

844
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:55,590
I don't care about anything else.

845
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,720
I do care.

Why are you

849
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,830
always hiding?

850
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:05,330
Liu Yanze,

851
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,280
do you lack confidence

852
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:09,220
in yourself

853
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,400
or in us,

854
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,070
in our relationship?

856
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:24,330
I chose not to go public

857
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,000
because I know

858
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:29,150
how hard it's been for you

or harm you

865
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,660
and your career.

866
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,430
I'm not afraid.

Of course, I'll listen to my employer.

so busy?

896
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,830
It's because of Xing Zhizhi.

964
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,630
Hello everyone, I'm Luo Xiaoxiao.

965
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:00,000
The reason for this video

966
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,760
is that there have been some rumors

967
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,440
about me online recently.

968
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:05,160
I've been troubled for a long time,

969
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:07,700
but I've decided

970
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,880
to give a response

971
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,610
to those

972
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,970
who like and support me.

973
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,120
It's true that I went to a psychological clinic,

974
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,370
but it's different

975
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:17,070
from what's being said online.

976
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:18,800
I don't have a mental illness,

977
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,850
but I may continue

978
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:22,460
to visit in the future

979
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:23,880
because...

980
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:31,790
Because

981
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,680
I'm married.

982
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:40,880
The person who was with me

983
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,480
at that time is my other half.

984
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:45,690

00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,600
he's the captain of the Xiaoyun Rescue Team.

00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:55,240

You're really something, aren't you?

1006
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,060
But you went to find Ge Wu for a marriage check-up;

1007
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,500
why does that sound...

1008
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:23,220
It's all because of you.

1009
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,280
I saw you worrying about

1010
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,630
Xing Zhizhi, looking all distracted.

1011
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:28,090
So, I discussed with Liu Yanze

1012
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:29,730
whether we could

1013
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:30,890
find out

1014
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,730
where Xing Zhizhi was hiding.

1015
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:33,620
As a result...

1016
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:36,990

1017
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:39,160
you're really good to me.

1018

Don't make that face.

1019
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:42,070
I haven't been much help.

1020
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:43,510
I didn't find where he is.

1021
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:47,860
So,

1022
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,180
where's Xing Zhizhi hiding?

1023
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,200
I don't know either.

1024
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:03,190
This is the rehab center

1025
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:06,040
where Xing Zhizhi is staying.

1026
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:08,240
If you want to see him, go ahead,

1027
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,010
but keep it quiet.

1028
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,970
And don't tell anyone I told you.

1029
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:15,750
Xing Zhizhi has been found!

1030
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:17,150
But how does Ren Siqi know

1031
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:19,280
which rehabilitation center he's in?

1032
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,780
Is this reliable?

1033
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:28,960
Hello. The number you have dialed is currently busy.
