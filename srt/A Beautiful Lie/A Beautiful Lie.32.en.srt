It doesn't taste as good as the old oil did.

00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,910
Why aren't you eating?

8
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,200
I didn't do well on the exam, so I'm not in the mood.

9
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,840
Look over there!

10
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,400
What a big teddy bear!

11
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,630
Do adults also like plush toys?

12
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,670
I learned from a book

13
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,140
that many plush toys

14
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,980
feel almost like human skin.

15
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,850
When you're feeling down,

16
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,730
hugging one can cheer you up.

17
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,920
I really want one too.

18
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,650
Here, give it to me.

00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,960
-Come on.

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,900

[Qin Xiaofei, I miss you so much]

Qin Xiaofei,

23
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,160
today is the 25th day of treatment.

24
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,120
I slept 9 hours yesterday.

25
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,250
It's very quiet here,

26
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,220
and the air is particularly good.

27
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,510
In the morning, I can even hear the birds singing.

28
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,550
I feel like I've gotten a little better.

29
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,450
Today's breakfast

30
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,000
is milk, black pepper beef sandwich,

31
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,180
along with strawberries and bananas.

32
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,320
I heard that they produce white tea here.

33
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,100
I had some yesterday.

34
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,890
It has a very light and fragrant taste.

35
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,520
What are you doing now?

36
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,250
Qin Xiaofei,

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,360

00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,190
Wait, wait. What are you doing?

41
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,160
Fei, it's me, it's me.

42
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,650
You scared me to death.

43
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,560
Where did that person go?

44
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,600
-I've been looking for him for a long time.
-Fei,

45
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,910
I've figured it all out.

46
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,000
This rehabilitation center

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
is divided into two parts.

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,720
The front is for accommodations,

49
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,070
and we also perform here.

50
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,870
Further inside,

51
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,140
it's more high-end and private,

52
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,810
specializing in rehabilitation vacations,

with a medical team on site.

54
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,680
You said Xing Zhizhi is inside there, right?

55
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,410
I think so.

56
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,340
I'm leaving.

57
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,690
Fei,

58
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,610
don't forget the small cake you made.

59
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,600
Here.

60
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,750
-You mustn't let Xing Zhizhi see you.

61
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,190

Where exactly is he?

Brother, let's go.

71
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,190
The big black bear looks fierce.

00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,040
I'm clearly a beautiful princess bear.

73
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,660
Black bear? Poor eyesight.

Are you alright?

75
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,520
Did you get hurt?

76
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,040
May I...

77
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,760
Get up first. Come on.

78
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,120

79
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,320
to get some fresh air?

80
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,320
You can't take it off?

81
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,750
Well, why can't you speak?

82
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,450
Dolls can't talk.

83
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,600
Alright, very professional.

What did Director Li say?

115

He thinks my medication dosage is too low

116
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:57,890
and suggested I increase it.

120

00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,020
So you accepted this treatment plan?

124
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,480

that I would return to her side as soon as possible.

Since you've already decided,

00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,980
I'll do my best to assist you. Just keep a calm mindset

Not really.

00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,300
I just bumped into a teddy bear.

138
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,830
It must be part of some activity at the rehabilitation center.

I'm looking for your boss, Ren Siqi!

How did Qin Fei know Xing Zhizhi was there?

150
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,650
Ren Siqi, don't play dumb with me.

151
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,410
You're the only one who's been to my office.

152
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,050
Was it you who turned off the office surveillance?

153
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,080
Yes.

154
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,410
You're quite honest.

155
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,220
You've left me at a loss.

156
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,510
Ren Siqi, how could you do this?

157
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,240
You even learned to steal, huh?

158
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,440
How could you say that? What are you talking about?

159
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,090
Don't interrupt me.

160
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,750
I'm not finished yet.

161
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,980
I'm telling you,

162
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,510
Xing Zhizhi is my patient.

163
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,270
Don't let your personal matters

164
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,530
interfere with my patient's treatment.

165
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,290
This is

166
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,820
Dr. Xing's therapist?

167
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,770
You know her?

168
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,580
Oh, I know her really well.

169
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,200
Please don't get angry, okay?

170
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,410
If there are any issues,

171
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,600
we can solve them step by step, right?

172
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
Ren Siqi, I'm telling you,

173
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,430
your actions aren't hurting me;

174
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,720
they're hurting Qin Fei and Xing Zhizhi.

175
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,620
Was Qin Fei discovered?

176
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,050
No, she wasn't.

177
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,740
Then it's no big deal.

178
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,320
What do you mean by "no big deal"?

179
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,300
Just because nothing has happened doesn't mean it's fine.

180
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,290
I really can't stand you anymore, Ren Siqi.

181
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,790
You have no sense of boundaries at all.

182
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,980
You have no bottom line.

183
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,240
You were like this when we were dating,

184
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:15,960
like this in our marriage,

185
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,870
and now that we're about to get divorced,

186
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,060
you still haven't changed!

187
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,120
Right, we're about to get divorced.

188
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,780
What is there for me to change?

189
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,590
Fine.

190
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,370
I had the lawyer revise the divorce agreement.

191
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,480
Just wait for the email.

192
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,210
I won't receive it.

193
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,470
I forgot the password.

194
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:37,830
Let me tell you,

195
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,900
if you dare to give Anji spicy ribs again,

196
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,160
I'll make sure you never see it again in your life.

197
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,670
I'm taking it for a check-up next month.

198
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,970
If there's anything wrong,

199
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:45,850
just you wait.

200
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,510
Anji loves spicy ribs.

201
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,720
I boiled them seven times.

202
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,320
I tasted them, and they weren't salty at all.

203
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,050
I don't believe your nonsense!

204
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,690
Still working, huh?

205
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,850
So this is the one you've been telling us about,

206
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,320
your childhood sweetheart

207
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,080
and later the supporting,

208
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,450
gentle, virtuous wife,

209
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,590
Mrs. Ren?

210
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,450
Alright, don't tell anyone.

211
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,630
Get off work early. Goodbye.

212
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:16,820
I'm leaving.

213
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,970
I talked to Ge Wu again today.

214
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,250
The treatment is already halfway through.

215
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,640
Starting tomorrow,

216
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,320
the medication dosage will be increased again.

217
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,620
It will be another adjustment process.

218
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,850
But as long as I have something to look forward to,

219
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,850
the days won't be too hard to endure.

220
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,760
I really want to eat the sweet and sour pork from Yang's Restaurant.

221
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,400
I also miss my family and friends,

222
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,640
and Qin Fei.

223
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,840
She's waiting for you.

224
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,640
Qin Xiaofei seems cold and fickle,

225
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:16,700
but she is actually very soft-hearted and values relationships deeply.

226
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,300
She likes to lie.

227
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,420
She said she loves money a lot,

228
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,110
but actually, she can abandon everything she has

229
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:25,660
to start over to pursue her dream.

230
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,930

Look, I've only made these few major categories.

233
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:34,470
Look, I've only made these few major categories.

234
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,960
And what do you think of this stage?

235
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,320
I think this part

236
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:38,780
can be bigger.

Hello.

248
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,870
I need a car for five o'clock tomorrow morning.

249
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,340
There are 12 of us.

250

-250.

256
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,770
Are you guys playing drinking games or discussing the budget?

257
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,240
Qin Fei, 150 thousand is really enough.

258
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,920
Let's not spend

259
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,970
unnecessary money, okay?

260
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,060
Real flower petals for the fairy flower scattering?

261
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,200
Let's switch to paper ones.

262
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,630
Real flower petals look beautiful; we can't save money on that.

263
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,920
Okay. So this one.

264
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,770
Each point here is a drone?

265
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,010
Count how many there are.

266
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:51,140
This won't work; it's too expensive.

267
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,900
The designer has already been hired. It's a must.

This is the last performance.

271
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,240
We must leave a deep impression

272
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,590
so that the audience can feel the lingering effect

273
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,880
even after they get home.

274
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,200
And the promotion. The promotion!

275
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,640
Can we not cut back on that?

276
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,640
Sure. Then why don't you just sell?

277
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,660
Who would buy you?

278
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,220
Qin Fei, I can agree,

279
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,390
but the money really won't allow it.

280
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,000
If that's the case, I'll have to call for backup.

281
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,730
Dr. Ge Wu should help me, right?

282
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:24,700
I told her.

283
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,760
We insiders should know that.

284
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,860
Add another 50,000. 200,000 at most.

285
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,660
Deal.

286
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,480
Thank you.

287
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,730
The original plan was 200,000.

288
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,420
How about we negotiate a bit more?

289
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,220
-How about 180 thousand?
-No.

290
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,920
No, we've already made a deal.

291
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,170
Anji,

292
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,360
has Mommy been late again?

293
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,570
Mommy is never on time, right?

294
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,160
Do you think Mommy is bad?

295
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,620
Is she doing it on purpose?

296
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,580
Who are you calling bad?

297
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,880
Anji, come here.

298
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,760
Come here.

299
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,330
Oh, right. Well...

300
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:22,280
I've given you the divorce agreement for a long time.

301
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,880
It's not that simple.

302
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,850
The company is currently under a betting agreement.

303
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,460
As the boss, I have to

304
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,440
carefully review every contract.

305
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,830
Carefully review?

306
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:33,620
I'm not asking for shares of Xingyi.

307
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,150
You're unkind to me, but I can't be unkind to you.

308
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,680
Who are you calling unkind?

309
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,400
I'm unkind, I'm unkind.

310
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,840
We're about to get divorced.

311
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,520
I'm not the type to take advantage.

312
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,430
I will give you what you're entitled to.

313
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,390
When?

314
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,270
Are you that eager?

315
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,520
I'm dead eager.

316
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,580
Alright, I'll push the legal team, okay?

317
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,670
Ren Siqi...

318
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,470
Don't you want to get divorced?

319
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,390
I think you're the one who doesn't want to get divorced.

320
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,610
I'll give you everything you're entitled to.

321
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,170
But I found Anji.

322
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,830
You can't take it away.

323
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,140
That's final.

324
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,510
Anji, let's go!

that Director Li adjusted from last time.

330
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,350
After increasing the medication dosage for half a month,

331
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,670
your condition has shown significant improvement.

332
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:48,480
In the last two weeks,

333
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,980
your condition has become increasingly stable.

334
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,180
Xiaojia hasn't appeared again, right?

335
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,720
Not even once.

336
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,550
Do you still think about things from the past?

337
00:20:58,990 --> 00:20:59,850
Occasionally.

338
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:03,160
But I feel my emotions have settled down a lot,

339
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,750
and I feel much more relaxed.

340
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,310
All your indicators are normal.

341
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,550
Your overall condition

342
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,210
is in line with expectations.

343
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,130
Your recent condition

344
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,740
looks quite stable.

345
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,490
I think you can return to a normal life now.

346
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,090
Is that so? That's good.

347
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,150
What's wrong, Xing Zhizhi?

348
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,560
It seems that

349
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,260
you are not happy.

350
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,220
No, not at all.

351
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,580
My emotions and condition

352
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,080
are much better than before.

353
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,430
And I haven't seen Xiaojia again.

354
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,260
But I still feel like

355
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,750
something is a bit different.

356
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,330
Tell me more specifically.

357
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,690
I don't know, I don't know.

Xing Zhizhi,

359
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,230
I think you can try to relax a bit first,

360
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,930
return to your previous life,

361
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:21,550
and interact with people you're familiar with and close to,

362
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,790
like Qin Fei,

363
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:23,960

364
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,160
and friends.

365
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,890

Let me tell you something really funny.

385
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,790
Once, I was arranging a surgery,

387
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,110
came to me

388
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:27,990
and said, "Doctor, do you have any antibiotics

389
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,680
that don't kill bacteria?"

390
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,860
What does that mean?

391
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,670
Right? I was really puzzled at the time too.

392
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:34,780
So I said,

"What do you mean by that?"

"Doctor, I know this request

confessed to you.

550
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,920
He didn't admit it.

551
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,350
I saw through it right away.

552
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,350
Plus,

553
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,430
there was music playing at that time.

554
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,790
I got it.

555
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:36,990
Dr. Xing isn't contacting you

556
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:39,190
because he wants to give you a surprise.

557
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,910
A surprise?

558
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:41,930
Building anticipation.

559
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:43,240
It must be that way.

560
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,440
I was wondering why that music sounds so familiar.

561
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,860
It's the song Dr. Xing sang

562
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,820
when he confessed to you.

563
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,280
He's still so romantic.

564
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,060
It must be that way.

565
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,750
And I'm pretty sure

566
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:57,410
it'll be after tonight's closing performance.

569
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,670
I've been reading a lot of love stories lately.

570
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,560
There was a man

571
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,940
who planted trees for a girl for 20 years.

572
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:37,970
He also saved all the letters they wrote to each other

573
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,600
when they were kids.

574
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,310
When they got married,

575
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,840
he brought them all out. It was so romantic.

576
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,230

00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,380
Congratulations.

724
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:01,090
Congratulations on your dance troupe's successful performance.

725
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:03,150
Tacky! So tacky.

726
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,410
Zhecheng said that a sense of ceremony doesn't need to be innovative;

727
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:10,540
it just needs to cater to preferences.

728
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,880
I think you'll like it.

729
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,470
What else?

730
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,360
Xiaoxiao and Coffee said you would give me a surprise.

731
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:22,110
Is there more?

732
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,840
Qin Fei,

733
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,800
go home with me.

734
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,820
I want to take you to meet my parents.

735
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,800
Are you serious?

[Moga Hair Salon]

737
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,630
Fei,

738
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,780
I rarely get a day off.

739
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,980
You really don't know how lucky you are.

740
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:00,240
Didn't I bring you here to enjoy yourself?

741
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:00,990
Fine.

742
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,540
I'll cover the cost of the hairstyle you get today.

743
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,710
Okay!

744
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,710
Help me choose a style.

745
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,350
I haven't done my hair in over a month.

746
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,350
What style should I go for?

747
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,880
I think highlights would be nice.

748
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,140
And didn't you always want

749
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,200
to try a reddish-brown color before?

750
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:23,140
But I'm going to meet my boyfriend's parents. Highlights won't be appropriate.

751
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,340
Really?

752
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:26,630
You're finally going to meet your in-laws-to-be?

753
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,140
Congratulations!

754
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:28,890
Well...

755
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:30,010
what about long, straight black hair?

756
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:31,870
I think elders prefer that style.

757
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,710
But I feel like long, straight black hair

758
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,370
doesn't really suit my style.

759
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,470
I want something

760
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:39,300
that makes me look elegant

761
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:40,830
but still keeps my personality,

762
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,060
and that also shows

763
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:44,060
I have an artistic vibe—

764
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:45,400
a style that reflects both

765
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,890
my gentleness and my elegance.

766
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:48,440
No problem, ma'am.

767
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,600

Let's try it.

775
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,310
Then I want one too.

00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,630
I want a look that can help me

777
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,110
dominate negotiations—a powerful woman's style.

778
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,000
It has to be powerful.

779
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,120
-Of course.
-Sir.

780
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,030

-Okay.

Tomorrow my son is bringing his girlfriend home.

00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:19,200
I want a hairstyle that is serious

784
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,320
yet gentle and can help me

785
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,760
bond with younger people.

786
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,740
Is that possible?

787
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,010
No problem.

788
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,560

I'll go get the bill ready.

What's next?

Are you going back to the hospital?

801

After the vacation ends.

00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:19,760

Good for you.

808
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,430
That's pretty efficient.

809
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,510
Does that mean

we'll be drinking at your wedding soon?

How am I putting on an act?

What do you mean?

have a fight?

Xing Zhizhi...

832
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:59,640
I have to call the police.

833
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:02,200
That stylist must have a grudge against me.

834
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:04,230
I spent 3,888

835

and got this look!

This is simply fraud!

837
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,100
Look at me.

838
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,160
I look terrible, don't I?

839
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,350
Not at all.

840
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,100
I don't think you look terrible.

841
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,270
It's just...

842
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,570
a bit special.

843
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,770
You think I look especially terrible!

844
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,280
What should I do now?

845
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,400
My image is ruined.

846
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:34,570
How can I meet your parents like this?

847
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,940
How about we postpone it

848
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,570
for a few days? Is that okay?

849
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,520
Don't be angry.

850
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,180
I think it's quite cute.

851
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,900
Besides, my parents are meeting you as a person,

852
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,620
not your hairstyle.

853
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,730
But my hairstyle

854
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,470
is also a part of who I am,

855
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:54,150
and it's very important.

856
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:57,590
Their first impression of me

857
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:59,030
can't be of my hair

858
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,890
looking like a Lhasa Apso, can it?

859
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:03,290
Trust me,

860
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:04,690
it really doesn't matter.

861
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:06,440
Let's go tomorrow, okay?

862
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:08,030
But...

863
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:09,960
Xiaofei,

864
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,230
listen to me.

865
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:14,450
This is the first time I'm bringing a girlfriend home for a meal.

866
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:16,140
It's because

867
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:18,110
I'm sure that you are the one.

868
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:20,390
It has nothing to do with your hairstyle.

869
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:24,330
But this hairstyle really is ugly.

870
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:28,110
I'll help you figure something out.

871
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:34,880
Is this the solution you came up with?

872
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:36,000
Wearing a hat when I meet your parents

873
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,670
for the first time feels too informal, doesn't it?

874
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:40,190
I think it's fine.

875
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,440
Don't overthink it.

876
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,610
They won't care about that.

877
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:44,320
It's my first time meeting them.

878
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,380
What if they don't like me?

879
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,310
How come you're not nervous at all?

880
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,360
Is there a need to be nervous?

881
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,940
Why...

882
00:43:58,110 --> 00:43:59,940
It's you!

883
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,850
It's you?
