I like this book very much too.

27
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,250
The book says,

28
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,340
thoracic surgeons

29
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,120
approach surgery with extreme caution,

30
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,500
but they must be bold enough to make the incision.

31
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,290
Yes, just one millimeter away under the endoscope

32
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,310
could be variant blood vessels and arteries.

33
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,300
Thoracic surgery

34
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,440
is all about who makes fewer misjudgments,

35
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,500
and it requires even more precision.

36
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,100
I feel there's still so much to learn.

37
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,800
Senior, are you also a thoracic surgeon?

This isn't for you.

00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,730
It's for him.

41
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,190
Just pretend

42
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,360
you don't know anything.

43
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,240
Give him a push.

Want some late-night snack?

45
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,770
I'm sick of egg pancakes.

46
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,490
How can you still eat them?

47
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,170
It's very stress-relieving.

48
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,600
I heard from Yu Zhecheng

49
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,950
that the surgery is extremely difficult.

50
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,610
Not even a 0.0001% error is allowed.

51
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,170
That's exaggerated.

52
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,400
But it is a bit challenging.

53
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,260
You haven't been in the operating room for years,

54
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,080
and now you're facing such a difficult surgery.

55
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,930
Are you under a lot of pressure?

56
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,620
Well, everything has a start.

57
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,400
Alright, forget about it.

58
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,310
If you're tired of eggs,

59
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,520
I can make quail egg pancakes for you next time.

60
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,240
No way.

61
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,210
Keep that away from me.

62
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,760
Just have one. It's not bad.

63
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,130
I won't eat it.

64
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:07,860
I don't want to eat.

65
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,130
No, no, no.

66
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,160
Why are you so hungry?

67
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,490
Then I'll eat it myself.

68
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:57,280
I'm really going to throw up if I eat any more of those eggs.

69
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,840
Do you think I should keep pretending

70
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,370
like I don't know anything?

71
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,340
Didn't you already make up your mind?

72
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,910
I think Xing Zhizhi's sister is right.

73
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,230
Maybe we really should give him a push.

74
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,570
It's hard for people to take the first step on their own.

75
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:13,720
Otherwise, it'll just be like

76
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,380
boiling a frog in warm water,

77
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,060
and the days will just slip by.

78
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,090
How is Xing Zhizhi doing now?

79
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,720
He must be under a lot of pressure, I guess.

80
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,220
He peels egg shells every night when he comes back.

81
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,300
If this continues,

82
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,180
both our cholesterol levels will be off the charts.

All these.

93
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,530
These are all thoracic surgery materials,

94
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,080
and they're all from recent years.

95
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,190
So,

96
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:12,140
he's always wanted to return to the operating table.

97
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,040
Right, just like this.

-Okay.

99

Look at you.

100
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,620
Look at how burnt these are.

101
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,280
You should have added some water

102
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,920
and put them in the oven.

103
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,460

and end up in debt, what will you do?

You're right.

135

You don't need me at all.

I really wish

158
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,210
my child was like Xing,

159
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,200
such an understanding son.

160
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,860
You already have Xiaocheng.

161
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,930
Why do you need so many sons?

162
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,210
Alright, I know what to do.

163
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,140
I'll hang up now.

164
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,720
I really wonder

165
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,620
how Xing Zhizhi enchanted my mom.

166
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,320
I made it myself.

167
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:22,990
Try it.

168
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,250
Good for you.

169
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,180
Is this edible?

170
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,210
Yes.

171
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:31,990
Try it.

172
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,870
Stop staring at me.

173
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,670
This is... embarrassing.

174
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:42,490
Are you going to eat it or not?

175
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,160
I'll eat it.

176
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,000
How is it?

177
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,620
Is it good?

178
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:50,450
It's okay.

179
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,390
-Really?
-Yes.

180
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,870
It's alright.

181
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,250
Just a bit burnt.

182
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,730
Do you remember?

183
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,420
You came to the cafe where I was working

210
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,750
I've been thinking a lot these past few days.

211
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,220
I really can't get over this in my heart.

212
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,440
I really can't accept

213
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,410

214
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,140
forcing him to do something he doesn't want to do.

You've guided me in this industry for five years,

216

217
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,370
I will go to Li Changjiang myself

are completely separate matters.

222
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,470
I can't let Xing Zhizhi sacrifice himself because of me.

223

224
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,530
to accept this surgery,

225
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,560

When no one knew what to do,

292
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,220
it was Xing Zhizhi who stepped forward.

293
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,050
He has never told anyone

294
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,830
why he left the operating room

295
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,320

297
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,020
maybe he had given up,

thrown in the towel,

299

00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,260
during these years since he left the operating room,

302
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,430

why he

312
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,450
repeatedly refused you?

313
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,960
I don't know.

314
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,060
He certainly isn't someone who would refuse to

315
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,180
save people or is irresponsible.

316
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,380
You should trust his choice as a doctor.

317
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,860

00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,270
That's right.

I hope

321
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,430
it's based on his professional judgment as a doctor.

322
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,190
He must be considering for the patient first.

323

00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,510
Dr. Xing.

744
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:18,000
Take care.

745
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,280
Director, I'll head back now.

746
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,190
You don't need to see me out.

747
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,840
-Go back. Bye.
-Bye.

748
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,440
Bye.

751
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,960
Three points.

752
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,420
I was really startled at that moment.

753
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,480
I was certain it was him,

754
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,750
the child who died in Suman,

755
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,950
who couldn't possibly appear in Huhai.

756
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:07,090
How long did he appear that time?

757
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,980
By the time I calmed down,

758
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,210
he had disappeared.

759
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:15,190
I thought it might be the environmental factors

760
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,580
or my bad mood

761
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:18,410
that caused the hallucination.

762
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,370
What happened later?

763
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,410
Later...

764
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:27,220
A few months later, he appeared again.

765
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:29,870
After that, it became a kind of signal.

766
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,300
Whenever I was in a bad mood

767
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,950
or couldn't figure something out,

768
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,070
he would appear.

769
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,070
Every time?

770
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,550
It's hard to say which time specifically.

771
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,230
It happened on and off.

772
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,590
He would always appear.

773
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:42,860
And recently,

774
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,440
it's been happening more and more frequently.

775
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,850
From your description,

776
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,640
you know Xiaojia is a hallucination,

777
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,600
right?

778
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:51,900
Yes.

779
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,460
This hallucination

780
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:58,050
appears or disappears

781
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,910
according to my mood and state of mind.

782
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,300
So why didn't you tell me about this before?

783
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,560
Because...

784
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:15,190
Because Xiaojia's appearance didn't bother me.

785
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:17,320
He was like a friend to me.

786
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,460
He would talk to me, give me advice,

787
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,840
and even make a few sarcastic comments.

788
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,100
It seems

789
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,430
you two get along well.

790
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:30,200
I suppose so.

791
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,010
Xiaojia's appearance

792
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:35,200
not only didn't affect my life,

793
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:37,560
but to some extent,

794
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,000
I really wanted to see him.

795
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,060
It was a kind of comfort, I guess.

796
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,170
After all,

797
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,800
it was the only way

798
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,850
I could see him again.

799
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:53,010
A few days ago, you came to the psychology clinic

800
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,930
and requested hypnotherapy.

801
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:56,330
Why?

802
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,640
Because

803
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,210
he appeared in the hospital,

804
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,420
in the operating room.

805
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:14,730
I really wanted him to disappear at that moment,

806
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:16,300
but he didn't leave.

807
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,790
That's when I realized

808
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,150
that Xiaojia's appearances

809
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:23,940
seemed to be completely out of my control.

810
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,280
I guessed

811
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:27,850
he must be the root of my psychological problem.

812
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:30,450
You've returned to the operating table again,

813
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,970
Xing Zhizhi.

814
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,640
I am your psychological counselor.

815
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:40,170
I hope that before you make any major decisions,

816
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:42,210
you can discuss them with me first,

817
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:43,860
especially something like returning to the operating table

818
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:46,120
that could trigger memories of the past.

819
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,960
Your behavior has broken through

820
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,710
your mental limit.

821
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:55,860
At this stage, I believe

822
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,370
you should stay away from

823
00:42:57,370 --> 00:42:59,230
all situations that irritate you,

824
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:01,290
including your work in the hospital.

825
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,610
It may

826
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,320
need to stop for a while.
