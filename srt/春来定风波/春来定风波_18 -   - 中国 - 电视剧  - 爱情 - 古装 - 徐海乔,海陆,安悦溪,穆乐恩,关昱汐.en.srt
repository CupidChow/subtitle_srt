is the largest jewelry store
in the area.

26
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,930
Miss Wantang, don't be shy.

27
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,620
If you see anything you like,

28
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,670
just let me know.

29
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,710
Thank you, Master Jingming.

30
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,550
Master Jingming,

31
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,870
it's an honor to have you

32
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,960
visit my small shop.

33
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,870
What do you have?

34
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,430
Introduce it to us.

35
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,450
Alright, Master Jingming.

36
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,550
This butterfly-themed gold hairpin,

37
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,150
set with a ruby as an accent,

38
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,680
and carved with a butterfly design,

39
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,320
can serve as a token of love.

40
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,240
What do you think?

41
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,390
Do you like it?

42
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,320
Bring out the best items

43
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,280
in your shop.

44
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,240
Got it.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,680
I don't like anything too flashy.

46
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,640
I remember

47
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,160
Lady Lan, Master Jingxiu's concubine,

48
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,600
often wears a hairpin

49
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,850
that has just the right style.

50
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,630
It has gold, jade, and agate,

51
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,260
with a unique design.

52
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,150
Well, that's easy.

53
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,560
I know

54
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,080
that this shop has an artist.

55
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,870
You can tell him the style you like,

56
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,150
and he'll draw it for you.

57
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,830
Miss Wantang, do you remember the style?

58
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,390
Yes.

59
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,150
Bring the artist here.

60
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,110
Alright.

61
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,680
Master Jingming

62
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,120
was very close with Lian Wantang

63
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,590
when they went to buy jewelry?

64
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,520
I didn't expect

65
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,590
that Lian Wantang could

66
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,680
win Master Jingming's favor
in a few days.

67
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,870
We really

68
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,680
underestimated her.

69
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,920
(Magnanimity)
Go sweep that area too.

70
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,710
Master Jingming, what are you doing?

71
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,560
From now on,

72
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,520
you don't need

73
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,200
to return to Rain Chamber.

74
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,590
I won't live in Rain Chamber?

75
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,990
Then where will I...?

76
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,680
You'll stay with me.

77
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,310
Aren't we moving a bit too fast?

78
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,200
Of course, I'm willing,

79
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
but...

80
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,520
I'm glad you're willing.

81
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,600
This room has everything,

82
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,870
but it lacks some liveliness.

83
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,720
Yunjiu,

84
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,110
go buy some fresh flowers tomorrow

85
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,240
to decorate it.

86
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,120
Oh, buy some books as well.

87
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,060
I'm talking to you.

88
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,250
I only listen to Master Jingming.

89
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,830
Master Jingming.

90
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:36,850
Do as Miss Lian says.

91
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,310
Thank you, Master Jingming.

92
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,190
From now on,

93
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,230
Miss Wantang,

94
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,920
you can stay in this room,

95
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,070
enjoying flowers and books.

96
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,960
Yunjiu,

97
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,080
listen carefully.

98
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,560
She's not allowed to have
any contact with anyone

99
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,490
or step outside this room
for even a moment.

100
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,560
Yes.

101
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,310
What do you mean?

102
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,590
What do I mean?

103
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,430
Miss Lian, don't you understand?

104
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,040
Did I do something wrong

105
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,240
to upset you?

106
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,840
Miss Lian, you made a mistake,

107
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,270
and

108
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,600
it was a big one.

109
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,160
I'll get everything ready tomorrow.

110
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:26,540
(Rain Chamber)

111
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,480
Stop pretending if you can't sleep.

112
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,680
Master Jingming,
with a belle by your side,

113
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,160
why bother coming here?

114
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,640
Are you angry because I took

115
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,750
Lian Wantang out?

116
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,870
You're overthinking.

117
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,920
I'm not that petty.

118
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,840
Where you go and with whom

119
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,360
has nothing to do with me.

120
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,590
It does matter.

121
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,160
I hope

122
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,750
that everything in my future

123
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,070
will concern you.

124
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,320
I don't want that.

125
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,080
Master Jingming,

126
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,800
are you hiding something from me?

127
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,280
So, this is what it looks like
when you're jealous.

128
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,160
What exactly are you up to?

129
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,760
Alright,

130
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,370
I won't hide it from you.

131
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,190
Something's off about Lian Wantang.

132
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,920
(Lian Genealogy)
Did you find anything unusual?

133
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,840
I felt that Lian Wantang showed up

134
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,120
at an oddly perfect time.

135
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,870
What did you find out?

136
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,630
I've checked everyone related to her

137
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,490
but haven't found
anything suspicious for now.

138
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,320
By the way, Young Master,

139
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,760
at the entrance
of the ancestral hall today,

140
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,630
I noticed something

141
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,390
between her and Lady Lan.

142
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,310
I've always felt that she isn't simple,

143
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,510
so I did all this today

144
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,280
to test her.

145
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,800
Unexpectedly,

146
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,390
once I took her to the jewelry shop,

147
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,920
she revealed something.

148
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,950
She told me

149
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,200
she liked a hairpin

150
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,950
that Lady Lan wears,

151
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,510
but as far as I know,

152
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,870
she only met Shen Qilan

153
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,300
during your family's worship event.

154
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,680
Yunjiu said,

155
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,640
Shen Qilan

156
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,070
wasn't wearing that hairpin that day.

157
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,710
So,

158
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,990
this means

159
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,730
they know each other beforehand.

160
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,390
It seems that your sister

161
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:47,950
isn't that simple.

162
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,160
If they knew each other already,

163
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,730
then the one who killed my mother

164
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,070
was Ms. Zou.

165
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,680
Think about it.

166
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,550
The moment you started
to investigate it,

167
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,160
Lian Wantang showed up at once

168
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,950
with evidence
that could convict Ms. Tian.

169
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,920
Everything is too coincidental.

170
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,900
It's as if someone

171
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,220
deliberately planned this.

172
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,460
Master Jingming,

173
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,740
you used yourself to lure her out

174
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,700
and investigated so many things
behind my back.

175
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,100
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

176
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,820
Because you wanted

177
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,980
to bear everything yourself,

178
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,620
looking like you didn't want my help.

179
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,840
I wanted to help you,

180
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,160
but I didn't know where to start,

181
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,080
so I could only wait
until I found some clues

182
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,900
to tell you.

183
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,420
Now you can tell me.

184
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,180
What else are you worried about?

185
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,980
If it's Shen Qilan

186
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,300
and Ms. Zou plotting together...

187
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,420
I hope we're wrong about this.

188
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,660
Young Master, My Lady,

189
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,620
Mr. Chu is here.

190
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,940
- Let him in.
- Please.

191
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,460
Zimo.

192
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,260
Mr. Chu, why came here

193
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,580
so late?

194
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,020
It's related to Mrs. Shen's death,

195
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,300
so I didn't dare delay.

196
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,940
Zimo, what have you found?

197
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,340
I've calculated it.

198
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,620
The amount of thunder god vine
in the bracelet

199
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,740
is insufficient to be fatal.

200
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,060
So,

201
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,620
the real murderer might be someone else.

202
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,700
Also, I found out

203
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,940
that when heated,

204
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,460
thunder god vine releases toxins
more rapidly.

205
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,740
What method did they use?

206
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,580
If they made

207
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,660
thunder god vine into intimate clothing,

208
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,620
it would heat up with body temperature

209
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,740
and be the best way to kill someone
without a trace.

210
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,420
(Shen Mansion)

211
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,380
Consort Jiangli,

212
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,860
what brings you here?

213
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,300
Please sit down.

214
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,420
Ms. Zou,

215
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,100
I came to thank you today.

216
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,060
That day, your maid helped me.

217
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,380
Today,

218
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,940
I've brought some fine Pu'er tea

219
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,220
to thank you.

220
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,420
Let's enjoy it together.

221
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,580
Consort Jiangli, no need for this.

222
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,780
We are family.

223
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,380
There's no need for formalities.

224
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,780
Even though we're family,

225
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,300
we still have to pay

226
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,020
for our mistakes

227
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,540
without an exception.

228
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,700
Of course.

229
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,380
Ms. Zou,

230
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,380
I've been

231
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,660
thinking a lot lately

232
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,700
about my mother's death.

233
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,180
Do you think

234
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,700
there might be

235
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,340
another murderer?

236
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,620
Someone who hid it well,

237
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,620
let Tian Xiaozhen take the blame

238
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,500
and escaped unscathed.

239
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,100
Consort Jiangli, you're overthinking.

240
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,140
The evidence is conclusive.

241
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,140
Obviously, Tian Xiaozhen
is the murderer.

242
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,140
Is that so?

243
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,140
But I

244
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,660
don't think

245
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,980
it's so simple.

246
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,060
Ms. Zou,

247
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,300
you've really

248
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,500
helped me a lot this time.

249
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,180
Maybe I'm overthinking.

250
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,020
If the murderer

251
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,380
is truly at large,

252
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,780
they must

253
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,940
be living in constant fear, right?

254
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,860
Yes, yes.

255
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,500
Go and brew some tea.

256
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,620
Today, I want to drink
a cup of tea to Ms. Zou.

257
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,820
Are you Ms. Zou's personal maid?

258
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,660
Yes.

259
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,620
My stomach suddenly hurts.

260
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,820
I need to go to the outhouse.

261
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,150
Take this tea

262
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,330
to the front courtyard.

263
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,460
Ms. Zou

264
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,780
and Consort Jiangli are waiting.

265
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,220
Yes.

266
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,460
Be careful.

267
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,980
I entrusted you with this important task

268
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,300
because you're Ms. Zou's personal maid.

269
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,780
Usually, I wouldn't delegate
such things to others.

270
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,420
Finally, she's gone.

271
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,420
Drinking tea with her
gave me a headache.

272
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,620
I don't think she was here to thank me.

273
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,540
Go to Master Jingxiu's Mansion now.

274
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,620
Yes.

275
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,180
Jiangli.

276
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,260
What did you find?

277
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,140
Jiangli,

278
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,060
this is what I found
in a secret compartment

279
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,080
in Zou Jiaoyue's bedroom.

280
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,780
This high-quality coat

281
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,020
wasn't kept in the wardrobe

282
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,340
but hidden in a compartment.

283
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,680
She's not even worried about mold.

284
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,420
I thought it was strange,

285
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,660
so I brought it out.

286
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,380
This coat...

287
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,420
I remember Madam wore it.

288
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,260
It used to belong to my mother?

289
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,820
Madam used to get cold easily,

290
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,780
so Ms. Zou

291
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,820
sent this coat to her.

292
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,420
Madam wore it every day,

293
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,580
saying it kept her very warm.

294
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,580
Jiangli, did you notice
something unusual?

295
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,620
This fur was made

296
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,300
from a complete sable fur.

297
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,600
The stitches are even and tight,

298
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,060
with the right amount of elasticity.

299
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,100
The person who made this

300
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,020
is definitely an excellent furrier.

301
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,660
But

302
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,260
the stitches at the cuff

303
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,540
seem a bit odd.

304
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,260
This same furrier couldn't possibly have

305
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,500
such a drastic difference
in their stitching.

306
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,620
The cuff was sewn later?

307
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,780
My Lady,

308
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,740
what is this?

309
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,380
Yunniang,

310
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,340
it concerns my mother's death.

311
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,540
Are you sure

312
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,020
this used to belong to my mother?

313
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,220
I'm sure.

314
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,520
My Lady, when you were little,
you didn't like reading.

315
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,760
One day, you threw a tantrum

316
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:11,980
and knocked over the inkstone,

317
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,860
leaving ink stains on the fur.

318
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,540
Though we cleaned it right away,

319
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,140
the stain remained.

320
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,900
After Madam passed away,

321
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,820
this coat went missing,

322
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,540
and we never noticed

323
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,860
if this coat was still there.

324
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,620
It was iron powder and carbon powder

325
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,780
that mixed together in the cuff,

326
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,900
heated up,

327
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,420
and increased the release of toxins

328
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,540
from thunder god vine,

329
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,940
making the poison

330
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,220
fatal enough

331
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,580
to kill my mother.

332
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,260
My Lady, are you saying

333
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,140
this coat is the key to Madam's death?

334
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,540
Who would have thought

335
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,180
this warm coat

336
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,020
was actually a poisoned garment?

337
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,180
What a wicked scheme.

338
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,580
Ms. Zou never imagined

339
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,420
that the one who caused her downfall

340
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,980
was her own greed.

341
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,220
If she hadn't been so reluctant

342
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,020
to burn this expensive fur coat,

343
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,060
we wouldn't have found the evidence.

344
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,580
My Lady, don't worry.

345
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,420
I'll risk my life

346
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,860
to expose her crimes.

347
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,020
No rush.

348
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,100
I heard

349
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,660
Father has been promoted recently.

350
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,540
I need to prepare a big gift for him.

351
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,380
Lord Shen

352
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,380
is a man who values dignity.

353
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,100
How could she be so kind

354
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,060
to visit and thank me today,

355
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,100
treating me to tea?

356
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,620
Based on what Shen Jiangli said today,

357
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:30,940
it's obvious

358
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,500
that she's started to suspect me.

359
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,280
Also, my pearl bracelet

360
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,740
suddenly broke today for no reason.

361
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,020
How unlucky.

362
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,140
This is clearly a reminder for me.

363
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,500
Mother,

364
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,300
how could you do such a thing?

365
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,140
You're so foolish.

366
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,660
Back when Madam was poisoned,

367
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,100
it was indeed my scheme,

368
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,080
but

369
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,740
I wasn't doing it just for myself.

370
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,340
If she hadn't died,

371
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,300
I would've forever been inferior to her.

372
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,620
By then,

373
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,140
you were already able to walk,

374
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,820
but your father insisted on sending you

375
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,980
to be raised in her room.

376
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,060
You're my flesh and blood.

377
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,500
How could I bear to see

378
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,540
you being sent away?

379
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,180
Women in the inner chambers

380
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,100
often use some means,

381
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,440
but it's out of necessity.

382
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,480
If she hadn't died,

383
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,480
you would've forever been
a concubine's daughter.

384
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,340
Do you not know what that means?

385
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,760
You would've always been inferior
to a lineal daughter.

386
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,300
I was only trying to find

387
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,380
a way out for us.

388
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,900
But you can't kill her.

389
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,300
Qilan, I know I was wrong.

390
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,580
I was just so afraid of losing you

391
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,700
that I acted out of desperation.

392
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,020
From now on,

393
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,220
I'll pray and chant scriptures
for Madam every day.

394
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,620
Will it make a difference?

395
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,420
Wang Danling just left,

396
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,700
and I've just found some peace,

397
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,140
yet you caused such trouble.

398
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,140
What if Master Jingxiu

399
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,380
finds out about it?

400
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,420
Qilan,

401
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,740
I have to rely on you now.

402
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,660
I'm truly out of ideas.

403
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,060
If you don't help me,

404
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,060
then you'll have

405
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,740
to watch me die.

406
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,420
If that's the case, then I'll just die.

407
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,780
I'll hang myself.

408
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,300
I'll crash my head against something.

409
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,140
Ow.

410
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,220
You heartless little thing.

411
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,620
Are you giving up on me?

412
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,860
Mother,

413
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,420
stop it.

414
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,900
I'll think of a way.

415
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,100
Mother,

416
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,420
don't worry.

417
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,140
Jiangli can't find anything.

418
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,940
Why did she come today then?

419
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,060
She came today to visit you.

420
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,940
She already believes

421
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,340
that Ms. Tian did this,

422
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,220
and Ms. Tian has been punished.

423
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,340
Don't worry.

424
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,540
Alright.

425
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,700
I'll listen to you.

426
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,180
I'll listen to you.

427
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,780
Now,

428
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,020
I can only rely on you.

429
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,820
Mother, don't worry.

430
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,860
I've planned everything.

431
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,580
Alright.

432
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,780
Let Lian Wantang come and see me.

433
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,740
Yes.

434
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,220
Jiangli.

435
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,500
Is the one outside here for you?

436
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,860
Consort Jiangli, it's my fault.

437
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,420
I know you're good to me.

438
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,140
I never meant to betray you,

439
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,980
but I was forced into it.

440
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,500
Tell me.

441
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,900
Why did you have to do this?

442
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,700
Actually, my mother
didn't go to visit her family.

443
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,380
Shen Qilan captured her to threaten me.

444
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,020
I had no choice but to obey her.

445
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,780
(Master Jingming's Mansion)

446
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,620
Miss Wantang,

447
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,580
your letter.

448
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,180
I know you didn't want

449
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,540
to do these things,

450
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,680
but if someone harms others
just due to a difficult situation,

451
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,180
what does that make them?

452
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,620
Consort Jiangli, everything you did

453
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,900
was for your mother,

454
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,660
and it was the same case for me.

455
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,700
I know I'm wrong.

456
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,820
Please forgive me.

457
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,100
Then tell me everything

458
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,780
you know,

459
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,580
without hiding even a little bit.

460
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,260
This is your last chance

461
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,620
to make up for your mistake.

462
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,180
Alright.

463
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,380
Jiangli,

464
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,460
Shen Qilan is here.

465
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,940
I've been waiting for her.

466
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,700
She couldn't sit still

467
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,160
once she couldn't reach Wantang.

468
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,450
Let her in.

469
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,500
Yes, Jiangli.

470
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,060
Qilan, you're here.

471
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,100
Please sit down.

472
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,120
Let me make you some tea.

473
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,340
Jiangli,

474
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,600
it's just been days since we met,

475
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,730
but you look a bit weary now.

476
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,900
What's happened?

477
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,660
Qilan,

478
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,500
do you remember Lian Wantang

479
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,060
who accompanied me
to worship the ancestors earlier?

480
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,900
Yes.

481
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,540
She identified

482
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,140
Tian Xiaozhen for me.

483
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,020
I was grateful

484
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,180
and wanted her to stay here with me,

485
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,180
yet she and Master Jingming...

486
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,860
Master Jingming

487
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,700
is even mad at me over her

488
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,780
and hasn't come here for days.

489
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,900
I truly brought a wolf into the house.

490
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,500
How did this happen?

491
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,140
Men in noble families are always fickle.

492
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,060
They're ultimately

493
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,060
attracted to looks.

494
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,380
Qilan,

495
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,860
you must keep my lesson in mind,

496
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,980
and be wary of those around you.

497
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,900
I'll remember this.

498
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,940
Consort Jiangli's performance

499
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:42,140
is honestly quite poor.

500
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,300
It's too exaggerated.

501
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,260
Really?

502
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,500
I find it rather cute.

503
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,140
Young Master, are you crazy?

504
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,180
Her act...

505
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,220
Please enjoy today.

506
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,380
Please come in.

507
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,740
Congratulations, Lord Shen.

508
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,120
- Congrats, Lord Shen.
- Thanks.

509
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,140
Thank you.

510
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,420
I've prepared a small gift.

511
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,340
Please.

512
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,340
We'll have to rely on you in the future.

513
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,820
No need to say that.

514
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,860
We're all working for the Prefect.

515
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,380
Please come inside.

516
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,340
Take it to the back.

517
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,500
Yes.

518
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,960
Father, congrats on your promotion.

519
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:21,900
This is the gift

520
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,020
I prepared for you.

521
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,100
Jiangli, how well you know me.

522
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,620
I've been needing a fur coat.

523
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,420
The quality really is good.

524
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,220
Things from Master Jingming's Mansion
are indeed precious.

525
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,260
Why does this look so familiar?

526
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,620
I'm glad you recognized it.

527
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,380
This is my mother's coat

528
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,340
and also the evidence that killed her.

529
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,540
What nonsense are you saying?

530
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,420
Tian Xiaozhen has confessed.

531
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,820
Tian Xiaozhen?

532
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,740
Someone can't possibly think

533
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,100
that pushing a scapegoat forward

534
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,180
will let them escape, right?

535
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,500
Someone? Who?

536
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,820
Aren't you the one who found
the witnesses and evidence?

537
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,980
On this joyous day,

538
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,180
don't make a scene.

539
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,780
Father,

540
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,060
I came today

541
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,540
to congratulate our family
on two things.

542
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,460
Your promotion is one thing,

543
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,820
and my mother's killer

544
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,140
being found out is the other.

545
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,880
What are you trying to say?

546
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,860
The murderer of my mother

547
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,300
is your beloved concubine,

548
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,460
Zou.

549
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,180
You slanderer!

550
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,620
Jiangli, stop saying nonsense.

551
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,650
Master, look.

552
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,820
Tian Xiaozhen has been punished.

553
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:36,820
Jiangli,

554
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,340
what else do you want to do?

555
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,140
Can't you let our family

556
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,100
have some peace?

557
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,780
- Exactly.
- Nonsense.

558
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,740
Yes, Consort Jiangli.

559
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,840
Your mother's killer has been convicted.

560
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,060
Why are you...?

561
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,020
You can't make baseless accusations.

562
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,420
Father,

563
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,500
this sable fur

564
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,940
is from your hometown.

565
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,100
You should be familiar with it.

566
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,420
Our family had only one bolt back then,

567
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,660
and this coat was made from it.

568
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,620
What's this?

569
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,900
This is iron powder and carbon powder.

570
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,180
My mother

571
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,420
loved this coat.

572
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,120
She thought it wouldn't
freeze her hands in winter,

573
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,860
but little did she know

574
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,760
that it wasn't the coat
that kept her warm

575
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,860
but someone had put iron powder
and carbon powder

576
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,020
into the cuffs,

577
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,460
letting it heat up once exposed to air.

578
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,620
Everyone must be wondering

579
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,220
what this heated cuff

580
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,020
has to do with my mother's death.

581
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,620
This bracelet contains
the thunder god vine,

582
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,380
which is already known to everyone.

583
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,900
I've studied ancient texts.

584
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,620
Thunder god vine is indeed a poison,

585
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,780
but

586
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,260
the small amount of it in this bracelet

587
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,060
couldn't have killed my mother.

588
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,560
The answer to this mystery

589
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,140
lies in the heated cuffs.

590
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,180
Jiangli,

591
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,540
the ancient records might not be true,

592
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,460
yet you speak so convincingly.

593
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,540
Ms. Zou, since you don't believe it,

594
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,980
why don't you try it yourself?

595
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,820
I...

596
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,740
Well, I...

597
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,900
I don't want to.

598
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,980
Don't!

599
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,060
What are you doing?

600
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,180
Ms. Zou, if you don't believe it,

601
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,340
what are you afraid of?

602
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,620
I...

603
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,820
I'm just scared!

604
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,340
I never expected Ms. Tian

605
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,580
to be so cruel.

606
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,420
Even without Madam,

607
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,140
she'd never become the wife.

608
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,500
What an ingrate.

609
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,220
How could she harm Madam?

610
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,220
Ms. Zou, have you forgotten?

611
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,780
You should be

612
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,420
more familiar with this coat, right?

613
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,700
Jiangli, what nonsense are you saying?

614
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,060
I'm...

615
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,460
I'm just so upset about how twisted

616
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,740
Madam's death was.

617
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,220
Master,

618
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,060
Master, forgive my rudeness.

619
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,100
I momentarily forgot

620
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,580
it's your promotion banquet today.

621
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,540
You are the star of today.

622
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,900
All these years,

623
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,180
you have supported
the entire family on your own.

624
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,620
Jiangli and Qilan

625
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,420
have grown up thanks to your protection

626
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,660
and care.

627
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,620
Jiangli,

628
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,700
please stop this.

629
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,020
As the head of the family,

630
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,180
this is all my responsibility, isn't it?

631
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,460
Go, go.

632
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,260
Go.

633
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,860
Wait.

634
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,020
Consort Jiangli

635
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,340
will also attend this banquet.

636
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,860
What if she finds out something?

637
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,900
Jiangli's husband is cheating on her.

638
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,180
How could she have the mood

639
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,040
to care about a matter
that's been concluded?

640
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,020
Tian Xiaozhen is certainly guilty,

641
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,540
but

642
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,700
are you going to blame

643
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,780
everything on her alone?

644
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,540
Jiangli, why are you
targeting me so today?

645
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,340
Since your mother's death,

646
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,220
I've treated you as my daughter.

647
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,700
You're still denying
you killed my mother, huh?

648
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,660
I didn't give her that coat.

649
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,060
Why should I admit it?

650
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,460
Did you see with your own eyes

651
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,740
that I gave your mother the coat?

652
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,900
I didn't see it,

653
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,620
but someone did.

654
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,780
I can testify.

655
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,700
It was Ms. Zou

656
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,700
who often had maids take the coat

657
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,060
for care and washing.

658
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,230
Each time it was returned,

659
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,180
the madam would say

660
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,400
the coat was warmer

661
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,620
after Ms. Zou took care of it.

662
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,100
Today, I realized

663
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,500
that this warm and smooth coat

664
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,140
was actually a weapon for murder.

665
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:21,260
Ms. Zou,

666
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,020
you're truly vile!

667
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,300
Yunniang,

668
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,860
do you have any evidence?

669
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,460
I know that words alone aren't enough.

670
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,260
This is lotus needlework.

671
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,460
Only Ms. Zou

672
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,820
in the entire mansion
uses this stitching method.

673
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,540
Father,

674
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,220
your scent pouch was also made
by Ms. Zou.

675
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,260
You can just look at the stitches.

676
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,740
You lowly maid.

677
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,460
I caught you

678
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,980
stealing things once,

679
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,660
so I drove you out.

680
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,340
That's why you hate me.

681
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,100
Jiangli,

682
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,180
I know you're dissatisfied with us.

683
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,340
Back when you caused trouble

684
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,060
and were sent to the ancestral tomb,

685
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,100
we never came to visit,

686
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:14,020
but that was because your father
fell ill with worry,

687
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,220
and he was always trying

688
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,780
to help you.

689
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,660
That's why you can stand here today.

690
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,700
If you really can't get over it,

691
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,420
then take it out on me.

692
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,180
No wonder you chose today.

693
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,060
You just wanted to disgrace our family.

694
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,100
What a wonder daughter you are

695
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,820
to bring me such a grand gift.

696
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,580
Master, please calm down.

697
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,380
Jiangli smells

698
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,860
of wine.

699
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,260
She must've been drunk

700
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,580
so she said some foolish things.

701
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,740
Sorry about this, everyone.

702
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,620
Take Consort Jiangli down,

703
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,740
and let her sober up.

704
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,620
Take this

705
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,580
foolish maid away

706
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,540
and interrogate her.

707
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,700
Yes, yes.

708
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,940
The evidence is irrefutable.

709
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,300
Jiangli must be drunk.

710
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,660
Please go and sober up.

711
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,420
Outrageous!

712
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,580
Let me see who dares to move.

713
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,100
You'll surely die if you do.

714
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,260
You...

715
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,740
Master, don't be angry.

716
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,220
Everyone says the master's promotion

717
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,340
is a grand success,

718
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,300
but only I know

719
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,660
how much the master has worried

720
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,180
about this daughter.

721
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,860
Everyone, please don't talk about it

722
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,420
after you leave.

723
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,820
The master won't mind,

724
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,900
but it'll hurt Jiangli's reputation.

725
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,100
Please, everyone.

726
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,620
Let's not talk about it.

727
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,020
Today, I finally understand.

728
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,940
Compared to Father's hypocrisy
and selfishness,

729
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,100
these methods are nothing.

730
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,340
If you hadn't neglected your wife

731
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,260
and indulged your concubines,

732
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,340
my mother wouldn't have
ended up like this.

733
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,940
This Shen family

734
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,940
is rotten to the core.

735
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,380
You...

736
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,500
You...

737
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,740
How unfilial!

738
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,260
How can you be so harsh?

739
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,420
Unfilial?

740
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,740
Our family only follows your example.

741
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,060
You were ruthless first.

742
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,940
You've slapped me before.

743
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,340
You'd better think carefully.

744
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,420
Don't regret it after the slap.

745
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,380
Who came begging

746
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,520
for reconciliation last time?

747
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,540
I won't be soft again.

748
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,860
Fine.

749
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,420
How dare you threaten me?

750
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,260
How unfilial.

751
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,060
It's my fault I was
too lenient last time,

752
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,300
letting you become more vicious.

753
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,220
Don't you dare!

754
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,980
Are you okay?

755
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,580
Lord Shen,

756
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,580
are you bringing in the family penalty?

757
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,540
Before, I respected you as an elder,

758
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,460
so I let it slide.

759
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,180
But today,

760
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,060
I'll see who dares to touch her.

761
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,620
Jingming,

762
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,500
this is a huge misunderstanding.

763
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,380
Jiangli is my cherished pearl.

764
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,940
How could I bear to punish her?

765
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,140
Jiangli seems to be drunk.

766
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,460
You came at the perfect time.

767
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,140
Please take her back to rest.

768
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,580
Father,

769
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,860
why didn't you slap me?

770
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,340
Is it out of love for me

771
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,100
or fear over Master Jingming's power?

772
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,700
The banquet hasn't even started,

773
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,980
and things have gotten so ugly.

774
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,020
How about this?

775
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,240
Let's send Ms. Zou

776
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,420
to the Court of Judicial Review
for an investigation

777
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,700
to be fair to everyone.

778
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,220
What do you think,

779
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,380
Lord Shen?

780
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,380
This...

781
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,460
Yunyi,

782
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:48,940
take Zou

783
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,420
to the Judicial Review.

784
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,980
The charge is

785
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,340
poisoning the madam of the Shen family.

786
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,540
Yes.

787
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,780
Master, I'm innocent!

788
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,180
Master.

789
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,820
You can't convict me

790
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,540
- Wait.
- based on Jiangli's words!

791
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,380
Master Jingming,

792
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,780
Father,

793
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,700
the evidence Jiangli presented today

794
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,460
is indeed related to my mother.

795
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,740
Qilan, you...

796
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,060
But

797
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,340
it wasn't my mother who killed Madam.

798
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,380
It was my mother's maid, Lyuzhu.

799
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,100
Lyuzhu grew up with my mother

800
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,500
and also knew the lotus needlework.

801
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,540
However,

802
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,060
she passed away last year.

803
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,520
Mother, is there still

804
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,180
any of Lyuzhu's needlework left at home?

805
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,340
We can present it
to the Judicial Review.

806
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,420
Yes, yes.

807
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,740
Jiangli,

808
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,140
I know you've been unable

809
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,540
to forget about your mother's death,

810
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,740
but you did wrong my mother.

811
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,220
Also, Father.

812
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,100
My mother was indeed innocent,

813
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,640
but she failed to manage her servants

814
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,680
and trusted the spiteful,

815
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:48,700
so she should be punished.

816
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,860
Hurry.

817
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,380
Master,

818
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,740
I admit my mistake.

819
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,160
Lyuzhu is dead and can't defend herself.

820
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,910
Qilan,

821
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,420
if you were a maid,

822
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,340
would you go to such lengths?

823
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,780
Jiangli,

824
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,020
I don't know

825
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,420
what you're saying.

826
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,300
Miss Lian.

827
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:14,860
Miss Lian.

828
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,140
How is your mother doing?

829
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,420
Thanks for your concern, Qilan.

830
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,380
She's fine.

831
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,260
Today, she had more breakfast.

832
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,100
Consort Jiangli even checked
on her health.

833
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,580
Master Jingming, how is my mother?

834
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,580
Has she been saved?

835
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,020
Mrs. Lian has been saved,

836
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,620
yet during the rescue,

837
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,740
she was a little startled,

838
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,900
but she was not injured.

839
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,460
She's been settled in the guest room.

840
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,740
Thank you for saving her.

841
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,840
Go and check on your mother.

842
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,740
Miss Shen Qilan,

843
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,040
you took my mother hostage

844
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,220
and forced me to lie

845
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,380
and distort the truth

846
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,300
so you can clear your mother

847
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,500
of this.

848
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,460
Miss Lian,

849
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,100
you can't slander me like this.

850
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,500
This matter

851
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,220
will be handled by the Judicial Review.

852
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,420
Qilan,

853
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,580
you won't escape either.

854
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,420
Enough!

855
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,220
This has nothing to do with my daughter.

856
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,260
I did it all by myself.

857
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,220
Mother...

858
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,420
I put iron powder and carbon powder

859
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,540
into the cuffs.

860
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,020
I was the one who gave it to Madam.

861
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,020
I was better in every way,

862
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,540
and Master favored me.

863
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,020
Why should she be the one

864
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:22,900
to be the madam?

865
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,820
Mother...

866
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,300
Since she's confessed,

867
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,380
Yunyi,

868
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,780
take her away.

869
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,020
I believe

870
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,860
the Judicial Review
will handle it fairly.

871
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,140
- Mother.
- Yes.

872
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,500
How can you confess to this?

873
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,450
Qilan,

874
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,460
this is all my fault.

875
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,300
Mother,

876
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,540
please don't let this

877
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,780
ruin your future.

878
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,140
Father,

879
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,620
please save Mother.

880
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,920
She's been with you for decades

881
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,420
as your partner, Father.

882
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,220
Father, I beg you.

883
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:50,060
She has done such shameless things.

884
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:53,260
It's ruined the reputation
of our family.

885
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,180
Father.

886
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,420
She...

887
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,180
She...

888
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,100
Father.

889
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,500
I...

890
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,780
I feel so bad.

891
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,060
(Shen Mansion)

892
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,420
Jiangli.

893
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,340
Jiangli.

894
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,780
Jiangli, please listen to me.

895
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,460
I didn't know anything
about Lian Wantang.

896
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,340
Please spare my mother. I'm begging you.

897
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,900
- My mother...
- She's confessed.

898
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,740
As for the rest,

899
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,100
it has nothing to do with my wife.

900
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,580
Let's go home.

901
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,260
Master Jingming, Consort Jiangli.

902
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,660
Hey.

903
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,740
I want hot water.

904
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,900
Go get me some.

905
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,580
Did you hear me? Are you deaf?

906
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,580
Do you know who I am?

907
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,560
Don't let anyone find out.

908
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,860
Go inside.

909
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,140
- Qilan.
- Mother.

910
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,340
Get me out of here.

911
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,860
This place is so cold and damp.

912
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,220
I'm so scared.

913
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,220
- Mother.
- I can't stay here.

914
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,300
Mother, don't worry.

915
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,660
I'll get you out of here.

916
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,620
Qilan.

917
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,660
Am I going to be exiled?

918
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,060
I've heard that those who are exiled

919
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,580
never return alive.

920
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,780
Most of them die on the road.

921
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,460
You have to get me out of here

922
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,460
before the verdict.

923
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,660
Please, Qilan.

924
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,340
Mother, don't worry.

925
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,540
I'll beg Jiangli.

926
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,020
She can hit or scold me if she wants.

927
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,620
I'll do whatever she asks me to.

928
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,180
I won't let anything happen to you.

929
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,540
Qilan, listen to me.

930
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:43,020
Shen Jiangli will not let me go.

931
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,560
You should go to Master Jingxiu.

932
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,900
After all, I'm your mother,

933
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,460
and you're his only woman.

934
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,740
He won't ignore this.

935
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,660
Mother,

936
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,500
this can't involve Master Jingxiu.

937
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,980
But don't worry.

938
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,100
I will risk everything to save you.

939
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,660
Mother, wait for me.

940
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,780
Thank you.

941
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,700
Why?

942
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,580
Thank you for everything

943
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,340
you've done for my mother.

944
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,780
And thank you

945
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,460
for always standing by me.

946
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,580
I just want you to be happy.

947
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,460
Besides,

948
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,940
Mrs. Shen is my mother-in-law.

949
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:34,700
Of course,

950
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,900
I can't just stand by.

951
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,340
Zou deserves her punishment,

952
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,220
but I didn't expect

953
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,140
that it was Shen Qilan's scheme

954
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,100
that almost blinded me

955
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,660
and let the culprit go free.

956
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,460
It seems

957
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,980
your sister

958
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,900
is not as innocent as you thought.

959
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,780
Yes.

960
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,540
I didn't expect

961
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,220
the inner chambers

962
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,500
to be so dark

963
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,300
that they could change
someone so easily.

964
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,180
Zou was like that,

965
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,660
and now it seems

966
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,420
Shen Qilan is the same.

967
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,340
For status and power,

968
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,580
they slowly lose themselves,

969
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,660
trampling on others,

970
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,620
even others' lives.

971
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,420
I hope my mother

972
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,340
won't be trapped there again
in her next life.
