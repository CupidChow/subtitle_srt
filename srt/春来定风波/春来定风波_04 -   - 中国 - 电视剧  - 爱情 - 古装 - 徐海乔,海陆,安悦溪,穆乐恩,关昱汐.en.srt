Shen Jiangli is a vicious woman

24
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,220
who bewitched my brother.

25
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,530
Taoist Master,

26
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,500
please help me expose her.

27
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,700
Rest assured, Your Grace.

28
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,090
With my ability,

29
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,140
that wretched woman

30
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,530
shall spend eternity in limbo.

00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,450
With you here,

32
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,700
I'm pretty reassured.

33
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,300
Jiangli, the princess is here.

34
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,330
She's heading this way.

35
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,380
Take care of Yanyan.

36
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,220
Alright.

37
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,380
- Guards!
- Yes.

38
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,490
Break the door down!

39
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,330
Yes.

40
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,010
No way.

41
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,730
Shen Jiangli,

42
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,170
how dare you!

43
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,420
Five years ago you scarred my face,

44
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,020
and now you dare return?

45
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,490
Qingqing,

46
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,860
I told you five years ago

47
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,700
that it wasn't me.

48
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,650
Since you insist it was,

49
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,330
where's your proof?

50
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,860
You never spoke to me like this before.

51
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,730
Your temperament has clearly changed.

52
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,140
You must be possessed by foul things.

53
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,700
Guards!

54
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,700
Restrain her!

55
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,930
Let Taoist Li examine

56
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,140
what evil has possessed her.

57
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,210
Blessings from the Heavenly Lord.

58
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,860
Upon entering,

59
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,580
I sensed a sinister aura.

60
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,020
Let me

61
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,420
test the depth

62
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,170
of this wickedness.

63
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,610
Five Stars shine in splendor,

64
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,050
illuminating the dark abyss.

65
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,300
Gods and sages,

66
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,770
please guard my spirit.

67
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,140
Swift by the divine order!

68
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,540
Your Grace,

69
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,820
I've inspected this place.

70
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,050
I've found

71
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,380
that the southwest corner

72
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,940
has the strongest evil aura.

73
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,580
And that aura

74
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,650
is tied to the lady of this chamber.

75
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,070
Shen Jiangli,

76
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,970
you are indeed possessed by evil.

77
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,370
Qingqing,

78
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,330
I am your sister-in-law.

79
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,140
Don't be fooled by villains

80
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,580
and act foolishly again.

81
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,140
"Sister-in-law"?

82
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,850
You're too cruel to be my sister-in-law.

83
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,820
Seize her!

84
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:49,810
How dare you!

85
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,700
Nobody moves.

86
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,620
How dare you lay hands on my lady.

87
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,020
Do you want to die?

88
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,900
Qingqing,

89
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,850
what nonsense is this?

90
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,100
Jingming,

91
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,820
you came just in time.

92
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,290
Shen Jiangli is possessed,

93
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,020
bringing chaos to our home.

94
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,140
I invited Taoist Li
to perform an exorcism.

95
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,140
Who gave you the right

96
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,740
to spout such superstitious nonsense?

97
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,180
Send him out!

98
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,250
- Yes.
- Yes.

99
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,540
Stop!

100
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:28,810
Jingming,

101
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,380
Taoist Li is renowned in the city.

102
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,060
If he says Shen Jiangli is possessed,

103
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,740
how can it be false?

104
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,530
Don't spout such foolish talk anymore.

105
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,260
Blessings from the Heavenly Lord.

106
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,040
Young Master,

107
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,380
you seem to hold prejudices
against Taoists.

108
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,580
I have mastered

109
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,380
spirit communication,
passed down by the Divine Laozi.

110
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,410
I have cultivated an indestructible body.

111
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,700
If I can prove this,

112
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,410
will you apologize, Young Master?

113
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,940
What kind of fool are you

114
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,700
to make demands of me?

115
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:01,820
Jingming.

116
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,820
I believe in Taoist Li.

117
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,850
What harm is there in letting him try?

118
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,020
Jingming,

119
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,290
since Qingqing insists,

120
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,530
let us witness Taoist Li's

121
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,060
so-called "indestructible body".

122
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,140
Your Grace, I shall demonstrate.

123
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,630
Six Ding protects my bones.

124
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,740
Six Jia enters my flesh.

125
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,980
I summon

126
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,180
the Six Ding and Six Jia gods!

127
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,970
Swift by the divine order!

128
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,890
He made paper figures self-ignite

129
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,290
and dipped his hand in boiling oil,

130
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,260
completely unharmed!

131
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,700
Like a god descended to earth!

132
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,180
Let me see.

133
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,250
What are you doing?

134
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,180
A cheap trick. Don't worry.

135
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,020
This is no "indestructible body".

136
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,340
This pot contains

137
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,290
a mix of oil and vinegar.

138
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,140
Oil is lighter,

139
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,850
so it floats on top.

140
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:44,850
Vinegar boils more easily,

141
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,970
so the liquid seems scalding

142
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,850
when it's actually cool.

143
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,210
Try it yourselves.

144
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,740
Do not attempt this lightly.

145
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,060
The ratio must be precise.

146
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,210
If done wrong,

147
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,140
you'll still be scalded.

148
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,170
Try it! Hurry!

149
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,540
Hurry!

150
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,180
Your Grace, it's true.

151
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:12,750
See?

152
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,370
Not a single burn.

153
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,700
- Guards!
- W... Wait!

154
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,020
I am a direct disciple

155
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,850
of the Divine Laozi himself!

156
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,410
- How dare you lay hands on me!
- Exactly!

157
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,210
You fraud in Taoist robes,

158
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,850
deceiving people with cheap tricks.

159
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,820
You disgrace true cultivators

160
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,140
and dare swindle Master Jingming?

161
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,570
Who knows how many common folk

162
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,170
you've cheated outside.

163
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,410
Yunyi, Yunjiu,

164
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,650
take the Taoist inside for a chat.

165
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,100
- Yes.
- Yes.

166
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:47,860
Young Master, My Lady.

167
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,340
I'm sorry. Please spare me.

168
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,740
I'll never do it again.

169
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,580
Silence!

170
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,050
You fraud,

171
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,410
how dare you swindle me?

172
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,860
Take them away.

173
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,530
Beat them fifty times.

174
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,010
- Yes.
- Yes.

175
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:06,740
- Spare me, please.
- Have mercy, Young Master!

176
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,260
- Spare me!
- Please, spare me!

177
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,460
Don't believe

178
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,020
such baseless lies in the future.

179
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,820
Jingming,

180
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,770
how could you treat me like this for her?

181
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,270
Have you forgotten

182
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,690
what I've endured all these years?

183
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,020
Let's go.

184
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,220
Actually, Qingqing

185
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,030
wasn't like this before.

186
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,410
Over the years,

187
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,060
she...

188
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,380
You don't need to explain.

189
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,650
I know what kind of person she is.

190
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,770
She must have been

191
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,380
manipulated

192
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,340
by Wang Danling.

193
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,060
Where's Danling?

194
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,170
Why did you bring me

195
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,460
such a fraud?

196
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,020
This "Taoist Li"

197
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,860
humiliated me in front of Shen Jiangli.

198
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,370
Qingqing,

199
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,380
calm down.

200
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,460
Let me explain.

201
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,140
I didn't know he was a fraud.

202
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,580
How about

203
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,340
reporting him to the authorities?

204
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,340
(Worth every penny I spent on Taoist Li.)

205
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,260
(At least he didn't turn me in.)

206
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:28,650
(Shen Jiangli,)

207
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,260
(I underestimated you.)

208
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:33,860
All these years,

209
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,100
Father sent her traveling

210
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,070
to broaden her mind,

211
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,570
so she wouldn't be trapped in the house,

212
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,100
dwelling on how she left scars.

213
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,100
The Lu family is boiling with secrets.

214
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,170
Since I married in,

215
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,120
outsiders blame me

216
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,810
for every

217
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,010
misfortune.

218
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:58,930
After today's farce,

219
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,410
I'll find solid evidence

220
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,290
and show you the truth.

221
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,940
By the way,

222
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,410
there's something

223
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,810
that's been on my mind.

224
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,140
I can't shake this uneasy feeling.

225
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,650
A match between Qingqing

226
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,860
and that intellectual elite, Su Rui'an.

227
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,530
I noticed Qingqing

228
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,770
seems quite fond of him.

229
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,740
His reputation is rising fast.

230
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,570
I've heard of him too.

231
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,100
But Su Rui'an

232
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,260
is the Lady Wang's distant nephew.

233
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,460
Now that I'm competing with Jingxiu,

234
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,340
I doubt Lady Wang has good intentions.

235
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,220
It seems there's more to this.

236
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,960
I'll send someone to check it.

237
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,700
Good.

238
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,380
I'm doing this for myself.

239
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,100
I don't want any more trouble.

240
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,220
Yunyi, Consort Jiangli is amazing.

241
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,500
That boiling oil trick

242
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,500
scared me half to death.

243
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,860
How did she figure it out?

244
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,410
And the Taoist
could make paper figures self-ignite.

245
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,740
How did Consort Jiangli know

246
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,170
he was just a fraud?

247
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,180
I'm not sure either.

248
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,550
White phosphorus

249
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,630
ignites easily

250
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,570
in the open air.

251
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,300
That Taoist

252
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,440
must have sprinkled it

253
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,380
on the talisman paper.

254
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,620
Master Jingming was impressive too...

255
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,620
Meanwhile, I understood nothing.

256
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:46,220
(Rain Chamber)

257
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,060
My Lady!

258
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,100
Where are my pigeons?

259
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:51,860
My Lady! My Lady!

260
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:53,860
My Lady!

261
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,980
My Lady, look.

262
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,810
This is a small token of my respect,

263
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,650
specially prepared for you.

264
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,290
I hope you can

265
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,410
let bygones be bygones.

266
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,000
A noble heart overlooks petty faults.

267
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:05,930
What is this?

268
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,030
Pigeon soup.

269
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,810
It's very nourishing.

270
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,100
Pigeon?

271
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,300
Yes.

272
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,360
Where did you catch it?

273
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,810
Right around here.

274
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,580
Nanny...

275
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,170
It was my messenger pigeon.

276
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,340
Now it become soup due to you.

277
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,980
Tell me, how should I thank you?

278
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,500
My Lady, spare me!

279
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,340
I truly didn't know!

280
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,580
My Lady,

281
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,050
can you consider

282
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,300
that I meant well?

283
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:35,920
My Lady.

284
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,260
That villain who harmed the princess.

285
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,290
I've seen him in the city before.

286
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,100
- Really?
- Absolutely true!

287
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,930
Even with ten thousand lives to spare,

288
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,100
I wouldn't dare lie.

289
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,620
I'm old friends with Nanny Dai,

290
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,100
the princess's attendant.

291
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,380
One day,

292
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,380
we saw that very villain on the street.

293
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,100
Nanny Dai swore

294
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,570
he was the one
who disfigured the princess.

295
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,170
I remember clearly

296
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,770
the villain

297
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,100
had a scar on his face.

298
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:09,770
Jiangli,

299
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,140
the person from the portrait

300
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,140
Nanny Dong gave us

301
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,170
should be around here.

302
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:14,500
Let's look for him.

303
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,460
Alright.

304
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,180
(Laifu Inn)

305
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,840
Dumplings for sale!

306
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,500
Big, fragrant dumplings!

307
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,460
Jiangli, that must be Tai.

308
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,690
I'll seize the chance to grab him.

309
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:27,530
Don't act yet.

310
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:28,880
So many people are here.

311
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,780
Let's follow him first.

312
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,240
Fine fabrics! Take a look!

313
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,170
What's so great about wealth?

314
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,250
When noblemen and rich men

315
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,400
hit rock bottom,

316
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,460
aren't they just like me?

317
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,660
Hiding away, scraping by.

318
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,570
My life is

319
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,410
way more comfortable than theirs.

320
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,260
Who's about to be unlucky now?

321
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,690
Well, it's not me.

322
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,410
If I have wine today,

323
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,740
I'll get drunk today.

324
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,500
No, no... not me!

325
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,140
A nobody like me, who could I offend?

326
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,100
Consort Danling.

327
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,140
- You're dead.
- Spare me!

328
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,260
- Have mercy!
- Move!

329
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,170
Who dares touch
the one Consort Jiangli wants?

330
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,860
Tie him up tight. Don't let him escape.

331
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,180
Yes.

332
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,500
How did you find me?

333
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,020
You already know, don't you?

334
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,500
You've been tracking me,

335
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,100
digging into my past.

336
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,500
What are you afraid of?

337
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,500
I never thought you, Master Jingming,

338
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,770
would stoop to

339
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:00,930
such underhanded tricks.

340
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,010

358
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,810
I know.

359

no need for such formality.

You should head back.

00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:37,650
Why the long face?

383
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,780
What's wrong?

384
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,500
The assassination…

385
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,660
failed.

386
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,940
What do you mean by "failed"?

387
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,020
Either Shen Jiangli or Tai dead

388
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,900
would've been enough.

389
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:52,900
Neither died.

390
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:55,850
Not a single one?

391
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,370
Useless!

392
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,700
Forgive me, My Lady.

393
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,220
Master Jingming intervened suddenly.

394
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,940
Or they'd be dead for sure.

395
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,460
Lu Jingming.

396
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:06,650
Yes.

397
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,220
He even took Tai

398
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,460
back to his mansion.

399
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,090
Useless.

400
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,290
What kind of people did you hire?

401
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,660
It was such a simple task!

402
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,180
If that Tai spills the beans...

403
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,610
Please calm down.

404
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,420
Tai wouldn't dare rat you out.

405
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,020
Even if he says something wild,

406
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,560
it'd be Shen Jiangli
forcing a false confession,

407
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,050
and colluding with Tai

408
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,530
to slander you.

409
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,900
Who are you people?

410
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,700
Why did you drag me here?

411
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,020
Do you know the princess?

412
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,580
Princess?

413
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,090
I'm just a lowly beggar.

414
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,700
How would I have anything to do with royalty?

415
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,810
Now if you're asking about the girls

416
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,260
from Joy House, I could name a few.

417
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,630
This is Master Jingming's Mansion.

418
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,660
We wouldn't arrest you

419
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,050
without reason.

420
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,300
Talk straight.

421
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,700
So what?

422
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:08,980
Can Master Jingming
arrest anyone he wants?

423
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,460
Playing dumb, huh?

424
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,740
Yulan.

425
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,170
Yes.

426
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:19,410
Listen,

427
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,530
we know exactly what you've done.

428
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,370
This is your chance to confess.

429
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,260
Tai.

430
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,940
Do you know what this is?

431
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,700
Leeches. They suck human blood.

432
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,980
If you keep playing dumb

433
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,700
we'll coat you with honey.

434
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:37,570
These leeches love honey.

435
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,290
I'll talk! I'll talk.

436
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:41,610
I'll confess.

437
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,780
Last year,

438
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,740
the theft at the Garment Shop

439
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:47,850
was me.

440
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,370
But I only stole one silver ingot.

441
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,570
And... and the year before,

442
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:53,730
the fire at Yixiantian Tavern…

443
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:54,900
I set that.

444
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,220
But I just owed a few drinks!

445
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,660
Mr. Chen threatened to break my right leg.

446
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,660
I lost my temper

447
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,700
and lit the place up.

448
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,130
And... and three years ago...

449
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,220
Start with five years ago.

450
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,500
Five years ago?

451
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,980
I... I don't remember.

452
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,420
Don't you?

453
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,260
Let me refresh your memory.

454
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,580
Five years ago,

455
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,360
on the day of
the Prefect's birthday banquet.

456
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:15,890
That day

457
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,740
someone saw you

458
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,050
dressed as a servant,
sneaking into the Prefect's Mansion.

459
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,420
You poisoned the Prefect's wine cup.

460
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,180
Luckily, the guards caught you,

461
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:25,700
but you still managed to escape.

462
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,050
Nonsense. I didn't do it.

463
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,330
If you won't confess until you're cornered,

464
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,090
then come with me to the Prefect's Mansion.

465
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,050
They won't be as polite as I am.

466
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:40,130
I was near the Prefect's Mansion that day,

467
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:42,370
but I was drunk.

468
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,940
I accidentally dragged a young lady

469
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,610
out of her carriage.

470
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:46,980
Only later did I learn

471
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:48,570
she was the Prefect's daughter.

472
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,500
Who put you up to this?

473
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,700
No... No one.

474
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,860
It was an accident.

475
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,570
Tai, think carefully.

476
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,700
Your master already tried to silence you.

477
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:58,700
If I hadn't been there today,

478
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,370
you'd be dead already.

479
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:03,370
Only Master Jingming can protect you now.

480
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,460
This is your last chance.

481
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,850
I hate

482
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,700
dealing with fools.

483
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:14,610
Take him away.

484
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:15,980
I'll talk! I'll talk!

485
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,050
I'll confess.

486
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:17,890
Let me speak.

487
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,780
It was all...

488
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,020
Consort Danling's doing.

489
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,060
Consort Danling?

490
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,780
Tell me about it.

491
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,980
If I suspect you're lying,

492
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,530
I'll send you straight to her mansion.

493
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,090
Back then, she sent someone to me

494
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:33,940
and ordered me to kill you.

495
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:37,090
She paid me a fortune in silver.

496
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,340
Later,

497
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,810
she came to me again

498
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,810
and warned me never to breathe a word.

499
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,020
Or she'd make sure I died without a grave.

500
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,060
She also said...

501
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,940
If anyone ever tracked me down,

502
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:48,810
I should swear under oath

503
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,930
that it was

504
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,530
Consort Jiangli's scheme.

505
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,660
Just as I thought.

506
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,130
Wang Danling
is truly domineering and ruthless.

507
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,850
She actually went this far

508
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,180
to destroy someone.

509
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,740
Take him away.

510
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,460
Guard him closely.

511
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,820
Yes.

512
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,100
Move.

513
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,850
Now that we have Tai as a witness,

514
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,370
I can finally

515
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,810
clear my name with you.

516
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,130
Qingqing innocently got caught

517
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:23,770
in the feud between Wang Danling and me.

518
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,700
We owe her the truth.

519
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,850
So back then, you were framed.

520
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,850
I wronged you.

521
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,260
Tomorrow,

522
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,570
let's take

523
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,900
Tai together

524
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,220
and explain everything to Qingqing.

525
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,740
(Master Jingming's Mansion)

526
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,580
Jiangli,

527
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,660
you told me to investigate Su Rui'an.

528
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,900
He's indeed shady.

529
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,740
What did you find?

530
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,700
Su Rui'an is a total fraud.

531
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,900
That "elite" reputation?

532
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:50,970
Fake.

533
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,610
Many in Jiangnan know that,

534
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,180
but out of respect for his father,

535
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:55,290
they keep quiet.

536
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:56,810
His father even paid someone

537
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,940
to take the provincial exam for him.

538
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:00,810
Then how did he win

539
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,290
those recent poetry

540
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,290
and chess competitions?

541
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,180
Probably the same old tricks.

542
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,850
Bribes, proxies, and cheating.

543
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,130
Then let's dig up

544
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,180
exactly how he cheated.

545
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:12,690
On it!

546
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:14,530
Interesting.

547
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,050
What's interesting?

548
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:19,980
I looked into Su Rui'an.

549
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,420
He's up to no good.

550
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,530
You're truly remarkable.

551
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,980
With Tai's testimony,

552
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,810
Qingqing's grudge should be resolved.

553
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,440
You came just in time.

554
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,460
Give me some money.

555
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,420
- How much?
- As much as possible.

556
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,090
You're in charge of household accounts now.

557
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,660
Take what you need

558
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,290
from the treasury.

559
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,180
Aren't you going to ask

560
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,180
what it's for?

561
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,500
What for?

562
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:46,330
I'm treating you to a grand show.

563
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,460
Nanny Dai,

564
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,260
it's been five days.

565
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,020
Why hasn't he come to see me yet?

566
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:00,690
Your Grace,

567
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,050
perhaps Mr. Su was delayed by some matter.

568
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,220
Delayed by what?

569
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,610
Why should you even think of

570
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:08,550
that good-for-nothing?

571
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,740
Mr. Su is a renowned talent from Jiangnan!

572
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,700
Renowned talent?

573
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:13,940
An overrated fraud.

574
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,130
Shen Jiangli.

575
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,810
Why must you oppose me at everything?

576
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,810
Five years ago you ruined my face,

577
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,940
and now you're ruining my marriage.

578
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,290
What happened five years ago
wasn't my doing.

579
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:26,900
Now I'm actually helping you.

580
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,290
That Su Rui'an is no good man.

581
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,260
I've sent an invitation
to play chess with him.

582
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,850
He's replied to me.

583
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,370
Tomorrow at 7 PM,

584
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,610
we'll meet at Heming Villa.

585
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,740
See for yourself.

586
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,820
(Land of Peace)

587
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,530
- We'll get to see some drama.
- Indeed.

588
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:51,180
Mr. Su, the hour has come.

589
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,180
Won't you show yourself?

590
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:54,770
Mr. Su has arrived.

591
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,370
Here he comes.

592
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,460
My apologies, my apologies.

593
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,220
I'm late.

594
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,370
You are rather late.

595
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,570
Miss, might I ask your name?

596
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,530
Best not to ask.

597
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,900
Let's just begin.

598
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,420
Such extravagance.

599
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,820
Rosewood

600
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,020
and white jade...

601
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:27,780
Miss,

602
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,330
you invited me to a game,

603
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:30,700
so I specially chose this place

604
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,810
and this chess kit.

605
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:32,890
What do you think?

606
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,810
I like it very much.

607
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,340
Please, have a seat.

608
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,660
Liuyan, sit.

609
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,850
Mr. Su, won't you join the game?

610
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,530
Miss,

611
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:50,530
my master always plays chess this way.

612
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:51,740
Distance from the board

613
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,530
helps him contemplate the game.

614
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:57,090
Mr. Su,

615
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,050
you're certainly unconventional.

616
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,290
You flatter me.

617
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,700
Shall we decide who plays first? Please.

618
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:10,770
Four, an even number.

619
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,220
You take white and move first.

620
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,460
First move: Tengen.
[*Tengen: center]

621
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,500
She started with Tengen.

622
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:21,610
How audacious!

623
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,810
Seems she's here to make trouble.

624
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,020
3-3 point.

625
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,420
Your Grace, if you want to go, just go.

626
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,130
I will help you with the petals.

627
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,020
No need.

628
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,290
Is she here to wreck the game?

629
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:56,980
- Look.
- Yeah.

630
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,130
It's unclear who will win.

631
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,940
Miss, if you lose,

632
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,420
would you honor me

633
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,940
with moon-viewing together?

634
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,740
Mr. Su, you're overconfident.

635
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:08,930
Lately,

636
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,940
I've seen Mr. Su often with the princess.

637
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,020
If word spreads

638
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,290
of you flirting today,

639
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,570
won't the princess be jealous?

640
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:19,660
The princess does admire me.

641
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,050
Mr. Su, good fortune is coming to you.

642
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:23,900
To marry such a beautiful princess.

643
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,500
Mr. Su, what fortune!

644
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:29,180
I've never cared about

645
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,180
a woman's face.

646
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:32,900
The princess and I

647
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,290
are just friends.

648
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:35,770
Actually,

649
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:38,260
I admire the one before me,

650
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:40,660
a skilled player who rivals me.

651
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,500
Well, I don't admire you.

652
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,020
This lady plays at 11-13.

653
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,700
Mr. Su, it's your turn.

654
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:12,810
I... I need to think.

655
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:16,740
What's there to think about?

656
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,290
This is an obvious move.

657
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:20,020
Silent observers are true gentlemen.

658
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,740
Mr. Su has his own reasons.

659
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,090
Mr. Su,

660
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,460
you've been thinking

661
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,770
rather long for this move.

662
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,300
What's going on?

663
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,180
Where is everyone?

664
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,540
Ready?

665
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,260
Yes.

666
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,180
13-15.

667
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:46,180
Young Master,
there's already a piece at 13-15.

668
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,810
Mr. Su, you must be fatigued.

669
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,810
Weren't you saying

670
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,090
distance aids thought?

671
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,780
Yes, I'm a bit tired.

672
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,490
You.

673
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:01,450
Fetch me hot water.

674
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,210
What's going on?

675
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:05,500
No need to check.

676
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,780
What?

677
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,610
Mr. Su, are you looking for them?

678
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,180
Mr. Su,

679
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:17,020
after humoring you for so long,

680
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,180
I'm truly exhausted.

681
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,700
Everyone, take a look.

682
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,330
This so-called "Jiangnan elite"

683
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,370
is nothing but a fraud.

684
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:25,570
He didn't win the poetry and chess contests

685
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,220
on his own,

686
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:28,530
but with these helpers.

687
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,810
This young lady,

688
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:32,220
you mustn't slander me.

689
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:33,940
I don't even know them.

690
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:36,500
What happened?

691
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,050
Do you want to ask them

692
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,900
why they took your money

693
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,810
