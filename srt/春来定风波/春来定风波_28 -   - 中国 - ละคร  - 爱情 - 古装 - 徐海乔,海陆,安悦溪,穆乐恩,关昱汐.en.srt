23
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,960
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry...

25
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,600
I'm so sorry.

The Grand Princess

Shuyu,

32
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,630
I'm sorry.

Where is everyone?

00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,600

Qilan...

38
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,280
Qilan.

39
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,720
Master Jingming...

40
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,110
His internal organs are unharmed.

41
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,060
His life is not in danger.

42
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:20,960
Please rest assured.

43
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,110
I'll take my leave now.

44
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,720
Consort Jiangli, please wait.

45
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,200
This is what happened.

46
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,080
Thank you.

47
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,800
Father,

48
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,870
are you still troubled about Jingxiu?

49
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,470
I know

50
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,720
he's always been ambitious,
craving power.

51
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,840
So, I've always treated him strictly,

52
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,990
hoping to curb those desires.

53
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,720
But even so,

54
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,110
he still ended up like this.

55
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,230
Is it because I failed

56
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,230
as a father?

57
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:28,950
Father,

58
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,280
please don't think that way.

59
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,520
This was his own choice.

60
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,960
Over the years,

61
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,550
as long as he didn't go too far,

62
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,840
I turned a blind eye

63
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,790
and let it slide.

64
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:40,730
But now,

65
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,600
he's gone so far

66
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,550
as to harm his own blood.

67
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,310
That truly disappoints me.

68
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,200
Jingxiu wanted to rule four states,

69
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,550
but now he's become a commoner

70
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,110
and been confined
to his mansion for life.

71
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,390
That is

72
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,720
the greatest punishment for him.

73
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,910
I hope he truly reflects on it.

74
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,520
If he were more like you and Jingming,

75
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,790
he wouldn't have ended up like this.

76
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,040
I know you, your mother,

77
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,160
and Jingming have tolerated

78
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,520
many things for their sake.

79
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,840
Your mother and Lady Wang

80
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,280
have been bickering half their lives.

81
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,600
Though they never got along

82
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,990
and always argued,

83
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,960
they never

84
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,280
did such cruel things to each other.

85
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,190
Father,

86
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,910
everything's over.

87
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,870
We have to move forward.

88
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,310
Qinian...

89
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,870
Thank you for sparing Jingxiu's life.

90
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,960
I know

91
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,040
he's committed unforgivable sins.

92
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,910
As his mother, it was my fault

93
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,670
for failing to teach him.

94
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,960
I no longer have the face to stay here.

95
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,080
I request to retire to the temple.

96
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,760
Don't blame yourself.

97
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,670
Everything is over.

98
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,080
If you, as his mother,

99
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,920
bear some fault,

100
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,640
then I, as his father,

101
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,200
must also take responsibility.

102
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,620
Things have come to this.

103
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,280
Let's hope he'll reflect
on his mistakes.

104
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,480
My Lord.

105
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,870
If you really leave,

106
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,160
no one will argue with me anymore.

107
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,310
I won't be used to that.

108
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,360
Alright then.

109
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,840
We've argued for half our lives.

110
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,940
We might as well enjoy some peace

111
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,060
in the other half.

112
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,160
When you have time,

113
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,830
come to my chamber often

114
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,400
to keep me company.

115
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,070
Why don't you come to my chamber?

116
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,000
Here we go again.

117
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,950
Alright, I'll come to you.

118
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,240
Lu Jingxing, you lost.

119
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,880
You used to admire

120
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,910
Jingxiu so much,

121
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,910
but look at him now.

122
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,670
I never thought

123
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,430
he'd turn out this way either.

124
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,830
But after all this,

125
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:21,910
I've thought a lot too.

126
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,220
Look at Jingming and Jiangli.

127
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,550
They worked so hard for the people.

128
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,120
That really inspired me.

129
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,070
This is our family's land

130
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,760
but also the people's.

131
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,710
As a son of the Prefect,

132
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,950
I should stay

133
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,310
and do something

134
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,310
for the people.

135
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,910
Alright.

136
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,240
I'll stay here

137
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,710
with you.

138
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,500
(Master Jingming's Mansion)

139
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,000
Your injury has mostly healed.

140
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,280
I should leave now.

141
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,320
Jiangli,

142
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,270
I know

143
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,860
I have no right to keep you here,

144
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,360
but I still want

145
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,760
to tell you

146
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,630
that I'm sorry.

147
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,790
Why are you apologizing to me?

148
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,190
Whether it was five years ago

149
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,070
or this time,

150
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,400
I know I hurt you deeply.

151
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,830
You can choose to leave.

152
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,120
You don't have to forgive me.

153
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,790
But I owe you this apology,

154
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,480
and I have to say it.

155
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,960
I do blame you.

156
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,160
I'm so mad.

157
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,640
I blame you for not trusting me.

158
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,400
I'm mad because you got hurt.

159
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,040
I know everything now.

160
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,000
Princess Chuya

161
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,240
told me everything.

162
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,430
From now on,

163
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,480
no matter what danger we face,

164
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,280
let's face it together.

165
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,630
Is that okay?

166
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,370
♪So, I cross mountains and rivers♪

167
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:24,100
♪I'm there for you on the journey♪

168
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,810
♪So what if the years have faded♪

169
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:28,830
I promise.

170
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:47,620
(Dongzhou)

171
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,480
Seeing the two of you reconciled,

172
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,400
I can finally rest easy.

173
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:56,670
Princess Chuya,

174
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,000
this time,

175
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,590
you've helped us resolve

176
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,670
a huge crisis in Dongzhou,

177
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,040
spared our people from war,

178
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,240
and allowed them

179
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,550
to live in peace.

180
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,760
On behalf of the people of Dongzhou,

181
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,040
I must express our gratitude.

182
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,630
Thank you.

183
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,720
From now on,

184
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,070
Dongzhou and Xizhou

185
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,320
will be allies.

186
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:18,880
We'll never have war

187
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,320
to share peace.

188
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,670
I consider you two close friends,

189
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,240
so there's no need for formalities.

190
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,910
In the future, Xizhou and Dongzhou

191
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,670
will certainly remain allied.

192
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,950
Your Grace,

193
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,880
we are grateful to you

194
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,550
for your repeated help.

195
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,630
When you return to Xizhou,

196
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,550
if there's anything we can do,

197
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,960
just let us know.

198
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,000
We'll be glad to help.

199
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,910
Thank you, Master Jingming,
Consort Jiangli.

200
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,360
During my stay here,

201
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,190
I was hoping to find a good husband,

202
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,670
but it seems I'll have
to return empty-handed.

203
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,640
Though you didn't find a husband,

204
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,760
you gained two loyal friends.

205
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,430
That is still a blessing.

206
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,160
From now on,

207
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,710
Dongzhou will be your second home.

208
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,590
Feel free to come back anytime.

209
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,640
Your Grace, you'll surely be busy

210
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,710
when you return to Xizhou.

211
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,830
Once you've settled down,
do come back.

212
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,830
I'll prepare fine wine and food

213
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,760
to host you.

214
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,160
Sure. It's a deal.

215
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,190
If you have time later,

216
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,000
welcome to visit Xizhou.

217
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,670
I'll take you on a tour

218
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,760
of our beautiful land.

219
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,150
Sure.

220
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:34,670
Please stay.

221
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:35,910
Let's part here.

222
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,120
- Come on.
- Come on.

223
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,840
Let's have a drink.

224
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,880
Jingming, you truly have foresight.

225
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,790
Everything went as planned.

226
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,210
Jingxing, how's the investigation

227
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,200
into the deaths

228
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,590
caused by the plague?

229
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,600
Any new leads?

230
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,550
At this point,

231
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,530
what's the point of that?

232
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,710
We might as well leave it unresolved.

233
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,040
Exactly.

234
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,590
Jingming, just focus on preparing

235
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,950
to marry your lovely bride

236
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,520
and the great power behind her.

237
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,790
Now that Yanyan and Jiangli
are safely away,

238
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,640
what's her innocence to you?

239
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,830
We no longer need to help you with this.

240
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,360
Jingxing, listen to me.

241
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,630
Jingming,

242
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,670
I'm afraid of my wife.

243
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,040
Yao is in charge here.

244
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,400
You're on your own.

245
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,960
You two, please wait.

246
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,830
Actually, everything

247
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,010
was part of the plan
of the princess and me.

248
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,150
So now,

249
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,670
this isn't just

250
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,880
about clearing

251
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,720
Jiangli's name.

252
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,790
There's a huge conspiracy behind this,

253
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,340
involving the relationship
between the two states.

254
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,760
If we let it continue

255
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,670
and don't expose

256
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,710
Jingxiu's true nature soon,

257
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,410
the people of both states

258
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,360
will never know peace.

259
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,550
If that's true,

260
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,070
we still don't know

261
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,400
how many troops Jingxiu has.

262
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,670
What if...

263
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:52,910
This is

264
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,760
very dangerous

265
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,720
so I didn't want

266
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,590
to drag Jiangli and Yanyan into this.

267
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,030
Jingming,

268
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,360
we'll face this crisis

269
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,070
together with you.

270
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,400
That was a fight

271
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,240
between two brothers.

272
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,280
Who would want

273
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,000
to see that?

274
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,790
Jingxiu is truly cruel

275
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,160
to harm his own kin.

276
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,240
He's shown no love for family.

277
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,860
He's tried to kill his brother.

278
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,460
He even gave
Wang Danling contraceptives.

279
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,830
What can't he do?

280
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,030
No matter what,

281
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,310
everything has been settled.

282
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,250
Let's not dwell on this.

283
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,180
Let's talk about the future.

284
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,880
Jingxing,

285
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,240
what are your plans

286
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,790
moving forward?

287
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,480
Yao and I have already discussed it.

288
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,670
After seeing

289
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,910
how much you've done

290
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,010
for the peace of Dongzhou,

291
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,000
we feel we should do more.

292
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,910
So, we've decided

293
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,950
to stay in Dongzhou,

294
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,190
learn from you two,

295
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,190
and do something
for the people of Dongzhou.

296
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,000
That sounds great.

297
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,580
His name is Li Yuanxiang.

298
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,550
He'd been in the army for 18 years

299
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,680
and had never achieved any great merit.

300
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,040
He always said

301
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,110
he'd manage to survive

302
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,960
and serve his elderly mother at home.

303
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:21,790
This is Yang Shiyou,

304
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,470
a former scout.

305
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,480
To stop the enemy's leader

306
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,280
for me,

307
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:28,960
he clung desperately

308
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,240
to his horse's leg

309
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,680
and was dragged to death

310
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,720
by the horse.

311
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,000
That's Ding,

312
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,320
just 14 years old.

313
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,520
He should have been carefree,

314
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,040
but he died

315
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,620
in the blazing flames of battle.

316
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,790
I heard you describe

317
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,150
this battle before,

318
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,040
but it was even more brutal

319
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,070
than I imagined.

320
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,480
All these years,

321
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,590
whenever I closed my eyes,

322
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,630
each of their faces,

323
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:09,870
their voices in the army,

324
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,110
and every word they said to me

325
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,790
would come to my mind.

326
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,000
Master Jingming, it's time to eat.

327
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,480
Master Jingming, please rest early.

328
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,960
Don't worry, Master Jingming.

329
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,000
They were once

330
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,070
vibrant lives,

331
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,190
but in the end,

332
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,920
they all perished in that war.

333
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,710
So,

334
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,280
after going through all that,

335
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,350
I dare not place you and Yanyan

336
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,150
in any danger.

337
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,110
Not even the smallest danger.

338
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,390
I just couldn't.

339
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,550
Master Jingming.

340
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,680
Master Jingming,
you're here to see them again?

341
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,560
Yes.

342
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:17,990
Mrs. Li.

343
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,320
This is my wife.

344
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,630
How wonderful.

345
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,830
You two are a perfect match.

346
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,440
Do you have any children?

347
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,040
We have a son; he's four now.

348
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,790
Yuanxiang,

349
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,680
this year,

350
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,720
it's been five years since you left.

351
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,920
I miss you.

352
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,680
By the order of the Prefect,

353
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,790
Master Lu Jingming
is virtuous and talented.

354
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,510
He's diligent and loves the people.

355
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,920
He has been made the Young Prefect.

356
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,240
Ancestors above,

357
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,550
(Lu)

358
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,830
I'm Lu Jingming.

359
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,470
My wife and I are here paying respects.

360
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,240
May your spirits in heaven

361
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,920
protect the prosperity of Dongzhou.

362
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,550
May our family's legacy continue.

363
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,800
Shuyu,

364
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,760
it's been five years.

365
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,350
I finally dare to see you.

366
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,720
Did you know

367
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,240
the one who instigated the war
five years ago

368
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,310
was actually Jingxiu?

369
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,080
Now,

370
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,630
Jingxiu has received
his just punishment.

371
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:16,790
You can

372
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,520
rest in peace now.

373
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,870
I remember when you were young,

374
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,200
you said you hoped to see

375
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,720
a world without war,

376
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,760
where people live in peace.

377
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,520
Now,

378
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,870
Dongzhou and Xizhou
are on good terms,

379
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,080
and we agreed

380
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,310
to have no more wars.

381
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,150
I will protect this peace

382
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,920
on your behalf.

383
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:58,950
Shuyu,

384
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,760
I also came to see you.

385
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,840
Consort Jiangli.

386
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:50,470
Please sit.

387
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,070
Seeing you like this,

388
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,070
I'm not quite used to it.

389
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,200
You must have heard

390
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,520
about Master Jingxiu.

391
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,000
Father visited me

392
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,040
and told me

393
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,790
about what happened outside.

394
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,630
He's received his due punishment.

395
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,760
So,

396
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,630
what are your plans now?

397
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,670
I don't know.

398
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,790
Then why call me here today?

399
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,790
Seeing you now,

400
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,590
I feel at peace.

401
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,720
It was my stubbornness and obsession

402
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,870
that caused you so much suffering.

403
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,390
And now,

404
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,680
I've received my due punishment.

405
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,760
I don't know if you'll forgive me,

406
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,350
but I know

407
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,550
I was wrong.

408
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,310
I've let go

409
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,590
of the past

410
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,390
and hope you can

411
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,680
escape the shadows of it too.

412
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,280
Desire is like this blazing fire.

413
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,870
It will devour you,

414
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,280
making you lose your senses

415
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,150
and judgment.

416
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,620
But through the flames,
you can be reborn.

417
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,280
Now, you are about to leave
the ancestral tomb.

418
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,390
I hope you can forget all of this

419
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,350
and start anew.

420
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,830
I brought you

421
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,720
a gift today.

422
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,390
Let me help you

423
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,280
with this hairpin.

424
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,520
Danling,

425
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,550
your hairpin is crooked.

426
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,190
Alright.

427
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,390
Shen Jiangli.

428
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:28,990
I'm sorry.

429
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,480
Lu Qingqing,

430
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,310
you truly overestimated yourself.

431
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,870
What gave you the right

432
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,070
to think a hero

433
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,350
who's traveled everywhere

434
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,520
would stop for you?

435
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,550
Zimo.

453
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,080
Thank you, Jiangli.

454
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,120
By the way,

455
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,310
after drinking your medicinal soup
the other day,

456
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,110
I no longer have stomach pain.

457
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,550
What was it?

458
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,630
That was Four Herb Soup.

459
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:18,870
I made it with angelica,
prepared rehmannia, Chuan Xiong,

460
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,760
peony root, and chicken.

461
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,690
If you take it for a few days
every month,

462
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,070
you won't have any stomach pain.

463
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,680
Alright, I'll take it regularly.

464
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,360
Jiangli,

465
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,550
a few days ago, my head felt dizzy,

466
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:30,790
my eyes were sore,

467
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,070
and I had weakness in my limbs.

468
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,000
Thanks to your medicinal soup,

469
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,040
I'm completely better now.

470
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:37,200
What exactly was in that soup?

471
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:38,860
You have insufficient blood and qi

472
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,550
with internal heat from yin deficiency.

473
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:42,390
I made the soup with lily, rehmannia,

474
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,520
and chicken.

475
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:45,680
Jiangli, you're amazing.

476
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,430
Jiangli,

477
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,860
with your amazing medical skills

478
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,680
and so many amazing medicinal soups,

479
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,550
why don't you open a clinic?

480
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:53,950
Actually,

481
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,680
I had that idea before.

482
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,790
The conditions you mentioned

483
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,550
aren't really difficult diseases,

484
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,450
but there aren't enough physicians
in the city.

485
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,670
If more people

486
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,760
could learn medicine,

487
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,630
then when the common people fall ill,

488
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,310
they would receive timely treatment.

489
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,680
It's truly a blessing
to have Jiangli around.

490
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,960
Unlike those two consorts,

491
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,150
who are always fighting
in the inner chambers,

492
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,110
disturbing our peace of mind.

493
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:23,990
Forget it.

494
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,180
Let's not mention them.

495
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,200
Jiangli, try this cake.

496
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:32,990
Jiangli?

497
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,630
What's wrong?

498
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,790
I was just thinking.

499
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,280
Actually,

500
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,440
they're not inherently malicious.

501
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,240
Qilan wanted to escape her family

502
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,040
through marriage,

503
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,920
but instead,

504
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,390
she was dragged deeper into the mud

505
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,790
because of it.

506
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:56,150
As for Wang Danling, she was born noble.

507
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,250
She should've been carefree,

508
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,440
but she's trapped by her own obsessions.

509
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,440
Look at you two.

510
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,980
You've traveled across the four states,

511
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,070
gained vast knowledge,

512
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,210
and broadened your horizons.

513
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,110
Though you're in this land of power,

514
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,240
you don't fight for fame or fortune.

515
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,440
I have an idea.

516
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,140
I want to open a women's school

517
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,310
in Dongzhou

518
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,000
so that more women

519
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:22,870
can learn medicine,

520
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,000
read books,

521
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,590
broaden their horizons,

522
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,440
and have more to do with their lives

523
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,350
instead of being trapped
in the inner chambers.

524
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,600
Jiangli,

525
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,830
I once thought

526
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,520
I'd never forgive Wang Danling.

527
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,390
Without her,

528
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,830
I would've had
everything beautiful in my life.

529
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,870
But over these years of traveling,

530
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:47,870
I've seen greater mountains and seas,

531
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:51,110
witnessed the suffering of the people,

532
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,040
and seen the joys and sorrows

533
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,790
of those around me.

534
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,550
That's when I realized

535
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,000
how small

536
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,390
my own experiences are.

537
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,520
So what

538
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,800
if we don't have pretty looks?

539
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,480
Is a woman's value

540
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,680
only measured by her appearance?

541
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,280
Jiangli,

542
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,540
I agree with your idea
of opening a women's school.

543
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,390
As a woman myself,

544
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,920
I want to do my part

545
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,550
to help more people

546
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,590
so they can make more choices

547
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,200
for their own lives.

548
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:30,950
Jiangli,

549
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,680
I also support your idea.

550
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:33,960
Qingqing and I

551
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,310
will always support you.

552
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,430
Come on.

553
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,000
Let's raise a toast

554
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,440
to the bright future

555
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,280
of Dongzhou.

556
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,560
Cheers.

557
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,480
Jiangli, try this.

558
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,870
Alright, you eat more too.

559
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,080
Jingming,

560
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,350
there's something I must tell you.

561
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,150
Wind Pavilion is calling me back.

562
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,550
There's a major plague in Nanzhou,

563
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,720
and they want to call back our disciples

564
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,720
to treat it.

565
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,590
As a physician,

566
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,590
I must go.

567
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:25,710
Shen Jiangli,

568
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,590
you're not only the consort of Dongzhou

569
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,590
and my wife.

570
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,310
You're still yourself.
