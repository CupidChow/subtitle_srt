22
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,700
My dear, be gentle.

23
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,610
What are you thinking about?

24
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,980
You seem so lost in thought.

25
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,780
What else could it be?

26
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,960
Of course, it's Qilan's marriage.

27
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,420
Qilan is beautiful and talented,

28
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,690
graceful and intelligent.

29
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,420
She surely deserves a good match.

30
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,300
Master, don't you agree?

31
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,140
Good.

32
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,850
Master...

33
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,770
I mean you're right.

34
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,210
Today,

35
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,720
Lady Wang came to offer incense
to the late Mrs. Shen.

36
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,540
She intends to betroth Qilan
to Master Jingming.

37
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,100
Master Jingming?

38
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,630
Doesn't he already have Jiangli?

39
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,450
Master,

40
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,310
Jiangli has never been close to us
since childhood.

41
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,290
Look,

42
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:35,770
Master Jingming is now

43
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,490
at the height of his power.

44
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:38,930
What have you got?

45
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,650
It shows

46
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,980
Jiangli isn't one of us.

47
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,260
That's true.

48
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,140
But Qilan is different.

49
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,460
She grew up right before our eyes.

50
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,050
She's always dutiful
and respectful to you.

51
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,650
If Qilan could marry

52
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,930
Master Jingming,

53
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:59,820
then in the future,

54
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,420
she would surely give her all

55
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,730
to support our family.

56
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,330
That's true.

57
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,610
Jiangli has had no children for years.

58
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,860
If Qilan

59
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,420
could bear a child

60
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,770
then it would be

61
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,890
like adding wings to a tiger for you.

62
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,890
Exactly.

63
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,700
My dear,

64
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,850
you really are thoughtful.

65
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,980
Father, Mother,

66
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,540
I can't marry Master Jingming.

67
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,700
Your marriage

68
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,140
is not up to you.

69
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,420
Leave now.

70
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,260
Mother,

71
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:38,980
Father,

72
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,490
the entire city knows

73
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,630
that Master Jingming
and Consort Jiangli are in love.

74
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,020
If I married him,

75
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,100
wouldn't that drive Jiangli
and our family

76
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,980
even further apart?

77
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,300
Qilan,

78
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,380
you don't think as far ahead
as your mother.

79
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,580
Enough, it's settled.

80
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,890
- Leave.
- Father...

81
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,330
- Mother...
- Enough.

82
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,330
Go back now.

83
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,140
My dear,

84
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,100
you're so clever.

85
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,700
Your plan

86
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,980
- is brilliant.
- Master.

87
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,610
It's all thanks to you, my dear.

88
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,330
Jiangli.

89
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:13,770
Please sit.

90
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,860
Greetings, Consort Jiangli.

91
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,020
Try one of the pastries.

92
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,970
It looks so crispy on the outside
and soft inside.

93
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:23,890
It looks delicious.

94
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,210
Thank you, Jiangli.

95
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:33,860
Jiangli,

96
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,410
today, I came to you

97
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,020
because I'm in trouble.

98
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,250
What's wrong?

99
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,940
Father said

100
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,090
he wanted to betroth me
to Master Jingming.

101
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,290
I don't think this is up to Father.

102
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:52,820
I heard

103
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,500
it was Lady Wang who proposed this.

104
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,620
I see.

105
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,890
Setting aside my status,

106
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,970
Master Jingming is indeed a good match.

107
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,520
Jiangli,

108
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,620
I have no improper feelings

109
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,940
toward Master Jingming.

110
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,970
Since you came to me,

111
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,090
I know what is on your mind.

112
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,290
So, what do you plan to do?

113
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:17,020
Actually,

114
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,970
I already have someone I love.

115
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,970
We are deeply in love.

116
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,130
I will

117
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,380
marry no one else.

118
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,210
You can tell Father how you feel.

119
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,770
But Father didn't even give me

120
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,110
a chance to speak.

121
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,700
And besides, we...

122
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,450
We've pledged ourselves
to each other in private.

123
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,580
Father doesn't know about this.

124
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,020
You're quite bold.

125
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:40,980
Jiangli,

126
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:41,980
I was wrong.

127
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,210
But it's a matter of love.

128
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,290
I beg you to help me.

129
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,320
But

130
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,940
you haven't even told me who you love.

131
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,210
How can I help you?

132
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:53,980
It's...

133
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:55,530
Master Jingxiu.

134
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:14,810
Jiangli,

135
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,410
I'm not someone

136
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,530
who clings to the powerful.

137
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,650
Master Jingxiu and I are truly in love.

138
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:21,810
Qilan,

139
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,450
the world thinks

140
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,380
marrying a noble means a carefree life.

141
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,580
But its bitterness

142
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,290
is only known to the one living it.

143
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,890
With your beauty and talent,

144
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,090
you could be a wife in a great household

145
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,450
and have your husband love you.

146
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,180
Why must you be a concubine
of Master Jingxiu?

147
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,330
Besides, Master Jingxiu

148
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,060
is not in favor now.

149
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,740
I love Master Jingxiu

150
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,820
because of himself,

151
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,330
not his status or family background.

152
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,740
Besides, Master Jingxiu is gentle
and caring toward me.

153
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,090
So, I'm willing to be his wife

154
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,090
or concubine.

155
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,090
Hearing you say all this

156
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,380
reminds me of five years ago.

157
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:07,610
Qilan.

158
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,090
Jiangli!

159
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,330
Jiangli, you're back!

160
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,620
Look.

161
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,780
This is my gift to you
for my visit after the wedding.

162
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,760
It's beautiful.

163
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,840
Let me help you put it on.

164
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:16,860
Alright.

165
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,380
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

166
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:22,460
Thank you, Jiangli.

167
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,260
Jiangli,

168
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,140
does Master Jingming
treat you especially well?

169
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,820
On the wedding day,

170
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,740
I saw how graceful and noble he was

171
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,290
and how considerate he was toward you.

172
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,790
You two seemed so loving.

173
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,770
At first, I thought

174
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,020
Master Jingming and I

175
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,700
married because of our elders

176
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,620
and we barely knew each other,

177
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,890
so we might end up distant.

178
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,450
But unexpectedly,

179
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,970
he turned out to be thoughtful
and attentive.

180
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,820
Only thoughtful and attentive?

181
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,410
Not gentle and affectionate?

182
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,060
What about you, Qilan?

183
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,740
You're at a marriageable age.

184
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,700
What kind of man

185
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,580
do you wish to marry?

186
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,850
I haven't thought much about it.

187
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,180
As long as he's gentle and caring,
that's enough.

188
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,550
If he is an official,

189
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,290
I'll help him manage the household.

190
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,860
If he's a merchant,

191
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,140
I'll keep the accounts.

192
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,890
If he farms,

193
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:24,940
I'll weave at home.

194
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,090
All I ask for is someone I can rely on,

195
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,740
not someone like Father.

196
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,700
Qilan, in the future,

197
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,710
you'll surely find a man
who's just right for you.

198
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,690
Thank you, Consort Jiangli.

199
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,460
Look.

200
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,650
It's gotten so chubby.

201
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:40,740
This is Shen Xiaoli.

202
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,500
Xiaoli?

203
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,060
This is Shen Xiaolan.

204
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,770
- Xiaoli and Xiaolan.
- And the ones below.

205
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:47,610
Look.

206
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,250
Qilan,

207
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,020
since you've made up your mind,

208
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,170
I won't try to stop you.

209
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,170
But as your sister,

210
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,340
there's something I must say.

211
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,530
Wang Danling is arrogant
and domineering,

212
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,590
and she has the support of the general.

213
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,100
If you marry Master Jingxiu,

214
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,460
she will surely not tolerate you,

215
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,740
and Master Jingxiu

216
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,810
may not be able to protect you.

217
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,650
I understand.

218
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,530
As long as I can be with Master Jingxiu

219
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,220
openly and honorably,

220
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,770
I fear nothing.

221
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,460
But Master Jingxiu has a vast household.

222
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,530
The life there may differ

223
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:25,260
from the peaceful life you want
with your loved one.

224
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,860
The man you've chosen

225
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,260
may not be able

226
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,340
to give you a calm life.

227
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:32,940
Jiangli,

228
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,570
I've spent much time
with Master Jingxiu.

229
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,810
I know he's the man I want.

230
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,860
Even if it means flying into the fire
like a moth,

231
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,260
I'll have no regrets.

232
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,220
Alright.

233
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,410
I understand.

234
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,290
Greetings, Master Jingming.

235
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,170
I'll take my leave.

236
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,020
When did you get here?

237
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,410
When you said I was a good match.

238
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,460
Let me ask you.

239
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,460
Why set aside your status
when you said that?

240
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,340
I will never be

241
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,410
a good match for anyone else.

242
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,690
And you can never set anything aside.

243
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,020
Think clearly before you speak.

244
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,650
I've made up my mind.

245
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:43,650
Shen Jiangli,

246
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,500
I'll never let you go in this life.

247
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:51,220
♪So, I cross mountains and rivers♪

248
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:55,780
♪Just to keep you by my side♪

249
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,620
♪The joys and sorrows,
the partings and reunions♪

250
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,460
♪How profound♪

251
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,340
♪Whether it's to part or reunite
is not up to me♪

252
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,300
Jiangli.

253
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,130
Yulan.

254
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,170
Jiangli,

255
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,380
what were you talking about

256
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,770
with Master Jingming just now?

257
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:17,610
Nothing.

258
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,460
Yulan,

259
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,690
can you help me plant

260
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,890
a new pot of bush lily?

261
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:24,370
Jiangli,

262
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,020
are we staying here?

263
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,690
Mother's death is still suspicious.

264
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,220
We still

265
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:31,890
need to stay a while longer.

266
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:33,860
Alright, Jiangli.

267
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:48,890
Shen Jiangli,

268
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,080
I'll never let you go in this life.

269
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,460
Young Master.

270
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:02,980
Young Master?

271
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,340
Just now, I saw Consort Jiangli

272
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,770
sent someone to invite Mr. Chu
to Rain Chamber.

273
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,220
- What's wrong?
- It's fine.

274
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,060
Let me see.

275
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,370
Let go of me.

276
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,460
What's wrong?

277
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,590
My hand hurts.

278
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,020
Did I accidentally touch your wound?

279
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,650
Let go; let me take a look.

280
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,260
Where does it hurt?

281
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,010
Master Jingming,

282
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,590
don't you think you're overacting?

283
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,930
You didn't even injure that hand.

284
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,130
But

285
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,490
didn't you show a little concern
for me just now?

286
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,700
Absolutely not.

287
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,170
Wait, what are you doing here?

288
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,410
Where's Mr. Chu?

289
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,340
He should be here soon.

290
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,340
How do you know he'll come?

291
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,650
This is my mansion.

292
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,350
Is there anything that happens here

293
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,520
that I wouldn't know about?

294
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,130
Fine.

295
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,620
Bring the fish over.

296
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:30,410
Got it.

297
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,580
Be careful; it's hot.

298
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,840
Master Jingming is here too.

299
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,180
Mr. Chu,

300
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,570
this is my home.

301
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,810
Isn't it perfectly normal

302
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,140
for me to come back for a meal?

303
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,500
But Mr. Chu,

304
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,810
what brings you here to eat?

305
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,920
Jiangli knew I'd been appointed
as the Director of Astrology,

306
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,880
so she invited me over

307
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:08,620
to celebrate.

308
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,290
Mr. Chu, your stay in Dongzhou

309
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,650
is a blessing to the people.

310
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:18,770
Of course,

311
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,050
my wife and I had

312
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,290
to celebrate together for you.

313
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,530
You claimed

314
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,530
we'd celebrate together,

315
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,500
but what did you do?

316
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:25,940
I...

317
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,130
Jiangli,

318
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,270
your favorite duck leg.

319
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,460
Here.

320
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,300
Thanks, Zimo.

321
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:36,620
Zimo,

322
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,620
I made this crucian carp soup
just for you.

323
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,100
Drink it while it's hot.

324
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,460
It smells wonderful.

325
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,130
How is it?

326
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,240
It reminds me of Wind Pavilion.

327
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,650
Try this too.

328
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,770
I remember these bamboo shoots.

329
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,200
You used to cook them for us often.

330
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,940
Yes.

331
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,050
Mentor loved them.

332
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:02,820
The taste hasn't changed.

333
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:08,770
At my mansion,

334
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,620
how can I let a guest do the work?

335
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,340
Let me do it.

336
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,490
Jiangli.

337
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:19,860
Zimo,

338
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:22,500
congratulations on your promotion.

339
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,010
Thank you, Jiangli,

340
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,620
for making such a lovely meal.

341
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,050
By the way, Zimo, how's Mentor doing?

342
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,100
Is he well?

343
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,690
He's very well.

344
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,340
You said you'd go back but didn't.

345
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,260
Now, Mentor

346
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,380
misses you even more.

347
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,290
He must be upset with me.

348
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,890
I'll go visit him as soon as I can.

349
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,690
What about Yanyan? Is he studying well?

350
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:44,610
Oh, right.

351
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,220
Look.

352
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,140
Guess what this is.

353
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:49,980
What is it?

354
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:54,610
Look.

355
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,500
Did Yanyan draw this?

356
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,620
Of course.

357
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,620
It's so good.

358
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,380
Look at the bamboo.

359
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,860
That's me, right?

360
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,860
And this one...

361
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,700
It's me.

362
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,770
We were out to enjoy the spring.

363
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,860
Yes, we flew kites together that day.

364
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,500
Do you remember the kite?

365
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,340
Yanyan and I made it for you.

366
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,380
Of course, I remember.

367
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,810
It was beautiful.

368
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,690
Yanyan's drawing is amazing.

369
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:19,930
I'm going to keep it.

370
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,050
Thanks, Zimo. You eat more too.

371
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:25,890
Alright.

372
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,420
Master Jingming, you're not eating?

373
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,860
I'm full.

374
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,500
How is it?

375
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,170
The Prefect

376
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:46,930
can fight with three states.

377
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,100
Great.

378
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:51,530
Jingming,

379
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,620
your wife is not only skilled
in medicine,

380
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,980
but she's getting better
at sweet-talking.

381
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,140
Father,

382
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,340
Jiangli has a lively nature.

383
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,530
Please don't take offense.

384
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,060
Sit.

385
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:03,530
Jingming,

386
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,220
you should learn from your wife.

387
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,850
Don't always be so rigid.

388
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,580
Understood, Father.

389
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,500
Greetings, Father, Mother, Lady Shu.

390
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:23,890
Father.

391
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,870
It's been a while since I last came.

392
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,330
Please punish me as you see fit.

393
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,500
You two have been busy

394
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,370
distributing congee
and helping the victims.

395
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,770
It's been hard on you.

396
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,820
Jingxiu,

397
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,740
Danling had no money
for disaster relief,

398
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,490
but there was no need
to sell her jewelry.

399
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,940
If you ever need anything,

400
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,260
I can pay for that.

401
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,700
Thank you, Father.

402
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,460
Thank you for your concern, Father.

403
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,760
I intend to stay home

404
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,570
and pray for blessings.

405
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,090
The jewelry is of no use to me.

406
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,370
If it can help the victims,

407
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,740
it's a blessing for me too.

408
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,330
No wonder people always say

409
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,700
that like father, like daughter.

410
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,460
In times of crisis,

411
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,770
the general's daughter
indeed stands out.

412
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:00,930
Father,

413
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,130
I will study hard

414
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,370
to learn how to govern the state.

415
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,500
Take a seat.

416
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,020
Thank you, Father.

417
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,530
My Lord, speaking of disaster relief,

418
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,530
Jingming has contributed too.

419
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,810
You mustn't overlook him.

420
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:14,810
Indeed, Qinian.

421
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,050
But

422
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,810
it seems Master Jingming

423
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,290
doesn't need any more treasure.

424
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:20,980
If you want to give a reward,

425
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:24,220
why not give something meaningful?

426
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,460
Lady Wang, it sounds like

427
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,530
you already have something in mind.

428
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,420
A few days ago, I heard from the nannies

429
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,050
who went out to buy things

430
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,090
that Miss Shen Qilan

431
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,020
and Jingming fell in love
at first sight.

432
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,740
Their feelings are mutual.

433
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,610
Miss Shen Qilan is gentle,

434
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:42,740
graceful, and poised.

435
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,290
Qinian, why not fulfill this bond

436
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,770
and grant them marriage?

437
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,980
It would be a lovely tale.

438
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:01,220
Congratulations, Jiangli.

439
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,740
If you two are together,

440
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,020
you can look out for each other.

441
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,370
I truly envy

442
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,570
those with sisters.

443
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,260
Unfortunately,

444
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,090
I'm an only daughter,

445
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,090
not so lucky.

446
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,660
Miss Shen Qilan has the face

447
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,610
of a good child-bearer.

448
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,700
In the future,

449
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,570
Jiangli can help Jingming
with external affairs,

450
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,050
and your sister

451
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,180
can handle the heirs.

452
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,580
Father,

453
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,740
this is impossible.

454
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,700
I've never even spoken a word

455
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,370
to Miss Shen Qilan.

456
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,910
How could we have fallen for each other?

457
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,940
Jingming's birth mother
is sitting right here,

458
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,570
yet gossip from outsiders

459
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,850
is already arranging his marriage?

460
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,020
Xiulan,

461
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,980
Danling makes a good point.

462
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,900
Since Jiangli is so capable

463
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,570
and can help Jingming with his work,

464
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,530
she naturally won't have time

465
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:00,500
to bear him children.

466
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,290
But Master Jingming

467
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,610
has a duty to carry on the family line.

468
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,220
What's wrong with taking a concubine?

469
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,850
Jingming,

470
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,500
are you worried Jiangli will be upset?

471
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:16,420
I believe she's sensible.

472
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,290
It'd be great to have
both pretty sisters.

473
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,450
Lady Wang,

474
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,020
Jiangli

475
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,290
is certainly sensible.

476
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,780
But

477
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,530
our relationship

478
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,810
is not for others to judge.

479
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,050
Jingming, Jiangli,

480
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,020
as your sister-in-law,

481
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,180
allow me to say this:

482
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:38,970
Marriage has always been

483
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,370
a matter of parental arrangement

484
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,530
and matchmaker's words.

485
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:42,870
Everything should be done

486
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:45,810
for the greater good.

487
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,910
Consort Danling,
I must respectfully disagree

488
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:54,850
with your child-bearing logic.

489
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,660
A child

490
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,570
is a gift from the heavens.

491
00:20:59,050 --> 00:20:59,940
Consort Danling,

492
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:02,020
you surely know that best.

493
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,220
Jiangli, you and Jingming

494
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,610
do share deep affection,

495
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,060
but should we let

496
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,460
Miss Shen Qilan's feelings

497
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,420
go to waste?

498
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,090
However, what I've heard

499
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,290
is quite different

500
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,290
from what Lady Wang
and Danling are saying.

501
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,460
Since Lady Wang

502
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,980
brought this up today,

503
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,700
and Danling

504
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,050
wants to fulfill

505
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:31,130
my sister's wish,

506
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,610
then I'll be bold

507
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,420
and ask for a good match for my sister.

508
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:36,530
My Lord,

509
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:37,420
in fact,

510
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,810
the one my sister likes

511
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,370
is not Master Jingming.

512
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,920
Then who is it?

513
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,810
It's Master Jingxiu.

514
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,980
Stop your nonsense!

515
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,050
Consort Danling, calm down.

516
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,490
Don't jump to a conclusion yet.

517
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,850
Just hear me out.

518
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,180
Qilan was troubled

519
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,570
when she heard those rumors

520
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:03,810
about her and Jingming.

521
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,340
First, she feared

522
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,700
it would harm our sisterly bond.

523
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,740
Second,

524
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,740
her heart indeed belongs to another.

525
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,690
That's why she came

526
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,850
to clarify things with me.

527
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,640
It's just a random jade pendant,

528
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,940
not necessarily Master Jingxiu's.

529
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:24,570
What a joke.

530
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,000
Danling,

531
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,340
didn't you just say

532
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,430
everything should be done
for the greater good?

533
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:30,850
No need to panic.

534
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,660
Let Jiangli finish first.

535
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,450
My Lord,

536
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,700
my sister is beautiful and kind,

537
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,330
and she's deeply in love
with Master Jingxiu.

538
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,770
If she were to marry Master Jingxiu,

539
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,130
she'd be a great help to Danling

540
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,810
and would bear children
for Master Jingxiu.

541
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:52,700
Father, please

542
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:53,890
grant a marriage

543
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,530
for Qilan and Master Jingxiu.

544
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:57,930
Jingxiu,

545
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,180
is this true?

546
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,100
Father,

547
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:03,370
I...

548
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,500
Master Jingxiu,

549
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,330
Qilan has loved only you

550
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,020
since she came of age.

551
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,370
You know best

552
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:12,090
whether my words are true.

553
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,900
As the Prefect's eldest son,

554
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,940
surely you're a man of honor.

555
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:18,410
Shen Jiangli,

556
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,420
how did you become

557
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,570
so aggressive?

558
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:24,220
Consort Danling,

559
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,570
didn't you just say you had no sisters

560
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,330
and envied those who did?

561
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,660
Well, now you do.

562
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,020
If my sister

563
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,810
marries Master Jingxiu,

564
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,770
she could ease your burdens quite a bit.

565
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:36,930
Shen Jiangli,

566
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:38,530
you have no say in this.

567
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,300
Danling,

568
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:43,130
Jiangli is Shen Qilan's elder sister.

569
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,050
Why does she have no say in this?

570
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,460
Jingxiu, do you dare deny

571
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,220
you gave that pendant to my sister

572
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,290
as a token of love?

573
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,530
Dongmei, bring the pendant here.

574
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,860
Jinyi,

575
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,260
this does look like

576
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:07,980
something that belongs to Jingxiu.

577
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:08,940
Jingxiu,

578
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,610
what is going on?

579
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,980
Our family acts with integrity

580
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,460
and honor.

581
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,900
Tell me the truth.

582
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,900
If you don't,

583
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,530
you'll be confined again for reflection.

584
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,050
Shall I bring my sister in?

585
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,300
Father,

586
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,980
I did give the pendant

587
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,260
to Miss Shen Qilan.

588
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,180
Jingxiu...

589
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,420
Jingxiu truly is a man of honor.

590
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,130
My Lord, you must bless this union.

591
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:47,700
In that case,

592
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,280
we shall choose an auspicious date

593
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:50,980
for you

594
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,420
to marry Miss Shen Qilan.

595
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,090
Qinian, this can't be.

596
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,230
Miss Shen Qilan is
a concubine's daughter.

597
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,330
How can she be worthy
of marrying Jingxiu?

598
00:24:58,770 --> 00:24:59,660
Yes, Father.

599
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:02,090
Jinyi, that's not what you said earlier.

600
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,900
Since Miss Shen Qilan

601
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,740
can marry Jingming,

602
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,660
why can't she

603
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,180
marry Jingxiu?

604
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,290
Qinian...

605
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:11,780
- Father...
- Enough.

606
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:14,130
Where are your manners?

607
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,900
I've made my decision.

608
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,020
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

609
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,780
Danling.

610
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:33,610
Danling.

611
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,500
I couldn't bear kids for you.

612
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:37,810
I can't blame anyone else.

613
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:41,280
With so few people in the household,

614
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,900
it would be livelier with more.

615
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,530
And if she can give you a son
or daughter,

616
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,130
that would be even better.

617
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:49,370
But Young Master,

618
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,180
Shen Qilan is just
a concubine's daughter,

619
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,420
and she's also Shen Jiangli's sister.

620
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,370
What if they team up...

621
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:57,210
Danling,

622
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,020
think about it.

623
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,190
It's because she's
a concubine's daughter

624
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,980
that she's easier to control.

625
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,290
If she has a child,

626
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,770
I can let you have them.

627
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:10,900
Even so,

628
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,970
I wouldn't want a child
of a concubine's daughter.

629
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,180
Even if I agreed,

630
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,660
my father wouldn't approve.

631
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,500
Fine.

632
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,850
Let's not talk about it for now.

633
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:28,900
But

634
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,260
even if General Wang doesn't agree,

635
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,220
the Prefect has consented.

636
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,330
I am a lineal daughter
of the Wang family;

637
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,660
my father is Dongzhou's general.

638
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,850
What is Shen Qilan?

639
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,810
What is the Shen family?

640
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:05,530
What is Shen Jiangli?

641
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:12,090
Only I,

642
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,700
Wang Danling,

643
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:19,370
will become the most respected woman
in Dongzhou.

644
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:28,980
I haven't come to you yet,

645
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,020
but you've come to me first.

646
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,120
Greetings, Consort Danling.

647
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,610
Please have some tea.

648
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,780
Stop it.

649
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:48,740
Enough with the flattery.

650
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:52,120
Do you think you can soar to greatness

651
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:54,770
just because you can marry Jingxiu?

652
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:58,610
I wouldn't dare.

653
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,940
I invited you here today

654
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:02,700
to express my feelings.

655
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:05,180
I love Master Jingxiu for who he is,

656
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,130
not for his status or wealth,

657
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,610
and I won't be your enemy.

658
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,900
I will always respect you and love you.

659
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,420
I will never be a threat to you.

660
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,570
You just used these methods

661
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,660
to keep Jingxiu interested, right?

662
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,320
Do you think I'll pay you any attention?

663
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,850
You were born a concubine's daughter,

664
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:37,530
and now you're just a concubine.

665
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,150
You're quite pitiful
when I think about it.

666
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:48,570
That day at Moon Jewelry,

667
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,090
you gave me a hairpin.

668
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:55,260
Tomorrow, on your wedding day,

669
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,770
I also have a big gift for you.

670
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,090
Goodbye, Consort Danling.

671
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:14,890
My Lady,

672
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,060
are you alright?

673
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:28,180
(Virtue and Grace)

674
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:30,930
Mr. Chu.

675
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:33,860
Miss,

676
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:37,050
your wound should be fine now, right?

677
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,610
Thanks to your ointment,

678
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:41,700
it's healed.

679
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,020
You're too polite.

680
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,290
I apologize for the previous neglect.

681
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:47,500
May I ask how to address you?

682
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,260
My surname is Lu.

683
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:50,700
You can call me Qingqing.

684
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,570
Lu Qingqing?

685
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,530
Lu Jingming is my second brother.

686
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,370
(Shen Mansion)
Hurry up!

687
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:00,530
Move faster!

688
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,660
- Yes.
- Yes.

689
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,460
Hurry up.

690
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,260
Be careful.

691
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:11,220
Don't break anything there.

692
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,210
- Yes.
- Yes.

693
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,020
Why is she here?

694
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,220
How unlucky.

695
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:25,900
But

696
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,810
Qilan is marrying the lineal eldest son,

697
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:30,020
so her status isn't much lower.

698
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,940
There's no need to continue

699
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,000
elevating her like before.

700
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,020
Jiangli, you're back.

701
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:40,130
How dare you!

702
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,220
How could you address
Consort Jiangli by name

703
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,130
without proper respect?

704
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,740
Is this the way the Shen family behaves?

705
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:48,850
Greetings, Consort Jiangli.

706
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,300
Rise.

707
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,600
My sister is getting married.

708
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,700
As her elder sister,

709
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,100
I should help with the preparations.

710
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,740
Ms. Zou, are you saying

711
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,460
I shouldn't be here now?

712
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,050
I wouldn't dare.

713
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:03,700
Consort Jiangli, please come in.

714
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,260
(Tian Xiaozhen, Shen's concubine)

715
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:10,610
Consort Jiangli is back.

716
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,180
Did you come by yourself?

717
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,800
Where is Master Jingming?

718
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,460
Let me tell you.

719
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,770
Once you're married,
you can't be so willful.

720
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,530
You must listen to your husband.

721
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,370
Be careful with jade items.
Don't break them.

722
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:24,740
- Yes.
- Father.

723
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,700
I'll go see Qilan.

724
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,300
Let me check.

725
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:36,900
Hold them steady.

726
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:38,980
Don't knock or break them.

727
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:40,770
What fine jade.

728
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,180
Jiaoyue, you're truly blessed.

729
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,090
I watched Qilan grow up.

730
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,600
Now that she's found a good match,

731
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,460
I'm genuinely happy for her.

732
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,610
Thank you for your kindness.

733
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:52,980
Though you only gave Qilan

734
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,940
a few glass beads,

735
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,180
I know

736
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,340
it's because you're short on money.

737
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,700
Still,

738
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,050
thank you for your thoughtful gift

739
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:01,460
on behalf of Qilan.

740
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:05,570
I'm starving to death
after all that work.

741
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,800
Master, Qilan's about to get married.

742
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,940
You can't say that word.

743
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,220
I'll remember that.

744
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,100
Father.

745
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:16,980
Father,

746
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,260
I heard from the nanny in charge

747
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,730
that before a daughter marries,

748
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,050
if her father pins up her hair,

749
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:23,260
her future will be filled
with happiness.

750
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,290
Father, would you do it for me?

751
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,660
- Master.
- I don't know how to do that.

752
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:29,650
Let's drink.

753
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,330
Coming, coming.

754
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,460
- Father.
- Coming.

755
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:34,520
Let's drink.

756
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:42,370
Jiangli,

757
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,420
why aren't you eating?

758
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,450
Jiangli,

759
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,330
try the Mati pastry.

760
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:48,890
It was

761
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,290
my mother's favorite.

762
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,940
Ms. Tian, do you still remember?

763
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:55,410
Of course.

764
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,220
I served your mother
since she was little.

765
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,560
Of course, I remember everything.

766
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,050
Try some, Jiangli.

767
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:05,180
I must ask this concubine

768
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,090
to mind her words.

769
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,500
Greetings, Master Jingming.

770
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,720
Greetings, Master Jingming.

771
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,170
We're all family.

772
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,600
No need to be so formal.

773
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:20,740
But just now,

774
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,290
this concubine called my wife

775
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,810
by her given name.

776
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:25,270
That was inappropriate.

777
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,770
Sorry for being rude.

778
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,060
Everyone, please sit.

779
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,340
Come on.

780
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,610
Servants,

781
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,290
bring a set of dishes
for Master Jingming.

782
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,420
Why are you here?

783
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,090
I finished my work,

784
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:44,610
so I came to be with you.

785
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,260
You sit here.

786
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:51,810
I'll take that side.

787
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:02,210
Seems like

788
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,900
the Shen family's situation

789
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,390
is not much better than ours.

790
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,210
It's the same.

791
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,860
Mr. Shen,

792
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:13,570
since my wife

793
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:14,410
will be staying

794
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:15,980
to prepare for the wedding,

795
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:17,530
I'll stay here

796
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,610
with her as well.

797
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,630
You're going to stay here?

798
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:24,980
Wherever my wife stays,

799
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,980
that's where I'll stay.

800
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:31,420
Today, Master Jingming's visit
has honored us.

801
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,960
Sorry for the negligence.

802
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:35,500
Come on, let's drink to Master Jingming.

803
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,340
Jiangli,

804
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,780
eat more.

805
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:54,360
I had the kitchen make

806
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:55,690
all your favorites today.

807
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,700
Father,

808
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,860
there are no outsiders at home.

809
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,650
Now,

810
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,730
just treat me

811
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:05,940
as usual.

812
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:09,730
What do you mean?

813
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,780
Father, Mother,

814
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,420
I'd like to propose a toast.

815
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,770
I've troubled Master Jingming

816
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,020
and Consort Jiangli

817
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,500
for my marriage.

818
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,780
Let me drink to everyone here.

819
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,300
Consort Jiangli,

820
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,780
how long do you plan to stay this time?

821
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,660
Why, Ms. Zhou,

822
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,170
am I not welcome?

823
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,250
Can't I return to my own home?

824
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,570
I didn't mean that.

825
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:49,490
Jiangli,

826
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,050
this is your home.

827
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,330
Of course, you can stay
as long as you like.

828
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,090
Jiangli,

829
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,690
thank you

830
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,340
for everything you've done for me.

831
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,340
Mr. Shen,

832
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,140
my wife has asked me

833
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,780
to prepare a lot of dowry items.

834
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:13,530
They'll be delivered here tomorrow.

835
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:15,410
Really?

836
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,170
You two

837
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,460
are very thoughtful.

838
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,050
How generous of you.

839
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,900
Thank you, Master Jingming,
Consort Jiangli.

840
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,170
Qilan's elder sister
really cares for her.

841
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,980
Not like Ms. Tian.

842
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:32,860
Mother.

843
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,170
When Consort Jiangli got married,

844
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,690
I did the same.

845
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:41,170
Jiaoyue, do you think the dowry
I gave Qilan was so little

846
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,210
that I should be ashamed

847
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,610
or that Qilan's dowry

848
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,420
should be more

849
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:47,210
than Consort Jiangli's?

850
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,050
I'm full now.

851
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:52,940
I'll go rest.

852
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,300
I'm full too.

853
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,140
I'll go with you.

854
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,730
Master Jingming, please rest.

855
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,300
The Shen Mansion really is a mess.

856
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,140
Did you come back

857
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,300
this time to investigate

858
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,380
your mother's death?

859
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,130
You don't need to get involved.

860
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,740
I'll listen to you.

861
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,730
But I need to ensure your safety.

862
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:30,650
What danger could there be here?

863
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,020
They're just a bunch of women.

864
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,500
Still, better to be cautious.

865
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,340
You've had a long day.

866
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,170
Get some rest.

867
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,730
What about you?

868
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:53,730
How about I make do

869
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,820
over there?

870
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,780
But...

871
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:01,650
Back in battle,

872
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,020
the conditions were far worse than this.

873
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,310
Are you thinking about Yanyan?

874
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,740
Yes.

875
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,260

Why now, all of a sudden?

881
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:22,610
It's not sudden.

882
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,730

883
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:29,020
