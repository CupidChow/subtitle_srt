Qilan.

23
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,220
Master Jingxiu.

24
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,380
I heard

25
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,100
you just came back from seeing Mother.

26
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,380
Did she

27
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,100
make things hard for you?

28
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,460
No.

29
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,980
She only asked me

30
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:00,900
to visit Princess Chuya more often.

31
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,980
That's good.

32
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,380
You should

33
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,180
visit her more often.

34
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,100
These days,

35
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,300
Shen Jiangli and the princess

36
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,580
have grown quite close.

37
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,140
Jingming's relationship with her

38
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,500
has improved because of it.

39
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,820
I've been feeling much better lately.

40
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,220
I was just thinking of visiting her.

41
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,540
Qilan,

42
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,400
she's not just a princess.

43
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,900
Behind her stands Xizhou,

44
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,260
the most powerful military force
among the four states.

45
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,980
We can't let such a valuable ally

46
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,180
fall into Jingming's hands.

47
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,460
I was too short-sighted before.

48
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,820
Thanks to Mother's reminder,

49
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,020
I finally see what's at stake.

50
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,060
Qilan,

51
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,140
don't worry.

52
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,100
You're the one I care about the most.

53
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,460
But if Jingming and his wife

54
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,420
get closer to her,

55
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,340
then my status in Dongzhou

56
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,540
might be in danger.

57
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,020
All my years of hard work

58
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,340
would be for nothing.

59
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,820
We need to create
some obstacles for them.

60
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,380
Qilan,

61
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,740
I hope you understand.

62
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,980
I do.

63
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,300
As long as it helps you,

64
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,420
I'll do anything.

65
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,740
Qilan...

(Xizhou, Nanzhou, Beizhou, Dongzhou,

67
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,220
Once we secure Xizhou,

68
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,060
Nanzhou and Beizhou

69
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,420
will be nothing to worry about.

70
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,380
Jinchuan,

71
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,420
keep a close watch over there.

72
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,940
Yes.

(Liuyun Post House)

74
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,420
Consort Qilan is here.

75
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,100
Greetings, Your Grace.

76
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,580
No need for such formality. Please sit.

77
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,720
Thank you, Your Grace.

78
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,060
I should've visited earlier,

79
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,620
but I've been

80
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,980
unwell these days.

81
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,340
Sorry for the delay.

82
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,140
You're too kind.

83
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,620
Consort Jiangli has been

84
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,420
keeping me company lately

85
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,580
so I haven't felt too lonely.

86
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,420
Have you two

87
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,660
had a good time together?

88
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,420
Consort Jiangli is thoughtful
and attentive.

89
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,500
She always treats me well.

90
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,260
I could certainly learn more from her

91
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,700
and be more proper.

92
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,860
But I'm not as clever as she is

93
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,260
so I could only make a few dishes

94
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,100
for you to try.

95
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,460
They're made

96
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,780
with our unique methods.

97
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,830
They look wonderful.

98
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,580
You're quite the cook.

99
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,980
I hope they suit your taste.

100
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,260
Your Grace,

101
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,180
look at the fish.

102
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,900
My mother taught me about it.

103
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,660
I'm sure you won't find
this flavor anywhere else.

104
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,620
It really is one of a kind.

105
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,460
I'm glad you like it.

106
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,700
If it's not too presumptuous,

107
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,990
I'd like to invite you

108
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,620
back to my mansion sometime.

109
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,920
I've planted many varieties of peonies

110
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,160
in the garden.

111
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,430
I'd love to enjoy them with you.

112
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,660
Then I shall gladly visit you.

113
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,740
Muxiang, take these ingredients
to the kitchen,

114
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,000
especially the licorice.

115
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,550
It takes time to make dessert with it.

116
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,460
Send it over early.

117
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,300
Yes.

118
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,340
Consort Jiangli,

119
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,700
you're quite attentive.

120
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,260
(Liuyun Post House)

121
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,860
Consort Qilan, you're no less eager.

122
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,940
Have you fully recovered now?

123
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,220
Do you need me to check?

124
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,840
Physical wounds are easy to heal.

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,560
It's the heart that's hardest to mend.

126
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,320
Since my mother passed away,

127
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,980
I've been dreaming of her.

128
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,620
She often reminds me,

129
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,700
telling me not to forget

130
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,380
who killed her.

131
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,900
Then you should

132
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,440
ask your mother in your dreams.

133
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,940
This time,

134
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,500
you won't stop Master Jingxiu.

135
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,060
Your Grace, Consort Jiangli

136
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,540
prepared these licorice cakes for you.

137
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,620
Please try them.

138
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,900
They're quite good.

139
00:06:59,060 --> 00:06:59,900
Consort Jiangli,

140
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,780
thank you

141
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,860
for everything these days.

142
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,460
You've shown me

143
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,860
so many things unique to Dongzhou.

144
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,540
It's the least I could do.

145
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,500
But there's something

146
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,500
I feel I must be honest about.

147
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,930
Please, go ahead.

148
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,300
Then I'll speak plainly.

149
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,660
Actually,

150
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,860
my heart already belongs to someone.

151
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,540
To tell you the truth,

152
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,100
it's Master Jingming.

153
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,220
Ever since he saved me,

154
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,180
he's been on my mind.

155
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,460
I met him again this time.

156
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,860
I believe it's fate.

157
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,220
Your Grace,

158
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,180
I understand

159
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,380
you like Jingming,

160
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,740
but we've been

161
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,020
married for years.

162
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,380
We have a child

163
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,300
and deep feelings for each other.

164
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,020
I'm afraid

165
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,620
he can't return your affection.

166
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,660
Consort Jiangli,

167
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:55,900
don't reject me so soon.

168
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,060
I'm not someone who can't share.

169
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,860
Since I'm telling you this,

170
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,940
I've already decided

171
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,220
we can coexist peacefully.

172
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,500
But Master Jingming isn't an object.

173
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,740
It's not something we can decide

174
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,100
just between us.

175
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,020
I have my own plans.

176
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,380
Then I won't disturb you further.

177
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,500
I'll take my leave.

178
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:19,900
Goodbye.

179
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,740
(The woman Master Jingming likes)

180
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,100
(does have a temper.)

181
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,140
Help...

182
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,180
How is Princess Chuya?

183
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,140
My Lady,

184
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,620
the princess

185
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,940
seems to be poisoned.

186
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,300
How could she be suddenly poisoned?

187
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,560
Can the poison be cured?

188
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,500
I need to know what the poison is first.

189
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,500
Shen Jiangli, hurry up and tell us

190
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,500
what you put in the food.

191
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,220
It wasn't me.

192
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,060
Poisoning her while dining together

193
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,940
would be too crude and obvious.

194
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,180
You're free to inspect the menu.

195
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,220
Physician, check the dishes

196
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,740
from dinner one by one

197
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,340
to see if it's been poisoned.

198
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,740
Yes.

199
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,740
My Ladies,

200
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,310
I've examined the dinner dishes.

201
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,340
No poison was found.

202
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,860
What did the princess eat today?

203
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,660
Bring me the menu.

204
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,780
She had lunch with Consort Qilan

205
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,380
and ate dishes from Dongzhou.

206
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,820
I don't know the specifics.

207
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,220
Jinyi,

208
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,980
Qilan was there at noon.

209
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,460
She should be

210
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,780
questioned too.

211
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:14,920
What if

212
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,860
it was the lunch that caused this?

213
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,460
Dingxiang,

214
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,380
go ask Consort Qilan to come.

215
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,660
Yes.

216
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,300
Greetings, Mother.

217
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,220
Greetings, Lady Shu.

218
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,300
Did you visit the princess at noon?

219
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:35,900
Yes, Mother.

220
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,340
I hadn't visited her

221
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,700
due to my poor health.

222
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,220
I found it quite rude,

223
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,780
so I joined her

224
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,500
for lunch today.

225
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,900
Tell us.

226
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,620
What questionable things

227
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,660
did you give the princess?

228
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,180
Lady Shu, I'm innocent.

229
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,500
I ate the same food

230
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,380
as the princess.

231
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,220
If I'd tampered with it,

232
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,100
how could I dare eat it too?

233
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,420
Besides, she was perfectly fine

234
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,260
when I left after our lunch.

235
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,940
She didn't fall ill until the evening.

236
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,420
This truly can't be blamed on me.

237
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,460
What did you bring at noon?

238
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,380
Just some home-cooked dishes.

239
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:09,900
Which ones?

240
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,860
List them clearly.

241
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,300
A plate of vegetables,

242
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,460
a meat dish,

243
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,500
and a fish.

244
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,780
Fish?

245
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,100
What kind of fish?

246
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,300
The servants cooked it.

247
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,620
I don't remember.

248
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,740
I believe it was carp.

249
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,420
Carp?

250
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,820
I see now.

251
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,740
The lunch and dinner themselves
were fine.

252
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,780
But the dessert served at dinner
was licorice cakes.

253
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,740
Carp should not be eaten
with licorice cakes.

254
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,300
Together,

255
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,080
they can cause vomiting and poisoning.

256
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,740
Can it be cured?

257
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,260
Yulan,

258
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,500
go prepare an antidote

259
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,820
and give it to the princess.

260
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,660
Yes, Jiangli.

261
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,980
She'll be fine then?

262
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,460
Yes.

263
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,540
She just needs proper rest tonight,

264
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,760
and she'll be fine by tomorrow.

265
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,540
Jiangli, stay and look after her.

266
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,300
Yes.

267
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,580
Your Grace,

268
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,660
you should rest.

269
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,780
We'll take our leave.

270
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,180
Jiangli,

271
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,940
how is the princess now?

272
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,660
She's much better.

273
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,660
Consort Jiangli,

274
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,220
I consider myself to be upright,

275
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,400
and I've treated you
with great courtesy.

276
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,140
Consort Jiangli,

277
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,780
why do you resent me so much?

278
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,500
Is it because of what I said

279
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,460
before dinner?

280
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,260
Your Grace,

281
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,340
what are you implying?

282
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,420
At dinner,

283
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,900
you specifically mentioned

284
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,900
the licorice cakes.

285
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,460
Was that not intentional?

286
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:24,900
Your Grace,

287
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,580
how could I have known
you had carp at noon?

288
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,660
I only prepared the fruit

289
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,740
because I heard the servants
at the post house say

290
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,020
you enjoyed cakes from Dongzhou.

291
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,260
When have I ever liked cakes?

292
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,740
I've never had a sweet tooth.

293
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,700
Your Grace,

294
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,460
I may not know

295
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,980
all that happened before,

296
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,020
but I know my wife better than anyone.

297
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,700
She's always kind.

298
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,100
Besides, she's a physician.

299
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,940
She will never harm anyone.

300
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,340
There must be a misunderstanding.

301
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,220
Give me some time.

302
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,660
I will find the truth

303
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,320
and give you a proper explanation.

304
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:58,900
Fine.

305
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,060
(Rain Chamber)
Muxiang,

306
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,780
which servant at the post house told you

307
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,500
the princess likes cakes?

308
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,220
I don't remember.

309
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,680
You don't remember?

310
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,180
But you remembered
to tell Consort Jiangli?

311
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,060
Was it your idea

312
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,620
to make licorice cakes?

313
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,980
Yes.

314
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,940
I meant well.

315
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,660
I thought the princess

316
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,020
hadn't tasted it before,

317
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,420
so I made the suggestion.

318
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,220
You also helped Consort Jiangli

319
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,420
and Yulan organize

320
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,400
the lantern event, right?

321
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,780
Yes.

322
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,460
Yulan,

323
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,820
take some people

324
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,860
and thoroughly search her room.

325
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:40,910
Yes, Master Jingming.

326
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,740
Muxiang,

327
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,600
if you confess now,

328
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,260
perhaps we will forgive you.

329
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,100
I didn't...

330
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,220
If we find something in your room,

331
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,300
do you realize

332
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,660
even the one behind you
won't be able to save you?

333
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,020
No, I didn't.

334
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,740
My Lady, I'm innocent.

335
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,300
Master Jingming, Jiangli,

336
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,420
I found some scattered white phosphorus

337
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,740
under Muxiang's cabinet.

338
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,740
Young Master, My Lady,

339
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,940
I don't know anything about it.

340
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,180
Muxiang,

341
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,580
you're a maid in the inner chambers.

342
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,060
Why do you have white phosphorus?

343
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,420
Do you understand

344
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,340
you've attempted to harm
the princess of Xizhou?

345
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,500
You won't clear your name so easily.

346
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,880
It could easily implicate
your entire family.

347
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,580
If you tell the truth now,

348
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,060
perhaps I can spare your life
and your family's.

349
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,820
Young Master, My Lady,

350
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,660
I'll tell the truth.

351
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,100
It was...

352
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,620
It was Consort Qilan who made me do it.

353
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,340
I had no choice.

354
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,500
My brother gambled outside

355
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,100
and lost a lot of money.

356
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,580
They said if he didn't pay it back,

357
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,260
they'd cut off both his hands.

358
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,300
Later,

359
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,700
Consort Qilan came to me,

360
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,820
paid off the debt,
and found a place for my brother.

361
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,300
She said I only needed to put

362
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,140
a little white phosphorus

363
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,280
in the princess's lantern,

364
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,540
and it wouldn't hurt her.

365
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,420
She said it was a magic trick, so I...

366
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,380
What about today?

367
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,620
Later,

368
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,020
after the princess got hurt,

369
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,820
Consort Qilan came to me again.

370
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,060
She said if anyone found out it was me,

371
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,300
I'd be sentenced to death.

372
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,060
But she'd keep it a secret.

373
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,540
Yesterday, she told me to suggest

374
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,020
making licorice cakes
for the princess at dinner.

375
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,500
If the princess

376
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,900
liked the cakes today...

377
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,860
If the princess was happy,

378
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,620
I could make up for my mistake.

379
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,500
I know nothing about the rest.

380
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,580
Yulan.

381
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,220
Take her away.
Keep her under strict watch.

382
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,260
Yes, Master Jingming.

383
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,580
Move.

384
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,710
- Young Master.
- Hurry.

385
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,060
How bold.

386
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,340
This is serious.

387
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,500
We must give the princess
an explanation.

388
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,420
Tomorrow,

389
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,540
I'll report this

390
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,700
to Father.

391
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,220
Father,

392
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,980
this is everything that happened.

393
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,620
We invited the princess today

394
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,060
to give her an explanation.

395
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,060
As for the punishment,

396
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,700
we await your judgment.

397
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,220
My Lord,

398
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,660
I hope you can punish
the murderer severely.

399
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,180
Your Grace, don't worry.

400
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,780
I will not show favoritism.

401
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,460
Jingming,

402
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,300
do we have solid evidence?

403
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,540
Yes.

404
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,800
Imprison Shen Qilan.

405
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,660
Yes.

406
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,380
Leave.

407
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,060
Master Jingxiu.

408
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,500
- Qilan.
- Master Jingxiu.

409
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,260
Master Jingxiu.

410
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,740
Master Jingxiu,

411
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,220
what took you so long?

412
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,340
I'm fine.

413
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,300
Look.

414
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,700
Let's head home.

415
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,740
Master Jingxiu...

416
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,780
Father said

417
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,500
you weren't punished
for what you did to Yanyan.

418
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,340
Now, for your own selfish desires,

419
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,740
you've harmed the princess of Xizhou

420
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,260
and left behind evidence.

421
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,100
This concerns the peace
between our two states.

422
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,100
No one can help you now.

423
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,060
Qilan,

424
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,420
I can't help you either.

425
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:31,940
Master Jingxiu,

426
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,060
I only wanted to help.

427
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,500
You're not the only one affected.

428
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,300
You've implicated me too.

429
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,500
I've worked so hard

430
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,140
for everything I have.

431
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,860
Now, Father is starting
to doubt me again.

432
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:50,900
Master Jingxiu...

433
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:51,980
Qilan,

434
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,460
how could you do this?

435
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,660
You've been with me for so long.

436
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,420
I thought you've learned to be careful.

437
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,220
How could you be so reckless?

438
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,380
- Master Jingxiu.
- Do you want me

439
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,460
to fall with you?

440
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:06,980
Master Jingxiu.

441
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,560
I don't want that, Master Jingxiu.

442
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,940
I just wanted to help you.

443
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,620
It's all my fault.

444
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,780
Help me?

445
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,780
Master Jingxiu...

446
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,700
I only did this for you.

447
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,860
If this time...

448
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,740
If we could frame
Shen Jiangli this time,

449
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,260
Master Jingming...

450
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,380
He'll definitely lose his composure.

451
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,540
He'll have no time to deal
with anything else.

452
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,140
I only did this

453
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,420
for you.

454
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,420
Sorry for failing to help you.

455
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,900
I could only come up with this plan

456
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,340
to assist you.

457
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,100
Master Jingxiu...

458
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,300
Master Jingxiu...

459
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,700
Master Jingxiu...

460
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:02,860
Qilan,

461
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,860
I know your intentions,

462
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,820
but everything has settled.

463
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,460
It's settled?

464
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,020
It's settled.

465
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,420
Well...

466
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,220
I've seen you

467
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,980
before I die.

468
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,780
I'll die without regrets.

469
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,220
Qilan,

470
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,620
if you can get out,

471
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,380
do you know what to do?

472
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,500
What do you mean?

473
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,380
Rain Chamber.

474
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:06,940
Young Master,

475
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,540
how about I tell the jailers

476
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,940
to look after Consort Qilan?

477
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,260
No need.

478
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,580
Qilan,

479
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,700
if you can get out,

480
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,620
do you know what to do?

481
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,460
Rain Chamber.

482
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,060
One slight mistake

483
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,740
might make you fall into hell

484
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,660
like Wang Danling.

485
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,260
You were born a concubine's daughter,

486
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,900
and now you're just a concubine.

487
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,700
- Take it off!
- Consort Danling.

488
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,540
- Danling.
- Let go!

489
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,060
Let go of me!

490
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,000
Master Jingxiu's Mansion

491
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,540
is different

492
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,900
from your family's

493
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,380
small household.

494
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,620
Shen Qilan is a concubine's daughter.

495
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,220
She's even worse than Shen Jiangli.

496
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,260
You've been with me for so long.

I thought you've learned to be careful.

How could you be so reckless?

499
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,300
Because you'll trap yourself

500
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,260

fighting for myself,

Why?

518
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,460
I just wanted to live a simple life

with one person by my side.

00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,740

I've brought Shen Jiangli to you.

Mother, do you hear me?

527
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,740
Someone! Put out the fire!

Shen Jiangli.

Aren't you supposed to be in prison?

Shen Qilan, have you gone mad?

and Fuling wouldn't have died.

538
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,420
It's all because of you.

539
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,730
Why are you still alive?

540
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,620
Don't you see you're responsible

542
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,460
I'm responsible?

543
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,340
You're right.

544
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,340
I was born a concubine's daughter.

545
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,420
I have a useless,

549
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,260
but I've been humiliated everywhere.

550
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,700
That's my fault.

551

00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,220
used me

in the end.

555
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,980
This is all my fault.

556
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,140
You're right.

557
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,780
This is all my fault.

558
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,460

559
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:21,980
but in the end,

560
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,260
it was even worse than the life

561
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,820

Father.

590
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,500
Jingming,

591
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,980
is Yanyan okay?

592
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,190
Did he get hurt?

593
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,500
Yanyan is fine.

594
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,540
Father, don't worry.

595
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:17,260
Shen Qilan should be in prison.

596
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,140
Why did she show up at Rain Chamber?

597
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,460
Father,

598
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,700
I've questioned the jailers.

599
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,900
They were all drugged.

600
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,220
How could a fragile woman

601
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,020
like her drug the jailers

602
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,380
and escape from the prison?

603
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,660
Was there no one to help her?

604
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,020
Father,

605
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,900
she is skilled in manipulating men.

606
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,420
I married her

607
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,980
because she enchanted me back then.

608
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,260
That night,

609
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,820
I did visit her in prison,

610
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,100
but I found her

611
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,060
exchanging glances with the jailers.

612
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,900
So, she must have

613
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,300
used this trick again

614
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,740
to slip away unnoticed.

615
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,300
Jingming,

616
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,620
protect Yanyan.

617
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,020
I won't forgive anyone who dares

618
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,540
to harm my grandson.

619
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,540
Yes.

620
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,660
Jingxiu,

621
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,100
your cap is crooked.

622
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,700
Qilan,

623
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,040
I've never looked down on you

624
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,980
because you were

625
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,400
a concubine's daughter.

626
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,100
I've always regarded you as my sister.

627
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,340
As your elder sister,

628
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,860
I failed to guide you in time.

629
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,440
None of this is your fault.

630
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,380
Qilan, do you know?

631
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,100
(Tomb of Shen Qilan)

632
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,180
In your heart,

633
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,820
you valued your background too much.

634
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,220
You thought that others would look down

635
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,100
on your background.

636
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,820
I hope in the next life,

637
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,420
we can live in a world

638
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,090
without distinctions of background

639
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,940
or struggles of the inner chambers.

640
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,540
Jiangli,

641
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,860
what are you doing?

642
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,460
You've even made a tomb

643
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,500
for this ungrateful girl.

644
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,060
Shen Zhengshan,

645
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,020
she's your daughter.

646
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,860
You should say goodbye to her.

647
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,220
No, no, no.

648
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,060
My family has no such criminal.

649
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,800
She poisoned the princess

650
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,340
and tried to burn a consort.

651
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,780
I never imagined

652
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,160
she could be so vicious.

653
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,580
Lord Shen,

654
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,340
the deceased has gone.

655
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,660
You should be

656
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,420
more careful with your words.

657
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,420
Yes, Master Jingming.

658
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,380
Jiangli is so kind.

659
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,420
She even made her a tomb

660
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,560
to pay respects to her.

661
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,500
Shen Zhengshan,

662
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,100
as her father, it's what you should do.

663
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,340
Have you ever thought about why

664
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,420
my mother,

665
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,460
Zou,

666
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,100
and Qilan ended up like this??

667
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,380
How would I know?

668
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,940
Our family has had no luck.

669
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,700
I was fulfilling my official duties,

670
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,020
drinking and singing happily,

671
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,500
and then everything suddenly changed.

672
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,300
They left me one by one,

673
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:31,780
leaving me to bury my own family.

674
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,340
Let me tell you.

675
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,020
It's because of you.

676
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,220
You favored your concubines
instead of your wife,

677
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,640
only caring for your own interests.

678
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:42,660
At home,

679
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,380
you never acted like a husband

680
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,500
or father.

681
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,340
You're selfish.

682
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,660
Whenever something happens,
you stir up trouble.

683
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:53,220
You've ruined our family's morals.

684
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,860
That's why they ended up like this.

685
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,020
Yes, yes,

686
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,420
You're right.

687
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,500
But it's all in the past now.

688
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,660
Now, only two of us
are left in the family.

689
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,020
From now on,

690
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,300
you're my only hope.

691
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,820
Lord Shen,

692
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,540
I don't think you can count on me.

693
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,060
Take care of yourself.

694
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,420
Jiangli,

695
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,480
what do you mean by that?

696
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,340
I'm your father!

697
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:19,910
- Jiangli.
- Jiangli,

698
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:21,830
you will always have Yanyan and me.

699
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,180
You are my daughter.

700
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,500
You've all gone.

701
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,340
Why don't you

702
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,060
move back to my house?

703
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:30,550
Come back.

704
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,180
Your Grace,

705
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,020
you've been staying here for so long.

706
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,180
You must be missing the scenery
of your hometown.

707
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,700
Why don't we

708
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,180
go hunting in the wild today?

709
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:44,820
Hunting?

710
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,220
Do you also hunt

711
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,700
in Dongzhou?

712
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,820
Of course.

713
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,660
In Dongzhou, men are skilled

714
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,420
in both literature and martial arts,

715
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,620
riding and archery.

716
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,640
Of course,

717
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:56,940
we can hunt.

718
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,820
Master Jingxiu,

719
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:01,020
I didn't expect you to be good at this.

720
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,860
In that case,

721
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,420
why don't we go for a contest

722
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,340
in a few days?

723
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,620
What about today?

724
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,380
The weather is great,

725
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,580
so how about today?

726
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,060
Sure.

727
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,300
Then let's invite the other two masters.

728
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,140
We'll go together.

729
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,660
Well,

730
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,460
Jingming should be busy with work.

731
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,420
How about

732
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,020
inviting Jingxing?

733
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,540
Alright.

734
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,660
Someone, prepare the horses.

735
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,900
Young Master,
I have something to report.

736
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,100
As you instructed,

737
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,260
I've had people watch
Master Jingxiu's Mansion.

738
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,380
Just now,

739
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,520
the assassin who escaped

740
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,060
disguised himself as a vegetable vendor

741
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,500
and entered Master Jingxiu's Mansion,

742
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,900
so I rushed back to report.

743
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,100
Got it.

744
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,100
Do not act rashly.

745
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,470
Yes. I'll take my leave.

746
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:08,180
(Master Jingming's Mansion)

747
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:09,860
Are you going out?

748
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,220
Princess Chuya sent a word

749
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,980
that there was something urgent
to discuss.

750
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,420
I won't have lunch at home today.

751
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:15,860
It's so urgent?

752
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,180
Do you want me to go with you?

753
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,220
This matter

754
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,740
is still unclear.

755
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,220
I'll go by myself.
