22
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,240
You scoundrel!

23
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,190
You've disgraced me completely!

24
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,110
Tell the Prefect everything

25
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,240
you did now!

26
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,560
Tell us the truth.

27
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,670
It was her.

28
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,270
She knew my mother was seriously ill.

29
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,470
She even gave me money

30
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,600
to help her with something.

31
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,750
But I never thought

32
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,080
I'd end up doing such a thing.

33
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,080
I don't know anything.

34
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,350
He's slandering me.

35
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,950
Don't think a helper's word

36
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,720
is enough to clear this up.

37
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,880
Everything Qingniang said

38
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,470
matches Yanyan's features.

39
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,000
Besides,

40
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,910
what about the wound on his wrist?

41
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,750
These days,

42
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:23,910
I've also been thinking.

43
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,060
Kids around Yanyan's age

44
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,040
tend to look quite similar.

45
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,840
As for the scar,

46
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,470
Qingniang said

47
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,910
her child was burned

48
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,750
when he was little.

49
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,160
But Yanyan was burned

50
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,630
just a short while ago.

51
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,350
If we bring in our physician,

52
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,790
he should be able to tell

53
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,070
if the scar is new or old.

54
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,550
As for that spirit tablet,

55
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,880
it seems

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,470
someone aged it on purpose

57
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,510
and put it in Rain Chamber.

58
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,510
Qingniang, do you know this maid?

59
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,190
Yes...

60
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:01,910
No...

61
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,320
I don't remember.

62
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,350
You liar!

63
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,840
Spouting nonsense and lies!

64
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,000
Mother.

65
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,160
Qingniang didn't lie.

66
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,790
The men I sent to Pei Village

67
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,930
have returned with a report.

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,950
Qingniang did have a four-year-old son.

69
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,350
And the details they gathered

70
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,720
match everything

71
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,600
Qingniang said.

72
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,750
It's complicated,

73
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,160
so I've invited Mr. Chu of Wind Pavilion

74
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,190
to explain it to you.

75
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,400
Very well. Summon Mr. Chu.

76
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,000
Our investigation

77
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,950
confirms that Qingniang
once had a child,

78
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,910
but her Xuan

79
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,190
only exists in her mind.

80
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,340
Years ago, while traveling the world,

81
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,230
I passed your ancestral tomb

82
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,810
and saved Jiangli
who was pregnant at the time.

83
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,630
Yanyan's parentage is clear.

84
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,630
Now, someone is trying

85
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,720
to twist the truth.

86
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,470
I can't let that go.

87
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:05,790
Zimo,

88
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,510
do you mean

89
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,560
Qingniang is suffering from hysteria?

90
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,160
During our earlier conversation,

91
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,600
Qingniang said Xuan went missing

92
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,670
six months ago at a pavilion
by Ping Lake.

93
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,110
But that pavilion was torn down

94
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:20,950
over a year ago.

95
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,560
So, I believe

96
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,960
Xuan has passed away.

97
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,040
After a severe emotional blow,

98
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,200
some people will block out
painful memories.

99
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,270
That's why

100
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,570
Qingniang fabricated a story
of her son going missing

101
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,310
because she couldn't face
the truth of his death.

102
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,440
Sir.

103
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,480
Sir?

104
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,470
Did someone in your family pass away?

105
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,990
I want to ask you about someone.

106
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,470
It's Qingniang.

107
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,430
Who?

108
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,110
It's Qingniang.

109
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,160
Qingniang?

110
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,000
Sorry, goodbye.

111
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,720
Oh, you mean

112
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,790
the one whose child died?

113
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,470
Xuan, be good.

114
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,720
I will take you home.

115
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,840
Be good. Don't be scared, Xuan.

116
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,110
I will take you home.

117
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,600
Father.

118
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,760
Losing a child

119
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,980
is already unbearable.

120
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,640
But someone even

121
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,640
exploited that pain.

122
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,310
It's despicable.

123
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,900
- Father, please
- We'll go home.

124
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,720
give justice to Jiangli and Qingniang.

125
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,760
How dare you

126
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,080
harm my eldest grandson?

127
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,840
Confess now!

128
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,800
It was her! She made me do it!

129
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,650
I...

130
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,670
And the spirit tablet.

131
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,070
Did you

132
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,190
bribe the servants

133
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,920
to place it in Rain Chamber?

134
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,390
I plead guilty.

135
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,160
I did it all by myself.

136
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,840
Xuan...

137
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,190
Ma'am,

138
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,760
have you seen my Xuan?

139
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,400
This is a deserted place.

140
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,480
Whose child would be here?

141
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,910
Ma'am, please think again.

142
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,200
My Xuan had a round face.

143
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,990
He looked so blessed.

144
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:09,960
We haven't seen him.

145
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,640
Xuan...

146
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,840
Xuan...

147
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,280
She's lost her child. What a poor woman.

148
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,790
I lost my mother, and she lost her son.

149
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,120
- We're both pitiful.
- Xuan...

150
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:24,840
Let's visit her often.

151
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,040
Give her some money.

152
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,190
Ma'am.

153
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,880
Ma'am.

154
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,470
Please take this money.

155
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,600
My Lady,

156
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,800
I'm sorry.

157
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,040
I lied to you.

158
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:48,950
My Lord,

159
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,040
ever since Consort Qilan miscarried,

160
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,870
she's been drowning in tears every day.

161
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,470
But then,

162
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,430
Consort Jiangli brought her son back

163
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,580
and won all the favor.

164
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,080
I couldn't bear to see

165
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,230
Consort Qilan

166
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,280
being treated so coldly

167
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,520
so I resort to this.

168
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,870
When I returned home to visit my family,

169
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,110
I ran into Qingniang,
who was acting strangely.

170
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,670
So, I lured her to Dongzhou

171
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,040
to search for her child.

172
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,720
I also bribed the helper to change

173
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,600
Young Master Yanyan's attire.

174
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,110
Then I secretly made

175
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,400
a fake spirit tablet.

176
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,090
While Master Jingming
and Consort Jiangli were away,

177
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,180
I bribed the servants

178
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,430
to place it in Rain Chamber.

179
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,520
I don't believe you did this yourself.

180
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,070
You must be taking the blame
for your lady.

181
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,550
No, no.

182
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,520
This was all my idea.

183
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,540
I didn't...

184
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,200
Ms. Qilan had no idea about this.

185
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,440
My Lord.

186
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,720
My Lord, please believe me.

187
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,040
Take them both out of here

188
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,460
and cane them to death.

189
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,560
My Lord.

190
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:45,950
Fuling...

191
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,800
- My Lady.
- Master Jingxiu.

192
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,000
Fuling...

193
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,190
Fuling...

194
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,450
Is this how you discipline your maid?

195
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,520
I'm sorry.

196
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,160
Father, Mother,

197
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,430
since Qilan married me,

198
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,010
she's always been careful and cautious.

199
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,390
It must've been after losing her son
and her mother

200
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,260
that she became lax
in managing the servants.

201
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,870
Father, Mother, please

202
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,760
let Qilan stay in the mansion

203
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,800
and reflect on her mistakes

204
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,870
in seclusion.

205
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,230
You'd better repent this time.

206
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,510
If it weren't for the upcoming
Peace Banquet,

207
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,230
I wouldn't let this slide.

208
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,070
Yes.

209
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,790
Enough. You may all leave now.

210
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,440
Thank you, Father.

211
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:34,880
Qilan, get up.

212
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,430
Jiangli,

213
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,830
you are skilled in medicine.

214
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,240
Please check

215
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,640
Qingniang's condition.

216
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,270
Yes.

217
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,510
My Lord.

218
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,520
Let's go see our grandson.

219
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,120
- Sure.
- Let's go.

220
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,720
Ma'am.

221
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,030
Here.

222
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,630
Jiangli,

223
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,010
are you really going to wake her up?

224
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,670
After waking her,

225
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,000
she might be even more painful.

226
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,590
I'm just temporarily

227
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,790
stabilizing her mind.

228
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,910
Whether she can overcome it

229
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,160
depends on her own will.

230
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,380
Let's go home.

231
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,640
Xuan.

232
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,520
Xuan...

233
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,950
Xuan.

234
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,190
Xuan, my Xuan...

235
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,590
Xuan...

236
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,430
Xuan.

237
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,790
My Xuan.

238
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,790
My Xuan...

239
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,890
Xuan...

240
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,240
This is Qingniang's home.

241
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,670
Thank you, sir.

242
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,910
Xuan,

243
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,190
look at the toys I bought you.

244
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,190
Xuan, Xuan...

245
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,120
At the beginning of life,

246
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,240
people are inherently good.

247
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,880
Xuan...

248
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,830
My Xuan...

249
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,360
I'll make a belt for Xuan.

250
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,670
I met her when her child

251
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,760
had been dead for several days.

252
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,280
I offered to help her bury him,

253
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,750
but she...

254
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,830
Xuan...

255
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,950
- She refused to let it go.
- I'm here.

256
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,160
Xuan, don't be afraid.

257
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:16,880
Xuan...

258
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,380
(Ride with Wind)

259
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,160
So many candied hawthorns.

260
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,190
Here.

261
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,830
Let me choose the biggest one

262
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,520
for you, okay?

263
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,190
Yanyan.

264
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,240
Mother!

265
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,710
I miss you so much.

266
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,950
I miss you too.

267
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,270
Let's go home.

268
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,030
My Lady,

269
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,160
are we really going to do this?

270
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,240
The child she described
looks just like Yanyan,

271
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,750
and we met her

272
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,590
when we saw Mother.

273
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,760
This must be Mother's will,

274
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,950
sending help from above.

275
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,390
Isn't this

276
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,830
too risky?

277
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,760
You've seen how the Prefect

278
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,880
treats Master Jingming and his family.

279
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,670
This child's appearance

280
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,170
already threatens
Master Jingxiu's position.

281
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,790
For the sake of Master Jingxiu,

282
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,550
I must take this chance.

283
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,520
But Qingniang

284
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,160
looks mentally unstable.

285
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,760
What if I can't control her?

286
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,480
I know.

287
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,160
That's why this is a double-edged sword.

288
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,830
But I'm betting

289
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,360
on the Prefect's suspicion.

290
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,240
If things go wrong,

291
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,040
I'll just go join my mother.

292
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,880
My Lady.

293
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,280
My Lady, don't worry.

294
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,280
I will handle everything.

295
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,040
Xizhou is sending

296
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,400
the Grand Lady
and the Grand Princess here.

297
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,280
So, we must maintain

298
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,590
proper manners.

299
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,710
Leave the upcoming

300
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,240
Peace Banquet to Jiangli.

301
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,430
My Lord, just leave it to Jiangli.

302
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,890
She will manage it perfectly.

303
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,600
Qinian,

304
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,550
the Peace Banquet is of high importance.

305
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,160
The Grand Princess

306
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,940
and the Grand Lady from Xizhou
will be here.

307
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,000
Qilan, as Jingxiu's consort,

308
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,880
can't miss this banquet.

309
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,310
How dare you mention

310
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,280
that useless child to me?

311
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,910
I haven't even settled

312
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,360
the score with you yet.

313
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,670
Xiulan,

314
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,160
we can deal
with our private matters later,

315
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,520
but we can't let disgrace our family.

316
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,360
You must think of the bigger picture.

317
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:00,910
Qinian,

318
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,400
please give Qilan

319
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,040
a chance to make amends.

320
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,480
Lady Wang has a point.

321
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,790
Our guests are of high status,

322
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,160
and we can't let our manners slip.

323
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,310
Let her assist Jiangli.

324
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,240
Let her try her best.

325
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,070
She can't make any mistakes.

326
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,590
If there's any mistake,

327
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,070
no one can protect her.

328
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:19,950
Thank you, My Lord.

329
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,550
Last time,
your maid took the fall for you.

330
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,640
You won't always be that lucky.

331
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,000
I understand.

332
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,830
I'll be more careful from now on.

333
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,240
The banquet is your chance
to turn things around.

334
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,160
I pleaded with the Prefect

335
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,310
for this opportunity.

336
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,190
Don't mess it up again.

337
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,430
I will remember this.

338
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,320
The embroidery looks good.

339
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,760
This gold embroidery

340
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,360
is unique

341
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,550
to Dongzhou.

342
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,400
It'll be presented
to the ladies of Xizhou

343
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,240
as a gift.

344
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,640
Tell the embroiderers

345
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,960
that they must do their best.

346
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,720
If these embroidered handkerchiefs
gain popularity in Xizhou,

347
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,550
you may even open up a business there.

348
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,190
Don't worry, Consort Jiangli.

349
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,710
I won't slack off.

350
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:20,950
We won't

351
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,190
disgrace Dongzhou.

352
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,120
Sir?

353
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,430
Go ahead.

354
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,710
I'll take another look around.

355
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,640
Yes, Consort Jiangli. Take your time.

356
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,590
Oh, it's Consort Qilan.

357
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,640
Sorry about my negligence.

358
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,710
Please forgive me.

359
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,030
Sir,

360
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,270
I'd like to order
100 gold-embroidered handkerchiefs.

361
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,590
What would that cost me?

362
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,950
My apologies, Consort Qilan.

363
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,000
We can't manage that now.

364
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,910
We've just taken on a huge order.

365
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,360
All our embroiderers are swamped.

366
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,880
We're overwhelmed now.

367
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,160
You're too late.

368
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,740
I've placed an order
for over 100 handkerchiefs.

369
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,310
So, it was you, Jiangli.

370
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,240
We're truly sisters.

371
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,190
Looks like we are

372
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,590
of one mind.

373
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,510
Shen Qilan,

374
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,160
spare me

375
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,400
the sisterly act.

376
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,040
You tried to frame me

377
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,880
with Qingniang, right?

378
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,030
Yes.

379
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,640
Did you just figure it out?

380
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,790
What will you do now?

381
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,080
Are you going to report me?

382
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,480
I don't even need to act

383
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,430
because you'll trap yourself

384
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,550
just like your mother.

385
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,390
Shen Jiangli.

386
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,760
You don't deserve to mention my mother.

387
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,710
The Qingniang incident

388
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,640
was merely my opening move.

389
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:50,910
The Peace Banquet

390
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,520
is the beginning.

391
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,000
I've prepared tea for you.

392
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,510
Come in.

393
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,240
Jiangli,
you truly have an eye for design.

394
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,590
This pattern

395
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,720
is exquisite.

396
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,340
I must learn more

397
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,000
from you in the future.

398
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,550
Qilan, you flatter me.

399
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,520
But you'll need to learn

400
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,870
more than just choosing handkerchiefs.

401
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,870
When the chance comes,

402
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,000
I'll teach you everything.

403
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,200
Thank you, Jiangli.

404
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,220
(Prefect's Mansion)

405
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,150
I've prepared
gold-embroidered handkerchiefs

406
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,070
to gift the guests from Xizhou.

407
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,550
Each one was made

408
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,870
by the finest embroiderers in Dongzhou

409
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,550
with auspicious phrases

410
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,240
and Buddhist totems on it.

411
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,240
We always gift visitors

412
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,960
gold-embroidered handkerchiefs.

413
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,150
It's getting old.

414
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,920
Seems Consort Jiangli

415
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,720
didn't put much thought into it.

416
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,350
Qilan, what have you prepared?

417
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,040
Mother,

418
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,760
My Lord,

419
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,830
the autumn skies are clear,

420
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,390
and the red maples of East Mountain
are a local marvel.

421
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,960
I plan to invite the ladies of Xizhou

422
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,870
to admire the maples.

423
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:18,240
I've also arranged lantern riddles
and drinking games,

424
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,280
so they can paint among the maples.

425
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,000
They'll surely have a good time.

426
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,550
Qilan must be telling a joke.

427
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,720
A group of ladies climbing a mountain?

428
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,590
What if they scratch their faces?

429
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:29,870
Can you take responsibility?

430
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:31,710
Besides,

431
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,200
the ladies of Xizhou

432
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,440
are no match for our refined ladies.

433
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,870
You want them to write poems?

434
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,830
You're helping with the banquet,

435
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,590
yet you didn't even research
their preferences?

436
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,310
Please, Father,

437
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,680
take a look at the programs
I've prepared

438
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,890
before making a final decision.

439
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,350
No need.

440
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,240
The Peace Banquet
should be festive and lively.

441
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,830
Just keep things lighthearted.

442
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,960
No need to have poetic events.

443
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,960
Jiangli's embroidered handkerchiefs

444
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,070
may not be fresh,

445
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:07,720
but they're a safe

446
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,200
and thoughtful gift.

447
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,050
With different auspicious phrases

448
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,930
on each one,

449
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,000
you must've put much effort into this.

450
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,150
Well done.

451
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,140
Thank you for your praise, Father.

452
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,920
It is my duty.

453
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,580
Qingqing,

454
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,300
the new ruler of Xizhou is still young.

455
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,870
So, the Grand Lady and Grand Princess

456
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,520
are involved in state affairs.

457
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,040
Those two

458
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,720
hold great power in Xizhou.

459
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,000
So,

460
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,840
their visit here

461
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,310
this time

462
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,720
isn't just for the Peace Banquet.

463
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,680
As the princess of Dongzhou,

464
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,830
you should prepare
a welcoming performance

465
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,520
to showcase the elegance of Dongzhou

466
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,040
in front of the princess of Xizhou.

467
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,790
I'll prepare it carefully.

468
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,040
What should I do?

469
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,390
What to do?

470
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,630
What should I perform?

471
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:02,840
Qingqing,

472
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,680
as the princess of Dongzhou,

473
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,520
you must have attended
many grand events.

474
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,390
Why are you so nervous this time?

475
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,630
It's different this time.

476
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,520
Everyone in the four states knows

477
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,870
Princess Chuya excels in everything,

478
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,520
including singing and dancing.

479
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,440
How can I preserve

480
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,960
Dongzhou's honor?

481
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,600
Also,

482
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,960
I heard

483
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,440
that Mr. Chu will attend the banquet

484
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,760
as the Director of Astrology.

485
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,480
He'll be recording
the meeting of the two states.

486
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,240
I don't want him

487
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,720
to see me being overshadowed.

488
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,440
I see.

489
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,730
So,

490
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,690
it's not the princess
you're nervous about,

491
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,390
but Zimo, right?

492
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,630
Jiangli, do you have any ideas?

493
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,790
Qingqing,

494
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,310
you've traveled through all four states

495
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,590
and seen the world's
finest sights and treasures.

496
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,110
I think

497
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,240
you should just show everyone

498
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,550
the most beautiful thing

499
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,920
in your eyes.

500
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,240
The most beautiful thing...

501
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:03,550
Let me think.

502
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,080
Jiangli,

503
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,070
I think I know what I'll prepare.

504
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,150
- Move the drum to the left.
- Yes.

505
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,250
- Align the sides.
- Sure.

506
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,240
Place it here.

507
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,290
Let's go check over there.

508
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,160
Jiangli.

509
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,000
Jiangli,

510
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,200
this is some mare's milk wine

511
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,550
I brought from home for you.

512
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,680
I thought it might be useful
for today's banquet.

513
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,400
It'd be a good treat
for our distinguished guests.

514
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,040
By the way, Jiangli,

515
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,630
it's such a grand event.

516
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,280
Why is this visit

517
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,310
from Xizhou so important?

518
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,310
In the past five years,

519
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,630
Dongzhou and Xizhou

520
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,000
have had some minor conflicts,

521
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,790
so the Prefect is giving this visit

522
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,680
special attention.

523
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,350
The Grand Lady and the princess

524
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,720
are both involved in state affairs.

525
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,040
So, we must treat them well

526
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,310
and not make any mistakes.

527
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,350
Alright.

528
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,820
I'll stay and help you arrange things.

529
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,200
Let's check the stage.

530
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,280
Let's go.

531
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,460
(Princess Chuya,
Grand Princess of Xizhou)

532
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,940
(Peace and Prosperity)

533
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,720
Grand Lady, you're finally here.

534
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,240
After such a long journey,

535
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,790
you still look so energetic.

536
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,480
How admirable.

537
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,040
By the way,

538
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,150
isn't Princess Chuya coming too?

539
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,960
Where is she?

540
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,720
My granddaughter
has always been carefree.

541
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,480
On the way here,
she spotted a wild rabbit,

542
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,520
so she went to chase it.

543
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,760
Grandmother.

544
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,390
Did you

545
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,390
let the rabbit go?

546
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,960
The rabbit's belly was bulging.

547
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,440
It must be pregnant,

548
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,350
so I let it go.

549
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,550
I've heard of Princess Chuya's

550
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,520
impressive reputation,

551
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,680
and seeing her today,

552
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,440
I can see she lives up to it.

553
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,630
Princess Chuya is no ordinary woman.

554
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,830
She excels in horsemanship and tactics.

555
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,350
She's a true heroine.

556
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,630
Go and greet Lady Wang and Lady Shu.

557
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,760
Greetings, Lady Wang.

558
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,630
Greetings, ladies.

559
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,110
Grand Lady, you brought

560
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,070
Princess Chuya here
for the Peace Banquet.

561
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,920
You must

562
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,110
value Dongzhou greatly.

563
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,760
Of course.

564
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,240
Xizhou and Dongzhou
are closely connected.

565
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,550
The young ladies here
are quite charming as well.

566
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,110
You're delicate and graceful.

567
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,470
I like you.

568
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,150
Grand Lady, you can rest

569
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,960
with the princess
at the post house for now.

570
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,680
Tonight, at the Peace Banquet,

571
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,790
the young people from both states

572
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,070
can have a good time tonight.

573
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,670
Thank you.

574
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,670
Let's go.

575
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:06,950
Yulan,

576
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,550
how's it going with the medicinal soups

577
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,990
I prepared for the guests?

578
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,920
They're all ready.

579
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,150
I've prepared

580
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,280
the dishes they like

581
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,760
and the medicinal soups

582
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,090
you prescribed for them.

583
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,760
Your Grace,
the banquet is about to start.

584
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,110
Where are you going?

585
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,200
I want to see

586
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,870
how Dongzhou

587
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,070
differs from Xizhou.

588
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,830
Also, put plenty of flowers here.

589
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,670
Then...

590
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,730
- Please forgive us.
- Please forgive us.

591
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,790
It's fine.

592
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,630
You can get up now.

593
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,080
Let me see.

594
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,920
Your hand is injured.

595
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,760
Yulan.

596
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:45,730
Be more careful in the future.

597
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,830
Don't act so rashly.

598
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,670
Yes.

599
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:48,910
Go on.

600
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:50,950
Let's go.

601
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,240
We met her today, right?

602
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,680
Yes. She's Consort Jiangli.

603
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:00,590
Consort Jiangli...

604
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,960
The Grand Lady and the Grand Princess

605
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,040
have traveled from afar,

606
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,520
so we've prepared this banquet.

607
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,680
It is called the Peace Banquet.

608
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,070
We hope

609
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,200
that our two states will reconcile,

610
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,280
bringing peace to the world.

611
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,390
May our two states reconcile

612
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,240
and the world be at peace.

613
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,320
Cheers.

614
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,520
Since you two have traveled from afar,

615
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,520
and the climate here
is different from that in Xizhou,

616
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:00,710
we were worried

617
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,630
that you might

618
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,520
feel uncomfortable due to the heat,

619
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,040
so we prepared some ice cream

620
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,520
to help you cool down and refresh.

621
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,830
This is Consort Shen Qilan.

622
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,150
Qilan is always a sensible

623
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,310
and thoughtful child.

624
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,070
How thoughtful. I'll give it a try.

625
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,190
Grand Lady.

626
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,550
I'd like one too.

627
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:31,760
It looks so exquisite.

628
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,720
This is much more refined

629
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,960
than the food we have in Xizhou.

630
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,280
Your Grace.

631
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,000
The Grand Lady and the princess

632
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,040
have traveled from Xizhou,

633
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,480
and there are
quite a few differences in cuisine.

634
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,990
To prevent any digestive discomfort,

635
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,390
I've prepared medicinal tea for you.

636
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,070
It'll help prevent any discomfort

637
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,060
from the change in environment.

638
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,630
Grand Lady,

639
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:21,680
this is Consort Shen Jiangli.

640
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:22,830
Jiangli,

641
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,040
serve the tea

642
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,000
to the Grand Lady.

643
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,520
Yes.

644
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,390
Grand Lady, please enjoy the tea.

645
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,280
Consort Jiangli is clever
and quick-witted.

646
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,280
Your two daughters-in-law
are truly impressive.

647
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,310
How thoughtful.

648
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,120
Your Grace, please enjoy the tea.

649
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:00,990
Grand Lady,

650
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,550
my daughters-in-law

651
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,060
have also prepared some performances.

652
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,480
I'd like to invite you two

653
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,790
to step into the courtyard

654
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,040
to enjoy them.

655
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,630
Grand Lady,

656
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,720
Qilan is known

657
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,790
as a talented lady in Dongzhou.

658
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,150
She's famous in Dongzhou?

659
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,550
Jiangli isn't bad either.

660
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,520
What a surprise that Jiangli can dance.

661
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,040
Your daughter-in-law can play the qin,

662
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,520
but mine can dance.

663
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,200
After watching the performances,

664
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:38,830
I'd like to perform a piece

665
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,830
for everyone as well.

666
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,440
Then we'll be in for a real treat.

667
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,200
Princess Chuya is truly talented.

668
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,340
May peace prevail in the four states.

669
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,290
May everything prosper.

670
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,230
May the four states enjoy peace.

671
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,650
May all the people be happy.

672
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,470
- Xiulan.
- Jinyi.

673
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,090
Your Grace, why are you here alone?

674
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:19,920
The Peace Banquet is over.

675
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,150
Mr. Chu, are you here to invite me
for a drink?

676
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:32,550
I've come as promised.

677
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,230
As promised?

678
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,040
Before I left,

679
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,310
didn't you say

680
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,000
we'd enjoy the fireworks

681
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,200
when I returned?

682
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,280
How did my performance go?

683
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,600
It was excellent.

684
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,790
I saw you moving around.

685
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,880
Did you get burned?

686
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,240
Yes.

687
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,230
Where?

688
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,150
I was joking.

689
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,280
You're in a good mood today, aren't you?

690
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,350
Coming back this time,

691
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,790
I've let go of some things.

692
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,360
What is it?

693
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,150
It's nothing really.

694
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,550
A few years ago,

695
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,110
I met a woman.

696
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,070
We met

697
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,590
in her most helpless time.

698
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,390
I saved her,

699
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,390
and I thought she couldn't move on.

700
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,690
We in Wind Pavilion
have helped many people.

701
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,610
I've seen so many people
unable to move on.

702
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,080
But she...

703
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,510
Not only did she get through it,

704
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,760
but she also became someone

705
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,310
who could save others.

706
00:32:58,630 --> 00:32:59,990
In the past, when I looked at her,

707
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,830
I would instinctively want

708
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:03,720
to protect her.

709
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:05,720
But now,

710
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,310
she's reached a position

711
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,240
where she no longer needs me.

712
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,200
Does that mean

713
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,550
I should congratulate you
for letting it go?

714
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,150
You could say that.

715
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:42,020
(Liuyun Post House)

716
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,080
Grandmother, have some tea.

717
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,040
What do you think

718
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,110
of the banquet yesterday?

719
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:49,240
The Peace Banquet went very well.

720
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,310
Dongzhou made it clear

721
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,200
that it hopes for reconciliation
between us.

722
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,760
It seems

723
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,630
that the border conflicts

724
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,510
may not be as simple as they appear.

725
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,630
Grandmother,

726
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,390
you should talk
with the Prefect of Dongzhou

727
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:02,240
next time.

728
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,190
Yes.

729
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,070
The years of war

730
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,520
have caused the people to suffer.

731
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,800
If both sides agree to cease war,

732
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,480
everyone will benefit.

733
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,110
I know

734
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,320
you've liked Dongzhou

735
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,800
since that man

736
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,520
saved you at the border.

737
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:25,950
Yes.

738
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,920
Dongzhou is vast.

739
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,840
I wonder when I can meet him again.

740
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,550
If it's meant to be, you'll meet again.

741
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,190
I'm telling you.

742
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,320
They've even prepared
a lantern event for me today.

743
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,360
I've heard that the lantern event here

744
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,840
is both exquisite and lively.

745
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,230
I must take a good look at it.

746
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,380
Right, Yulan.

747
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,360
Make the lantern higher.

748
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,150
- Okay.
- My Lady.

749
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:54,000
Add two more to that side.

750
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,960
Yes.

751
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,270
Make sure they're hanging evenly.

752
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,670
Right. Lower it this side.

753
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,070
Yes, make those two match.

754
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,550
When did you get here?

755
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,640
Consort Jiangli,

756
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,550
how's the preparation
for the lantern event going?

757
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,400
I'm still working on it.

758
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,270
Don't worry.

759
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:14,190
I'll check everything again later.

760
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:15,920
I didn't expect you

761
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,480
to be so nervous this time.

762
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,070
Don't worry.

763
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:20,750
Everyone praised you

764
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,460
for doing a great job
at the Peace Banquet.

765
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,630
I'm not nervous.

766
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,670
This concerns the two states.

767
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,150
I need to be more cautious.

768
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,000
There's still some time.

769
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,020
How about

770
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,480
I take you for a stroll

771
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,320
to relax?

772
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,750
I don't have time for that.

773
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:34,510
I'm swamped.

774
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,690
Master Jingming, you go ahead.

775
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:36,820
Get back to work.

776
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:37,990
Young Master.

777
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,160
My Lady.

778
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,160
Well, you're needed in the camp.

779
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,390
Okay.

780
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,960
My Lady,

781
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,150
did I do something wrong?

782
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,230
No, you've done very well.

783
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,770
Go ahead and find your master.

784
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,360
I'll take my leave.

785
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,110
Yulan, keep an eye on things here.

786
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,100
I'll go check over there.

787
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:58,840
Okay.

788
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,750
Grandmother,

789
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,000
I've spent the whole day

790
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,070
experiencing Dongzhou's
customs and culture.

791
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,000
I've found

792
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,400
that although Xizhou is strong,

793
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,840
Dongzhou also has things
we can learn from.

794
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,520
It seems you had a great time today.

795
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,360
It's him...

796
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,630
Chuya, what are you looking at?

797
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,440
Grand Lady, Your Grace,

798
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,920
you can have some tea

799
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,760
and rest for a while.

800
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,000
We'll head to the lantern event
in the evening.
