Mother.

What's wrong, Yanyan?

25
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,530
Mother,

26
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,020
I just dreamed

27
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,890
we were sleeping on a small boat,

28
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,100
swaying back and forth.

29
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,700
Yanyan, go to sleep now.

30
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:14,980
We need to travel tomorrow.

31
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,490
Mother, we're so happy here.

32
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,170
Why do we have to leave suddenly?

33
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:24,980
We're not leaving;

34
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,300
we're going back.

35
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,580
This is not our home.

36
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,860
But I like it here.

37
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,330
Mr. Cute is very good to me.

38
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,100
I like Mr. Cute the most.

39
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,860
You naughty boy.

40
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,260
Everyone in Wind Pavilion likes you.

41
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,420
Don't you miss them?

42
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,650
I miss Father Zimo and Mentor too,

43
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:50,770
but I don't want to leave Mr. Cute.

44
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,330
Mother,

45
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,380
can we take Mr. Cute

46
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,140
with us?

47
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,220
No.

48
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,450
Mr. Cute

49
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,490
is Master Jingming of Dongzhou.

50
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,020
He has to put
the people of Dongzhou first.

51
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,420
I understand now.

52
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,420
Mr. Cute is amazing.

53
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:10,770
Then

54
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,490
who's more amazing,
him or Father Zimo?

55
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,150
Each of them has their strengths.

56
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,540
Young Master,

57
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,820
if you don't want
Consort Jiangli to leave,

58
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,020
you can issue an order.

59
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,650
After all, she is your rightful wife.

♪May you be free from a long journey♪

61
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,070
Yanyan,

62
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,420
it's Uncle Zimo.

63
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:48,890
You can't call him Father.

64
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,140
But other children

65
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,210
have mothers and fathers.

66
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,610
I want a father too.

67
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,930
But

68
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,770
Uncle Zimo is not your father.

69
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,210
If you call him that,

70
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,610
it will cause him trouble.

71
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,610
Then is Mr. Cute my father?

72
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,300
I also want a father.

73
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,930
I'm so cute.

74
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,260
Can't I have two fathers?

75
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20,530
Yanyan, be good.

76
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:21,770
In a few days,

77
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,180
you'll see Uncle Zimo.

78
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,370
Now, go to sleep.

79
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,420
Be good.

80
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,820
Mentor!

81
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,700
Put the box at the back of the carriage.

82
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,690
- Slow down.
- Okay.

83
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:12,940
And those luggage.

84
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,480
Has everything been taken care of?

85
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,370
Yes.

86
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,050
My Lady,

87
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,060
the journey is long.

88
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,700
Master Jingming asked me to escort you.

89
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,250
No need.

90
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,970
I know

91
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,700
you prepared the carriage

92
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,020
and hired the coachman

93
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,530
because you didn't want us

94
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,620
to know your whereabouts, but...

95
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,850
Since you already know,

96
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,330
don't force it.

97
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,050
Let's go, Yanyan.

98
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,100
My Lady, please wait.

99
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:37,250
Bring it here.

100
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,770
Yesterday, Master Jingming
went with Qilin Guards

101
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,490
to rescue the farm
in the east of the city.

102
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,940
But before leaving,

103
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,530
he asked me to prepare

104
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,660
some cakes

105
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,480
and drinks for you and the young master.

106
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,240
There are the Mati pastry I love,

107
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,940
and the osmanthus cake
Mother loves the most.

108
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,820
Mr. Cute is really good to us.

109
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,180
Let's go, Yanyan.

110
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:28,490
I'm fine.

111
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:29,930
Master Jingming.

112
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,850
You two go over there to see

113
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,780
if there are any survivors
under the rubble.

114
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,090
Go help over there.

115
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:37,970
Yes.

116
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:38,970
Yunyi, come.

117
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:39,810
Yes.

118
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,480
This way.

119
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,720
Slow down.

120
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,580
This way.

121
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,780
Come on.

122
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,020
Come on.

123
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:54,860
Hurry.

124
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,090
Be careful.

125
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:58,980
Everyone, listen up.

126
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,380
The houses here

127
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,850
are not very sturdy.

128
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,330
Move the injured

129
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,750
to the flat ground over there.

130
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,780
- Yes.
- Yunyi, let's go.

131
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,970
Slow down.

132
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:24,060
Yanyan, we'll be back
at Wind Pavilion soon.

133
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,960
Are you happy?

134
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,450
- Yes.
- If you're happy,

135
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,210
let's finish the noodles quickly.

136
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,700
Once we finish, we'll go back.

137
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,770
- Okay?
- Sure.

138
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,220
Alright, eat then, sweetie.

139
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,180
Eat up.

140
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,530
I've lived in Dongzhou
for over a decade.

141
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,220
I really don't want to leave.

142
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,520
But what can we do?

143
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,560
Dongzhou is plagued
by constant natural disasters.

144
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,170
If we don't leave, we might die.

145
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,140
It's Master Jingming's fault.

146
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,570
Who would've thought he was

147
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,380
the root cause of this earthquake?

148
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,060
What a jinx.

149
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,960
The earthquake is a natural disaster,

150
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,140
not a man-made one.

151
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,990
What does it have to do
with Master Jingming?

152
00:08:59,050 --> 00:08:59,930
It actually does.

153
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,170
It's because Master Jingming's fate

154
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,260
clashes with Qilin Guards.

155
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,830
If he's in charge,

156
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,690
Dongzhou will suffer
from constant disasters.

157
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,690
We common people

158
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:08,980
can't interfere

159
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,130
with the Prefect's decisions.

160
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,460
The only way to survive

161
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,570
is to leave Dongzhou.

162
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:13,890
Nonsense!

163
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,460
This isn't just nonsense.

164
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,810
This statement came
from the Astrology Bureau.

165
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,360
Lord Zhou from the Astrology Bureau

166
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,350
is the first disciple

167
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,220
of Wind Pavilion's chief.

168
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,460
It can't be false.

169
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,460
Lord Zhou's divination skills

170
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,860
are legendary.

171
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,530
It's said that today,

172
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:30,810
Master Jingming went over there

173
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,460
and was hit by the gold ball.

174
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,700
Father.

175
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,100
I wonder why you urgently

176
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:48,940
summoned me.

177
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,140
Master Jingming, please be patient.

178
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,740
You were hastily called back

179
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,690
for something important.

180
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,340
My Lord,

181
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,890
I observed the stars last night.

182
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,260
Since the beginning of spring,

183
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,810
the city has been suffering

184
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,810
from floods and earthquakes.

185
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,380
The people are suffering.

186
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,460
All of this

187
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,740
is caused by the jinx taking charge

188
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,220
of Qilin Guards.

189
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,620
The people are in danger.

190
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,250
Lord Zhou,

191
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,340
do you have any way to resolve this?

192
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:23,810
Lord Zhou,

193
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,140
as our Director of Astrology

194
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,340
and the first disciple
of Wind Pavilion's chief,

195
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,320
you must think carefully
before speaking.

196
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,740
Are you suggesting

197
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,770
that if we destroy Qilin Guards,

198
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:34,860
the disasters will end?

199
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,690
That's absurd.

200
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,490
Master Jingxing,
please don't misunderstand.

201
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,220
I'm only informing the Prefect

202
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,010
about the recent abnormal star patterns.

203
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,150
I'm not suggesting anything.

204
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,170
Moreover,

205
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,460
the importance of Qilin Guards

206
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,570
is self-evident.

207
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,650
How could we handle it recklessly?

208
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,010
So,

209
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,960
everyone is gathered here today

210
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,460
to discuss this.

211
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:55,860
Jingxing,

212
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,410
Father has called us here

213
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,340
to resolve the problem.

214
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,860
We all know that recently,

215
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,130
there was an earthquake
in the south of the city.

216
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,220
If this continues,

217
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,500
the entire city might be destroyed.

218
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,970
Instead of wasting time here
with superstitions,

219
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,540
we should focus on disaster relief
and help the people

220
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,810
to calm the public.

221
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,300
Jingming,

222
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,690
don't be rude.

223
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,770
Lord Zhou has been

224
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,620
protecting and praying for Dongzhou

225
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,170
on behalf of the chief.

226
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,170
We must respect him.

227
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,280
My Lord, thank you for your respect.

228
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,770
Master Jingming

229
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,220
is just worried.

230
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,020
Everyone here

231
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,740
cares about Dongzhou.

232
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,220
Please remain calm.

233
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,650
I've brought

234
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,020
a special treasure from my mentor.

235
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,580
What treasure?

236
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,700
Bring it here.

237
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,100
Yes.

238
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:45,770
Bring it here.

239
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:09,980
My Lord,

240
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,340
this is the Tianzhu Instrument

241
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,860
of my mentor,
the chief of Wind Pavilion.

242
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,020
It can predict the affairs of the world.

243
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,380
Tianzhu Instrument,

244
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:22,740
please tell me

245
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,980
who should be responsible

246
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,690
for the disasters in this city.

247
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,100
Jingming...

248
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,860
How did this ball end up
at Jingming's feet?

249
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,980
What's going on here?

250
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,820
I...

251
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,140
Speak frankly.

252
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,860
Frankly speaking,

253
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,860
as shown by the Tianzhu Instrument,

254
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,340
the jinx

255
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:11,930
is Master Jingming.

256
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:13,860
This is nonsense!

257
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,830
I heard that the earthquake had stopped,

258
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,460
but once Master Jingming arrived there,

259
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,770
it started again,

260
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,860
and there was even bloodshed.

261
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,260
The Tianzhu Instrument

262
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,500
is truly powerful.

263
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,490
My Lord,

264
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,870
please remove Master Jingming

265
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,770
from his position
as the Commander of Qilin Guards.

266
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,010
My Lord

267
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,340
the city is already talking about this.

268
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,220
Is Master Jingming really...

269
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,100
My Lord, please put Dongzhou first.

270
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,820
- Father.
- Jingming.

271
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,460
You should put Qilin Guards

272
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,500
aside for now.

273
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,930
Go back to rest for now.

274
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,100
Someone should be in charge

275
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,340
of disaster relief now.

276
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,980
Father, please reconsider.

277
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,490
Wait.

278
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,890
My Lord, I have
something important to report.

279
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,820
Consort Jiangli,

280
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,170
we are discussing major affairs here.

281
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,570
How dare you, a woman, break in?

282
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,810
Don't you know

283
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,030
your interference in politics
is punishable by death?

284
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:13,890
Jingxiu,

285
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,470
Jiangli hasn't said a word,

286
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,570
and now you're accusing her

287
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,660
of interfering in politics?

288
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,010
Father,

289
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,050
Jiangli is not usually reckless.

290
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,090
Today,

291
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,530
she barged into the hall like this,

292
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,300
so it must be
due to something important.

293
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,980
We should at least listen
to what she has to say.

294
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,740
Fine. Go on.

295
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,460
My Lord,

296
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,620
on my way

297
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,100
to the ancestral tomb,

298
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,140
I once met the chief of Wind Pavilion.

299
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,020
From what I know,

300
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,460
there's no disciple named Zhou

301
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,410
in Wind Pavilion.

302
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,690
I don't know where Lord Zhou

303
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,260
came from.

304
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,500
Consort Jiangli,

305
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,220
how dare you openly slander
the Director of Astrology?

306
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,220
You just met the chief.

307
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,500
What could he have told you?

308
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:55,770
Master Jingxiu,

309
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,140
please be patient.

310
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,100
If I didn't have proof,

311
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,620
how could I accuse
the Director of Astrology?

312
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,490
Isn't this

313
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,650
the Luminous Pearl I gave to the chief

314
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,750
of Wind Pavilion years ago?

315
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,860
Exactly.

316
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,020
The chief

317
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,690
gave me several medical books

318
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,570
so I started studying medicine.

319
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,090
Then

320
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,380
he also gave me

321
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,410
this Luminous Pearl

322
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,770
to ensure my success in everything.

323
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,770
So,

324
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,690
you really know
the chief of Wind Pavilion.

325
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:35,650
Yes.

326
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,180
So,

327
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
it was you who stole my Luminous Pearl.

328
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,550
My Lord,

329
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,460
a few days ago, my house was robbed,

330
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,980
and my mentor's Luminous Pearl

331
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:45,930
suddenly disappeared.

332
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,980
I couldn't find it anywhere.

333
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,340
I even asked Master Jingxiu for help.

334
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,930
Father, this is true.

335
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,290
I never expected

336
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,500
the thief to be so bold

337
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,620
and even show up here,

338
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,860
trying to slander me.

339
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,370
My Lord,

340
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,410
I am

341
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:04,810
innocent.

342
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,050
Consort Jiangli has been
staying at home lately,

343
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,340
never leaving the house.

344
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,110
How could she have stolen anything?

345
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,910
Father, please believe me.

346
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,620
What an unrepentant liar.

347
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,650
My Lord,

348
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,650
I can invite the chief of Wind Pavilion

349
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,750
to testify.

350
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:25,100
The chief is said to be a recluse

351
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,170
and hasn't appeared for years.

352
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,290
Can Consort Jiangli

353
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,740
really find him?

354
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,180
Jiangli,

355
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,860
can you really invite the chief here?

356
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:35,530
Yes.

357
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,220
The chief is a capable man.

358
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,980
If you can find him so easily,

359
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,980
what kind of recluse is he?

360
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,410
Consort Jiangli,

361
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,020
what if

362
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,930
you can't find him?

363
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:48,530
Father,

364
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:49,890
if Jiangli

365
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,770
can't bring the chief here,

366
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,570
I'll accept all punishments.

367
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,820
Fine.

368
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,380
I'll give you seven more days.

369
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,260
Let me see

370
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,260
if you can bring the chief here.

371
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,820
- Yes.
- Yes.

372
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,540
Jiangli.

373
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,130
What are you doing?

374
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,290
Earlier,

375
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,260
you barged into the hall.

376
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,610
I heard

377
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,330
someone was impersonating
the chief's disciple

378
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,170
so I...

379
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,220
So, I got anxious.

380
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,740
That's all.

381
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:54,890
Really?

382
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,030
What else could it be?

383
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:57,850
Do you think it's for you?

384
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,900
No matter the reason,

385
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,940
I'm quite happy about it.

386
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,700
Aren't you afraid

387
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,660
that I won't be able to invite the chief

388
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,000
and that you'll be punished
because of me?

389
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,250
Last time when Yanyan was sick,

390
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,330
the medicine bottle you took out

391
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,090
had Wind Pavilion's mark on it.

392
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,260
You didn't say anything,

393
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,420
so I didn't ask.

394
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,050
I'll go with you to find

395
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,150
the chief of Wind Pavilion.

396
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,300
No.

397
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,660
Wind Pavilion

398
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:29,900
is off-limits to outsiders.

399
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,050
Is Wind Pavilion off-limits,

400
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,330
or are you afraid
that I'll remember the way

401
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,660
and come find you later?

402
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:37,170
Glad you know that.

403
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,290
Jiangli, aren't we going back for now?

404
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,740
I need to investigate

405
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,580
Zhou Siqi first.

406
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,850
We can't let him use

407
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,020
the name of our Wind Pavilion

408
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,260
to deceive people.

409
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,500
Yanyan is not safe with me.

410
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,320
His illness has been cured.

411
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,000
Please take him back to recuperate.

412
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,770
We'll go our separate ways back.

413
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,090
Yes, Jiangli.

414
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,860
Zimo.

415
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46,130
I know him.

416
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,860
Zimo.

417
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:53,610
Yunyi.

418
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,220
I knew it was you.

419
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,330
Can you stop it, Master Jingming?

420
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:15,930
Who is this?

421
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:17,650
This is my senior.

422
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:19,940
I am Chu Zimo.

423
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,260
(Chu Zimo, first disciple)
You must be Master Jingming.

424
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,260
I've long heard of you.

425
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,050
Thank you

426
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,700
for taking care of Jiangli

427
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,020
when she was in Wind Pavilion.

428
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:30,690
You're too kind.

429
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,300
Zimo, what took you so long?

430
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,570
I took care of the matters
in the Pavilion

431
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,090
and then rushed over day and night.

432
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,460
Why are you alone?

433
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,290
Where is Yanyan and Yulan?

434
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,260
I told Yulan and Yanyan

435
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,370
to take another route

436
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,310
back to Wind Pavilion.

437
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,940
I have an emergency.

438
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,330
Someone

439
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,180
is impersonating you

440
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,740
and spreading rumors in Dongzhou.

441
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,180
So, I was planning
to ask the chief for help.

442
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,770
How absurd.

443
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,220
Some people are indeed
impersonating me.

444
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,520
Originally,

445
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,670
I didn't plan to make a fuss,

446
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,590
but he actually showed up
in front of me.

447
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,850
In that case, you don't need to go back

448
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:07,710
to find Mentor.

449
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,180
I'll go with you to settle this.

450
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:10,850
Although

451
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,420
Zhou Siqi is impersonating you,

452
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,700
we promised Father

453
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,180
we'd bring the chief back.

454
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:17,900
If you go...

455
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,220
I know

456
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,740
how to convince the Prefect.

457
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,770
Good.

458
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,900
It's already late.

459
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,090
Let's rest for now.

460
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,220
Tomorrow, I'll go back with you.

461
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,850
But we're out in the wilderness.

462
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,390
We'll have to make do
in the carriage for the night.

463
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,290
Young Master, My Lady,

464
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,370
the ancestral tomb is nearby.

465
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,570
There's a place there

466
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:40,760
for the tomb keepers to rest.

467
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,020
We could spend the night there.

468
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,020
I think

469
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,380
staying in the carriage is fine

470
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,370
so we won't have to move around.

471
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,340
No, Zimo.

472
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,530
It's been a long time
since I've been there.

473
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,090
I miss it.

474
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,000
Since we're passing by,

475
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:01,260
let me revisit the old place.

476
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,260
You must be tired.

477
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,740
Go rest early.

478
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:49,810
This place is so rundown.

479
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,290
I don't know how Consort Jiangli

480
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,050
has managed here all these years.

481
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:19,410
Today

482
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,530
should be the Spring Festival.

483
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:25,660
I wonder how Master Jingming

484
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,290
is doing at the frontier.

485
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:51,740
Master Jingming,

486
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,770
you're back.

487
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:57,520
I've been waiting for you
to come and pick me up.

488
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,060
Master Jingming...

489
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,850
He's not here.

490
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:08,450
Time to eat.

491
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:14,050
Nanny Dong, I beg you.

492
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,320
Please help me plead for mercy.

493
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,290
I want to go back.

494
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,200
I want to go back
and wait for Master Jingming.

495
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,740
You're pitiful.

496
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,810
But stop daydreaming.

497
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,660
Master Jingming has returned
from the frontier.

498
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,700
He knows

499
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,570
Lady Shu has locked you up here.

500
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,850
Why hasn't he come to see you?

501
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,610
It's because he's forgotten about you.

502
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,050
If you want to blame someone,

503
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,370
- blame your fate.
- Nanny Dong.

504
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:36,450
Nanny Dong.

505
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,690
Nanny Dong,

506
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,370
please help me plead to Master Jingming.

507
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,660
I want to go back and see him.

508
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,700
Please explain it to Master Jingming.

509
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,390
- Nanny Dong.
- I don't know anything.

510
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,340
I beg you.

511
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,050
- I don't know anything.
- I beg you.

512
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:49,460
Nanny Dong, please pass the message.

513
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,460
- Let go.
- I beg you, Nanny Dong.

514
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:03,770
What is fate?

515
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,330
Why...

516
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:52,850
It's already late,

517
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,940
yet you haven't gone to bed.

518
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,980
Is there something you want to say?

519
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:01,570
It seems

520
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:02,980
I haven't had a chance

521
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:04,890
to ask

522
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:07,850
how you know the chief

523
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,330
and how you suddenly have a senior.

524
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,130
This is my privacy.

525
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,720
I don't need to explain
everything to you, do I?

526
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:18,770
If I had

527
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,260
believed you back then,

528
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,240
maybe you wouldn't have suffered

529
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,330
so much hardship.

530
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:29,410
Hardship...

531
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,420
What a light word.

532
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:35,290
You're born noble,

533
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:36,610
living in comfort,

534
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,500
so naturally, you don't know
how unbearable my days

535
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,660
at the ancestral tomb were.

536
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,570
This dilapidated and cold yard

537
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:49,020
has not changed.

538
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,900
It's brought the past back to me.

539
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,330
I remember when I was dying,

540
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,370
someone told me

541
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,020
that this was fate.

542
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,500
Master Jingming,

543
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,570
I've brought you here this time

544
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:04,660
to tell you

545
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,850
that I don't believe in fate.

546
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,620
I believe in human will
overcoming heaven's will.

547
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,260
I've decided to leave.

548
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:15,810
No one can stop me.

549
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:38,410
Master Jingming,

550
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,770
when a house has cracks,

551
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,420
even if you patch it with fresh clay,

552
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,420
it will not return
to its original state.

553
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,850
Let alone people's feelings.

554
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,700
This is between me and my wife.

555
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:56,860
Your wife?

556
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,130
You claim to be her husband,

557
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,970
but you didn't fulfill your duty.

558
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,220
How are you any better than me,

559
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,050
an outsider?

560
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,530
Mr. Chu, what do you mean?

561
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,420
Five years ago,

562
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,610
I passed by here

563
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,810
and met Jiangli
who's on the brink of death.

564
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,180
She hadn't eaten for days

565
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:23,810
and was pregnant.

566
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,170
Help...

567
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,050
Help me...

568
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,580
Help...

569
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,220
- Miss.
- Help me.

570
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,460
I'm from Wind Pavilion.

571
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,180
Help me...

572
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,660
Help...

573
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,980
- Don't worry.
- Help me.

574
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:47,970
I'll help you.

575
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,330
I have a child in my belly.

576
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,490
After I brought her back
to Wind Pavilion,

577
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,810
I found her body

578
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:01,930
was severely damaged.

579
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,260
The day she gave birth,

580
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,420
she hemorrhaged heavily.

581
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,390
Half of her foot had stepped

582
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,050
into the gates of hell.

583
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,180
All these years,

584
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,260
have you cared for her and Yanyan?

585
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,290
As you can see,

586
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,660
Jiangli has changed so much.

587
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:28,370
It's because she died once

588
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,260
and experienced the deepest despair.

589
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,780
Master Jingming,

590
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,570
a bird should fly freely.

591
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,130
She could have been a free goose.

592
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,020
Why

593
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,180
trap her beneath the eaves?

594
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,260
Why must she stay
in your little mansion?

595
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,570
Think about it.

596
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:03,580
♪The wind and moon
fall through our fingers♪

597
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,130
♪Like a dream that will return
to the starry night♪

598
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:09,850
♪The illusion is full of lies♪

599
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:14,000
♪Turning into cycles flowing in time♪

600
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,280
♪No one understands the sorrow
of the falling leaves♪

601
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:21,070
♪Soaked in despair,
spinning and falling♪

602
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:23,630
♪Time twists and overlaps♪

603
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:27,510
♪Yet it still remains cold♪

604
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,260
Young Master,

605
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,460
the nearest village

606
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,330
is over ten li away.

607
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,900
Did you leave early this morning?

608
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,610
Has Jiangli woken up?

609
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:02,460
Consort Jiangli and Mr. Chu left.

610
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:05,290
They left at dawn.

611
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,060
Are you okay?

612
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,540
Let go.

613
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:25,980
Otherwise, you'll die too.

614
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,330
Nonsense.

615
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,370
Hold on to me.

616
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,260
Are you crazy?

617
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,740
Are you okay?

618
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,050
I'm fine, and you?

619
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:43,850
You're fine?

620
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:44,900
Why didn't you let go

621
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,940
when I told you to?

622
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,780
You...

623
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,780
Are you okay?

624
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:53,650
Do you know

625
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:54,980
who sent the assassins?

626
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:56,220
Who else could it be?

627
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,900
Who'd stop us from going back?

628
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,810
That's obvious.

629
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,390
Sorry for dragging you down.

630
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:02,180
I don't blame you.

631
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,820
It seems

632
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,140
it's dangerous outside the city.

633
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:06,940
We need to return to the city asap.

634
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,060
Let's go.

635
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,500
Let's go.

636
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:19,140
(Dongzhou)

637
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,700
Go.

638
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,560
Alright.

639
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,900
It must be Consort Jiangli
in the carriage.

640
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,740
She just came back

641
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,770
and had so much trouble.

642
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,040
She must be having a hard time.

643
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:02,410
Consort Jiangli?

644
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:04,160
Who are you referring to?

645
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,970
You went home these months
so you don't know.

646
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,890
It's the consort
who were sent to the tomb.

647
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,870
- Yes.
- She's back.

648
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,210
What's going on?

649
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:14,600
- What happened to her?
- My Lady.

650
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:17,020
My Lady, wait for me!

651
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:31,970
Father,

652
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:33,800
on our way to find the chief,

653
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,730
Jiangli and I ran
into the true first disciple

654
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:38,170
of Wind Pavilion,

655
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:39,010
Chu Zimo.

656
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,300
So, we invited Mr. Chu here

657
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:42,780
to confront Lord Zhou.

658
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,300
Wind Pavilion disciples are well-versed

659
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,250
and skilled in various divination.

660
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,400
You claim

661
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:58,610
to be the chief's disciple.

662
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,250
What proof do you have?

663
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:13,820
What did you discover?

664
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,980
I discovered

665
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,940
the most confidential secret.

666
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,020
What secret?

667
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,940
This is your privacy.

668
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,140
How about

669
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:25,650
I just draw it out?

670
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,050
Give him paper and a brush.

671
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:56,300
What secret can you uncover

672
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:57,650
by drawing like that?

673
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,130
You're before the Prefect.

674
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:00,670
How can you just draw your wild guesses?

675
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,530
I just doodled.

676
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,530
If the Prefect can't understand it,

677
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:06,420
I can explain it.

678
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,780
No need.

679
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:09,420
I believe

680
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,420
you are indeed the chief's disciple.

681
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,250
My Lord, you can't trust him.

682
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,280
It's an easy trick.

683
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,300
I can also figure it out

684
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,440
with the Tianzhu Instrument.

685
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,020
I've never heard

686
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,090
that Mentor has a Tianzhu Instrument.

687
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,260
You're an impostor,

688
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,580
so of course, you won't admit it.

689
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:26,650
I simply disdain to use

690
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:28,460
such lowly tricks.

691
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,660
Yes.

692
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,940
Such tricks

693
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,460
don't even need Mr. Chu to intervene.

694
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,380
I can expose them myself.

695
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,310
Bring the Tianzhu Instrument here.

696
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,780
My Lord,

697
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:02,150
the principle of the instrument
is quite simple.

698
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:03,570
However,

699
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:06,340
I need something from Lord Zhou.

700
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,090
This...

701
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,380
Tianzhu Instrument,

702
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:14,780
please tell me

703
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,610
who framed Master Jingming.

704
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,250
- This...
- Father.

705
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,170
Shen Jiangli must've tampered with it.

706
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,020
How could I possibly frame Jingming?

707
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,340
Master Jingxiu,

708
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,250
you can convince everyone
that Master Jingming is a jinx

709
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,170
with this,

710
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:34,250
so why can't I use this to identify you

711
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,430
as the culprit?

712
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,780
Besides, with everyone watching,

713
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,130
how could I tamper with it?

714
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:41,860
My Lord,

715
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,530
this is not a gold ball at all.

716
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:46,010
It's an iron ball,

717
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:48,130
and this horsetail whisk is a magnet.

718
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,570
One end attracts the iron ball,

719
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,940
and the other

720
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,250
repels it.

721
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:54,530
This makes it easy

722
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:56,210
to control the ball.

723
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,300
Lord Zhou,

724
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,460
how dare you fake this,

725
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,420
deceive the Prefect,

726
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,980
and frame Master Jingming?

727
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:05,070
My Lord,

728
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,830
the horsetail whisk
and Tianzhu Instrument

729
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,940
must've been tampered with.

730
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,620
I understand now.

731
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,650
It must've been your trap.

732
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,660
Our trap?

733
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,890
With so many people here,
how could we set a trap?

734
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,690
Do you think we're fools

735
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,020
who can't see
through such a lowly method?

736
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,180
Zhou Daqi,

737
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,180
are you done with your act?

738
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,300
My Lord,

739
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:25,980
this man's real name is Zhou Daqi.

740
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:28,060
He was a street vendor
selling fake medicine,

741
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,570
using the name of Wind Pavilion

742
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,340
to swindle people along the way.

743
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,800
Unexpectedly,

744
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,050
he rose to power

745
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,160
and even became
the Director of Astrology.

746
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:37,900
Such a menace

747
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:39,780
must be removed.

748
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:40,860
Nonsense!

749
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:42,380
You shameless man.

750
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,340
How dare you slander me?

751
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,300
You've been posing as me

752
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,760
under my banner for all these years,

753
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,980
so of course, I've investigated you.

754
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:49,930
My Lord,

755
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,460
this man nearly caused a death

756
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,500
by selling fake medicine

757
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,210
and was then arrested,

758
