00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,860
(Zhao Huaiwei)

23
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,160
This girl is nice.

24
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,880
She looks gentle and agreeable.

25
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,070
And this Sun girl is nice too.

26
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,680
She looks well-educated.

27
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,630
I really don't know who to choose.

28
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,150
Dingxiang,

29
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,270
what do you think?

30
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,990
I dare not judge,

31
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,750
but if I may speak freely,

32
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,120
what matters most

33
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,260
is someone who can bear kids
for Master Jingxiu.

34
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,400
A fuller figure

35
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,640
usually means good fertility.

36
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,920
You've hit the nail on the head.

37
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,310
Shen Qilan just had a miscarriage.

38
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,630
She looks frail.

39
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,520
Who knows if she can conceive again?

40
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,710
Jingxiu

41
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,870
mustn't end up like Jingming.

42
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,680
Jingxiu can't have a barren consort.

43
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,710
Besides,

44
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,520
Shen Qilan is a concubine's daughter.

45
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,590
She's even worse than Shen Jiangli.

46
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,080
General Zhou's daughter is good.

47
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,230
She looks like the type
who'll give us sons.

48
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,120
I'll talk to Jingxiu tomorrow.

49
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,270
They think they can take advantage

50
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,720
just because Jingxiu hasn't found

51
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,920
a consort yet.

52
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,270
My son is the lineal eldest son.

53
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,800
How can they keep overshadowing him?

54
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,080
We must find Jingxiu a consort soon.

55
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,630
My Lady,

56
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,990
don't take Lady Wang's words to heart.

57
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,430
She doesn't know how well you
and Master Jingxiu get along.

58
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,750
He cherishes you dearly.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,120
No one can shake your place
in his heart.

60
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,990
Lady Wang has always despised
my background.

61
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,840
She's long wanted to find

62
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,680
a more suitable wife for Master Jingxiu,

63
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,150
but...

64
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,120
My Lady, are you worried

65
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,990
the future consort will be hard on you?

66
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,240
No matter who becomes the consort,

67
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,010
my life won't be easy.

68
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,480
However respectful and obedient I am,

69
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,360
I'll still be at someone's mercy.

70
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,120
My mother was right.

71
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,870
Once you become a concubine,

72
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,750
you'll always be a concubine.

73
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,870
Fuling,

74
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,080
I used to be naive.

75
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,140
I thought after I escaped
the Shen family,

76
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,940
I could just stay
by Master Jingxiu's side.

77
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,990
But it's not true.

78
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,590
In this vast Dongzhou,

79
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,430
who can I truly count on?

80
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,240
If I were the consort,

81
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,800
would Shen Jiangli

82
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,640
be wary of my status?

83
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,420
Would Master Jingxiu have stepped in

84
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,430
to keep my mother's life?

85
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,950
Would she still be alive?

86
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,720
I want to fight for a good future

87
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,240
for myself.

88
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,920
I want to fight for a good background

89
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,800
for my child.

90
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,150
It's because...

91
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,680
It's because I didn't stand high enough.

92
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,120
It's because I didn't stand high enough

93
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,640
that I've been looked down upon.

94
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,990
My Lady, what do you plan to do?

95
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,910
Jiangli.

96
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,720
Mother came by this afternoon?

97
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,630
Was it about Yanyan?

98
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,840
Yanyan's fine.

99
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,040
Luckily, Nanny Dong
and her grandson showed up.

100
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,190
We muddled through for now.

101
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,240
But if this keeps up,

102
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,480
I don't think we can
hide it much longer.

103
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,120
So, what are you thinking?

104
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,070
It's not the right time yet.

105
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,030
Maybe I should

106
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,310
take Yanyan back to Wind Pavilion.

107
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,120
Yanyan is

108
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,630
getting older.

109
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,630
We can't keep him

110
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,870
in Wind Pavilion forever.

111
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,030
How about this?

112
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,860
Father will go to the Big Buddha Temple

113
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,750
in a few days to pray.

114
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,600
Let's use that chance

115
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
to bring Yanyan along

116
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,390
and tell Father the truth.

117
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,160
If anything happens later,

118
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,390
I believe Father

119
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,840
will certainly protect Yanyan.

120
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,470
Alright.

121
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,120
Don't worry.

122
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,790
I'm here.

123
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,510
I'm Shen Qilan, a faithful woman.

124
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,680
All the gods above,

125
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,990
may my husband be safe and healthy.

126
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,120
May my husband's every wish come true.

127
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,430
May my husband live with no regrets.

128
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,710
I offer ten years of my life
in exchange.

129
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,550
I will pray for him every day.

130
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,000
Qilan.

131
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,060
- Master Jingxiu.
- What are you doing?

132
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,870
What are you doing?

133
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,270
Master Jingxiu.

134
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,070
Is there anything
you need to hide from me?

135
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,550
I never meant to hide anything from you.

136
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,680
It's just that a monk said

137
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,460
fingers are connected to the heart,

138
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,950
so this is the best way
to show sincerity to the gods.

139
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,760
I'm foolish.

140
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,510
There's nothing I can do to help you.

141
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,510
This was all I could think of.

142
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,430
Please don't blame me

143
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,670
for keeping it from you.

144
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,160
Why would I blame you?

145
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,310
You...

146
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,160
Why pray for me in this way?

147
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,520
I heard

148
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,960
the consort chosen by Lady Wang

149
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,280
is about to enter the mansion.

150
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,830
I'm afraid I'll never get the chance

151
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,160
to serve you again.

152
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,950
It's all my fault.

153
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,720
I failed to protect the child.

154
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,920
So, I hope

155
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,310
the consort will arrive soon

156
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,240
and bear heirs for you.

157
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,750
I only wish you get everything you want.

158
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,280
I'm willing to pray for you
and the consort

159
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,390
every day.

160
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,440
Qilan,

161
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,990
of course, I know you love me.

162
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,200
Don't let those rumors outside

163
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,430
trouble you.

164
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,920
I'll take care of everything.

165
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,390
You are the only one

166
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,190
I can rely on in this life.

167
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,390
I will do whatever you say.

168
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,510
It's late and cold.

169
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,170
Come back with me to treat your wounds.

170
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,280
Yes.

171
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,270
My Lady,

172
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,990
Physician Luo
and Physician Gao are here.

173
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,950
Thank you both for coming.

174
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:33,910
Please have a seat.

175
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,200
Lady Shu, how have you been lately?

176
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,120
I've been unwell,
so I asked you to come.

177
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,240
Lately,

178
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,390
I've been short of breath.

179
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,560
It's very uncomfortable.

180
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,240
Allow me to check your pulse first.

181
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,320
Thank you.

182
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,920
Lady Shu,

183
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,240
you are weighed down by worries.

184
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,490
Your heart's energy is blocked.

185
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:56,720
You'll need

186
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,480
proper rest in the coming days.

187
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,670
Physician, you have no idea.

188
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,880
There are so many matters

189
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,710
in the mansion.

190
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,840
How could I have time to rest?

191
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,400
Disciple,

192
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,480
treat Lady Shu with acupuncture.

193
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,160
Lady Shu,

194
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,510
I'll begin your treatment.

195
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,030
Please give me your hand.

196
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,670
The acupuncture

197
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,630
will clear your heart's stagnation

198
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,510
and boost your energy.

199
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,720
Lady Shu, you're too worried.

200
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,700
What is troubling you so?

201
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,150
Physician, you don't know.

202
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,960
One trouble follows another.

203
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,320
Not just my health.

204
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,630
You have no idea.

205
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,320
My son, Jingming,

206
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,760
after all these years,

207
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,240
still hasn't

208
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,440
had an heir.

209
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,390
Could it be

210
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,910
his body...?

211
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,120
Lady Shu, you needn't worry.

212
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,950
Master Jingming is naturally strong

213
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,480
with ample vitality.

214
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,240
There's no issue with fertility.

215
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,150
If he wants a child,

216
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,120
he'll have one.

217
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,600
Physician,

218
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,870
that's wonderful.

219
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,240
Your words put my mind at ease.

220
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,910
I finally

221
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,960
feel relieved.

222
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,510
No need to worry, Lady Shu.

223
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,550
Since you're doing better,

224
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,840
my disciple and I will take our leave.

225
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,710
Dongmei, see them out.

226
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,390
Physician,

227
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,180
could you also

228
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,430
prescribe a couple of formulas

229
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,390
for Jingming

230
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,480
to nourish his body?

231
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,550
Or maybe

232
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,240
acupuncture as well?

233
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:59,620
(Big Buddha Temple)

234
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,030
You don't need to follow me.

235
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,710
- I'll take a walk.
- Yes.

236
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,030
Stop it. Be careful on the steps.

237
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,510
Slow down. Slow down.

238
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,990
Come on, sit there.

239
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,800
Come on.

240
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,910
Mother, where did Mr. Cute go?

241
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,510
Why isn't he back yet?

242
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,360
Yanyan, just be patient.

243
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,080
Sir,

244
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,670
excuse me.

245
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,630
Do you know when the Prefect
will arrive?

246
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,640
Ma'am,

247
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,510
the Prefect has just arrived
at the gate.

248
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,120
Will you

249
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,670
be dining here?

250
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,870
No, thank you, sir.

251
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,990
Amitabha.

252
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,960
Yanyan?

253
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,960
Yanyan?

254
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:15,540
(Hall of Heavenly King)

255
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,560
May the Bodhisattva bless me.

256
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,120
Ancestors of the Lu family above,

257
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,790
please bless Dongzhou with good weather.

258
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,150
I will do good deeds

259
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:55,030
and devote myself
to the people of Dongzhou.

260
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,400
Who's there?

261
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,790
Little kitten,

262
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,310
how did you end up here

263
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,400
having food?

264
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,990
I was too hungry.

265
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,080
Who did you come with?

266
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,120
I came with my mother.

267
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,750
Your mother?

268
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,630
Who else is visiting the temple today?

269
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,560
Yanyan?

270
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,710
Yanyan?

271
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,680
Yanyan?

272
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,200
Yanyan?

273
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,110
Jiangli.

274
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,840
What happened?

275
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,320
I was talking to a monk.

276
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,150
When I turned around, Yanyan was gone.

277
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,320
Don't worry.

278
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,200
He probably

279
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,360
hasn't gone far.

280
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,390
Let's go.

281
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,390
Let's go look.

282
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,350
Yanyan?

283
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,360
Sir, are you making a wish
to the Bodhisattva?

284
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,870
Can the Bodhisattva really hear us?

285
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,550
Of course.

286
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,270
Sincerity brings blessings.

287
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,670
Bodhisattva, I'm sorry.

288
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,360
I didn't mean to eat your offerings.

289
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,240
I hope you can be happy every day

290
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,830
and eat tasty things

291
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:13,960
every day.

292
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,080
Others pray for themselves,

293
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,870
but you pray for the Bodhisattva.

294
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,180
You might be the only one
in the world who does that.

295
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,990
Yanyan.

296
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,710
Yanyan.

297
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,670
My Lord. Yanyan.

298
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,510
Yanyan,

299
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,360
you scared me to death.

300
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,080
Yanyan, how did you end up here?

301
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,670
I was hungry.

302
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,800
Father,

303
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,600
why are you here alone?

304
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,440
I came up by myself.

305
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,120
Who is this child?

306
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,800
His name is Yanyan.

307
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,750
He's my child with Jiangli.

308
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,460
When Jiangli was sent
to the ancestral tomb,

309
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,560
she had to give birth
to Yanyan alone there.

310
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,320
All these years,

311
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,510
it's my fault I didn't care for them.

312
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,160
So,

313
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,600
I brought them back now

314
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,030
to look after them.

315
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,960
Since Yanyan was back, he'd been unwell.

316
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,060
Jiangli and I didn't want you to worry

317
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,360
so we kept it

318
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,120
from you.

319
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,960
Please don't blame us.

320
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,920
This...

321
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,390
Is this truly my grandson?

322
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,960
Yes.

323
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,440
Come on.

324
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,560
Come here.

325
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,920
Come on.

326
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,120
Go on. Call him Grandfather.

327
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,150
Grandfather.

328
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,440
Let me hold you.

329
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,390
The heavens have blessed us.

330
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,750
I have a grandson.

331
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,320
I have a grandson now.

332
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,590
Don't cry.

333
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,870
Mother said we need
to stay happy to be healthy.

334
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,750
I'm not crying.

335
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,790
I'm just so happy.

336
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,430
No wonder I liked you

337
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,390
the moment I saw you.

338
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,870
As it turns out, you're my grandson.

339
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,350
Good, good.

340
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,030
We'll pick a good day

341
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,600
to announce Yanyan's identity.

342
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,920
My Lord,

343
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,200
the envoys from Xizhou are coming.

344
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,910
The city is full of strangers.

345
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,390
I fear

346
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,960
this isn't the right time.

347
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,200
Yes, Father.

348
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,560
Jiangli is right.

349
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,870
Right now,

350
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,190
Xizhou's attitude toward us

351
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,270
is uncertain.

352
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,990
The situation is tense.

353
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,560
If we announce Yanyan's identity now,

354
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,960
it may bring trouble instead of peace.

355
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,710
So, Father,

356
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,160
please

357
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,320
keep it secret for now.

358
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,150
You're the only one who knows.

359
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,510
Even your mother can't know this?

360
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,270
Please help us with this.

361
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,870
Fine.

362
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,400
Knowing your mother,

363
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,440
if she finds out,

364
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,760
the four states will know

365
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,120
she has a grandson.

366
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,630
Let's wait until everything is settled.

367
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,360
Come on. Give me a kiss.

368
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
Wonderful.

369
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:58,870
Truly wonderful.

370
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,040
Mother.

371
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,590
Jingxiu,

372
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,010
you've come at the perfect time.

373
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,030
Come and sit.

374
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,520
Look at these.

375
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,040
These days, I've picked out the best

376
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,870
from all the noble ladies

377
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,390
for you.

378
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,630
Look.

379
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,630
General Zhou's daughter

380
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,240
has a full figure

381
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,510
and is well-educated.

382
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:23,000
She's the perfect choice
for your consort.

383
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,880
Mother,

384
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,120
I've made my decision.

385
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,960
Who has caught your eye?

386
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,280
I'll go talk to her myself.

387
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,510
Qilan.

388
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,160
I've decided

389
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,840
to make Qilan my consort.

390
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,080
What?

391
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,440
Impossible.

392
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,600
With her background,

393
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,040
how can she be your consort?

394
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,920
She's lucky

395
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,080
to even be a concubine.

396
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,550
Mother,

397
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,030
Wang is General Wang's only daughter.

398
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,360
She's from a noble lineage.

399
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,360
But what came of that?

400
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,120
Since she entered the mansion,

401
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,110
she's been reckless and willful,

402
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,950
bringing me endless trouble,

403
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,440
and making my position
in court difficult.

404
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,440
Because of her,

405
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,430
General Wang bears resentment toward me.

406
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,000
I married her

407
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,800
to gain support,

408
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,080
but it's backfired.

409
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,310
If General Zhou's daughter

410
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,360
turns out the same,

411
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,550
should I risk alienating

412
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,630
General Zhou too?

413
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,210
Mother,

414
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,150
how can I rule Dongzhou

415
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,150
that way?

416
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:29,750
Mother,

417
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,120
I may be speaking too much today,

418
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,800
but I only want you to understand

419
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,530
every move we make
affects the entire situation.

420
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,320
From now on, we must

421
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,190
consider every step carefully.

422
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,390
Fine, I didn't think it through.

423
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,360
Mother,

424
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,950
Qilan is gentle and considerate

425
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,840
and always has my best interests
at heart.

426
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,280
She is the best choice

427
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,910
for my consort.

428
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,950
Very well.

429
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,760
We'll do as you say.

430
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,360
Thank you, Mother.

431
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,520
So, she got what she wanted.

432
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,030
My Lady,

433
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,550
Master Jingxiu must've

434
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,870
made his decision after careful thought.

435
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,840
True.

436
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,840
My son sees the bigger picture.

437
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,190
Let's follow his lead.

438
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,790
Shen, from a noble family,

439
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,040
is gentle and virtuous.

440
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,840
By the will of the Prefect,

441
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:35,150
she's granted to be
Master Jingxiu's consort.

442
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,600
I hereby thank the Prefect.

443
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,320
Lady Wang, thank you for your kindness.

444
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,080
I will do my utmost
to serve Master Jingxiu

445
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,840
and bring him an heir soon.

446
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,870
You're not Jingxiu's wife,

447
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,110
and there should be a ceremony for this.

448
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,000
But with the Peace Banquet coming,

449
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,520
we don't have time
for all the proper rites.

450
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,430
It's unfair to you.

451
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,080
Please don't say that.

452
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,230
I don't mind at all.

453
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,920
As long as I can stay
by Master Jingxiu's side

454
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,830
and share his burdens,

455
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,910
nothing else matters to me.

456
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,470
How thoughtful of you.

457
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,080
At the banquet,
you must show your best side.

458
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,760
Don't let Shen Jiangli outshine you.

459
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,030
I will

460
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,120
remember that.

461
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,320
Remember what I said.

462
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,870
Goodbye, Mother.

463
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,000
Lady Wang is just bullying you.

464
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,230
How much would a ceremony cost?

465
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,400
She just doesn't want
to prepare it for you.

466
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,360
Yeah.

467
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,560
She's always looked down on me.

468
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,880
But honestly,

469
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,080
I don't care about those formalities.

470
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,120
As long as I can secure
my position as consort,

471
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,590
not only will I stay

472
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,670
with Master Jingxiu forever,

473
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,190
but I can stand on equal footing

474
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,000
with Shen Jiangli.

475
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:11,790
Jiangli,

476
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,630
when we meet in the future,

477
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,230
you'll have to show me some respect.

478
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,790
My Lady,

479
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,430
I heard that the Prefect just went out.

480
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,550
What?

481
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,000
He's gone again?

482
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,040
He's been going out every day lately.

483
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,910
Do you know what it's about?

484
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,630
No, I don't.

485
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:41,990
Prepare the carriage.

486
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,240
I'm going to find out

487
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,760
what's happening outside

488
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,470
that's making him go out every day.

489
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,920
- Let's go.
- Yes.

490
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,120
Trinkets!

491
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:54,950
How about a candied fruit?

492
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,710
Take a look. We have everything.

493
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:00,620
(Zuixian Tavern)

494
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,400
Let's go.

495
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,230
Yanyan,

496
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,560
look at what I brought you.

497
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,070
There must be sweet dates I love.

498
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,910
Oh, you smell it.

499
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,440
These are all for you.

500
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,840
Take whatever you like.

501
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,790
Yanyan,

502
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,680
eat less.

503
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,330
Don't you want to eat

504
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,350
the steamed fish
your mother made for you?

505
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,910
I can eat it all.

506
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,390
Yanyan, look at your little belly.

507
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,770
You've been eating too much lately.

508
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,920
Children are growing.

509
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,080
It's a good thing he can eat.

510
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,200
My grandson is so well-behaved

511
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,480
and so cute.

512
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,080
You're so adorable.

513
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,130
Everyone's here.

514
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,680
Why are you here?

515
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,800
Why can't I be here?

516
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,470
Whose child is this?

517
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,950
I'm here to play with Grandfather.

518
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,390
Yanyan, call her Grandmother.

519
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,960
This...

520
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,440
Is this

521
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,790
Jingming's child?

522
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,680
Mother,

523
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,640
his name is Yanyan.

524
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,430
He's my child with Jiangli.

525
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,830
Actually,

526
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,840
Jiangli gave birth to him outside.

527
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,040
My Lord, when did you find out?

528
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,150
Not long ago.

529
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,190
Good for you.

530
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,670
How could I not know such big news?

531
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,670
I told you before, didn't I?

532
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,550
I've longed

533
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,280
for a good grandson.

534
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,910
I even told you this.

535
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,550
But now,

536
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,680
you're all here,

537
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,280
enjoying family bliss,

538
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,840
and completely forgot about me.

539
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,470
Mother,

540
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,640
please don't be angry.

541
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,680
This

542
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,680
was my decision.

543
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,120
Don't blame Jiangli.

544
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,600
Shut up.

545
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,800
Please, Grandmother.

546
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,350
Don't be so harsh with Mother

547
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,470
and Mr. Cute,

548
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,710
okay?

549
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,790
You...

550
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,350
What did you call me?

551
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,230
Grandmother, Grandmother.

552
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,520
My sweet grandson.

553
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,360
You're so sweet.

554
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:20,240
Alright, I'll do whatever you say.

555
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,560
I'm not angry anymore.

556
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,600
Come on, eat this.

557
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,920
Look at him.

558
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,150
The way he eats

559
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,860
is just like Jingming
when he was little.

560
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,680
So cute and lovable.

561
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,550
Alright.

562
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,110
You've met your grandson.

563
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,160
It's getting late.

564
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,480
Let Jingming and Jiangli

565
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,910
take Yanyan back.

566
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,430
Yanyan is leaving now?

567
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,510
Mother,

568
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,510
actually,

569
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,670
we thought of the upcoming

570
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,000
Peace Banquet.

571
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,620
Besides, the situation in the city

572
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,600
is still unstable.

573
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,630
For Yanyan's safety,

574
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,120
we decided to keep his identity
hidden for now.

575
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,270
But...

576
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,120
But I've just met my grandson.

577
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,790
You'll have plenty of time
to be with him.

578
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:07,470
We must prioritize Yanyan's safety now.

579
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,630
Mother, are you okay?

580
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:13,710
I'm feeling chest pain.

581
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,600
I feel unwell.

582
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,840
Mother.

583
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,440
Mother?

584
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,070
Yanyan,

585
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,030
go.

586
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,510
Go on.

587
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,200
Grandmother,

588
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,040
are you feeling better?

589
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,840
As long as you're with me,

590
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,800
I'm perfectly fine.

591
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,520
Mother, since you're fine,

592
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,870
I'll take Jiangli and Yanyan back now.

593
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:02,910
No.

594
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,040
My chest hurts so much.

595
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,640
Look.

596
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,000
Every time I think about the years

597
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,390
I've been away

598
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,950
from my sweet grandson,

599
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,920
I feel guilty,

600
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,560
and my chest just aches.

601
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,910
I'm Yanyan's grandmother.

602
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,120
How can you treat me like this?

603
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,870
What do you take me for?

604
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,080
I'm in so much pain.

605
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,870
Grandmother, what's wrong?

606
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,910
Why are you crying?

607
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,120
Who's bullying you?

608
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,870
I'll help you get revenge.

609
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,720
They are.

610
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,710
They've teamed up to bully me.

611
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:49,080
They want to take you away from me.

612
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,150
They want to separate us.

613
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,520
I'm torn between my mother

614
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,350
and my grandmother.

615
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:58,030
I love you both so much.

616
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,470
It really puts me in a hard position.

617
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:03,150
Grandmother, how about I kiss you?

618
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,510
Alright, Grandmother.

619
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,950
You're not angry now, right?

620
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,760
I'm not angry anymore.

621
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,230
I'm not angry at all.

622
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,320
Alright, alright.

623
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,350
Your grandson is so concerned
about you.

624
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,800
Just stop making a scene.

625
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,320
So what?

626
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,840
You knew you had this grandson,

627
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,710
but I didn't know.

628
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:27,320
You've all teamed up to deceive me.

629
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,240
I'm so sad.

630
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,000
You don't understand me at all.

631
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,790
Please calm down.

632
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,680
We did

633
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,640
ignore your feelings.

634
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,910
Of course.

635
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,880
None of you can take Yanyan away.

636
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,800
Don't take him away from me.

637
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:44,760
But...

638
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,320
There's no but.

639
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,480
I think

640
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,350
we should announce

641
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,360
my grandson's identity now

642
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,760
and let everyone know

643
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,600
who the eldest grandson
of the Prefect is.

644
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,670
My Lord, what do you think?

645
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,830
You're making a point.

646
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,150
Then it's settled.

647
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,440
Jiangli,

648
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,000
you go to work.

649
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,350
I'll dedicate all my time

650
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,120
to taking care of my grandson.

651
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:14,390
I won't let him suffer
the slightest grievance.

652
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,560
Actually,

653
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,520
if Yanyan's identity is made public,

654
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,560
and he stays in the Prefect's Mansion,

655
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,710
that'd be the best protection for him.

656
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,400
What do you think?

657
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,880
Yanyan,

658
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:32,640
would you like to live

659
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,870
at my house?

660
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,720
I'll make you

661
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,190
delicious cakes every day.

662
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,630
Everything is up to Yanyan.

663
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,350
I want to stay with Grandmother.

664
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:48,070
I've stayed with Mr. Cute, Mother,

665
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:51,150
and Grandfather so many times,

666
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:54,320
but I've never stayed with Grandmother.

667
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:57,120
Mr. Cute?

668
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,200
Mother.

669
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,470
Yanyan's still too young.

670
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,950
He doesn't know

671
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,000
I am...

672
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,040
I know.

673
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,760
I know everything.

674
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,950
I know Mr. Cute is my father,

675
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,230
but I can only call him that
if Mother agrees.

676
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,780
My grandson is so smart.

677
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,000
You're so clever.

678
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,390
Jiangli,

679
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,910
why don't you let Yanyan...

680
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,270
Yanyan,

681
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,910
call him Father.

682
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,750
Father.

683
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,800
You're being generous.

684
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,630
Jiangli.

685
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,160
Come on.

686
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,750
Come here.

687
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,070
Jiangli,

688
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,790
the Prefect's mother gave me this

689
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,270
when Jingming was born.

690
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,240
Now,

691
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,840
I'm passing it to you.

692
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,600
Thank you, Lady Shu.

693
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,160
Are you

694
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,080
still angry about the past?

695
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,160
Jiangli,

696
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,800
time to change your address.

697
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,870
Thank you, Mother.

698
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:26,790
Good.

699
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:28,990
Good.

700
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,760
In that case, Mother, rest well.

701
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,870
Take care of Yanyan for us.

702
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:37,870
We'll leave now.

703
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,270
Go ahead.

704
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,110
Grandmother,

705
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,320
your illness healed so quickly?

706
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,590
Of course.

707
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,280
It's because you're by my side.

708
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,360
Come on, tell me.

709
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,280
What do you like to eat?

710
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,800
What do you like to play?

711
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,510
My sweet grandson,

712
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,120
I've missed you so much.

713
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,000
I know

714
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,760
you're still worried

715
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,560
if we reveal Yanyan's identity now.

716
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,520
But Mother...

717
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,910
I can understand her feelings.

718
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,600
It's just...

719
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,960
Jiangli,

720
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,630
I know you still have some concerns.

721
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,960
I've thought this over

722
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,880
many times.

723
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,000
But right now, the Prefect's Mansion

724
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,240
is actually the safest place

725
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,360
for Yanyan.

726
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:33,710
Think about it.

727
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,360
If we reveal his identity

728
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,520
and include him
in the family's genealogy,

729
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,330
it's also a form of protection.

730
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,570
Anyone who dares

731
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,150
to harm the Prefect's eldest grandson

732
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:45,570
will have to face the consequences.

733
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,270
I understand now.

734
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,270
Come on.

735
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,200
Mother,

736
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:05,120
I brought you your favorite
mung bean cake today.

737
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,550
I've been

738
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,150
made a consort,

739
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,600
but it's too late.

740
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,630
I couldn't let you see it.

741
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,040
But don't worry, Mother.

742
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,310
No one

743
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,560
will bully me anymore.

744
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,420
(Tomb of Late Mother, Zou Jiaoyue)

745
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,910
My Lady,

746
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,360
you still have me.

747
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,560
It's freezing cold in the mountains.

748
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,000
Let's head back now.

749
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,550
Mother,

750
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,430
I'll visit you next time.

751
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,190
Congratulations.

752
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,630
Congrats, Lady Shu,
on having a grandson.

753
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,470
Congratulations, Lady Shu.

754
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,950
The Prefect has an heir now.

755
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,600
This is a blessing for Dongzhou.

756
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,360
Lady Wang is here.

757
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:06,520
Master Jingxiu
and Consort Qilan are here.

758
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,080
Jinyi, hello.

759
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,560
Congratulations, Xiulan.

760
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,760
Your grandson came so suddenly,

761
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,430
so I didn't have time to prepare a gift.

762
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,240
When Qilan was pregnant,

763
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,040
I went to the temple

764
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,560
to ask for this jade pendant.

765
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,680
Unfortunately, this child

766
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,120
isn't fortunate enough,

767
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,800
so I'll pass it on to you now.

768
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,120
Raising a child can't be easy.

769
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,070
This jade pendant

770
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,360
will ensure peace and safety.

771
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,000
Thank you, Jinyi.

772
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,720
Don't worry.

773
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,280
Yanyan is my life.

774
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,710
As long as I'm here,

775
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,760
no one can harm him.

776
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,430
Grandmother.

777
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,350
My sweet grandson,

778
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,840
I've missed you so much.

779
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,830
Come, Yanyan. This is also

780
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,390
your grandmother.

781
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,110
Who is she?

782
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,550
I don't know her.

783
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,320
I don't want to call her.

784
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,150
Yanyan, how old are you?

785
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,880
Jinyi,

786
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,520
Yanyan gets scared
when he sees strangers.

787
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,830
Please don't take it to heart.

788
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,920
It's fine.

789
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,630
Yanyan is really smart.

790
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,980
This must be
the Prefect's eldest grandson.

791
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,830
He has the same charm
as Master Jingming when he was young.

792
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,920
How adorable.

793
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,700
Please go take a seat.

794
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,750
Today, Yanyan is staying with me.

795
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,840
Be good, okay?

796
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,440
You're Shen Jiangli's sister,

797
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,750
yet you didn't even know

798
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,080
she has such a big child?

799
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,710
Jiangli is cautious.

800
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,080
Even the Shen family

801
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,400
has never heard of this child.

802
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:47,480
I hope he's not an illegitimate child.

803
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,830
Princess Qingqing is here.

804
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,550
Yanyan, look.

805
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,670
These are all new clothes

806
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,000
I made for you.

807
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,960
Do you like them?

808
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,440
Thank you, Aunt.

809
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,190
Yanyan is so cute.

810
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,400
Go take a seat now.

811
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,630
Yanyan,

812
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,350
look at what gift

813
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,400
I've brought you.

814
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,480
Uncle Jingxing, Aunt Yao, you're back.

815
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,710
Let me see if you've gained weight.

816
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,520
Today is the day when Yanyan

817
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,230
can openly call me Aunt.

818
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,360
Look at what I've brought you.

819
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,960
Aren't you going to thank Aunt Yao?

820
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,190
Thank you, Aunt Yao.

821
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,110
You're so cute.

822
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,600
The Prefect is here.

823
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:25,670
Come here.

824
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,200
Yanyan,

825
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,440
you should call me Grandfather.

826
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,360
Grandfather.

827
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,630
You're so good.

828
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,600
Let's go; we'll sit up front.

829
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,840
Come on.

830
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,230
Take a seat.

831
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,510
Are you happy?

832
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,400
Here,

833
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,830
I'd like to announce something.

834
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,230
From today,

835
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,400
Yanyan

836
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,120
will be entered
into the family genealogy.

837
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,480
His name is Lu Zhaoyan.

838
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:56,120
Father, thank you for the name.

839
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,480
Thank you, Grandfather.

840
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,310
I like this name.

841
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,000
I'm glad you like it.

842
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,750
Today, my eldest grandson Lu Zhaoyan

843
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,230
is meeting everyone for the first time

844
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,520
on this joyous day.

845
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:12,920
Let's all raise a glass.

846
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,790
Congratulations, My Lord.

847
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,280
Congratulations, Xiulan.

848
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,600
Thank you, Jinyi.

849
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,240
Yanyan,

850
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:40,670
I invited Mr. Song to teach you.

851
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,150
From now on,

852
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,350
you'll study hard with Mr. Song

853
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,230
and take on your responsibility.

854
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,480
Thank you, Grandfather.

855
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:57,400
Good child, come here.

856
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,670
Have some dessert.

857
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,630
Good.

858
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,830
Jiangli, Yanyan is becoming
cuter and cuter.

859
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,480
Come on, cheers.

860
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,280
One more drink.

861
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,920
Come on.

862
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,920
Are you happy?

863
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,270
Yes.

864
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,440
Jiangli, congratulations.

865
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,400
Thank you, Qilan.

866
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,720
Come on.

867
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,000
Congratulations, Jingming.

868
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,150
Thanks, Jingxiu.

869
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:23,960
Come on.

870
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,080
Let's drink.

871
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,000
Yanyan, are you happy today?

872
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,350
Everyone, you may leave now.

873
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,110
Jiangli, you're so fortunate.

874
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,190
You gave us

875
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,560
such a sweet grandson.

876
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,150
He's just like Jingming
when he was young.

877
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,520
Today is truly a happy day.

878
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,710
Yanyan is simply too adorable.

879
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,630
Let's go.

880
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,440
Wang Danling is useless.

881
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,790
You must show some spirit

882
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,880
and produce children for Jingxiu soon.

883
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,560
Without children,

884
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,710
they'll always be suppressing us.

885
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,480
I'll remember this.
