22
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,050
Mr. Chu,

23
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,770
I've picked a gift for you.

24
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,930
Thank you for healing my scar.

25
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,690
I've put it here for you.

26
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:09,690
You travel far and wide

27
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,100
for the people of the world.

28
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,170
I hope

29
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,170
this small water pouch

30
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,610
can provide you with some comfort

31
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,730
during your long journeys.

32
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,530
Qilan.

33
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,730
Here, try this.

34
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:32,850
It's prepared for you.

35
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,160
If you like sour food,
it means it's a boy.

36
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,700
Eat more.

37
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,820
It's delicious.

38
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,780
It's a boy.

39
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,340
Come on. Eat up.

40
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,980
Here, try this.

41
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,180
Try this.

42
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,330
Qilan.

43
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,060
Eat more fruit.

44
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,100
The braised pork is
Master Jingxiu's favorite.

45
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,020
Let him eat it.

46
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,980
It's just braised pork.

47
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,420
Danling,

48
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,540
the way you're speaking now

49
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,180
is becoming more inappropriate.

50
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,740
Sorry for speaking out of turn.

51
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,300
It's okay.

52
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,860
Lady Lan,

53
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,300
the antiabortifacient is ready.

54
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,930
Qilan, drink it while it's hot.

55
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,080
Be careful not to burn yourself.

56
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,780
Master Jingxiu, you eat too.

57
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,100
No rush.

58
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,360
Try this.

59
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,140
My son will surely like this,

60
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,180
just like me.

61
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,740
What's wrong?

62
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,180
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong, Qilan?

63
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,540
My belly...

64
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,490
Your belly?

65
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,340
Qilan.

66
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,100
- I didn't.
- My belly...

67
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,580
Call the physician!

68
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,420
Yes.

69
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,220
Qilan...

70
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,660
How is it?

71
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,740
How is the baby?

72
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,420
Lady Wang,

73
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,020
Master Jingxiu,

74
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,260
I'm afraid

75
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,100
Lady Lan

76
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,620
had a miscarriage.

77
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,040
- What?
- What?

78
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,620
What?

79
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,700
Consort Danling...

80
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,700
Consort Danling, why harm me?

81
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,220
What are you saying?

82
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,180
How could I harm you?

83
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,700
I was fine.

84
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,260
Why did I lose the child after taking

85
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,100
your antiabortifacient?

86
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,140
Yes.

87
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,340
Qilan drank your medicine

88
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,500
and had a miscarriage.

89
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,820
What exactly happened?

90
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,900
Master Jingxiu,

91
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,380
I'm innocent.

92
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,860
How could I be foolish enough

93
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,100
to poison her in front of everyone?

94
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,420
Shen Qilan,

95
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,620
I've treated you with so much care.

96
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,340
Why repay me with hatred

97
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,660
and frame me like this?

98
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,980
That's not true, Lady Wang.

99
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,460
Consort Danling

100
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,500
has always disliked Lady Lan.

101
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,900
Not long ago,

102
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,100
she made Lady Lan kneel
until she fainted,

103
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,420
claiming it was the rule.

104
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,060
Outrageous!

105
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,920
You have no place to speak here.

106
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,420
Master Jingxiu,

107
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,820
Mother,

108
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,940
she's twisting the truth.

109
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,140
Don't believe her.

110
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,900
I'm not twisting the truth.

111
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,490
Lady Wang, if you don't believe me,

112
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,770
you can ask the other servants
in the mansion.

113
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:02,940
I...

114
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,230
Qilan.

115
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,980
- I've always been careful.
- Qilan.

116
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,340
I've been careful with my food.

117
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,460
Consort Danling

118
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,500
brought the antiabortifacient to me.

119
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,220
Mother,

120
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,060
you have to stand up for me.

121
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,180
Please believe me.

122
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,060
Don't walk into others' traps.

123
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:26,980
In that case,

124
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,900
bring the private physician here.

125
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,100
Whether you've poisoned her

126
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,620
will be clear then.

127
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,260
Yes.

128
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,860
My child...

129
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,900
(Master Jingxiu's Mansion)

130
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,580
Jingxiu, don't worry.

131
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,540
This physician is the one

132
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,140
who normally treats your father.

133
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,420
I've invited him today

134
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,460
to find out

135
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,100
who wanted my grandson's life.

136
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,300
Lady Wang,

137
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,140
Master Jingming,

138
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,700
someone altered the formula

139
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,820
for Lady Lan's antiabortifacient,

140
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,540
turning it into an antiabortifacient,

141
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,300
causing Qilan to miscarry.

142
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,900
You've always been in charge

143
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,460
of Qilan's antiabortifacient.

144
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,420
The physician has said so.

145
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,460
What can you say in your defense?

146
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,500
Mother,

147
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,580
are you suspecting me?

148
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,340
It's not me.

149
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,780
Master Jingxiu, believe me.

150
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,900
How could I

151
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,060
harm your child?

152
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,660
Master Jingxiu...

153
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,020
Fine.

154
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,540
Then explain to us

155
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,580
what happened.

156
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,420
- I...
- It was me.

157
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,220
Lady Wang, Young Master,

158
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,520
- It was me.
- You have no place to speak here!

159
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,260
Speak!

160
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,500
I had increased

161
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,060
the dosage of the antiabortifacient.

162
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,060
But I only wanted

163
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,660
to make the baby stronger

164
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,020
so I added more.

165
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,740
I checked the dosage with a physician.

166
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,460
Nothing should've gone wrong.

167
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,820
It must be Shen Qilan.

168
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,100
She must've eaten something bad

169
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,640
and framed me with the miscarriage.

170
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,460
I see.

171
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,100
Lady Lan's pulse

172
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,260
tells me she's weak.

173
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,540
With that dosage,

174
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,420
she'd surely have a miscarriage.

175
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,540
What more do you have to say?

176
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,420
You poisonous woman!

177
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,660
This is the Prefect's eldest grandson!

178
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:44,980
Mother,

179
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,260
I meant well.

180
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,140
I could never harm
Master Jingxiu's child!

181
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,180
Let the physician leave.

182
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,220
Lady Wang,

183
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,700
Master Jingxiu,

184
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,300
this

185
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,620
is of great importance.

186
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,940
I dare not hide anything.

187
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,120
I will report it truthfully
to the Prefect.

188
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,460
Master Jingxiu, Lady Wang,

189
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,580
I beg you.

190
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,820
Please be fair to Lady Lan.

191
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,740
These days,

192
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,140
Consort Danling has been
making things hard for her.

193
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,860
She had to review the ledgers
late at night

194
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,980
and would be punished
even for the slightest mistake.

195
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,840
I didn't.

196
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,060
- She had to kneel on the abacus.
- I didn't.

197
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,500
As a maid, even I couldn't handle it.

198
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,040
Lady Lan was even pregnant.

199
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,540
- And this antiabortifacient.
- I didn't.

200
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,100
Consort Danling

201
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,420
must've plotted

202
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,540
to cause this miscarriage.

203
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,460
Is this true?

204
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,500
Mother,

205
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,320
please don't believe her nonsense.

206
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,620
Shen Qilan begged me.

207
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,060
She asked me to teach her

208
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,880
how to manage the household

209
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,740
so I agreed.

210
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,220
I never expected her
to twist my intentions,

211
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,540
accusing me of targeting her.

212
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,740
She's overestimated herself.

213
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,420
She's a concubine's daughter
from a humble family.

214
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,220
So what if she has a child?

215
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,740
Even without a child,

216
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,500
I'm still the general's lineal daughter

217
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,900
and Master Jingxiu's wife.

218
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,200
Why should I bother to plot against her?

219
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,780
I think what happened today

220
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,300
is part of her plan to play the victim

221
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,180
and frame me.

222
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,380
Are you saying

223
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,820
she used her child to frame me?

224
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,940
What kind of mother

225
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,860
would risk her child's life?

226
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,020
Mother,

227
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,300
you don't understand.

228
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,700
Women of low birth

229
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,980
like her

230
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,860
often pretend to be subservient.

231
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,560
She's known since she was young

232
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,600
that she had to suffer
to get something better.

233
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,380
My child...

234
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,220
Qilan...

235
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,740
Qilan, I'm here.

236
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,060
My child...

237
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,140
Master Jingxiu.

238
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,380
Master Jingxiu,

239
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,780
I just dreamed about our child.

240
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,060
He looked adorable,

241
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,940
just like you.

242
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,340
Our child

243
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,100
was so smart.

244
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,580
He could call us at a young age.

245
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,240
I also dreamed...

246
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,020
I dreamed that our child

247
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,620
loved his grandparents.

248
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,780
When the Prefect held him,

249
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,580
he grabbed the Prefect's beard

250
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,700
and made the Prefect laugh.

251
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,060
The Prefect said

252
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,100
he was the eldest grandson,

253
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,220
his eldest grandson.

254
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,340
Qilan, we will have more children.

255
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,180
I didn't see him grow up.

256
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,180
I didn't see him study or practice

257
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,180
martial arts with you.

258
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,220
I didn't even let him help me

259
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,580
solve your problems.

260
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,100
Now, Master Jingxiu,

261
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,620
I've never even heard him

262
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,860
call me Mother.

263
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:56,980
Qilan...

264
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,140
Master Jingxiu,

265
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,980
I really don't know

266
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,900
how this happened.

267
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,780
Even if there was a mistake,

268
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,740
it was unintentional.

269
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,460
Please forgive me, Master Jingxiu.

270
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,540
Stop defending yourself.

271
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,280
If it weren't for your jealousy
over Qilan's pregnancy

272
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,300
and your dirty tricks,

273
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,780
how could I lose my grandson?

274
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,180
Even if your father

275
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,890
knows about this,

276
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,620
he can't defend you.

277
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,820
Jingxiu,

278
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,340
you can't forgive her.

279
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,420
Qilan,

280
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,540
rest well.

281
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,700
How could it be unintentional?

282
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:06,940
Today,

283
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,140
I'll strip you of your position
as my consort.

284
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,740
In three days,

285
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,690
you will be sent to the ancestral tomb

286
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,620
to reflect on your mistakes.

287
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,980
Master Jingxiu,

288
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,220
you're abandoning me?

289
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,700
I'm your wife,

290
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:37,060
yet you want to abandon me for her?

291
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,340
What about our bond

292
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,700
over the years?

293
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,580
Master Jingxiu,

294
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,820
it wasn't me!

295
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,340
I didn't do it!

296
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,180
Jingxiu,

297
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,460
I didn't mean that.

298
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,820
This is too serious.

299
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,580
You need to discuss it with your father.

300
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,660
Mother,

301
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,980
I've made my decision.

302
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,460
This concerns the heirs of our family.

303
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,170
If the physician tells Father,

304
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,140
he will never forgive

305
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,660
such a vile woman.

306
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,340
Mother,

307
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,180
if I'm lax in managing
the household and indecisive,

308
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,340
how will Father view me?

309
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,380
How will I manage Dongzhou
in the future?

310
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,260
I've made up my mind.

311
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,940
No need to discuss this further.

312
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:01,180
(Prefect's Mansion)

313
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,340
My Lord, sorry for my crime.

314
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,100
What crime have you committed?

315
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,420
My Lord,

316
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,860
sorry for bad parenting.

317
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,300
I just found out

318
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,780
that Danling has made
such a grievous mistake.

319
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,540
It's because I spoiled her

320
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,140
too much.

321
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,900
I've been too busy

322
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,260
with military affairs

323
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,260
to spend time with her,

324
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,180
so I wanted to make up for it,

325
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,460
but in the end,

326
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,700
I've spoiled her this way.

327
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,140
However,

328
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,620
I know

329
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,580
my daughter well.

330
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,460
Though she's a little spoiled,

331
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,300
she doesn't harbor
any malicious intentions.

332
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,180
She grew up under your watch.

333
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,740
I hope you can be lenient

334
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,060
with her.

335
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,860
I've been lenient with her twice,

336
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,780
so she made this huge mistake.

337
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,700
How about

338
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,780
I ask a strict nanny

339
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,420
to discipline her?

340
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,460
Once she's well-disciplined,

341
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,940
I will return her

342
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,780
to Master Jingxiu

343
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,820
and let her give you

344
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,460
a healthy grandson.

345
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,380
If you think that's not enough,

346
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,220
then please strip her

347
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,420
of her position
as Master Jingxiu's consort

348
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,180
and send her back to me.

349
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,980
I guarantee she will never

350
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,940
step out of my mansion again.

351
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,780
No need.

352
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,580
This time, we can't let her off.

353
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,060
Let her go to the ancestral tomb

354
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,440
to reflect on her mistakes.

355
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,260
She

356
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,780
is my only daughter.

357
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,940
I've served Dongzhou in battle

358
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,980
for half a lifetime.

359
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,260
Please spare Danling's life.

360
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,460
General Wang,

361
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,770
this is my eldest grandson!

362
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,900
Master Jingxiu, why are you here?

363
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,660
Is it not enough to strip me
of my position?

364
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,660
Are you here to vent your anger for her?

365
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,700
Danling,

366
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,260
I never intended to abandon you.

367
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,700
We've been married for years.

368
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,780
You know how I have treated you.

369
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:27,380
I've always thought
of our marriage bond.

370
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,660
For all these years,

371
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,260
whatever trouble you've caused,

372
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,060
I've thought it was
because I spoiled you.

373
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,540
You didn't bear a child
in the last five years,

374
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,500
and I didn't allow anyone
to speak ill of it.

375
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,740
But this time,

376
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,820
you've gone too far.

377
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,340
Master Jingxiu,

378
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,780
I...

379
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,140
Don't you understand how important

380
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,300
this child is to me?

381
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,820
It's the Prefect's eldest grandson.

382
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,540
How could you be so inconsiderate?

383
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,060
Master Jingxiu,

384
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,380
sorry about this.

385
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,500
Please give me another chance,

386
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:20,980
okay?

387
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,940
If Father didn't know about this,

388
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,100
I could help you cover it up,

389
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,740
but since he knows,

390
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,380
what can I do?

391
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,100
Master Jingxiu,

392
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,460
the bond we share

393
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,700
is much more important
than an unborn child.

394
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,580
We grew up together.

395
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,980
I married you soon after I came of age.

396
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,220
For all these years,

397
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,900
I've been with you.

398
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,380
We shared...

399
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,860
Danling,

400
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,340
do we have any bond between us?

401
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,180
What...

402
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,060
What?

403
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,620
It's true we grew up together,

404
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,180
but have you ever loved me?

405
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,300
The man you've always wanted
to marry is Jingming.

406
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,760
Because of my identity
as the lineal eldest son

407
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,180
and Golden Guards,

408
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,420
you changed your mind

409
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,780
back then

410
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,060
and plotted to spend a night with me.

411
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,300
One more drink.

412
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:46,980
One more drink.

413
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,250
Danling, you can really drink.

414
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,740
Jingxiu,

415
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,500
let me pour wine for you.

416
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,220
To Jingxiu.

417
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,500
May all things go

418
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,020
as you wish.

419
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,540
Thank you, Danling.

420
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,220
Afterwards, you framed
Shen Jiangli with this.

421
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,300
No...

422
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,660
Do you really think I don't know it?

423
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,500
You wanted to become
the most respected woman in Dongzhou,

424
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,700
while I just wanted

425
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,310
to use your family.

426
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,780
We were just using each other.

427
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,700
No, it's not like that.

428
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,100
I admit

429
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,100
I used some tricks,

430
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,220
but

431
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,820
I love you.

432
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,740
I also know,

433
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,260
Master Jingxiu,

434
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,060
that you love me too.

435
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,460
You've caused me so much trouble.

436
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,300
For your family, I've endured it all.

437
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,300
But you laid hands on my child.

438
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,660
Master Jingxiu,

439
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,020
I can give you a child too.

440
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,980
I can do it.

441
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,080
I can do it.

442
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,740
Don't think about it.

443
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,420
Jingxiu.

444
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,820
- Mother.
- Please sit.

445
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,700
Why call me here?

446
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,020
Jingxiu,

447
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,500
Wang Danling will be abandoned,

448
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,380
but your mansion needs
to be taken care of.

449
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,580
What if someone causes trouble

450
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,340
in the absence of a consort?

451
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:57,980
Don't worry, Mother.

452
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,780
After Qilan recovers,

453
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,820
I want her to take charge temporarily.

454
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,160
She needs to learn
how to manage the house.

455
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,540
What do you mean by that?

456
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,760
Are you planning
to make her your consort?

457
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,220
Qilan has been in the mansion
for a while.

458
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,220
If she can manage the household,

459
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,580
I won't bother looking for a new one.

460
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,220
- Jingxiu.
- Mother.

461
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,780
Qilan just lost her child
and is heartbroken.

462
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,380
Let her do something

463
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,860
to distract herself.

464
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,660
She can temporarily take charge,

465
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,220
but you absolutely can't

466
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,780
let her be your consort.

467
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,380
I will find you someone worthy

468
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,940
of your noble status.

469
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,580
Don't worry about this.

470
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:40,820
Mother,

471
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,620
let's discuss this later.

472
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,580
Mother,

473
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,860
I have to work,

474
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,320
so I will take my leave for now.

475
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,100
Jingxiu.

476
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,100
Jingxiu.

477
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,900
This child...

478
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,780
Dingxiang,

479
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,700
go and find some

480
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,980
portraits of noble ladies

481
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,300
at a marriageable age.

482
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,820
My Lady,

483
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,140
Master Jingxiu said to let Lady Lan...

484
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,260
What do you know?

485
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,260
Shen Qilan is just
a concubine's daughter.

486
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,740
It's already her good fortune

487
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,460
to be Jingxiu's concubine.

488
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,220
She can never

489
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,660
be Jingxiu's consort.

490
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,540
I'm afraid

491
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,940
if she's in charge for too long,

492
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,180
she might have other ideas.

493
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,380
Fuling.

494
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,140
How is she?

495
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,420
She just fell asleep.

496
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,380
Bring some bright flowers.

497
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,380
These are withered.

498
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,460
How can they help cheer her up?

499
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,580
Hurry up.

500
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,420
Yes.

501
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,060
Qilan.

502
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,380
Take it slow.

503
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,460
Greetings, Master Jingxiu.

504
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,140
Qilan,

505
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,820
I've given instructions.

506
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,420
Once your health is better,

507
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,620
you'll be in charge of the household.

508
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,400
From now on, you're in charge

509
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,340
of this family.

510
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,260
I haven't done this before.

511
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,460
I'm afraid I won't do it well.

512
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,860
No worries. You can learn over time.

513
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,260
Thank you, Master Jingxiu.

514
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,660
But it's pitiful for my child.

515
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,660
This is my first child,

516
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,900
but he never even had the chance

517
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,100
to see the world.

518
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,980
We'll have another one.

519
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,380
I have no other wishes.

520
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,220
I just want to have a peaceful

521
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,460
and happy family with you.

522
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,580
Please believe me.

523
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,500
I'll get better,

524
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,660
and I'll definitely

525
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,100
bear a child for you soon.

526
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:51,900
Sure.

527
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,860
I'll wait for you.

528
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,060
My Lady!

529
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,060
Bad news!

530
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,500
My Lady!

531
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,260
Greetings, Master Jingming.

532
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,300
I didn't know you were also here.

533
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,060
Why so panic?

534
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,860
I heard from the servants

535
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,820
in Master Jingxiu's Mansion

536
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,780
that Lady Lan had a miscarriage.

537
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,380
It's said that Consort Danling

538
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,060
repeatedly bullied Lady Lan,

539
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,260
which weakened her body.

540
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,780
With some medicine,

541
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,900
Lady Lan miscarried.

542
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,860
I see.

543
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,100
This shouldn't be spread
within the mansion.

544
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,620
You may leave now.

545
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,460
Yes.

546
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,420
I'll take my leave.

547
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,340
I'll go see her.

548
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,080
Do you want me to accompany you?

549
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,660
No need. I can go myself.

550
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,660
Then be careful.

551
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,660
Shen Qilan just married Master Jingxiu,

552
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,260
and Wang Danling is furious now.

553
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,060
Be careful with what you do,

554
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,380
and protect yourself.

555
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,620
Why are you in such a hurry?

556
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,460
Consort Jiangli.

557
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,460
I...

558
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,460
It's fine. Go back to work.

559
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,100
Yes.

560
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,180
Jiangli, you're here.

561
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,580
Jiangli.

562
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,100
Please sit.

563
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,060
Fuling, prepare tea.

564
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,180
No need.

565
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,100
I just came to see how you're doing.

566
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,700
Let me check your pulse.

567
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:47,980
Master Jingxiu

568
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,960
has asked the Prefect's physician

569
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,340
to examine me.

570
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,700
You don't have to do this.

571
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,340
I'm your sister.

572
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,220
I think it's better if I check it.

573
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,140
Thank you, Jiangli.

574
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,060
But I don't want Master Jingxiu

575
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,620
to misunderstand that I don't trust him,

576
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,420
so I hope you'll forgive me.

577
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,020
I'm just glad you're alright.

578
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,700
Jiangli,

579
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,060
this is

580
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,140
the Lantian jade bracelet
from Master Jingxiu.

581
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,580
This jade is rare and valuable,

582
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,060
and it perfectly matches
your noble demeanor.

583
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,540
Please allow me

584
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,140
to give this to you.

585
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,660
You should

586
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,260
keep it for yourself.

587
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,180
The inner chambers are eerie.

588
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,180
One slight mistake

589
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,780
might make you fall into hell

590
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,820
like Wang Danling.

591
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,620
This bracelet

592
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,620
will help protect you from evil.

593
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,820
You're right.

594
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,500
We can't harbor malicious intent

595
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,020
like her,

596
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,540
but people have many helpless moments.

597
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,710
Sometimes, it's just
to protect themselves.

598
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,140
Jiangli, do you agree?

599
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,900
It's never wrong
to consider yourself first.

600
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,860
But people live only once.

601
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,600
Some things can be done,

602
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,040
but some things can't.

603
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,660
We must stick to our bottom line.

604
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,380
I'll follow your advice.

605
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,100
I don't have any advice for you.

606
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,060
Where is Wang Danling now?

607
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,100
She's under house arrest in her room.

608
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,740
Are you going to see her?

609
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,860
We've had many entanglements for years.

610
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,260
Now that she's leaving,

611
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,980
I should go see her.

612
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,980
Rest well.

613
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,040
No need to see me off.

614
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,740
Jiangli, take care.

615
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,220
What are you here for?

616
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,660
I came to see you.

617
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,340
Are you here to laugh at me?

618
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,380
Let me tell you.

619
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,460
I'm doing just fine.

620
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,860
Stop playing tough now.

621
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,100
Still dreaming about becoming
the Prefect's wife?

622
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,940
Who are you to laugh at me?

623
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,660
Even if I'm not a consort anymore,

624
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,020
I'm still the general's only daughter.

625
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,020
I'm not you.

626
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,620
You marrying Master Jingming

627
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:02,380
can even be considered rarely lucky.

628
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,620
Do you think your marriage

629
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,160
can make you my equal?

630
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,060
You don't deserve it!

631
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:15,040
Someone as insignificant as me

632
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:18,060
could still become your thorn
in the side

633
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,500
and the target of your schemes
again and again.

634
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,380
I don't even know

635
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,580
whether I should feel sad

636
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,290
or proud.

637
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,980
I don't even know what I did

638
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,180
to offend you.

639
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,060
It was you who chose

640
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,500
to marry Master Jingxiu,

641
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,560
but to achieve your goals,
you plotted against me.

642
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,340
I hadn't even sought revenge on you,

643
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,340
yet you made things hard for me

644
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,180
because I married Master Jingming.

645
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,580
Don't you think you're too overbearing?

646
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,180
Overbearing?

647
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,300
You should know this.

648
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,540
Even if it's something I have discarded,

649
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,980
you have no right to pick it up.

650
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,340
Even picking it up is a crime.

651
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,220
Your arrogance and pompousness

652
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,180
are truly vile.

653
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,860
You look like a tiger,

654
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,300
baring your fangs and claws,

655
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,420
but you have nothing to back you up.

656
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,020
Stop showing off here.

657
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,380
I don't need you to teach me a lesson.

658
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,820
Do you know?

659
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,420
Qilan is actually not pregnant.

660
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,540
What did you say?

661
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,380
I just went to see her,

662
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,620
and I discovered something.

663
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,060
Consort Jiangli.

664
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,100
I...

665
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,060
It's fine. Go back to work.

666
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,780
Yes.

667
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,660
She used medicine

668
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,900
to create a false pregnancy.

669
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,900
Then she used medicine

670
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,260
to fake a miscarriage.

671
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,060
As for the blood,

672
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,100
she must've calculated the timing

673
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,820
and waited for her period to come

674
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,220
before blaming it on you.

675
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,980
I knew it.

676
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,300
I had consulted with the physician
about the dosage,

677
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,620
and the child would've been fine.

678
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,660
You go.

679
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,100
Go tell Master Jingxiu

680
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,820
so he will know I was wronged.

681
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,980
You go.

682
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,540
You go tell Master Jingxiu.

683
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,380
You go.

684
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,500
It's too late now.

685
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,760
She's destroyed the evidence.

686
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,260
I knew it.

687
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,500
You two were in cahoots

688
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,220
to make a fool of me.

689
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,020
I knew you wouldn't be so kind

690
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:35,980
to visit me.

691
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,700
Wait and see.

692
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,420
If my father knows about this,

693
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,740
he will surely plead with the Prefect.

694
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,520
In just a few days, I'll be out of here.

695
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:48,820
By then,

696
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,580
I won't let you get away with it.

697
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,540
You probably don't know

698
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,380
that General Wang went to the Prefect,

699
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,220
but the Prefect didn't change his mind.

700
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,580
What did you say?

701
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,580
I don't believe it.

702
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,460
My father holds a lot of weight

703
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,860
with the Prefect.

704
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,380
With his military merits,

705
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,040
the Prefect has to consider his opinion.

706
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,460
Wang Danling,

707
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,740
you've been treating everyone

708
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,860
like pawns in your game.

709
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,820
Do you really think you're a player?

710
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,560
Good and evil will be repaid.

711
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,420
Take care of yourself.

712
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,060
Shen Jiangli!

713
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,700
Come back here! Don't leave!

714
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,300
Explain yourself!

715
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,900
It's impossible!

716
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,820
Fuling, pour me a cup of tea.

717
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,140
Fuling.

718
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,260
Pour me a cup of tea.

719
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,740
Alright.

720
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,100
My Lady, sorry.

721
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,100
When I sent

722
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,660
the clothes out earlier,

723
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,740
I ran into Consort Jiangli.

724
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,580
She saw those clothes.

725
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:52,900
If...

726
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,340
If she associates those clothes

727
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,600
with something

728
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,700
and discovers our secret...

729
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,540
- It's fine.
- I...

730
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:01,780
Get up.

731
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,610
Even if she didn't see those clothes,

732
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:11,660
she'd still find out about it.

733
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,340
I did this

734
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:15,900
to protect myself.

735
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,100
I never intended to harm anyone.

736
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,980
Wang Danling went too far,

737
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,500
so I had to resort to this.

738
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,180
It's fine now.

739
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,620
From now on,

740
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,900
we can live peacefully.

741
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,940
Jiangli is wise.

742
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,440
She won't interfere with matters

743
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,580
that don't concern her.

744
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,060
By the way, My Lady,

745
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,980
your mother just sent a letter

746
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,200
and said she'd come over later.

747
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,940
Help me change my clothes.

748
00:35:55,620 --> 00:36:02,620
(Master Jingxiu's Mansion)

749
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,260
Why are you here?

750
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,180
It's getting cold,

751
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,740
so I brought you a coat.

752
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,300
What's happened?

753
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,380
I'm just a bit sentimental.

754
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,100
Wang Danling,

755
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,100
as the general's lineal daughter,

756
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,380
favored by all,

757
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,220
grew up in the Prefect's Mansion,

758
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,060
studying with the Prefect's sons,

759
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,700
yet she's trapped

760
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:39,020
in the inner chambers,

761
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,380
scheming and plotting,

762
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,900
hurting others and herself.

763
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,140
She wants too much,

764
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,580
and in the end, she's trapped
by her desires and obsessions.

765
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,660
But this endless struggle

766
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,380
really changes people.

767
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,060
I went to see Qilan today,

768
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,320
and she's changed a lot too.

769
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,620
I hope she can learn from this

770
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,360
and not repeat Wang Danling's mistakes.

771
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,220
No matter what the situation is,

772
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,300
the path is one's own choice.

773
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:06,980
I hope that those who feel helpless

774
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,780
can hold on to their true selves.

775
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,580
Let's go.

777

By the Prefect's order,

778
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,100
the guilty woman, Wang Danling,

779
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,520
has plotted against Lady Shen Qilan,

780
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,220
and her as the consort is revoked.

781
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,960
She is to be sent to the ancestral tomb.

782

783
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,700
I invited you here today

784
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,540
to express my feelings.

785
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,740
I love Master Jingxiu

786
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,060
for who he is,

787
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,100
not for his status or wealth,

788
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,380
and I won't be your enemy.

789
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,620
I will always respect you and love you.

790
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,100
I will never be a threat to you.

Qilan, are you feeling better?

815
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,580
I pity my grandson.

816
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,980
Wang Danling is truly heartless.

817
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,140
Mother,

818
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,180
I'm fine.

819
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,680
Wang Danling has gone
to the ancestral tomb,

820
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,700
and Master Jingxiu has let me

821
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,680
manage the household.

822
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,100
Really?

823
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,300
What a blessing.

824
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:40,620
However,

825
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,620
this miscarriage

826
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,360
must've harmed your body.

827
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,660
You must take good care of yourself,

828
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,820
so you can conceive again.

829
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,260
Mother,

830
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,580
actually...

831
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,060
What?

832
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,100
You...

833
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,420
Don't worry, Mother.

834
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,980
No one knows about this.

835
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,860
I can endure

836
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,700
Wang Danling's abuse,

837
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,500
but she shouldn't have humiliated you.

838
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,060
On my wedding night,

839
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,060
she humiliated you for no reason.

840
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,700
Good child.

841
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,300
It's my fault

842
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,850
for letting you suffer this.

843
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:13,900
Mother,

844
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,540
now, Master Jingxiu loves me

845
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,380
and trusts me.

846
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,100
We'll have many good days to come.

847
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,780
What's wrong?

848
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,140
- What's wrong?
- Qilan,

849
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,540
I'm afraid

850
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,860
there won't be a future for me.

851
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,220
What happened, Mother?

852
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,020
I heard that your elder sister

853
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,700
found the servants who used

854
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,900
to serve her mother

855
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,580
and said she'd investigate
her mother's death.

856
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,980
Didn't her mother die of illness?

857
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,700
Why investigate?

858
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,540
Actually,

859
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,620
there have been rumors
at home for years

860
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,020
that her mother didn't die of illness.

861
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,020
Mother, what do you know?

862
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,580
Let her investigate.

863
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,420
But...

864
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,020
Mother,

865
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,420
we needn't worry.

866
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,020
You didn't do this.

867
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,700
We have nothing to fear.

868
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,700
Actually,

869
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,540
back then, to protect us,

870
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,420
I also used some methods.

871
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,690
I'm just afraid

872
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,060
they might use it to frame me

873
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,460
during the investigation.

874
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,220

00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,620
