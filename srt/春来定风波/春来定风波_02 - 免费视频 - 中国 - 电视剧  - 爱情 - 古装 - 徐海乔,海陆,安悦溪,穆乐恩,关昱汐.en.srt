=Episode 2=

22
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,660
(Master Jingming's Mansion)

23
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:50,650
Young Master,

24
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,600
I've interrogated Nanny Dong
who's guarding the ancestral tomb.

25
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,110
(Yunyi, Lu Jingming's guard)
She's neglectful of her duties.

26
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,100
She didn't know anything
about Consort Jiangli

27
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,720
or that she had returned to the mansion.

28
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,500
(Yunjiu, Lu Jingming's guard)
Young Master,

29
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,700
I feel that Consort Jiangli

30
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,780
seems different
from the one she was before.

31
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,890
She used Consort Danling's
fertility rituals

32
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,380
to gain Lady Shu's protection.

33
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,050
She can even bring people back to life
and cure diseases.

34
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,020
I don't know how Consort Jiangli

35
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,210
learned these skills.

36
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,820
Find clues

37
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,250
and get to the bottom of this.

38
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,490
Also,

39
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,450
keep an eye on Rain Chamber.

40
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:30,700
(Master Jingxiu's Mansion)

41
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:45,770
Yuzhu,

42
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,930
has everything been arranged

43
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,650
for Nanny Zhou's funeral?

44
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,360
Don't worry, Consort Danling.

45
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,420
I've taken care of everything.

46
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,170
It's all because of Shen Jiangli.

47
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,490
I won't let her off the hook.

48
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,890
Rest assured. I promise.

49
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,140
Thank you, Consort Danling.

50
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,420
Yuzhu,

51
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,610
you've really suffered.

52
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,980
You've been with me for years.

53
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,220
Don't worry.

54
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,020
I won't treat you badly.

55
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:23,610
In the future,

56
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,450
I'll find you a good husband.

57
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,580
No, Consort Danling,

58
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,020
I don't want to marry.

59
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:31,490
My mom is gone.

60
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,980
You are my only remaining family.

61
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,730
Please don't drive me away.

62
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,820
I just want to serve you

63
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,300
for the rest of my life.

64
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,050
Alright.

65
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,860
(Shen Jiangli,)

66
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:52,930
(only one of us)

67
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,700
(can stay in Dongzhou.)

68
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,100
(Rain Chamber)

69
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,660
Young Master.

70
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,780
Keep him alive.

71
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,640
Yes.

72
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,620
You're injured.

73
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,850
It's nothing.

74
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,290
I'll bandage it for you.

75
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,970
No need.

76
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:50,810
Come on.

77
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,490
Tell me. Who sent you here?

78
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,920
Physicians are always kind.

79
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,500
I'm just helping you

80
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,090
because you saved me earlier.

81
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,580
Thank you.

82
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,860
Master Jingming,

83
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,850
apart from these knife wounds,

84
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,140
is there anything else wrong
with your body?

85
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:23,610
No.

86
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,780
What are you doing?

87
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,740
Haven't you recently had

88
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,850
difficulty breathing?

89
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,410
At night, there's pain and itching,

90
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,450
making you suffer, right?

91
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,820
You've got the wind-heat rash.

92
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,170
Wind-heat rash?

93
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,820
The physician said before...

94
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,100
What did he say?

95
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,860
Nothing.

96
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,420
You weren't misdiagnosed

97
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,820
with a venereal disease, were you?

98
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,740
Shen Jiangli.

99
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,890
No wonder you pretend
to be uninterested in politics,

100
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,560
not competing
for the position of Prefect.

101
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,190
It turns out you have a hidden illness

102
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,460
and can't take care of yourself.

103
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,410
If your brother finds out about this...

104
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00,260
I warn you.

105
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,850
Watch your mouth.

106
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,970
I also warn you.

107
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,650
If you get angry again,

108
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,630
it won't do you any good
for your injuries.

109
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,680
- Master...
- Master...

110
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,050
Come back.

111
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,130
Where is he?

112
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:16,610
I failed in my duty.

113
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,850
That thief

114
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:18,940
poisoned himself to death.

115
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,090
You two, wait outside for me.

116
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,540
- Yes.
- Yes.

117
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,240
If you dare reveal a word

118
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,500
about my condition,

119
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,620
I won't spare you.

120
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,650
How did it go?

121
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,170
We...

122
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,500
We failed.

123
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,180
We could've succeeded,

124
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,380
but Master Jingming suddenly appeared.

125
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,090
Did you leave any evidence?

126
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,210
No.

127
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,970
We sent a dare-to-die killer.

128
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,210
After the failure,

129
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,630
he committed suicide.

130
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,780
How useless.

131
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,850
Consort Danling, calm your anger.

132
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,650
Lady Shu has already ordered

133
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,740
that if she makes another mistake,

134
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,680
she'll be sent back
to the ancestral tomb.

135
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,020
As we failed this time,

136
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,700
let's think of a longer-term plan.

137
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,540
What do you know?

138
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,870
She left the ancestral tomb
and ruined my plans.

139
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,260
She must've been long
plotting against me.

140
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:27,940
She's probably not

141
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,740
as easy to deal with as before.

142
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,740
She's back now.

143
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,940
If she digs up the past...

144
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:38,730
No.

145
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,210
I have to think of a way.

146
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:44,730
Young Master,

147
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,450
Lady Shu is on her way.

148
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:47,990
Do you know how to respond?

149
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,650
It's just a small injury,

150
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,380
and you're fine.

151
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,500
I wasn't there.

152
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,340
What?

153
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,600
Are you going to hide
such a serious matter from me?

154
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,380
How dare you?

155
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,580
Jingming,

156
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,410
how are you? Where did you get hurt?

157
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,140
Mother, don't worry.

158
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,700
It's just a scratch.

159
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,620
It's already fine.

160
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,410
Jingming,

161
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,940
you getting hurt is serious.

162
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,500
How could you not tell me?

163
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,020
What if something
really happened to you?

164
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,020
How am I supposed to live?

165
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,090
Mother,

166
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,330
it's not that serious.

167
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,700
It's really just a minor injury.

168
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,290
What do you mean?

169
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,910
You're injured so badly.

170
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,910
You...

171
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,140
How could you let this happen?

172
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,290
My Lady, I'm sorry.

173
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,260
I heard from Danling

174
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,050
that you got injured
while protecting Shen Jiangli.

175
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,380
Is that true?

176
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,580
Mother,

177
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,820
I...

178
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,250
Enough.

179
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,260
I knew it was true.

180
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,570
Shen Jiangli

181
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,740
is just a jinx.

182
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,500
Her return

183
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,410
always brings trouble.

184
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:56,770
Jingming,

185
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,690
you're too soft on her.

186
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:01,940
Mother,

187
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,050
five years ago,

188
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,810
you said Jiangli poisoned you?

189
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,810
How could I possibly risk my life

190
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:09,890
to frame her?

191
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,680
But

192
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,220
if it weren't for Danling,

193
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,260
how would I have known

194
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,220
the flowers Shen Jiangli sent me
every day were poisoned?

195
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,290
You mean

196
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,410
it was Wang Danling who reminded you
about this back then?

197
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,370
Yes.

198
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,260
Jingming,

199
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,740
you should rest now.

200
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,690
I won't disturb you any longer.

201
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,380
Don't worry, Mother.

202
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,140
Let's go, Dongmei.

203
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,620
Yunjiu, follow them.

204
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:40,770
Yes.

205
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,410
(Was there a hidden truth back then?)

206
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,340
Consort Jiangli,

207
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,500
since Lady Shu ordered you
to copy scriptures,

208
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,340
you might as well listen to her.

209
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,530
If you sincerely repent,

210
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,890
Lady Shu will surely send someone
to bring you back.

211
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,170
What do I have to repent for?

212
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,770
I don't want to return
to that chaotic place.

213
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,690
Lu Qingqing went out herself to play.

214
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,090
What does her disfigurement
have to do with me?

215
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:11,770
And Lady Shu.

216
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,980
I kindly gave her flowers,

217
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,170
but she was allergic to the pollen,

218
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,790
yet she accused me of poisoning her.

219
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,050
What kind of people are they?

220
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,010
The Commandery Princess is spoiled,

221
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,100
and Lady Shu is vicious.

222
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,500
They deserve to suffer.

223
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,770
They deserve to be poisoned.

224
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,650
Greetings, Lady Shu.

225
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:41,980
Kneel.

226
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:44,650
Lady Shu,

227
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,620
I don't know what I did wrong.

228
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:47,840
Why should I kneel?

229
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,570
You don't know what you did wrong?

230
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,620
That day,

231
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,500
because of Lady Wang's arrogance,

232
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,020
I kept you in the mansion.

233
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,500
I also told you

234
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,160
that if you caused trouble again,

235
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,660
I would send you back.

236
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,460
But it hasn't even been a few days,

237
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,780
and you've caused my son to be injured.

238
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,740
You didn't even greet me
in the mornings and evenings.

239
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,380
You've completely failed
your duties as a wife.

240
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,770
Those are your mistakes.

241
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,620
How dare you laugh?

242
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,580
Lady Shu, Master Jingming was injured,

243
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,460
but it wasn't me who sent the thief.

244
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,620
What crime have I committed?

245
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,540
Furthermore,

246
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,020
you confined me in the ancestral tomb

247
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,800
and declared that I was
no longer a consort.

248
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,800
You've disowned me
as your daughter-in-law,

249
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,660
so how could I show you

250
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,240
the proper respect for a mother-in-law?

251
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,700
You brought this
upon yourself in the past.

252
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,340
Besides, in these five years,

253
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,030
you haven't given our family
a son or daughter.

254
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,540
Just based on this,

255
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,080
I could punish you.

256
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,220
Lady Shu,

257
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,540
you're joking.

258
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,380
I was confined in the ancestral tomb.

259
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,660
How could I have children?

260
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,860
Can I get pregnant alone?

261
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,420
How dare you defy your elders?

262
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,460
Dongmei,

263
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,740
teach her proper manners.

264
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:55,900
Yes.

265
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,300
You've gone too far.

266
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,060
Come on, hold her down.

267
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,940
Mother.

268
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,260
What?

269
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,940
I can't even discipline her?

270
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,220
You're right.

271
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,220
Shen Jiangli is unruly.

272
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,380
She should be punished.

273
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:24,940
But I'm worried

274
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,100
you'll hurt yourself

275
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,350
because of her.

276
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,810
- Yunjiu.
- Yes.

277
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,740
Send Lady Shu back.

278
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,580
Yes.

279
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,580
Leave this

280
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,820
to me.

281
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,700
You...

282
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,780
My Lady, calm down.

283
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,840
Master Jingming still cares about you.

284
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,260
Let's head back now.

285
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,040
I'll have the kitchen prepare
some snow fungus soup for you.

286
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:18,910
Mother broke

287
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,860
into Rain Chamber today.

288
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,620
I apologize on her behalf.

289
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,460
There are some ice cubes
and medicine here.

290
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,500
You should handle it yourself.

291
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,540
No need.

292
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,540
Don't move.

293
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,900
Have you figured out

294
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,380
who sent the thief last night?

295
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,660
It's not hard to guess who sent him,

296
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,180
but it should be aimed at me.

297
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,140
Don't worry too much.

298
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,740
Indeed.

299
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,180
The Prefect has long been sick

300
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,980
but has never said

301
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,140
that Master Jingxiu is the successor.

302
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,900
Clearly, he has other considerations.

303
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,700
Your younger brother is too young.

304
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:09,980
Now,

305
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,180
you've become their biggest threat.

306
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,540
Master Jingming,

307
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,260
you are now

308
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,940
in a perilous situation.

309
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,380
What do you think of this?

310
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,940
If I were you,

311
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,580
facing this situation,

312
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,540
I'd definitely find a reliable helper.

313
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:27,860
For example,

314
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,140
someone like me.

315
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:31,980
Continue.

316
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,220
I can cure your illness.

317
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,460
I dare say

318
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,380
that no one in this city

319
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,740
can cure

320
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,100
the hidden ailment you carry.

321
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,900
Once your illness is cured,

322
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,780
you will have no more worries

323
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,340
and can do whatever you wish to do.

324
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,460
Continue.

325
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,780
Help me obtain the Lei Pill,

326
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,060
and I'll manage
to get close to the Prefect.

327
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,980
Once I cure the Prefect's illness,

328
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,380
you'll be one step closer
to the position...

329
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,820
Let's get back to your deal.

330
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,420
I want to know

331
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,140
why you're going through
so much trouble.

332
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,420
I want the Lei Pill.

333
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,540
As for what I'll use it for,

334
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,780
you don't need to ask about it.

335
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,180
Master Jingming,

336
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,100
this deal is not a loss for you.

337
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,940
(She has faced danger continuously
since her return.)

338
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,940
(The household struggles
are more complicated than I imagined.)

339
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,940
(Maybe, in the past,)

340
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,020
(I trusted my mother too easily.)

341
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,900
(Rain Chamber)

342
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:04,500
(Rain Chamber)

343
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,860
Master Jingming, why are you here?

344
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,740
With your medical skills,

345
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,560
you still need the Lei Pill
to save someone.

346
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,220
You must be facing great difficulties.

347
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,780
I'm willing to work with you.

348
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,100
Five years have passed.

349
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,700
How have you been?

350
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,020
I've been doing quite well.

351
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,180
At least it's much more comfortable

352
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,340
than in the Prefect's Mansion.

353
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,140
Really?

354
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,460
Master Jingming, you must be busy.

355
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,440
I won't keep you here.

356
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,740
Please leave.

357
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:00,530
Master Jingming,

358
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,900
I'll see you off here.

359
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,300
Your late concern is useless to me.

360
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,660
Don't worry about my difficulties.

361
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,980
You should know our relationship.

362
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,620
It's mutually beneficial,

363
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,380
not dependent on one another.

364
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,460
I'll get the Lei Pill,

365
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,140
you'll get the position
of Young Prefect.

366
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,700
We'll both get what we need.

367
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:33,290
♪May you be free from a long journey♪

368
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:39,780
♪May you return without suffering
from the storm♪

369
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:44,570
♪I quietly search in my heart♪

370
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,620
(We met because of our parents' words)

371
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,660
(and once made promises to each other.)

372
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,820
(I once thought)

373
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,260
(we'd be together forever.)

374
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,460
(The past cannot be recaptured.)

375
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,140
(Will we ever get)

376
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,780

388
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,700
My Lady,

389
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,840
Master Jingxiu and Consort Danling said

390
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,180
that they came to check on you.

391
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,740
They are in the main hall now.

392
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,220
Jiangli is here.

393
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,620
Greetings, Jingxiu, Danling.

394
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,020
Danling, you still have time

395
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,420
to visit us?

396
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,780
Didn't Lady Wang order you

397
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,740
to copy scriptures in seclusion?

398
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,860
What?

399
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,060
Have you finished?

400
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,100
No need for you to worry about it.

401
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,900
After all, unlike you,

402
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,580
I still have to manage

403
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,420
the affairs of my mansion.

404
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,960
I really envy you, Jiangli.

405
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,260
You must be living

406
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,700
a carefree life here.

407
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,340
It's all because my husband

408
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,580
is too fond of me.

409
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,100
He doesn't let me worry

410
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,300
about trivial matters.

411
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,220
My husband says

412
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,700
a wife is meant to be pampered,

413
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,540
not to toil over household chores.

414
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,340
For these trivial matters,

415
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,020
we can just hire several housekeepers.

416
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,500
At least,

417
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,980
we can still afford that.

418
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,030
I heard a thief broke in two nights ago.

419
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,480
Is everything alright?

420
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,260
It's fine.

421
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,340
Jingxiu, don't worry about it.

422
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,780
I didn't expect

423
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,340
that Jiangli would stay this time.

424
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,380
Has Lady Shu agreed?

425
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,900
Jiangli,

426
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,300
you must handle your relationship
with your mother-in-law.

427
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,420
Rumors have been spread outside.

428
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,540
It could tarnish
your family's reputation.

429
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:50,900
Jingxiu,

430
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,480
people outside always gossip.

431
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,500
Repeated lies make truth.

432
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,540
It's not worth believing.

433
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,750
If you're concerned
about our family affairs,

434
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,780
just come directly to ask me.

435
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,500
Alright, sorry for speaking out of turn.

436
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,260
But for the sake
of our family's reputation,

437
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,840
I still have to say a few words.

438
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:09,540
What do you think, Jiangli?

439
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,820
Jingxiu, that's not quite right.

440
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,900
Whether it's the Prefect's family

441
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,940
or an ordinary family,

442
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,340
there will inevitably be conflicts

443
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,220
between a mother-in-law
and a daughter-in-law.

444
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,580
Who has the time

445
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,440
to gossip

446
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,240
about other people's
family matters all day?

447
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,700
Fine.

448
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,540
Since you two are so close,

449
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,020
I can rest assured.

450
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,800
Jingming,

451
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,680
recently,

452
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,020
I found a treasure,

453
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,770
so I brought it to share with you.

454
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,780
I'm curious.

455
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,020
What treasure could catch your eye?

456
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,300
Please.

457
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,700
Jingming,

458
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,500
I asked Kunlun craftsmen

459
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,550
to forge this iron sword.

460
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,410
A heavy sword has no edge;

461
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,620
great skill lies in simplicity.

462
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,280
You're well-traveled and knowledgeable.

463
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:10,800
Please help me assess

464
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,430
whether this sword lives up to its name.

465
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,100
Jingming.

466
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,060
Jingxiu,

467
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,780
you know very well

468
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,180
that in recent years,

469
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,100
I've only been interested
in calligraphy and paintings.

470
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,020
As for evaluating the sword's quality,

471
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,420
you're the true expert.

472
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,500
Jingming, you're joking.

473
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,060
Back in the battle with Xizhou,

474
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,420
though you lost,

475
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,700
everyone in the four states knows

476
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,340
you fought valiantly.

477
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,100
I haven't touched swords in years,

478
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,740
so I won't embarrass myself
in front of you.

479
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,540
You keep refusing.

480
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,380
Why?

481
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,140
Is this sword

482
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,980
not worth looking at?

483
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,180
Jingxiu,

484
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,500
I've been confined for five years.

485
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,900
May I take a look at it?

486
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,700
Who are you?

487
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,900
Look at the sword, Jingming.

488
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,580
Let me have a look.

489
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,660
Are you okay, Jingming?

490
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,720
Jingxiu,

491
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,610
I'm fine,

492
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,020
but

493
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,500
this is a good sword.

494
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,100
Jiangli is too curious.

495
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,100
I'll tell her later

496
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,480
about what should be touched

497
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,420
and what shouldn't.

498
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,500
Jingxiu, Danling,

499
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,940
please come inside for tea.

500
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,380
Jingming, it's good that you're fine.

501
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,260
Jingming,

502
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:13,940
how's your injury?

503
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,580
You don't need to worry.

504
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,200
The private physician has checked.

505
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:19,530
It's been treated; it's fine now.

506
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,200
Then I can rest easy.

507
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:25,870
Jiangli,

508
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,340
you must take good care of your husband.

509
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,780
These past few years,

510
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,820
Jingming has been immersed
in poetry and music

511
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,780
and has even been reprimanded
by the Prefect

512
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,640
that he mustn't neglect
his responsibilities.

513
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,620
As his sister-in-law, I'm truly worried.

514
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,980
How can he assist Jingxiu properly?

515
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,940
Thank you for your reminder.

516
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,710
I'm curious.

517
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,420
Danling,

518
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,140
why are you so concerned

519
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,530
about Jingming's future?

520
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,300
Jiangli,

521
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,310
why are you so confrontational?

522
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,100
What Danling said was just

523
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,660
to remind you about your duties.

524
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,860
She meant well.

525
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,060
She heard that Lady Shu hit you,

526
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,180
so she specifically came to visit.

527
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,540
It seems that in these five years,

528
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,660
Danling and I

529
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,740
haven't grown distant.

530
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,460
You've been as kind to me

531
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,740
as you were five years ago.

532
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,660
Shen Jiangli, you...

533
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,660
I've let go of the ceremony.

534
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,420
This time we came to check on you,

535
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,860
but you're so sharp-tongued.

536
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,200
A harmonious family
is the key to everything.

537
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,060
Jiangli, you should always

538
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,540
keep this in your heart.

539
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,860
Jingxiu, please don't be angry.

540
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,220
I just wanted to catch up with Danling.

541
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,540
After all, we have so many past events.

542
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,860
What a joke.

543
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,180
What past events do I have with you?

544
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,420
Danling, your memory is poor.

545
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,060
Should I help you

546
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,700
recall the events

547
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,140
from five years ago one by one?

548
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,940
I remember that five years ago...

549
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,220
Shut up.

550
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,060
Danling,

551
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,380
sit down.

552
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,580
Jingming,

553
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,880
Jiangli is really sharp-tongued now.

554
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,820
You need to talk to her

555
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,540
about the rules of our family.

556
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,900
You're right.

557
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,340
Jiangli,

558
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:03,860
don't be rude.

559
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,260
It seems that Jiangli

560
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,580
is not in the best mood today,

561
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,380
so we won't disturb you any longer.

562
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,580
Jingxiu, let's go home.

563
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:19,900
Let's go.

564
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,060
I'll go get you some more medicine.

565
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,340
Jingxiu,

566
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,820
Shen Jiangli has become

567
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,780
increasingly bold and reckless.

568
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,220
Did you see her arrogance today?

569
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,820
My dear,

570
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,860
why bother with her?

571
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,940
She's not as noble as you.

572
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,170
There are many ways

573
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,780
to punish her in the future.

574
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,020
You're right.

575
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,990
My father is a general.

576
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,580
By the way,

577
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,180
I'm curious about one thing.

578
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,060
What's so special about that sword?

579
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,700
Why did it make Lu Jingming

580
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,700
act like that?

581
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,140
Five years ago,

582
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,620
he underestimated the enemy

583
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,100
and fell into a trap,
causing the entire army

584
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,060
to be wiped out.

585
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,060
The sword I showed him today

586
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,780
has the very totem

587
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,740
of the troops he led at that time.

588
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:37,980
I see.

589
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,260
You're so accomplished in battle

590
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,780
and the lineal eldest son.

591
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,500
The position of Prefect

592
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,500
will definitely be yours.

593
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,220
You needn't worry about him.

594
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:53,940
What's wrong?

595
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,810
Unfortunately,

596
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,350
I'm not lucky enough

597
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,650
to give you

598
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,740
a son or daughter.

599
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,260
Danling.

600
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,340
Danling.

601
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,940
I'm content with you by my side.

602
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:17,180
And I know your heart.

603
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,260
As for the children,

604
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,620
we'll let nature take its course.

605
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,660
We're both still young.

606
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,180
No need to trouble ourselves with it.

607
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,340
Thank you for your understanding.

608
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,900
I'll do my best to help you

609
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,420
secure the position of Young Prefect.

610
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,180
Danling, my dear.

611
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:48,420
(Master Jingming's Mansion)

612
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:52,780
Thank you

613
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:53,860
for today.

614
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,660
It's nothing.

615
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,020
Should I take

616
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,620
another look at your wound?

617
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,380
I've looked at it.

618
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,380
It's fine.

619
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,020
You were too impulsive today.

620
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,860
Didn't you see

621
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,920
they were purposely
causing trouble for you?

622
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,460
It's been five years.

623
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,140
I've long let it go.

624
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,620
Rest well.

625
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,740
I'll leave now.

626
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,980
When's the next treatment?

627
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,380
Didn't you say we'd make a deal?

628
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,420
Since you want a deal,

629
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,380
why don't we show our sincerity first?

630
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,780
I'm now in a precarious situation here.

631
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,380
My mother-in-law

632
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,900
and sister-in-law

633
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,580
keep troubling me.

634
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,300
How can I focus on anything else?

635
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:41,700
So, what do you want?

636
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,340
If you want me to treat you,

637
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,740
you'll first restore my status
as your consort.

638
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,740
You've always been my consort.

639
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,020
That was just an empty title.

640
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,740
I've been treated with contempt

641
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,740
and controlled.

642
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,420
What kind of consort is that?

643
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,500
Moreover,

644
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,420
if one day I'm wronged,
and I'm in a bad mood

645
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,900
and make a mistake with my needle,

646
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,180
don't blame me.

647
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,260
I'll agree to that.
