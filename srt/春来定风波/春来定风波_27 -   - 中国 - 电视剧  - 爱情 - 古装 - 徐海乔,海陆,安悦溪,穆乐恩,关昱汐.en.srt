will you leave

00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,600
with them

28
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,040
and never return?

You heard everything?

30
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,390
It seems we have

31
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,270
finally reached the time to part.

32
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,440
Mr. Chu,

33
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,470
in just this half month,

34
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,320
I've seen with my own eyes

35
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,560
how Jingxiu cast Shen Qilan aside

36
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,040
like worn-out shoes to save himself.

37
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,230
And I've watched Jingming and Jiangli

38
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,480
who used to be a loving couple

39
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,190
go their separate ways.

40
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,320
It makes me feel

41
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,350
that all men in this world

42
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,320
are heartless

43
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,160
and irresponsible.

44
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,840
But Mr. Chu,

45
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,560
you're different.

46
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,040

- Jiangli

47
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,470
is just my junior now.

48
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,960
Right now,

49
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,190
I can't just watch her sink deeper

50
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,030
into the mire.

51
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,880
I understand.

52
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,950
Take Jiangli with you.

53
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,320

There's something

71
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,400
I would like to discuss

72
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,790
with you in the study.

73
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,600
Yao,

74
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,160
you came so late.

75
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,550
What's the matter?

76
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,310
Lady Shu.

77
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,190
Lady Shu.

78
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,680
Jiangli...

79
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,800
Lady Shu,

80
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,520
Jiangli would like to see you.

81
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,520
Take your time.

82
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,200
I'll take my leave.

83
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,550
Jiangli, you've suffered.

84
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,390
Come here.

85
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,310
Take a seat.

86
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,310
You've lost a lot of weight.

87
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,670
Thank you for your concern, Lady Shu.

88
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,080
You must already know

89
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,810
about what happened
between Master Jingming and me.

90
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,110
Yes, I know everything.

91
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,110
It was my failure in teaching my son

92
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,520
that led him to wrong you.

93
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,310
We were fated but not destined.

94
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,200
I won't cling to it.

95
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,160
I came today

96
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,400
just to see Yanyan.

97
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,920
Where is he?

98
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,760
He's dining with the Prefect now.

99
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,040
You know.

100
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,870
The Prefect has been attentive

101
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,970
to Yanyan's studies lately.

102
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,600
Yanyan misses you very much.

103
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,520
He keeps asking

104
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,310
when he can see you.

105
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,110
I came today

106
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,760
to take Yanyan away.

107
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,550
I hope you'll grant me this.

108
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,600
Jiangli,

109
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:59,710
I know

110
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,990
this whole matter

111
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,470
was entirely Jingming's fault.

112
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,160
He let down your sincere heart.

113
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,910
But I believe

114
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,080
there must be a reason behind it.

115
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,310
Jingming isn't someone

116
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,720
who is cold and ungrateful.

117
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:12,950
Perhaps,

118
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,470
in time,

119
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,550
things may take a turn for the better.

120
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,520
I only want to take my child.

121
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,110
The rest has nothing to do

122
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,720
with me anymore.

123
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,160
I told you.
Yanyan is dining with the Prefect.

124
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,200
This is a matter between adults.

125
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,600
Let's not involve the child.

126
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,180
What do you mean by that?

127
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,000
Lady Shu,

128
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,080
as a mother yourself,

129
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,720
are you asking me to be separated

130
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,790
from Yanyan?

131
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,150
Jiangli,

132
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,600
I understand your pain as a mother.

133
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,080
But Yanyan is also

134
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,600
our eldest grandson.

135
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,200
Forget me.

136
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,960
The Prefect would never

137
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,400
allow you to take Yanyan away.

138
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:03,850
You know how much the Prefect

139
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,160
loves Yanyan.

140
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,500
He is grooming him wholeheartedly.

141
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,720
Yanyan may inherit his position
in the future.

142
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,110
I don't need my child
to inherit that position.

143
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,670
I just want to take him away.

144
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,040
But

145
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,720
if you take Yanyan away,

146
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,670
then we'll never get to see him again.

147
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,720
If I leave Yanyan behind,

148
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,870
as his mother,
I'll have to part with him.

149
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,000
That won't happen.

150
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,080
Once things settle down,

151
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,230
I'll plead with the Prefect
on your behalf,

152
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,230
so you'll have a chance to visit Yanyan.

153
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,790
After all, you're his birth mother.

154
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,910
Let me be honest with you.

155
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,280
You absolutely can't

156
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,870
take Yanyan away.

157
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,710
Lady Shu...

158
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,430
Let Yanyan leave with her.

159
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,560
Nonsense.

160
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,640
Actually, it was the princess's idea.

161
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:10,950
On one hand,

162
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,350
she feels that if Yanyan

163
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,520
stays in the mansion,

164
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,710
as a stepmother,

165
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,920
if she doesn't do well in the future,

166
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,470
she'll be criticized.

167
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,270
And

168
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,080
if later on, she and I

169
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,110
have our child,

170
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,470
she doesn't know how to treat him.

171
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,150
Also,

172
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,750
Yanyan's character is like his mother's.

173
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,920
Once he makes up his mind,

174
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,710
nothing can change it.

175
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,640
If you deceive him

176
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,550
and force them to separate,

177
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,040
he'll grow distant from you.

178
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,000
It's better

179
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,240
to let her take him.

180
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,590
You have no more concerns now.

181
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You should leave asap.

192
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,000
won't Father come with us?

193

♪You'll think of me, in every trace♪

194
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,000
Your father and I

195
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,140
have important matters to deal with.

196
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,520
We must part now.

197
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,430
I understand. It's only temporary.

198
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,120
We'll be back soon.

199
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,160
Goodbye, Father.

200
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,760
I will take good care of Mother.

201
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,880
Be good, Yanyan.

202
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,270
Please.

203
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,670
Can I trust you?

204
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,070
Actually,

205
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,190
things aren't as you think.

206
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,710
I don't care

207
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,790
about the hidden reasons.

208
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,520
I only remember that you

209
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,400
once promised

210
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,310
to take care of Jiangli for life.

211
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,040
But now, she's enduring

212
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,160
the pain and humiliation.

213
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,880
Is this the promise you once made?

214
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,630
Five years ago,

215
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,370
I led troops to fight
in the Battle of Lingshui.

216
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,580
In the end, we were ambushed.

217
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,640
The entire army

218
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,760
was wiped out, except for me.

219
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,600
All these years,

220
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,190
I've been searching for the truth.

221
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,000
Only recently

222
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,580
did I uncover the truth.

223
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,000
The one who betrayed the country

224
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,880
was my eldest brother.

225
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,950
Not only that,

226
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,140
he's also allied with Xizhou,

227
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,510
putting the people in Dongzhou
in even greater danger.

228
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,880
That's why

229
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,400
I've been planning this wedding

230
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,400
with Princess Chuya.

231
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,310
The goal is

232
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,070
to capture my brother

233
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,880
when he acts

234
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,380
and secure peace for both states.

235
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,240
As for Jiangli,

236
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,880
I had to deceive her.

237
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,360
Only if my brother believes

238
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,710
I've cut all ties with Jiangli

239
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,400
will he not target them.

240
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,880
In case anything

241
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,160
goes wrong,

242
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,790
they can

243
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,430
escape unharmed.

244
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,520
Have you considered

245
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,360
the danger in all this?

246
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,480
I never thought
I could walk away unscathed.

247
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,910
So, I had no choice
but to use this method

248
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,930
to force Jiangli to leave.

249
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,160
Even if she hates me,

250
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,120
I can't let them

251
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,310
face any danger.

252
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,390

00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,360
I didn't know

273
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,270
you had a private villa like this.

274

278
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,400
I've prepared a villa

279
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,360
for them.

280
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,280

281
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,070
and it's very secluded.

00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,580
I've also sent a team of guards

283
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,880
to protect them at all times.

someone has been

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,300
visiting Jingxiu frequently.

290
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,750
It seems

291
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,070
he's ready to act.

292
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,670
We must remain cautious.

293
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,150

00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,760
I had a nightmare.

304
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,280
I dreamed

305
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,480
that you wanted to divorce me

306
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,400
and marry Chuya.

307
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,590
Didn't we promise each other

308
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,240
we'd never part

309
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,120
in this life?

310
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,670
We've already parted once.

311
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,550
I don't want to part again.

312
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,120

00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,470
You're awake.

317
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,920
My head hurts a little.

318
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,310
I don't even know how I fell asleep.

319
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,090
You've been traveling these days,

320
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,000
caught in the rain and a cold,

321
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,400
and you've been burning with fever.

322
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,630
Take your medicine.

323
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,080
Come on.

324
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,360
I admit.

325
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,440
I can't let go right away.

326
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,520

Zimo,

330
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,520
if someone

331
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,280
lets go of your hand the first time,

332
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,630
and you choose to forgive them,

333
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,480
yet they choose to let go again,

334
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,200
will you still wait at the same spot?

335
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,620
This time, it is your choice.

336
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,190
Actually,

337
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,150
Jingming...

338
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,280
I've thought it through.

339
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,630
From now on,

340
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,110
I'll part ways with him.

341
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,870
Even if my heart still hurts,

342
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,390
I can heal myself.

343
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,950
In the future,

344
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,720
I'll live my life well.

345
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,230
Alright.

346
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,390
Then I'll be responsible

347
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,040
for helping you recover.

348

Jingming will marry
the Grand Princess of Xizhou

Forget it.

361
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,720
Since it's come to this,

362
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,250
there's no point in saying more.

363
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,590

Come out now!

365
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,920
He abandoned his wife.

366
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,480
If I don't scold him,

367
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,310
everyone will think my family

368
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,150
is full of such cold-hearted men.

369
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,920

I will never

373
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,200
be like him.

374
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,600
Come out!

375
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,190
Jingming,

376
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,070

00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,440
Shen has already left the city.

382
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,070
It seems Master Jingming

383
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,450
is really determined to marry

384
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,390
the Grand Princess of Xizhou.

385
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,480
Yes. Who would've thought

386
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,310
Master Jingming would be
so shameless?

387
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,350
Master Jingxing and his wife

388
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,790
stood at his door

389
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,170
and scolded him for quite a while,

390
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,520
but the door remained shut,

391
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,650
and he refused to meet them.

392
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,350
If he marries Princess Chuya,

393
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,680
the position of the Young Prefect

394
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,070
will be within his grasp.

395
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,760
Naturally, he won't care

396
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,000
about the criticism.

397
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,040
Yes.

398
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,630
We can't let Princess Chuya

399
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,000
marry Lu Jingming.

400
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,430
Otherwise,

401
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,110
there's nothing to gain for us.

402
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,550
But with the current situation,

403
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,350
I'm afraid it's too late to stop it.

404
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,390
Young Master.

405
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,790
You may leave.

406
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,390
- Yes.
- Yes.

407
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,160
Young Master, something's wrong.

408
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,480
What happened?

409
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,590
There's news from Xizhou.

410
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,760
Wen Du has confessed.

411
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,880
What?

412
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,790
Our spy in Xizhou reported

413
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,720
that Princess Chuya
tortured Wen Du so badly

414
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,060
that he couldn't hold on anymore.

415
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,350
He revealed everything.

416
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,690
He was rescued by his subordinates,

417
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,390
and now they're planning a coup.

418
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,000
This means

419
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,920
Lu Jingming has investigated everything

420
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,680
about the events from five years ago.

421
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,440
I wondered why he's been

422
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,830
so close to Princess Chuya lately.

423
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,480
She's even come to me secretly
multiple times.

424
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,830
So, this was all part of their plot.

425
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,600
This means

426
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,760
the wedding

427
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,920
cannot happen.

428
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,720
Such overwhelming power

429
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:37,870
is too much for anyone to bear.

430
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,720
If you get something

431
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,200
that's not meant for you,

432
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,830
the only end is

433
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,150
death before you can enjoy it.

434
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,350
Wen Du has rebelled.

435
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,900
My child said the pay was good

436
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,110
if he went to fight in Xizhou.

437
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,480
With the sudden war coming,

438
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,630
he is gone...

439
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,400
Young Master, we're at your command.

440
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,560
Let's go.

441
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:14,710
Let's go!

442
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:30,140
(Master Jingming's Mansion)

443
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,080
Jingming.

444
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,140
Are you waiting for me?

445
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,580
On the night before my wedding,

446
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,000
Jingxiu, did you rush over

447
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,920
to congratulate me in advance?

448
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,480
So, this was your plan

449
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,390
to trap me.

450
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,200
This so-called wedding

451
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,550
was just a cover-up.

452
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,860
The goal was to expose

453
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:00,520
the traitors who betrayed the country.

454
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,680
Jingxiu, are you here tonight

455
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,110
to strike against your own brother?

456
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,150
Oh, I forgot

457
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,440
that this isn't the first time

458
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,150
you'd plotted against your siblings.

459
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,310
What do you mean?

460
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,550
Five years ago,

461
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,500
I led the army to fight
in the Battle of Lingshui.

462
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:30,910
Master Jingxiu

463
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,280
and General Wen Du of Xizhou

464
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,280
set up an ambush,

465
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,040
and my entire army was wiped out.

466
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,830
The final order from Master Jingxiu
and Wen Du

467
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,960
was to kill everyone

468
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,040
and leave no one alive.

469
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,390
Did you know Shuyu was there too?

470
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,830
I didn't want her to go at the time,

471
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,550
but she insisted.

472
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,390
Shuyu,

473
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,330
come back with me.

474
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:59,380
(Lu Shuyu, Grand Princess of Dongzhou)
No, Jingxiu.

475
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,680
I'm going to fight with Jingming.

476
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,110
The situation is critical,

477
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,410
and the danger is unpredictable.

478
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,690
You mustn't risk your life.

479
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,310
If it's dangerous, then I must go.

480
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,040
As the Grand Princess of Dongzhou,

481
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,040
I can't retreat even a step.

482
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,520
You might lose your life.

483
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,430
Jingxiu,

484
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,680
let's drink when I win and return.

485
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,680
Go.

486
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,590
Shuyu.

487
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,430
Shuyu!

488
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,680
You killed Shuyu.

489
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,870
You failed to protect our sister.

490
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,000
At this point,

491
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,960
you're still trying

492
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,000
to twist the truth.

493
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,760
Tell me.

494
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,920
What else do you know?

495
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,320
Over the years,

496
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,040
you have been

497
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,480
in cahoots with General Wen Du
of Xizhou

498
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,590
and have instigated many battles

499
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,150
between Dongzhou and Xizhou

500
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,130
and exaggerated the military situation.

501
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,920
Wen Du wanted to amass wealth.

502
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,310
What about you?

503
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,040
Jiangli asked

504
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,790
Wind Pavilion to gather the intel.

505
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,420
They told me

506
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,980
all the military funds you received

507
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,110
were channeled into Jinsheng Bank

508
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,720
and then went through the bank

509
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,830
to several mountain villages.

510
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,790
At first, I was curious,

511
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,830
thinking maybe you were funding bandits.

512
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,000
But I had Qilin Guards
investigate later.

513
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,960
The so-called bandits

514
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,590
were your private troops.

515
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,310
All these years,
I really underestimated you.

516
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,150
That's right.

517
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,920
You know too much,

518
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,040
so I can't let you live.

519
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:46,950
Guards!

520
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,600
Let's go.

521
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,080
Lu Jingming,

522
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,650
since we're brothers,

523
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:07,950
surrender.

524
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,310
I might spare your life.

525
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,840
Is that all?

526
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,440
Lu Jingming,
you're overestimating yourself.

527
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:28,030
You've said it yourself.
I have private troops outside.

528
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,080
Now,

529
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,920
the ones surrounding you

530
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,150
are all my men.

531
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,880
Lu Jingming,

532
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,790
the force behind me is Xizhou,

533
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:46,070
the strongest military power.

534
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,890
What do you have to fight me with?

535
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,630
You've become close to Chuya,

536
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,280
but now she can't even protect herself.

537
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,280
Master Jingxiu,

538
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,790
General Wen Du has been
executed on the spot.

539
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,000
If you're short on men,

540
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,320
there are 100,000 soldiers

541
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,240
at your border.

542
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,860
The one who should surrender

543
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,760
is you.

544
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,320
Jingxiu,

545
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,550
aren't you going to repent?

546
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,630
Lu Jingming,

547
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,070
was this all part of your plan?

548
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,760
Fine.

549
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,520
You won today.

550
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,390
I'll make sure

551
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,870
the two states never reconcile.

552
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,720
Master Jingming...

553
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,560
Master Jingming.

554
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,040
Tell me.

555
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,920
What's really going on?

556
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,760
To the victor goes the spoils.

557
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,240
I have no words to say.

558
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,760
You...

559
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,190
Father,

560
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,550
Jingxiu orchestrated

561
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,550
this plague incident.

562
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,040
We found horse feed in the medicine.

563
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,350
After an investigation,

564
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,830
we found the coachman

565
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,150
who tampered with the medicine.

566
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,040
He has been arrested.

567
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,870
He confessed to everything

568
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:40,810
Jingxiu told him to do.

569
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,590
Jingxiu intended to frame Jingming,

570
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,830
but by mistake,
Jiangli ended up taking the blame.

571
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,210
As for what happened just now,

572
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,520
the dare-to-die killers
outside have confessed.

573
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,520
They said Jingxiu's order was

574
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,960
to eliminate everyone

575
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,000
in Jingming's mansion.

576
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,870
Eliminate everyone?

577
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,590
The dare-to-die killers outside

578
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,520
are soldiers from your Golden Guards.

579
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,200
How could you be

580
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,760
so ruthless?

581
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:10,990
Jingxiu,

582
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,390
you were the man
I admired most in my youth.

583
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,680
I never thought

584
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,920
you'd do this

585
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,350
to your own brother.

586
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,200
Not only that,

587
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,200
but you also disregarded
the lives of the people.

588
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,040
You are beyond saving.

589
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,310
I thought you were simply ambitious,

590
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,480
but now I see you are truly malicious.

591
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,480
I even told Danling before

592
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:34,930
that you were the only one

593
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,340
in Dongzhou worthy of her.

594
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,580
Alas, she ended up like this
because of me.

595
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,240
When she was still your consort,

596
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,870
she toiled diligently for years for you,

597
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,480
yet you gave her contraceptive medicine,

598
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,440
making her unable to become a mother.

599
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,390
General Wang,

600
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,150
you forced me to do this.

601
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,960
All these years,
you've held military power

602
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,000
and earned great merit.

603
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,790
If Danling had my child,

604
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,110
and you turned against me,

605
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,920
wouldn't that become your leverage?

606
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,630
You overestimate yourself.

607
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,280
You've brought all of this

608
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,280
upon yourself.

609
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,040
What a beast!

610
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,550
Do you know
how many innocent lives were lost

611
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,790
and how many people became homeless

612
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:18,150
because of what you've done?

613
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,760
Father,

614
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,150
you're a good prefect,

615
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,550
but you're too stuck in your ways.

616
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,240
If all four states agree

617
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,680
to let me be their ruler,

618
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,440
wouldn't that bring peace to the land?

619
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,720
Those are just a few ants.

620
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,920
What do they matter?

621
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,960
You scoundrel!

622
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,310
Are human lives only ants to you?

623
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,520
What makes you think

624
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,240
you can ensure
there will be no more wars?

625
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,650
What makes you think you're capable

626
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:48,140
of managing all four states?

627
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,440
It's your fault.

628
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,790
You refused to pass the position

629
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:52,920
of the Prefect to me sooner.

630
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:55,270
Otherwise, I would've given you
my answer long ago.

631
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,150
Your answer?

632
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,040
Is this the answer you give me?

633
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,830
You accused me

634
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,870
of treating the people's lives as ants.

635
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,150
But what I want is
to end war and suffering

636
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:09,150
for the people of Dongzhou.

637
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,960
Think about it, Father.

638
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,200
If I become the ruler of four states

639
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:14,960
and unify the land,

640
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,390
wouldn't that mean an end to war?

641
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,550
To achieve such everlasting glory,

642
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:22,480
how could there be no bloodshed?

643
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,480
Isn't that right, Father?

644
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,300
For your so-called power,

645
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,150
you've gone mad,

646
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:28,760
harming innocent people,

647
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,000
even your own siblings.

648
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,390
Guards,

649
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,550
detain Master Jingxiu.

650
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,200
From now on,
he is demoted to a commoner.

651
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,360
He may not leave the mansion anymore.

652
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,200
Father...

653
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,190
- Get up.
- Father...

654
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,800
Father...

655
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,200
Father.

656
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,430
Father...

657
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,800
My Lord.

658
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,320
Your Grace, you're here.

659
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,880
Your Grace.

660
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,840
Regarding what's happened
in Dongzhou recently,

661
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,970
it was because I failed to teach my son.

662
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,520
Sorry about this.

663
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,190
Please accept my apology.

664
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:13,990
Well,

665
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,270
your marriage with Jingming...

666
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,620
My Lord, no need to apologize.

667
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,670
Master Jingming and I are close friends

668
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,160
and never truly intended to marry.

669
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,400
This was all part of the plan.

670
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:26,110
Rest assured.

671
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,400
I've reported everything to Xizhou.

672
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,800
During my time in Dongzhou,

673
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,480
I've seen what Princess Qingqing
and the masters

674
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,480
have done for the people

675
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,520
and their well-being.

676
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,240
I believe Dongzhou

677
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:41,070
will surely stand proud

678
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,520
among the four states.

679
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,630
We in Xizhou

680
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,580
have no intention of losing
such a valuable ally.

681
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:48,280
Aside from the betrothal
between Master Jingming and me,

682
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:49,340
none of the other terms

683
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,270
will be changed.

684
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,920
Your Grace,

685
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,840
thank you for your understanding.

686
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,190
Are you

687
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,840
about to return to Xizhou?

688
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,920
Yes. I'll depart the day after tomorrow.

689
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,710
After I return,

690
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,750
the terms will be implemented
one by one.

691
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,720
Very well.

692
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:09,400
Your Grace,

693
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,960
allow me

694
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,270
