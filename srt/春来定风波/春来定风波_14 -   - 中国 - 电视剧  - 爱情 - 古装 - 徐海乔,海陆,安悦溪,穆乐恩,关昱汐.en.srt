22
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,310
Be careful over there.

23
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,210
Did you hear me?

24
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,120
Put this over here.

25
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,040
Got it?

26
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,920
Look at the Shen family.

27
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,030
Both daughters
married the Prefect's sons.

28
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,800
Such good fortune.

29
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,840
She's just a concubine,

30
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,390
yet the wedding's so extravagant.

31
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,030
It's a marriage granted
by the Prefect.

32
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,080
Of course, it's different.

33
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,740
(Happiness)

34
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,670
Higher.

35
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,350
Like this?

36
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,770
What about here, Fuling?

37
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,990
Is it too low?

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,920
- Is it okay?
- Here?

39
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:32,910
Jiangli.

40
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,830
You look beautiful.

41
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,600
You finally came.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,030
Now that you're here,

43
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,790
I feel so much more at ease.

44
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,000
Do I look good?

45
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,910
Consort Jiangli, you're up so early.

46
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,430
The auspicious hour is still far off.

47
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,280
You didn't have to come so soon.

48
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,880
I care about my sister's wedding,

49
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,920
so I came to keep her company.

50
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,480
She went to the ancestral tomb
for reflection.

51
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,640
How unlucky.

52
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,230
I can tell

53
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,230
Master Jingxiu really values you.

54
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,520
This ceremony

55
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,280
isn't much different
from that of a consort.

56
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,410
He said

57
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,000
it's a marriage granted by the Prefect,

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,320
so it has to be done properly.

59
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,710
Jingxiu is thoughtful.

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,110
It seems you'll live a good life.

61
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,190
Of course.

62
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,120
My daughter

63
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,390
is blessed.

64
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,600
She'll be favored by her husband.

65
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,110
There are many good days to come.

66
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,200
Whether the days are good or not

67
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,160
depends on how you live them.

68
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,240
I understand.

69
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,270
Jiangli, come and look.

70
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,920
Come and see these.

71
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,030
Master Jingxiu

72
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,550
prepared these for me.

73
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,390
These are clothes for all four seasons

74
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,360
and matching jewelry for each.

75
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,400
Master Jingxiu
actually prepared everything.

76
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,960
- Do they look nice?
- Yes.

77
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,980
They suit you perfectly.

78
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,960
Have a look and see

79
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,010
if there's anything else
he gave you that you like.

80
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,320
What's this?

81
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,320
Wedding candles.

82
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,080
Only a wife gets to use these.

83
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,440
Even I didn't get to.

84
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,830
On the wedding night,

85
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:22,390
if the candles burn through the night,

86
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,800
the couple

87
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,350
will grow old together in love.

88
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,910
But

89
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,430
if they go out halfway...

90
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,350
Stop it.

91
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,740
I won't say such unlucky things.

92
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,160
Master Jingming.

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,820
Master Jingming,
urgent news from the border.

94
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,140
Wait for me. I'll be right back.

95
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,900
The Prefect has summoned you
to the mansion

96
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,100
to discuss border affairs.

97
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,120
Master Jingming.

98
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,820
(Happiness)

99
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,640
Jiangli...

100
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,870
Look at me rushing around.

101
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,320
I forgot to pour you tea.

102
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,620
Fuling, serve tea.

103
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,900
Yes.

104
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,900
No need.

105
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,820
Don't trouble yourself.

106
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,620
I'll go for a walk.

107
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,500
Mother,

108
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,420
speak more respectfully to Jiangli.

109
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,800
She's just upset because Master Jingxiu
treats you so well.

110
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,680
She's jealous. That's all.

111
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,820
Jiangli isn't like that.

112
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,580
Don't assume the worst

113
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,660
of everyone.

114
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,380
Besides,

115
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,740
this marriage

116
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,500
only happened thanks to her.

117
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,100
Fine, fine.

118
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,740
Now, even my daughter

119
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,100
lectures me every day.

120
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,060
Forget it.

121
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,140
Let's not talk about that.

122
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,380
Come here.

123
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,250
Come and sit.

124
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:58,980
So beautiful.

125
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,860
Before,

126
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,220
I even considered

127
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,580
having you marry Master Jingming.

128
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,380
But now,

129
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,900
Master Jingxiu truly dotes on you.

130
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,820
Even though you're only my daughter,

131
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,860
you're better off than Shen Jiangli.

132
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,940
Once a woman is married,

133
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,860
no matter how noble her family is,

134
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,700
her husband's affection
is what matters most.

135
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,700
Without it,

136
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,900
even the most powerful maiden home

137
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,780
is just a paper tiger,

138
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,460
and one poke will make it fall apart.

139
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,140
I understand.

140
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,650
Once you marry Master Jingxiu,

141
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,300
you'll have to compete with the consort.

142
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,260
In talent and looks,

143
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,020
she can't compare to you.

144
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,700
Besides,

145
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,620
you have Master Jingxiu's affection.

146
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,380
Mother,

147
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,460
I've never wanted
to compete with anyone.

148
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,180
I just want

149
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,980
to marry the one I love.

150
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,700
She's the wife.

151
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,180
Once I'm in the house,
I'll have to listen to her.

152
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,580
Wang Danling is not easy to handle.

153
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,020
Alright.

154
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,460
I'm off to tend to things.

155
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,780
Fuling, let's go.

156
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,740
I understand.

157
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,540
You don't have to follow me.

158
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,540
I want to be alone for a bit.

159
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,620
This is Shen Mansion.

160
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,340
No one will harm me.

161
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,700
Yes, Jiangli.

162
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,580
Your mother had always been healthy.

163
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,460
Then, for some reason,

164
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,220
she suddenly went mad

165
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,540
and often talked nonsense,

166
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,220
saying things we couldn't understand.

167
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,460
When your mother passed away,

168
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,220
Ms. Zou and Ms. Tian

169
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,460
blamed the servants
for neglecting your mother

170
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,300
and expelled all the maids

171
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,540
who attended to her.

172
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,740
They even falsely accused me
of stealing valuable items

173
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,300
and

174
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,060
kicked me out.

175
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,580
(Master Jingxiu's Mansion)

176
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,500
Please come in.

177
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,420
Be careful.

178
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,200
- Congrats.
- Congrats.

179
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,980
Congratulations.

180
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,900
Thank you.

181
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,460
(Zou Jiaoyue)

182
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,740
(is more clever than Tian Xiaozhen.)

183
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,060
(She knows she should seize control
of the household finances.)

184
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,460
- Hurry.
- Move.

185
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,500
(Master Jingxiu's Mansion)

186
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,660
- Hurry.
- Hurry.

187
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,420
Move.

188
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,460
Master Jingming.

189
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,860
It's Jingxiu's wedding today.

190
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,420
Why tie him up?

191
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,100
This is a kitchen helper.

192
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,860
He got into a fight with the chef.

193
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,980
It's a joyous day.

194
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,700
We were afraid
he might offend the guests,

195
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,340
so we took him out to calm down.

196
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,080
Master Jingming, please go inside.

197
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,700
Master Jingxiu was
just asking about you.

198
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,820
Got it. Carry on.

199
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,980
Yes.

200
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,420
Let's go.

201
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,340
- Move.
- Move.

202
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,420
Jingming.

203
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,100
Jingxiu.

204
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,820
Why haven't you come in?

205
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,460
Congrats, Jingxiu.

206
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,480
You'll get married today.

207
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,940
Jingming,

208
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,780
you have Qilin Guards,

209
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,260
I have Golden Guards,

210
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,940
and both of us married daughters

211
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,180
of the Shen family.

212
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,980
You married the lineal daughter,

213
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,460
and I married a concubine's daughter.

214
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,860
It seems you always outshine me.

215
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,940
Jingxiu, you jest.

216
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,900
We're family.

217
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,780
We share the same father,

218
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,900
and both serve to protect
the people of Dongzhou.

219
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,860
There's no such thing as outshining.

220
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,540
Alright.

221
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,300
Come in and have a drink.

222
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,820
Let's go.

223
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:04,100
(Master Jingxiu's Mansion)

224
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,980
(When Tian Xiaozhen rose in status,)

225
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,500
(she was extremely favored.)

226
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,900
(But she wasn't smart enough)

227
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,540
(to understand)

228
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,740
(that love fades with beauty.)

229
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,020
This is my mother's bracelet.

230
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,580
This...

231
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,220
Shen Qilan is marrying Master Jingxiu,

232
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,300
so Zou Jiaoyue

233
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,060
thinks she's become a phoenix now.

234
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,500
Now that this has happened,

235
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,940
they must be in a frenzy.

236
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,020
I need to get some wine.

237
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,460
Later,

238
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,540
there will be a good show.

239
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,340
This...

240
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:07,940
This...

241
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,300
How can this work?

242
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,860
Mother.

243
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,020
Consort Jiangli.

244
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,420
Consort Jiangli.

245
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,340
Please help Miss Qilan.

246
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,340
Get up.

247
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,460
What happened?

248
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,500
Consort Danling sent over

249
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,660
a wedding gown,

250
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,260
but it's badly damaged.

251
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,820
There's no time left to repair it.

252
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,300
Miss Shen Qilan

253
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,740
is just too delicate, isn't she?

254
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,220
Even Consort Danling's gift
isn't good enough.

255
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,580
I suppose she'll only accept something

256
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,140
from the Queen Mother of the West.

257
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,540
- Miss Yuzhu.
- You...

258
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,060
That's too harsh.

259
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,780
It's just that the gown...

260
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,660
Don't worry.

261
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,620
Let me take a look.

262
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,180
This was clearly

263
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,340
deliberately slashed.

264
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,260
How dare you!

265
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,440
Consort Danling would never
do such a thing.

266
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,940
She's such a kind woman.

267
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,420
I know that better than anyone.

268
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,980
Is that right, Yuzhu?

269
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,620
Yes.

270
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,680
Consort Jiangli, you are so reasonable.

271
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,180
Even Miss Shen Qilan's maid is so rude.

272
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,660
I wonder what that says

273
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,740
about her mistress's morals.

274
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,220
You...

275
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,140
Mother.

276
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,100
Consort Danling is
from a military family.

277
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,420
She's educated and well-mannered.

278
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,740
Yuzhu,

279
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,380
I just realized

280
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,340
you haven't greeted me yet.

281
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,820
Greetings, Consort Jiangli.

282
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,220
Consort Danling ordered me

283
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,420
to deliver the gown and jewelry.

284
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,260
It's my first time handling such a task,

285
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,380
and I lack experience.

286
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,060
If I've offended Miss Shen Qilan

287
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,620
in any way,

288
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,620
please forgive me.

289
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,460
This marriage
was arranged so suddenly,

290
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,700
and we just spent

291
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,260
all our money on disaster relief.

292
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,940
Consort Danling

293
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,420
has already done her best

294
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,140
to prepare everything
for Miss Shen Qilan.

295
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,260
Who would've thought

296
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,500
a rat would chew the wedding gown?

297
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,340
It's as if fate itself

298
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,500
is trying to stop Miss Shen Qilan

299
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,700
from marrying Master Jingxiu.

300
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,180
You've gone too far.

301
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,100
Mother.

302
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,840
Consort Danling
has thought of everything.

303
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,980
Everything I need

304
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,940
has been fully prepared.

305
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,060
Please pass on my gratitude

306
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,100
to Consort Danling, Miss Yuzhu.

307
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,900
Miss Shen Qilan,

308
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,260
if you dislike the gown

309
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,280
Consort Danling prepared,

310
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,300
you may try this backup instead.

311
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,260
However,

312
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,500
you should think carefully.

313
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,420
Don't let others

314
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,420
laugh at our mansion.

315
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,660
If we don't stand up to them,

316
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,180
they'll think we're easy targets.

317
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,860
My goodness.

318
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,140
Luckily, they brought a new one.

319
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,460
This is Wang Danling's wedding gown.

320
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,340
How could Qilan wear hers?

321
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,420
That's not right.

322
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,860
But the pink gown is in tatters.

323
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,100
If I wear it,

324
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,400
it'll embarrass both the Shen family
and Master Jingxiu.

325
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,780
But

326
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,260
if I wear the wife's gown,

327
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,580
it would be a grave offense.

328
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,500
What should I do?

329
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,300
The wedding procession is on its way.

330
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,260
We can't delay the auspicious hour.

331
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,660
Oh, my dear daughter.

332
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,220
What should we do, Qilan?

333
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,140
Mother.

334
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,430
Consort Jiangli,

335
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,960
please help Qilan.

336
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,700
You hold the same rank
as Consort Danling,

337
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,620
and she's always been wary of you.

338
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,820
If you speak

339
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,860
on Qilan's behalf,

340
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,580
I'm sure she won't oppose you

341
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,900
and make things hard for Qilan.

342
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,820
Mother,

343
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,740
this isn't appropriate.

344
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,020
Jiangli already stood up
for me just now.

345
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,500
If she had another conflict

346
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,620
with Consort Danling because of me,

347
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,340
she'd be accused of meddling

348
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,920
in her brother-in-law's family affairs.

349
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,460
This is the path I chose.

350
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,180
In that case,

351
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,940
I'll wear it.

352
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,180
Qilan, you mustn't.

353
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,780
You mustn't.

354
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,180
- Mother.
- You can't.

355
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,100
- Mother.
- Qilan.

356
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,420
Ms. Zou,

357
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,900
you're overacting.

358
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,740
Forget it.

359
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,260
It's not hard to solve this.

360
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:38,900
Consort Jiangli,

361
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,300
I knew you'd find a way

362
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,260
to help Qilan.

363
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,980
I'm helping her,

364
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,100
not you.

365
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,780
If you want your daughter

366
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,800
to have a grand wedding,

367
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,260
then from now on,

368
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,260
stay out of my sight.

369
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,740
Yes, yes.

370
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,820
As long as Qilan gets help,

371
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,980
I won't get in your way.

372
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,300
No, no.

373
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,860
If...

374
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:06,140
(Master Jingxiu's Mansion)

375
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:34,660
(Happiness)

376
00:19:55,540 --> 00:20:02,540
(Master Jingxiu's Mansion)

377
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,740
Where are you going?

378
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,340
It's your brother's wedding.

379
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,020
Shouldn't you stay a bit longer?

380
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,020
Master Jingming,

381
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,820
you won't even pretend
to respect him now?

382
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,580
Why?

383
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,820
Do you want me to stay

384
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,900
and keep you company?

385
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,180
Don't flatter yourself.

386
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,900
I'm just letting you know

387
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,840
there's going to be a great show later.

388
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,140
I'm sure it'll be dramatic.

389
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,780
Let me remind you.

390
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,380
You should know your place.

391
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,860
Don't get yourself into trouble.

392
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,600
I've got something important to handle.

393
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,020
I have to go now.

394
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,180
What is it? Do you need any help?

395
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,460
Wait for my news.

396
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,500
The ceremony is about to begin.

397
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,420
I'll head inside.

398
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,860
Stay safe.

399
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:45,970
You too.

400
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,140
- Thank you.
- Congrats.

401
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,150
Great.

402
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,000
Congratulations.

403
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,300
Consort Danling, Consort Jiangli.

404
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,890
Great wine.

405
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:59,780
Congratulations.

406
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,660
Consort Jiangli.

407
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,180
Congratulations.

408
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,820
Today is a joyful day
for Master Jingxiu.

409
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,780
I should be congratulating you.

410
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,060
Then allow me
to congratulate your sister

411
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,220
who finally got what she wished for.

412
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,500
Congratulate you

413
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,620
on gaining another

414
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,140
capable helper in the household.

415
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,740
My Lady,

416
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,380
she wore that pink gown.

417
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,740
It was so slashed up.

418
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,540
People must've seen her body.

419
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,660
Master Jingxiu is bound
to abandon her on the spot.

420
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,980
I knew it.

421
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,580
Shen Jiangli wouldn't sit still

422
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,060
and had to help her sister,

423
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,340
but she'd only make things worse.

424
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,540
Consort Jiangli.

425
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,620
(Happiness)

426
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,860
First bow.

427
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,380
Second bow.

428
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,940
Third bow.

429
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,340
How dare you.

430
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,420
Shen Qilan,

431
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,120
though the Prefect granted

432
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,500
your marriage with Master Jingxiu,

433
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,900
don't forget

434
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,660
you're just a concubine.

435
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,540
As a concubine,

436
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,620
you should know your place.

437
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,860
What's with this wedding gown?

438
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,100
Are you trying to step over me?

439
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,940
Danling,

440
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,340
what are you doing?

441
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,260
Wearing a red wedding gown is one thing,

442
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,300
but how could you steal my wedding gown?

443
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,100
Do you think you should

444
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,620
be the consort here?

445
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,300
Miss Yuzhu sent

446
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,520
this gown to Shen Mansion.

447
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,500
I know I shouldn't wear

448
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,100
a red gown to offend you,

449
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,660
but my wedding gown's

450
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,840
inner garments are in tatters,

451
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,740
so I had no choice

452
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,860
but to wear this red garment.

453
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,020
But I didn't know

454
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,700
it was your gown.

455
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,340
I might've made a mistake

456
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,540
and sent your wedding gown
to Shen Manson.

457
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,500
But even if I made a mistake,

458
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,060
you should know

459
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,580
this is Consort Danling's wedding gown.

460
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,420
Everyone knows

461
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,460
the general had Consort Danling's

462
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,540
wedding gown

463
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,140
custom-made for her wedding.

464
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,560
The waistband even has

465
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,180
a golden Wang character embroidered.

466
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,900
Consort Danling's personal maid

467
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,180
is always meticulous,

468
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,020
yet she sent the wrong gown.

469
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,620
What a coincidence.

470
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,980
My maid made a mistake,

471
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,340
so I'll punish her myself.

472
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,980
Consort Jiangli,

473
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,060
are you covering for your sister?

474
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,180
Stop twisting the truth.

475
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,740
Master Jingxiu,

476
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,380
Shen Qilan is a concubine,

477
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,860
yet she's wearing my wedding gown

478
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,020
to offend me.

479
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,900
- Take it off!
- Consort Danling.

480
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,820
- Let go!
- Danling.

481
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,180
Let go of me!

482
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,300
Danling.

483
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,300
Consort Danling,

484
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,740
look closely.

485
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,260
Is this really your inner garment?

486
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,860
The garment Consort Danling prepared

487
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,900
is already ruined.

488
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,300
If Qilan had worn it,

489
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,220
she'd only have embarrassed
Master Jingxiu.

490
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,860
So, I had a swift servant

491
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,340
fetch my wedding inner garment

492
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,060
from my mansion

493
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,080
and then lent it to Qilan

494
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,500
to save her dignity.

495
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,660
Consort Danling,

496
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,740
let me ask you.

497
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,780
What's wrong with Qilan wearing

498
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,260
her sister's wedding gown?

499
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,500
Even if a concubine

500
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,620
has done something wrong,

501
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,900
you shouldn't tear a girl's clothes

502
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,180
in front of so many people.

503
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,300
How will she face others in the future?

504
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,180
You've married Master Jingxiu for years,

505
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,060
yet you still
don't understand the rules?

506
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,060
I've never done anything

507
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,460
improper or disrespectful.

508
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,060
Consort Danling, why are you
treating me like this?

509
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,820
Good.

510
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,100
You two

511
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,380
schemed together to frame me.

512
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,420
Have you lost your mind?

513
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,080
There are so many people watching.

514
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,220
Who tore the wedding gown?

515
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,300
- I...
- Wang Danling.

516
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,420
Enough!

517
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,500
Leave!

518
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,300
Everyone,

519
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,500
my wife is handling the wedding
for the first time.

520
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,220
If there's anything improper,

521
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,900
please forgive us.

522
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,500
We've prepared wine and delicacies.

523
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,860
Please enjoy them.

524
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,900
Thank you, Master Jingxiu.

525
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,380
Who are you?

526
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,460
I don't know you.

527
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,900
Why did you bring me here?

528
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,060
You know my wife

529
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,780
but not me?

530
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,500
Let me remind you.

531
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,540
You designed a trap

532
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,180
to harm my wife

533
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,700
on the mountain.

534
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,700
Do you know

535
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,160
that plotting against Consort Jiangli

536
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,920
is punishable by exterminating
the entire clan?

537
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,740
Master Jingming.

538
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,300
Bring him closer.

539
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,740
Master Jingming.

540
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,140
Master Jingming, forgive me.

541
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,500
Master Jingming, please.

542
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,400
- Master Jingming.
- Do you know what to do?

543
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,260
I'll tell the truth.

544
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,380
Go ahead.

545
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,540
That day,

546
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,620
Consort Danling forced me

547
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,460
to set up the trap for Consort Jiangli.

548
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,700
But later,

549
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,780
Consort Jiangli

550
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,460
was unharmed,

551
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,700
so Consort Danling

552
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,260
ordered

553
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,740
my pinky to be chopped off.

554
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,740
Young Master,

555
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,940
I checked his record.

556
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,820
He used to work in Golden Guards

557
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,740
and design weapons.

558
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,020
Not long ago, he was dismissed

559
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,060
and was even caned
before being kicked out.

560
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,340
You were a Golden Guard?

561
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,820
Yes.

562
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,580
Back then,

563
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,180
Golden Guards recruited many craftsmen.

564
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,780
I was full of confidence when I joined.

565
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,180
But unexpectedly,

566
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,260
Golden Guards

567
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,780
only value connections,

568
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,460
not skills.

569
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,780
Without any backers,

570
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,540
I wasn't promoted.

571
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,620
Later,

572
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,540
I was targeted by Deputy Wu,

573
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,860
then sidelined,

574
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,980
and kicked out.

575
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,980
I was really frustrated,

576
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,100
so today I came

577
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,220
to Master Jingxiu for justice,

578
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,380
but Deputy Wu

579
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,660
threw me out.

580
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,260
I truly never meant to harm

581
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,020
you or Consort Jiangli.

582
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,220
Master Jingming,

583
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,300
I hope you can spare me.

584
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,020
Lu Yan,

585
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,700
listen carefully.

586
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,780
I won't kill you.

587
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,180
You said Golden Guards was corrupt

588
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,300
so your talent and ambitions
went unrecognized.

589
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,540
But my Qilin Guards

590
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,900
are well-governed

591
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,840
with clear rewards and punishments.

592
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,580
If you're willing to join Qilin Guards,

593
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,140
you can showcase

594
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,060
your talents and ambitions.

595
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,580
You don't blame me

596
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,940
and want me to fulfill my ambitions?

597
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,380
Would you accept this?

598
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,540
I would.

599
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,700
I swear loyalty to Qilin Guards.

600
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,420
(Happiness)
- Congrats. - Congrats.

601
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,820
- Congrats.
- Same to you.

602
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:07,980
Jinchuan,

603
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,020
see them out.

604
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,940
Yes.

605
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,740
Please, everyone.

606
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:12,940
Alright.

607
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,780
Master Jingxiu,

608
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,380
you must be exhausted today.

609
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,620
I didn't expect

610
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,220
the daughter of the general

611
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,620
to act like this.

612
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,040
- She's disgraced Master Jingxiu.
- Master Jingxiu.

613
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:26,300
You...

614
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,860
Obviously, Consort Danling

615
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,940
got jealous

616
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,500
and humiliated Ms. Shen Qilan
in front of everyone.

617
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,300
Master Jingxiu, are you drunk?

618
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,260
Master Jingxiu, are you okay?

619
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,540
Wang Danling,

620
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,660
today,

621
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,860
how dare you

622
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,940
disgrace me in front of everyone!

623
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:56,860
I...

624
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,060
Master Jingxiu, calm down.

625
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,580
It was because I love you

626
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,060
too much,

627
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,300
so I went too far.

628
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,860
Master Jingxiu,

629
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,820
please don't blame me.

630
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,860
Wang Danling,

631
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,500
listen to me.

632
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:27,180
I hate internal conflicts the most.

633
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,460
If this

634
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,980
implicates my reputation,

635
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,580
I will never forgive you.

636
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,940
Master Jingxiu...

637
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,860
Get lost!

638
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,740
Go.

639
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,580
Go find her mother!

640
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,130
- Hurry!
- Yes.

641
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,660
I want to see

642
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,220
what kind of mother

643
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,260
could raise such a lowly daughter.

644
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,740
(Master Jingming's Mansion)

645
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,780
How was today's banquet?

646
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,180
There were very few guests today.

647
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,500
The Prefect, Lady Wang, and Lady Shu

648
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,420
were all absent.

649
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,300
Today, Wang Danling

650
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,240
used the wedding gown
to humiliate Qilan.

651
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,620
Though it was resolved,

652
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,740
I still worry about Qilan

653
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,620
since she married Master Jingxiu.

654
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,740
Actually, life in the Prefect's family

655
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,420
isn't what Qilan imagined.

656
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,500
Moreover,

657
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,660
General Wang

658
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,460
has been powerful in Dongzhou

659
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,900
for many years,

660
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,260
and everyone

661
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,180
is wary of him.

662
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,860
I don't know

663
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,260
what Qilan will face next.

664
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,060
Let go!

665
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,180
I can walk myself.

666
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,100
Consort Danling, what do you mean?

667
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,620
You should invite guests here

668
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,820
at the right time.

669
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,420
Now, Qilan

670
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,540
has married Master Jingxiu.

671
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,140
How bold!

672
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,820
You should curtsy to Consort Danling!

673
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,380
How dare you hit me?

674
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,540
Do you know
I'm Master Jingxiu's mother-in-law?

675
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,340
Now I see where your daughter
learned it from.

676
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,140
She's as lowly as you.

677
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,700
Consort Danling,

678
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,980
aren't you afraid
of Master Jingxiu finding out?

679
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,700
Qilan,

680
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,060
sorry about today.

681
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,100
Master Jingxiu, it's okay.

682
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,460
A humble family

683
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,900
truly limits one's vision.

684
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,740
I'm Master Jingxiu's consort,

685
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,260
and my father is the current general.

686
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,180
So what if I hit you today?

687
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,020
Even if I hit your daughter,

688
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,540
what could

689
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,900
Master Jingxiu do to me?

690
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,780
I kindly invited you to have tea,

691
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,780
yet you show me this attitude.

692
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,420
How am I supposed

693
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,180
to get along with your daughter

694
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,980
in the future?

695
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,300
Consort Danling,

696
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,220
I was rude

697
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,260
just now.

698
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,460
Consort Danling,

699
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,020
please don't hold it against me

700
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,660
or vent your anger

701
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,980
on Qilan.

702
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,700
I will give you a chance

703
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,100
to redeem yourself.

704
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,580
Tomorrow, the new concubine

705
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,140
needs to serve tea to the consort.

706
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,900
Why don't you

707
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,300
demonstrate

708
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,340
for your daughter first?

709
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,460
Consort Danling,

710
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,580
regardless, I am...

711
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,820
Alright.

712
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,740
I've given you the chance,

713
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,940
but you rejected it yourself.

714
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,660
I'm willing to do that.

715
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,860
Consort Danling,

716
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,660
please drink tea.

717
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,180
Do you really think you're good enough

718
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,500
to serve me tea?

719
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,980
I've finally kept my promise to you.

720
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,660
Master Jingxiu,

721
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:17,940
how much longer

722
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,460
will this go on?

723
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,740
Qilan,

724
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,700
rest assured.

725
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,620
I must consider Danling's feelings.

726
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,180
After all, she's...

727
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,100
Does this mean you can marry me

728
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,100
if I win her favor?

729
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,020
Yes.

730
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,540
Master Jingxiu, don't sigh.

731
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,060
I'll wait for you.

732
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,460
Qilan,

733
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,980
I will definitely marry you,

734
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,540
keep you by my side, and protect you,

735
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,540
so no one can bully you.

736
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,180
When I became the Prefect,

737
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:00,220
the one standing by my side
will definitely be you.

738
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,580
Master Jingxiu.

739
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:41,460
(Happiness)

740
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,980
You found the man who set up the trap

741
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,620
and even recruited him
into Qilin Guards?

742
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,420
Lu Jingming,

743
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,300
you're really good at poaching talent.

744
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,220
That's not true.

745
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,580
Golden Guards are burying talent,

746
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,540
while Qilin Guards are eager for talent.

747
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,860
You're just fishing

748
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,180
for compliments, aren't you?

749
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,660
♪The sound of the flute lingers,
making the night more tender♪

750
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:12,730
♪Stealing a bit of the starry sky,
making the encounter romantic♪

751
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:16,880
♪The lights fade; the story isn't over♪

752
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,260
What are you doing?

753
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,740
It's my fault.

754
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,220
I owe you

755
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,140
a complete wedding night.

756
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,820
Jingming,

757
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,340
that night,

758
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,180
I truly wished the wedding candles

759
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,220
could burn steadily until morning.

760
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,500
I've heard people say

761
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,140
that if the wedding candles
burn until dawn,

762
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,760
the couple will grow old
together in love.

763
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,420
But that night,

764
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,010
our wedding candles went out.

765
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:55,730

the only natural outcome♪

766
00:38:56,030 --> 00:39:00,450

These wedding candles

770
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,420
and my feelings

771
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,260
came too late.
