1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,000
seven days and six months later

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,660
Enroute Demon

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,080
My Lanuling

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,060
Even he knew with� incentivised

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,660
and his Ludicous looked almost every day

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,280
Withing the day

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:27,520
the union

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,680
But career has changed

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's not the survival of the internal family.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Young Master, the border is in danger.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The Central Government ordered you to go to the Central Government

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and discuss the border matter.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
In the past three days,

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Young Master was extremely anxious to go to the battlefield.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
He was killed for the country's personal gain.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
He was not able to capture the situation.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I was framed in the family.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
He was locked up by Madam Shu.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Take her away.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm with Lu Jinming.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm not the mastermind.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Why did you marry him?

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I can't get Lu Jinming.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Don't you want to get him?

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Madam Shu's poison is easily destroyed.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's all my fault.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Madam.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You're such a fool.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I should be here forever.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The Central Government is not against it.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I was framed, but no one was willing to do so.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Lu Jinming, where are you?

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm here.

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The Moons classroom

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
After Young Master Zhou died,

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
even though his body had been burned and quatro,

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,880
So he will be requests toholder Wang Dan Ling

38
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,680
for seven days for the ceremony ceremony.

39
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,840
Going to Departure!

40
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,540
Water was brought by Immortal.

41
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,500
It's the OK for your life.

42
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,040
Even a fair-played disciple

43
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,540
will прилave strongly together.

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,400
Go.

45
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,060
Lord and Madam are back since WWII too.

46
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,060
I've never heard of such a woman.

47
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,060
What kind of blessing and grace

48
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,560
does she need to be so upright?

49
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,060
They all said that she has high-ranking position.

50
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,560
Of course, she has different ways of doing it.

51
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,860
I know that your sister, Na'er Xi,

52
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,560
said she was going to guard the ancestral forest.

53
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,560
She is actually unfilial to you.

54
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,560
She can't serve you.

55
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,060
So, no matter what my good daughter-in-law does,

56
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,560
you all think it's wrong.

57
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
You...

58
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,560
You...

59
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,560
You...

60
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
You...

61
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,560
You...

62
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
You...

63
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,060
Ling'er, take us to the temple.

64
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,060
Yes.

65
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,060
These ceremony is really...

66
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,060
Mother, please.

67
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,060
Look at those blessings.

68
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,060
Do you feel strange?

69
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,060
What's going on?

70
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,060
What's going on?

71
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,060
What's going on?

72
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,060
What's going on?

73
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,060
What's going on?

74
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,060
What's going on?

75
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,560
What's going on?

76
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,560
What's going on?

77
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,560
What's going on?

78
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,560
What's going on?

79
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,560
What's going on?

80
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,560
I'll just say it's a bloodbath.

81
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,560
Na'er, if this is really a ghost,

82
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,560
you should take her with you.

83
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,560
You're a coward.

84
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,560
Mother, don't run.

85
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,560
Who is pretending to be a ghost?

86
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,560
Come out!

87
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,560
Shen Jiangli?

88
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,560
Why is he back?

89
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,560
Sister-in-law,

90
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,560
don't be so strange.

91
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,560
What's wrong?

92
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,560
You look like a ghost.

93
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,260
Shen Jiangli?

94
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,260
Why are you back?

95
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:40,440
You've been transferred to the ancestral

96
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,140
Hall of Marriage, right?

97
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,140
I'm also responsible for the mother's death.

98
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,140
Now that and I do,

99
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,180
I also hope for your military troubles.

100
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,900
A small amount of your living dreams

101
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,300
will be od布,

102
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,440
and turn out to be all your ownandra уже va.

103
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:54,900
In my life,

104
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,060
Master is sick.

105
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,940
I want to borrow the Qifu's ceremony of the Great Sister-in-law

106
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,420
to pray for you.

107
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,660
I think you've been in the ancestral temple for five years.

108
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,660
The more you pray,

109
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,900
the more you will be in the way of your Qifu.

110
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,180
Throw a pot of coffin and come in.

111
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,620
I'm afraid you'll deliberately make Master go out

112
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,580
and do something that will make you feel guilty.

113
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,500
Come on.

114
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,260
Take him back.

115
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,660
Don't worry, Young Consort.

116
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,740
Let's open the coffin first.

117
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,380
Let's see who's in it.

118
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,380
Who's in it?

119
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,300
What does it have to do with me?

120
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,020
Wang Danling, do you remember Gao Shi?

121
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,140
I don't know him at all.

122
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,260
What are you so nervous about?

123
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,860
Are you afraid that after Gao Shi's death,

124
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,620
you'll be a ghost and come to your life?

125
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,780
Don't say that there's no ghost in the world.

126
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,420
Even if there is a ghost,

127
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,980
I'm not afraid of it.

128
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,540
Don't be so full of it.

129
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,660
If there's a ghost in the world,

130
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,260
don't scare me.

131
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,820
Second Young Consort,

132
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,900
your story has been a human's injury.

133
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,300
But it's better for you to be in the Qifu.

134
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,540
Sister,

135
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,340
you're a child.

136
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,820
You're pretending to be a ghost in the Master's Mansion.

137
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,540
Don't blame me for not being affectionate.

138
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,580
I have to take care of the Lu family's reputation.

139
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:20,860
Come on.

140
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,300
Wait a minute, Sister.

141
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,540
Wait a minute, Sister.

142
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,980
If I'm wrong,

143
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,340
Li Ying is my mother-in-law.

144
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,140
Since she's back,

145
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,140
why don't you let her speak clearly?

146
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,740
Li'er, do you have any evidence?

147
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,740
If you don't have any evidence,

148
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,340
no one can protect you.

149
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,180
If you have any evidence,

150
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,540
take it out immediately.

151
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,060
Let Madam and Second Young Consort

152
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,660
have a good time.

153
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:49,860
What are you doing?

154
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,220
Let go of me.

155
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:50,820
Wang Danling,

156
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,020
take a good look.

157
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,300
Who's in there?

158
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,060
What's going on?

159
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,060
Why am I getting more confused?

160
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,660
Madam,

161
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,940
a few days ago,

162
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,180
my father almost died

163
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,420
of a big-time death.

164
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,500
Second Young Consort saved my father.

165
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,220
At that time,

166
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,700
we had been kneeling for five days and five nights

167
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,180
and we were not able to sleep.

168
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,460
My father was very hard to bear.

169
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,100
He was nearly faint.

170
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,340
He had to sneak in secretly.

171
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,780
Even if my father was wrong,

172
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,420
he would never be able to die.

173
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:45,820
How dare you!

174
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,940
Drag him up!

175
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,300
You can't let Second Young Consort

176
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,380
go through this, can you?

177
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,780
You know that Second Young Consort

178
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,300
is looking at you

179
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,180
and is trying to bully you.

180
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,620
How dare you steal something?

181
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,340
If you break the bully,

182
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,780
you won't be able to pay for it.

183
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,740
Second Young Consort, please spare me.

184
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,740
You're so noisy.

185
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,940
You said that you didn't want me to be quiet.

186
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,540
Why don't you drag him down?

187
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:13,620
Come on.

188
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,140
Drag him down.

189
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,300
Madam.

190
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,740
Didn't you eat something?

191
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,660
I'll let you eat enough now.

192
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,380
Give me three.

193
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,140
No.

194
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,300
You're not eating.

195
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:26,740
Qingrang.

196
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,340
If anyone

197
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,460
tries to trick me about what happened today,

198
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,900
I won't let you go.

199
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,380
If anyone else breaks the bully,

200
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,660
then this is what happened.

201
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,280
Doomed and

202
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,140
su عل media removed.

203
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,300
It was our head sued

204
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,260
all his followers.

205
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,940
Our handsome

206
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,660
lama,

207
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,460
and Cin bathing queen are

208
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,780
by theanks officers and social workers.

209
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,940
You mustgeon reason.

210
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,700
They want to justify

211
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,520
My shei ...

212
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,520
The dictatorship in Wangdan

213
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,000
Not necessarily

214
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:37,480
forty day

215
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,700
What затемwhat

216
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,220
He decesive

217
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,660
Is not because of ha disaster

218
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,200
It's because I used Fans

219
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:43,900
Gib Camel

220
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,820
Take what was seen in her Marquis Yan and charge itimmer.

221
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,220
Because we know we can,

222
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,540
I require her care.

223
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,980
The wife of Suluo

224
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,660
created such a temperate story.

225
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,180
She hojed grease me,

226
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,380
do you think you can force me?

227
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,260
Guards.

228
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,740
To take the rank of make-up and make a clean face.

229
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,940
Since both of you are here today,

230
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,740
it's not too late to discuss it.

231
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,940
What do you think?

232
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,940
Brother.

233
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:24,940
Second Brother,

234
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,940
did you forget what you did to Madam Shu and Qingqing?

235
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,340
Who would believe your nonsense in the river?

236
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,740
After you married Second Young Master,

237
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,740
you were so despicable and hurt my mother and my aunt.

238
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,740
Only after Madam Shu was released, you were sent to the ancestral tomb.

239
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,740
When will you be able to cure me?

240
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,740
How would you know if I can cure you?

241
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,740
Do you have eyes?

242
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,740
You can't see such a big fireman standing in front of you.

243
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,740
How could you have killed someone?

244
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,740
I was the one who...

245
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,740
Yu Zhu!

246
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,740
Thank you for helping me to cure you.

247
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,740
The death of Gao Shi is a fact.

248
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,740
I'm saving someone is the truth.

249
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,740
I'm here today to tell you that

250
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:24,740
Madam Shu is a woman who is famous for her blessings.

251
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,740
She is a concubine in the mansion.

252
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,740
She is begging for her own life.

253
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:33,740
So, you have been praying for your wife for many days.

254
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,740
Your illness hasn't been cured yet.

255
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,740
So, you have another reason.

256
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,740
Second Young Master has been in the ancestral tomb for five years.

257
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,740
What kind of blessing is that?

258
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,740
I want to ask you.

259
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,740
What kind of blessing is that?

260
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,740
Do you need to ask 27 women who have given birth to their sons

261
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,740
to kneel here for seven days?

262
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,740
What do you know?

263
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,740
I asked someone to give me this.

264
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,740
It's for the sake of the Lord of the Seven Ways.

265
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,740
I'm not worthy of it.

266
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,740
You're not worthy of it?

267
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,740
You only have a grandson.

268
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,740
You can't let the Lord know.

269
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,740
You don't know who you are.

270
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,740
You have this evil way of praying for your son.

271
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,740
You're so cunning.

272
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,740
You're doing this kind of punishment for the Lord of the Seven Ways.

273
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,740
Are you doing this to pray for the Lord of the Seven Ways?

274
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,740
You...

275
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,740
Shut up!

276
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,740
I haven't finished my words.

277
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,740
What are you in a hurry?

278
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,740
You have to tell me the truth.

279
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,740
If I really do as you say,

280
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,740
Madam will be the witness.

281
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,740
You have to prove it.

282
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:46,740
Madam, please send someone to check the four corners of the south of the east and west of the yard.

283
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,740
They will bury the magic weapon.

284
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,740
Guards, dig for me.

285
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,740
Yes, sir.

286
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,740
What else do you have to say?

287
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,740
This is the Shenjiang Forest.

288
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,740
You're trying to trap me?

289
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,740
In the past one year,

290
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,740
the most sacred seven days of the Yangtze River

291
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,740
were the best places to choose the best water.

292
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,740
In the next 27 places,

293
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,740
the wife of the child was the witness.

294
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,740
This is a legal punishment for the people.

295
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,740
The Mingyue Army is the most powerful country in the world.

296
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,740
The people of the country are the best.

297
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,740
The people of the country are the best.

298
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,740
The people of the country are the best.

299
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,740
The people of the country are the best.

300
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,740
The Mingyue Army is the most powerful country in the world.

301
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,740
I'm right, Madam.

302
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,740
I don't know.

303
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,740
I don't know what the Yangtze River is.

304
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,740
Do you know?

305
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,740
Go to the Communist Party of the House.

306
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,740
See if the Buddha statue you have in the palace is the same as the jade statue.

307
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,740
And the Songzi coffin.

308
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,740
Mother.

309
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,740
Sister, let's go to the Jiaojing.

310
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,740
Come, let's take a look.

311
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,740
What are you doing?

312
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,740
Sister, your son-in-law is indeed not simple.

313
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,740
He is a woman of the Jiangmen.

314
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,740
He is so hard-working for the Young Master.

315
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,740
If he hadn't been my son-in-law,

316
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,740
he wouldn't have found his son-in-law's ambition.

317
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,740
Huang Tanling.

318
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,740
Sister, wait for me.

319
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,740
Huang Tanling, you...

320
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,740
Mother.

321
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,740
Tanling, what's going on?

322
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,740
I...

323
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,740
Your Highness, I'm afraid that you...

324
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,740
This matter has nothing to do with Consort Shao.

325
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,740
I made the decision myself.

326
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,740
Mother.

327
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,740
I've been with Consort Shao for many years.

328
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,740
She has been working in the house all day.

329
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,740
She has ordered the jade statue in the house.

330
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,740
But she didn't have it this time.

331
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,740
Consort Shao was always by my side.

332
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,740
I saw her heartache.

333
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,740
I thought that the jade statue was made by me.

334
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,740
I was lying to Consort Shao.

335
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,740
I said it was for the blessing of the Lord.

336
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,740
It has nothing to do with her.

337
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,740
It really has nothing to do with her.

338
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,740
Then why didn't you say it just now?

339
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,740
I'm afraid it was just a good excuse.

340
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,740
In the ancestral temple,

341
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,740
the family has been drunk for five years.

342
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,740
What right do you have to be the one to blame Consort Shao?

343
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,740
I...

344
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,740
Only want to die.

345
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:06,740
To prove Consort Shao's innocence.

346
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,740
Consort Shao, take care.

347
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,740
Mother.

348
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,740
Mother.

349
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,740
Mother.

350
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,740
Mother.

351
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,740
Mother.

352
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,740
Mother.

353
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,740
Mother.

354
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,740
Mother.

355
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,740
Mother.

356
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,740
Now,

357
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,740
the guilty person is blessed.

358
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,740
But Dan Ling,

359
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,740
you are not good at teaching servants.

360
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,740
Stay in the Imperial Palace for a good life.

361
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,740
Think carefully.

362
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,740
Yes.

363
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,740
Everyone,

364
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,740
if you know what happened today,

365
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,740
you will be punished.

366
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,740
Get out of here.

367
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,740
Yes.

368
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,740
Yes.

369
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,740
Go back.

370
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,740
Go back.

371
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,740
Go back.

372
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,740
Sister.

373
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,740
Your hair is all tangled up.

374
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,740
Shen Jiangli was so naughty today.

375
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,740
He killed the vile person in the room.

376
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,740
But why did he come back suddenly?

377
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,740
I want to thank Mother for her kindness.

378
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,740
Today,

379
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,740
you are the one who accused Consort Shao of the crime.

380
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,740
I will let you go to the ancestral tomb.

381
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,740
But don't think that way.

382
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,740
You can make up for the mistake

383
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,740
you made to Qingqing and me.

384
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,740
I know.

385
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,740
Jingming,

386
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,740
he did that before.

387
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,740
Naturally, he can't stay in the city.

388
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,740
Tomorrow, he will send her back to the ancestral tomb.

389
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,740
No.

390
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,740
Now, he will go to the ancestral tomb.

391
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,740
No.

392
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,740
No.

393
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,740
Now, he will go to the ancestral tomb.

394
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,740
Mother,

395
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,740
it's my son who brought Jiangli back.

396
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,740
What?

397
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,740
It's been five years.

398
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,740
No matter what,

399
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,740
there should be an end.

400
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,740
Second Young Master's Mansion

401
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,740
can't have a female master.

402
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,740
Fine.

403
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,740
You stay here tonight.

404
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,740
If you make any trouble again,

405
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,740
return to the ancestral tomb with me.

406
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,740
You can't go back to the ancestral tomb forever.

407
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,740
How dare you!

408
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,740
You just came back from the ancestral tomb.

409
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,740
You are so proud of your family.

410
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,740
If you don't make the water boil,

411
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,740
how can you be so silent?

412
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,740
Second Young Master,

413
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,740
I am glad to see you.

414
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,740
When did you learn the medical skills?

415
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,740
How come I don't know?

416
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,740
You can only say

417
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,740
that you are just judging me

418
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,740
from others' perspective.

419
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,740
Maybe

420
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,740
you never gave me a chance to know you.

421
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,740
Second Young Master and I

422
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,740
don't have a chance.

423
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,740
You came back from the ancestral tomb.

424
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,740
You know your mother, Madam Shu,

425
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,740
and threw me into the ancestral tomb.

426
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,740
You never looked for the truth.

427
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,740
Maybe it doesn't matter

428
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,740
if I am talking to you.

429
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,740
I came back from the ancestral tomb

430
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,740
and returned to the ancestral tomb.

431
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,740
Mother has no evidence.

432
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,740
You don't want to see it.

433
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,740
If you want me to help you,

434
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,740
you can ask for it.

435
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,740
Don't mention it again.

436
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,740
We don't need to make any trouble again.

437
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,740
I have my own reason to come back.

438
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,740
If you want to talk to me,

439
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,740
come to Yuxuan to see me.

440
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,740
Second Young Master,

441
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,740
it's been five years.

442
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,740
Don't be so careless.

443
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,740
It's you.

444
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,740
I know

445
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,740
that your brother is very proud

446
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,740
of you.

447
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,740
You are not hiding

448
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,740
from your brother

449
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,740
to be the head of the family.

450
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,740
The ancestral tomb of the Nine Realms

451
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,740
is so clear

452
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,740
about what happened to the court.

453
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,740
You don't need to know

454
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,740
how I know it.

455
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,740
You just need to be sure

456
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,740
that I can help you.

457
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,740
Why do you need to help me?

458
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,740
Is it because

459
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,740
you still miss the old love five years ago?

460
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,740
Second Young Master is so funny.

461
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,740
We have no friendship

462
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,740
between us.

463
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,740
It's just a deal.

464
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,740
What do you need me for?

465
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,740
I want the thunder ball.

466
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,740
Do you know what thunder ball is?

467
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,740
It's the gift

468
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,740
from the former Chief of the Feng Pavilion.

469
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,740
There is only one beauty in this world.

470
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,740
That's why I want this beauty.

471
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,740
Who do you want to save

472
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,740
the thunder ball?

473
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,740
You don't need to know that.

474
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,740
We are just friends.

475
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,740
We can do whatever we want.

476
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,740
Friends?

477
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,740
You are a sinner.

478
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,740
What can I do for you?

479
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,740
Today is the last day

480
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:26,740
of Wang Dan Ling's seven days of praying.

481
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,740
Take a look.

482
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,740
I will send you a gift.

483
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,740
The King of the Feng Pavilion

484
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,740
The King of the Feng Pavilion

485
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,740
The King of the Feng Pavilion

486
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,740
The King of the Feng Pavilion

487
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,740
The King of the Feng Pavilion

488
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,740
The King of the Feng Pavilion

489
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,740
The King of the Feng Pavilion

490
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,740
The King of the Feng Pavilion

491
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,740
The King of the Feng Pavilion

492
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,740
The King of the Feng Pavilion

493
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,740
The King of the Feng Pavilion

494
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,740
The King of the Feng Pavilion

495
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,740
The King of the Feng Pavilion

496
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,740
The King of the Feng Pavilion

497
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,740
The King of the Feng Pavilion

498
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,740
The King of the Feng Pavilion

499
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,740
The King of the Feng Pavilion

500
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,740
The King of the Feng Pavilion

501
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,740
The King of the Feng Pavilion

502
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,740
It's been a long time since we last lived here.

503
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,740
We are going to climb the rice

504
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,740
and cook with the rice in the new house.

505
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,740
The King of the Feng Pavilion

506
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,740
I spent so much time on the house.

507
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,740
I worked so hard to make so many days of housework.

508
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,740
I thought I could take the King's order this time.

509
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,740
I didn't expect that

510
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,740
I could only let him be a demon.

511
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,740
No matter what,

512
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,740
we also saved a innocent life.

513
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,740
The demon who committed the crime for Wang Danlin

514
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,740
was his mother.

515
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,740
Without him,

516
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,740
Wang Danlin is a dead tiger.

517
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,740
Are you going to stay in the Second Young Master's Mansion?

518
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,740
Only here

519
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:33,740
can I get what I want.

520
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,740
Okay.

521
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,740
I'll go where you go.

522
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,740
The King of the Feng Pavilion

523
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,740
The King of the Feng Pavilion

524
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,740
Yuxuan.

525
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,740
I'm back.

526
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,740
Help.

527
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,740
Help.

528
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,740
Help.

529
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,740
Miss.

530
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,740
Help me.

531
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,740
I'm from the Feng Pavilion.

532
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,740
Don't worry.

533
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,740
I'll take care of everything.

534
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,740
I have a baby.

535
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:06,740
This cold mother is not a place to be separated.

536
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,740
If I hadn't been saved by the Feng Pavilion,

537
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,740
I would have died in the Lu family.

538
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,740
I've suffered a lot.

539
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,740
I'll be back this time.

540
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,740
I'm sorry.

541
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,740
I'm sorry.

542
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,740
I'm sorry.

543
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,740
I'm sorry.

544
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,740
I'm sorry.

545
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,740
I'm sorry.

546
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,740
I'm sorry.

547
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,740
I'm sorry.

548
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,740
I'm sorry.

549
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,740
I'm sorry.

550
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,740
I'm sorry.

551
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,740
I'm sorry.

552
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,740
I'm sorry.

553
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,740
I'm sorry.

554
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,740
I'm sorry.

555
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,740
I'm sorry.

556
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,740
I'm sorry.

557
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,740
I'm sorry.

558
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,740
I'm sorry.

559
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,740
I'm sorry.

560
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,740
I'm sorry.

561
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,740
