Move faster.

23
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,270
- Yes.
- Hurry up.

24
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,240
What's on your mind?

25
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,240
I was thinking

26
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,430
I smelled a contraceptive drug
in her room

27
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,520
when I went to see

28
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,350
Wang Danling that day.

29
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,810
Someone doesn't want her
to get pregnant.

30
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,190
You should know

31
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,270
who it is better than me.

32
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,550
Fuling.

33
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,200
My Lady.

34
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,150
Bring Lian Wantang here.

35
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,990
Yes.

36
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,590
Our harvest this year isn't good.

37
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,160
It's the same everywhere.

38
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,270
It's this village.

39
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,890
- Let's see.
- There's nothing we can do.

40
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,270
Yunniang,

41
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,080
is this the way to the Lian family?

42
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,910
I remember their house...

43
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,000
Miss Lian doesn't live there anymore.

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,160
Her ruthless father

45
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,750
abandoned them after learning

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,120
that her mother was sick.

47
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,430
Miss Lian swore never to marry

48
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,030
and to take care of her mother.

49
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,750
Now,

50
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,920
she lives by mending clothes for others.

51
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,510
She has only her mother now.

52
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,480
Though their life is hard,

53
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,870
it's still stable.

54
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,800
Miss Lian is truly pitiful

55
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,550
but also admirable.

56
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,990
If

57
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,710
I were older back then,

58
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,560
maybe I'd have taken my mother

59
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,550
to live on our own.

60
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,640
I finally found out

61
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,400
she now lives in this village.

62
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,310
Let's go and see.

63
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,080
Be careful.

64
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,870
Hello, excuse me...

65
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,320
Be careful.

66
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,240
It's okay.

67
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,080
- Let's go there.
- There's a girl.

68
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,590
Miss,

69
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,480
do you know how to get
to Lian Wantang's house?

70
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,230
(Lian Wantang)

71
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,270
Who are you?

72
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,580
What do you want with her?

73
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,040
My mother and her mother
were old friends.

74
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,520
We've come to visit her.

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,990
Who are you?

76
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,520
I'm Lord Shen's eldest daughter,

77
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,240
Shen Jiangli.

78
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,520
Jiangli,

79
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,640
it's you.

80
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,950
I'm Lian Wantang.

81
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,680
You're Miss Lian?

82
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,080
We haven't seen each other in years.

83
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,990
Miss Lian,

84
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,760
I used to serve Mrs. Shen.

85
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,870
We've met before.

86
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,670
Mrs. Lian used to often bring you

87
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,040
to the mansion to talk with Madam.

88
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:30,900
Yes.

89
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,800
I used to often go with my mother.

90
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:33,880
Earlier,

91
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,400
I was afraid you might be bad people,

92
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,750
so I didn't dare admit who I was.

93
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,350
This isn't the place for conversation.

94
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,530
Come to my house for some tea.

95
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,790
Let's go.

96
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,030
Jiangli,

97
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,630
I didn't expect you to find me here,

98
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,310
but the timing is a bit off.

99
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,710
My mother has been taken back
to visit her family.

100
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,720
She can also recuperate there.

101
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,390
This is the place.

102
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,150
Please come in.

103
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,160
Our home is a bit simple.

104
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,190
Please don't mind.

105
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,320
No, it's fine.

106
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,680
Sit down.

107
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,920
Miss Lian,

108
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,520
where should I place these things?

109
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,200
Just put them over there. Thank you.

110
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,120
It's alright.

111
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,280
My mother left half a month ago.

112
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,470
She probably won't be back for a while.

113
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,670
When I heard you mention the past,

114
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,040
it reminded me of a lot.

115
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,110
The last time my mother
visited Shen Mansion,

116
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,430
I went with her.

117
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,870
How have you been lately?

118
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,760
It's just okay.

119
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,950
My husband...

120
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,680
Let's not talk about it.

121
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,160
Luckily, Wantang is obedient.

122
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,600
Wantang, come here.

123
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,430
Let me see if you've grown taller.

124
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,590
You're so cute.

125
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,870
Later, Jiangli will be back

126
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,080
from school.

127
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,510
She'll play with you.

128
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,760
Yunniang,

129
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,160
wait outside for Jiangli.

130
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,910
When she's back, bring her here.

131
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:56,830
Yes.

132
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,840
It's alright.

133
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,670
- Come on.
- My Lady.

134
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,990
Ms. Tian requests to see you.

135
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,240
Let her in.

136
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,590
Yes.

137
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,120
Come and eat.

138
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,790
Madam,

139
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,070
I know I was wrong.

140
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,750
I shouldn't have deducted
the maids' wages.

141
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,920
I was sick the other day

142
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,680
and couldn't manage,

143
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,550
so I did it.

144
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,600
You should've told me if you were sick.

145
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,310
But if you keep secretly deducting

146
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,520
the maids' wages,

147
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,390
the maids will resent you.

148
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,310
It might cause more trouble.

149
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,280
I'll remember your teachings

150
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,870
and won't make this mistake again.

151
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,440
Madam,

152
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,720
I made

153
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,600
such a big mistake,

154
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,750
yet I still get your teachings
and forgiveness.

155
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,510
I don't know how to repay you.

156
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,800
Please accept this.

157
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,480
Just don't repeat the same mistake.

158
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,800
I don't need the bracelets.

159
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,120
Madam, please don't despise it.

160
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,600
The bracelets may not be something rare,

161
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,120
but they're a kind gesture from me.

162
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,920
I didn't mean it that way.

163
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,910
Don't refuse anymore.

164
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,160
Take them.
They're a gesture of goodwill.

165
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,910
Alright.

166
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:10,990
I'll accept them then.

167
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,360
Just don't repeat the same mistake.

168
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,190
Yes, I'll remember.

169
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,550
Now, I'll take my leave.

170
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,510
The bracelets are beautiful,

171
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,920
and they have a strange fragrance to it.

172
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:28,110
Why don't we each have one?

173
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,190
No, no.

174
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,350
We've grown up together.

175
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,430
We're like sisters.

176
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,160
This is just a bracelet.

177
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,480
Don't be so polite to me.

178
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,720
After my mother returned,

179
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,430
she had a high fever

180
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,630
and was in a daze,

181
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,240
crying out in pain,

182
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,870
but she didn't know

183
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,630
where it hurt.

184
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,190
The physician couldn't figure out
what was wrong with her.

185
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,950
My father was disgusted
with my mother being a burden,

186
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,550
so he abandoned us

187
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,190
in the village.

188
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,400
My mother became depressed

189
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,390
and lost in her thoughts.

190
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,430
I thought that bracelet was precious,

191
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,070
and someone might try
to get it from my mother,

192
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,670
so I kept it well.

193
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,240
She hasn't worn it in all these years.

194
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,640
Jiangli, wait for me a moment.

195
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,560
Alright.

196
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,800
Jiangli, look.

197
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,360
Over the years,

198
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,720
because of her friendship
with Mrs. Shen,

199
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:29,970
my mother never thought

200
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,950
of selling the bracelet
however hard life got.

201
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,710
Mrs. Lian's condition was

202
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,600
exactly the same
as when Madam passed away.

203
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,080
As expected.

204
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:39,990
What?

205
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,760
There's poison hidden

206
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,790
inside the bracelet.

207
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,550
Luckily, you kept it away

208
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,260
and didn't let your mother
wear it again.

209
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,350
How could this happen?

210
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,760
We still don't know everything yet.

211
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,760
Can I keep

212
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,150
this bracelet for now?

213
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,830
Of course.

214
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,490
Your mother is innocent
and was dragged into this.

215
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,080
Thankfully, her life is safe.

216
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,360
When she returns,

217
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,200
I'll come and visit her again.

218
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,240
You're back.

219
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,320
The Shen family sent it over.

220
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,460
(From Shen Zhengshan)
Right on time.

221
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,070
Do you want me to accompany you?

222
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,320
No need.

223
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,670
I won't drag you

224
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,990
into the Shen family's matters.

225
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,420
(Shen Ancestral Hall)

226
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,070
Consort Jiangli,

227
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,840
didn't Master Jingming come with you?

228
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,030
As annoyingly proud as your mother.

229
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,080
Mother.

230
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,560
If I hear you speak ill
of my mother again,

231
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,150
it won't just be this slap.

232
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,350
I didn't.

233
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,360
Consort Jiangli, you heard wrong.

234
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,630
Jiangli, don't be angry.

235
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,460
We're here to worship the ancestors.

236
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,510
Why not discuss things later?

237
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,970
Let's not disturb the ancestors.

238
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,990
What's said and done can be denied,

239
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,870
but heaven sees everything,

240
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,510
and it keeps a record.

241
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,440
Let's go.

242
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,400
Father,

243
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,560
you got your position today

244
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,960
with the help of my mother's family.

245
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:27,820
Yes.

246
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,440
Our family's smooth sailing

247
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,190
is also due to my mother's protection

248
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,510
from above.

249
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,670
Listen to this.

250
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,990
It seems like your mother brought

251
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,400
everything into the family.

252
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,320
Shut up.

253
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,440
Jiangli is right.

254
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,960
Your mother gave you to me.

255
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,310
You married Master Jingming

256
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,870
and earned the favor of the Prefect,

257
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,190
which has brought glory

258
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,200
to our family.

259
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,300
Of course, I must thank your mother.

260
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,440
Don't you want to talk

261
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,720
about the truth of my mother's death?

262
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:00,990
The truth?

263
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,310
Didn't your mother die of illness?

264
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,230
Illness?

265
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,470
Oh, right.

266
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,200
You were too busy

267
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,440
thinking about visiting your mistress

268
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,630
to know that my mother had a high fever,

269
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,900
tormented by nightmares,
and unable to sleep at night.

270
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,280
How could you know that my mother

271
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,520
wasn't ill

272
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,560
but was poisoned?

273
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,950
Ms. Tian,

274
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:23,990
isn't that right?

275
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,630
I didn't know.

276
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,430
This is the bracelet

277
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,150
you gave my mother back then.

278
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:39,790
I...

279
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,360
I've never seen this bracelet.

280
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,910
What an unrepentant schemer.

281
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,750
Lord Shen,

282
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,360
my mother and Mrs. Shen

283
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,390
were close friends.

284
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,270
I often came to your house
when I was young.

285
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,590
Back then, I saw Ms. Tian

286
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,080
give a pair of bracelets to Mrs. Shen.

287
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,360
Mrs. Shen was friends with my mother,

288
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,120
so she gave one to my mother.

289
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,790
But after my mother wore that bracelet,

290
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,080
she became delirious,

291
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,040
showing the same symptoms as Mrs. Shen

292
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,960
before she passed away.

293
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,550
Nonsense.

294
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,030
Who are you, village woman?

295
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,790
Consort Jiangli must've found you

296
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,390
to frame me.

297
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,320
I can also testify.

298
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,790
I used to serve Ms. Tian,

299
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,550
but she kept deducting

300
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,480
my wage.

301
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,830
I was helpless,

302
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,270
so I had to complain to Madam.

303
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:25,950
Madam stood up for me

304
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,240
and punished Ms. Tian,

305
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,510
so Ms. Tian hated Madam to the bone

306
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,270
and found these two bracelets.

307
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,440
It's true.

308
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,510
I did give her the bracelets,

309
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,280
but

310
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,150
I didn't know they were poisoned!

311
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,630
No.

312
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,150
Ms. Tian knew very well.

313
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,910
I heard Ms. Tian say

314
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,270
she wanted to teach Madam a lesson.

315
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:47,910
That's why I thought

316
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,030
she was so ruthless,

317
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,790
so I asked Ms. Zou to take me in.

318
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,910
But I didn't know

319
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,270
this lesson was to poison Madam.

320
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,750
All these years, I didn't dare speak up.

321
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,320
I was just speaking in anger.

322
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,680
Master,

323
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,750
she's serving Ms. Zou now.

324
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,640
Ms. Zou and her maid

325
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,960
have long had a grudge against me.

326
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,990
Today, they've joined hands
to slander me.

327
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,510
Master, you have to stand up for me!

328
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,710
You mustn't make baseless accusations!

329
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,620
If I had known,

330
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,910
I'd have dealt with you long ago.

331
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,960
Why would I wait until now?

332
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,830
Madam was so kind.

333
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,180
How could you treat her like this?

334
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,830
Even a maid can't stand

335
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:24,870
what you've done.

336
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,830
How could you be so cruel?

337
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:27,760
Master,

338
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,870
I'm innocent!

339
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,920
I...

340
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,400
Jiangli,

341
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,150
this happened so long ago,

342
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,150
and your mother

343
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,600
was already weak.

344
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,440
My mother was never weak.

345
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,720
I wonder if Father instructed

346
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,480
Ms. Tian to poison my mother

347
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,480
so that my mother passed away.

348
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,790
This is nonsense!

349
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,390
Why would I kill your mother?

350
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,200
Because of my mother's dowry!

351
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,560
If you hadn't used my mother's dowry,

352
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,080
how would you have been

353
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,540
able to mingle with the officialdom?

354
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,180
How would you have paid for pleasures?

355
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,830
Jiangli,

356
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,120
could we

357
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,510
discuss this later?

358
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,030
Who among you dares swear to heaven

359
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,560
that Ms. Tian didn't poison my mother,

360
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,870
Father didn't favor concubines
over his wife,

361
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,240
didn't steal my mother's dowry,

362
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,600
and didn't abandon me?

363
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,030
Dare you swear to that?

364
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,110
Father,

365
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,270
my mother died in regret.

366
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,630
What right do you have
to live in luxury?

367
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,960
Outrageous!

368
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,550
What kind of sin did I commit

369
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,360
to give birth
to such an unfilial daughter?

370
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,080
Servants, bring in the family penalty!

371
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,800
How dare you?

372
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,770
What's there to be afraid of?

373
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,400
I'm going to teach you today
what it means

374
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,600
to disrespect your elders!

375
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,100
How are you going to punish me?

376
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,630
Will you kill me

377
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,080
to cover up Ms. Tian's crimes?

378
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,480
How unfilial!

379
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,030
You've really crossed the line!

380
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,120
Do you think I won't hit you?

381
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,120
You'd better kill me,

382
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,280
otherwise,

383
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,600
I'll never stop until the murderer

384
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,990
of my mother is dead!

385
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,560
I'll let everyone in Dongzhou know!

386
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:08,750
Jiangli...

387
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,400
Lord Shen,

388
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,670
with this slap,

389
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,630
you've severed all ties between us.

390
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,590
From now on,

391
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,510
I won't be lenient with the Shen family.

392
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,380
I'll get back what you owe my mother

393
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,070
with interest!

394
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,510
How unfilial!

395
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,590
My Lady.

396
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:36,960
My Lady.

397
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,670
Master Jingming said

398
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,500
he shouldn't get involved
in Consort Jiangli's

399
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,480
maiden family matters.

400
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:42,990
However,

401
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,240
Consort Jiangli is still his consort.

402
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,270
If anyone dares to bully her,

403
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,390
he will certainly support her.

404
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,780
Master Jingxiu has ordered

405
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,590
that it's no longer just a family issue

406
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,480
as this concerns lives.

407
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,890
If Consort Jiangli wants to report it
to the authorities,

408
00:15:58,890 --> 00:15:59,910
he'll oversee the case.

409
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,910
If the authorities don't act,

410
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,790
he will report it to the Prefect.

411
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,970
The Prefect is very strict
on filial piety

412
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,910
and will uphold justice
for Consort Jiangli.

413
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:11,750
Jiangli,

414
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,360
I've been exhausted

415
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,520
from organizing this event,

416
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,840
so I did such a thing.

417
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,240
I was wrong.

418
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,400
I can

419
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,320
let this slap go.

420
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,480
I'm here today

421
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,510
to seek justice for my mother.

422
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,440
Lord Shen,

423
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,990
you choose.

424
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,440
Which one do you want,

425
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,750
your future or your concubine?

426
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:40,120
Master, you can't do this.

427
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,070
I've married you for over ten years.

428
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,440
I've endured so much hardship for you.

429
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,120
Master, think carefully.

430
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,280
It's not worth risking

431
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,320
the entire family for her.

432
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:55,030
Jiangli and Master Jingming
are favored now.

433
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,200
Just go along with her.

434
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,560
How ruthless of you

435
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,080
to harm the madam.

436
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:14,140
It's only right that you pay
for murdering her with your life.

437
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:15,710
Servants,

438
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,630
take Ms. Tian to the authorities.

439
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,710
Wait.

440
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,000
It's too easy for her

441
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,360
to pay with her life now.

442
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,360
I want her to kneel
in front of my mother's tablet

443
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,230
and kowtow 100 times every day.

444
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,400
She'll be sent to the authorities

445
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,560
after a month.

446
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,520
Do as Consort Jiangli says.

447
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,710
Jiangli, watch your step.

448
00:17:54,710 --> 00:18:01,260
(Shen Ancestral Hall)

449
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,590
My Lady, Master Jingxiu
had to leave first,

450
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,950
but he asked me to escort you home.

451
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,400
Miss Lian,

452
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,950
come stay with me for a few days.

453
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,680
It's a good chance

454
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,360
to talk about Mrs. Lian's situation,

455
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,140
and I'll help you get some medicine.

456
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,120
Sure. Then I'll trouble you.

457
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,200
Jiangli, take care.

458
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,680
Miss Lian,

459
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,960
please go.

460
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,560
Jiangli, are you alright?

461
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,630
Is your face okay?

462
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,790
I'm fine.

463
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,120
Master Jingming.

464
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,380
From now on, I'll go with you

465
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,620
when you return.

466
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,840
How did you know
what happened today?

467
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,840
That day,

468
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,800
I knew something was wrong
when I saw your expression

469
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,430
of receiving the invitation.

470
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,390
Later, I went to ask Mr. Chu,

471
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,870
and he told me what happened.

472
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,310
So?

473
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,710
How did it go?

474
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,430
It went smoothly.

475
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,150
After all, Ms. Tian's left many traces.

476
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:58,630
Besides,

477
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,320
Wantang testified for me.

478
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,430
With the irrefutable evidence,

479
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,040
she couldn't argue.

480
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,120
But...

481
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,230
What's wrong?

482
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,350
I just feel like things

483
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,430
went too smoothly.

484
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,520
Did you find anything suspicious?

485
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,440
No.

486
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,040
Do you want me to check?

487
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,840
No need. I won't trouble you.

488
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:47,580
(Master Jingming's Mansion)

489
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,870
Why are you walking so fast?

490
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,670
Wait for me.

491
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,310
Jiangli,

492
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,670
your mother's matter has been solved.

493
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,670
Why are you still so downcast?

494
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,230
The matter has been resolved,

495
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,910
and the murderer has been caught,

496
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,470
but my mother

497
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,320
could never come back.

498
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,150
My mother was a noble lady,

499
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,230
gentle and virtuous.

500
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,000
She was never harsh

501
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,230
on the concubines and servants.

502
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,280
But people's minds were unfathomable.

503
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:27,390
They fought to climb up,

504
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,190
even willing to shed blood.

505
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,080
I was by my mother's side every day,

506
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,320
but I never noticed it.

507
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,190
As a daughter,

508
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,910
I really feel I've failed her.

509
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,040
Jiangli, you were still young.

510
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,360
How could you guard
against these things?

511
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,550
Now, you've avenged your mother.

512
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,150
I'm sure her spirit

513
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,600
will be at ease.

514
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,760
By the way, Jiangli,

515
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,910
can we return to Wind Pavilion now?

516
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,630
Then we need to plan ahead.

517
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:55,790
We have so many things

518
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,390
to bring back this time.

519
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,000
I was thinking

520
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,560
of buying some cakes too.

521
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,470
We've been out for so long.

522
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,720
I wonder if they've taken care
of the herbs

523
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,150
we planted on the back mountain.

524
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,280
Yes.

525
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,080
We should return.

526
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,960
But I want

527
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,630
to wait until I see Mrs. Lian

528
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:16,150
to thank her before I go.

529
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,360
You're thoughtful as always.

530
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,830
I'll prepare things first,

531
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,200
so we won't be in a rush

532
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,150
with so much luggage.

533
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,900
I'll take my leave then, Jiangli.

534
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:33,720
I think

535
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,710
my mother is already on her way back.

536
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,910
She'll be home in about ten days.

537
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,360
I should go home.

538
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,230
Since Mrs. Lian has set off,

539
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,710
why don't you stay here for now?

540
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,950
I'll send someone
to escort Mrs. Lian here,

541
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,000
so I can thank you properly.

542
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,240
No need.

543
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,340
It'd be too much trouble
for you and Master Jingming.

544
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:52,480
Miss Lian,

545
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,800
please don't refuse anymore.

546
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,230
This time,

547
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,280
you and your mother
have helped me so much.

548
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,080
I should thank you in person.

549
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,480
I'll make some medicinal dishes

550
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,560
and help you and your mother
adjust your health.

551
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,190
Thank you, Jiangli.

552
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,390
When you have time,

553
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,320
you must come to Jiangnan.

554
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,910
I've never been to Jiangnan.

555
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,470
I'd love to see

556
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,870
the scenery of West Lake

557
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,110
and try the dishes of Jiangnan.

558
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,460
Compared to the scenery,

559
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,760
the food in Jiangnan
is truly exceptional.

560
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,830
One bite is appetizing enough

561
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,300
to leave an aftertaste that lingers.

562
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:23,480
Now that you mention it,

563
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,800
I suddenly feel like the tea
has lost its flavor.

564
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:28,990
Master Jingming.

565
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,960
Miss Wantang.

566
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,600
Jingming, why not sit down
and have some snacks?

567
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,520
Master Jingming...

568
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:47,670
I don't know what's going on
with him today.

569
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,950
How strange.

570
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,440
Miss Lian, are you alright?

571
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,910
Mr. Yunjiu, what's the rush?

572
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,000
It's nothing.

573
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,870
Master Jingming wanted
some stir-fried shrimp,

574
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,390
so I was in a hurry to get it for him.

575
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,710
Miss Lian, I'll go now.

576
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,120
Mr. Yunjiu, take care.

577
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,120
Master Jingming.

578
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,870
Miss Lian.

579
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,190
It's so late.

580
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,080
What brings you here?

581
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,680
I had a good time with Consort Jiangli

582
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,800
this afternoon

583
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,960
so I might've left
a hairpin here by accident.

584
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,950
I came here to find it.

585
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,800
Master Jingming, why drink alone here?

586
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,360
Is something on your mind?

587
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,390
Just some trivial matters.

588
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,840
I don't want to trouble you with them.

589
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,670
Master Jingming, you can tell me.

590
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,630
I may not have the foresight

591
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,280
to help you,

592
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,600
but it's still better

593
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,360
than drinking alone in the cold.

594
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,840
Miss Lian, you're smart.

595
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,680
You must have

596
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,150
noticed something by now.

597
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,950
Jiangli and I

598
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,670
had some misunderstandings before,

599
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,870
and to this day,

600
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:33,390
those gaps haven't been resolved.

601
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,870
I don't know much

602
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,120
about you two,

603
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,710
but I believe a misunderstanding
can be cleared up.

604
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:47,230
She and I have a deep grudge.

605
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,360
There's no way she'll truly trust me.

606
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,360
No matter how sincerely I apologize,

607
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,670
she just can't accept it.

608
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,800
Miss Lian, during your stay,

609
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,190
you must have noticed it too.

610
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,430
Consort Jiangli's personality

611
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,280
is always so aggressive.

612
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,710
She's nothing like you.

613
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,230
My family abandoned me,

614
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,520
and I'm used to suffering
with my mother,

615
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:23,910
so I'm not as carefree
as Consort Jiangli,

616
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,560
nor do I have the same talents
and virtues.

617
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,840
I only know the Three Obediences
and Four Virtues

618
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,520
and follow my husband's orders.

619
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:39,080
Forget the Three Obediences
and Four Virtues.

620
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,320
She doesn't even take care
of my daily needs.

621
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,390
Whenever something displeases her,

622
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,390
she fights back fiercely.

623
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,630
Not only that,

624
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,230
but even my mother dislikes her.

625
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,840
Every time she tries to discipline her,

626
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,600
she refuses to listen

627
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,190
and argues back.

628
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,000
If only she could be

629
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,190
a little more sensible

630
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,320
like you.

631
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,470
If only she could be

632
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:25,560
a little more sensible

633
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:26,840
like you.

634
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,550
Miss Lian,

635
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,000
isn't this just a bird?

636
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,470
Don't worry about it.

637
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,670
It's still a life.

638
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,200
Since I saw it,

639
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,670
I can't just ignore it.

640
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,400
Master Jingming.

641
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,480
Greetings, Young Master.

642
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,750
Miss Lian,

643
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,360
how kind of you.

644
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,840
You flatter me, Master Jingming.

645
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,030
Please.

646
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,430
Master Jingming, what do you mean?

647
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,040
We got Tian to confess this time

648
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,710
thanks to you.

649
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:37,760
I've been busy with work

650
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,290
and didn't have time to thank you.

651
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,870
The other day,
you mentioned hometown dishes,

652
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,190
so I asked the kitchen to prepare a few.

653
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,000
I wonder if they suit your taste.

654
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,280
Thank you, Master Jingming.

655
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,840
You're too kind.

656
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,510
By the way,

657
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,840
have a look.

658
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:58,600
Is this your hairpin?

659
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,270
Yes, it is.

660
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,150
I searched the garden all night

661
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,150
but couldn't find it.

662
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,840
Unexpectedly, you did.

663
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,760
Perhaps it's fate.

664
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:15,840
Master Jingming, are you here
for Consort Jiangli?

665
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,240
Unfortunately,

666
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,120
she just left the mansion.

667
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,910
Actually,

668
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,470
I came to see you.

669
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,750
Yunyi,

670
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,150
why do you think Lian Wantang

671
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,840
is getting close to Master Jingming?

672
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,390
What could it be?

673
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,040
Master Jingming

674
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,110
is outstanding,

675
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,030
brave, and intelligent.

676
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,520
Isn't it normal for a woman
to admire him?

677
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,470
What about Consort Jiangli?

678
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,550
Is Master Jingming trying to find us

679
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,120
a new consort?

680
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,230
That won't do.

681
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,470
Mind your manners.

682
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,600
You drank quite a bit last night.

683
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,390
I was worried you'd have
a headache today,

684
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:01,590
so I made you some green tea

685
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,800
to help with the hangover.

686
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,150
Now, it seems

687
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,230
it was not necessary.

688
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,710
Are you okay?

689
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,480
Here.

690
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,570
Thank you, Master Jingming.

691
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:24,100
Miss Lian, are your feet okay?

692
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,390
Yunyi,

693
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,310
go get the ointment.

694
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,510
Yes.

695
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,040
Thank you, Master Jingming.

696
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,110
The tea you made

697
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,080
smells great.

698
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,790
If you like it,

699
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,910
I'll make it for you often.

700
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,320
But

701
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,870
you mustn't drink alone again.

702
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,680
If something's bothering you,

703
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,230
you can talk to me.

704
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:01,230
Maybe I can help with your burden.

705
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:02,790
Of course, you can.

706
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,630
Which one is good here,

707
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,760
the tea or the tea maker?

708
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,390
I should have listened to Yulan

709
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,940
and gone back to Wind Pavilion earlier.

710
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,500
(Rain Chamber)

711
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,120
My Lady.

712
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,840
My Lady.

713
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:41,710
What's wrong?

714
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,910
Master Jingming had someone
send this over just now.

715
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,040
I just ironed it.

716
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,040
Take a look.

717
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:52,280
This is the rare Shu brocade
with woven golden flowers.

718
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,800
It's very expensive.

719
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,560
I've been in the inner chambers
for decades,

720
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,230
and I've hardly seen it.

721
00:32:58,790 --> 00:32:59,960
Master Jingming is

722
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,760
truly considerate of you.

723
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,680
Look.

724
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,470
Its color suits you perfectly.

725
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,310
Is it for me?

726
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,070
What do you think?

727
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,950
Of course, it's for you.

728
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,840
What does the play say?

729
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,560
It's to make a belle smile.

730
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,950
I don't want it.

731
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,320
He just spent a romantic night
with someone,

732
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,040
and now he's giving me brocade?

733
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,870
I'm sure you don't mean that.

734
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,240
My Lady,

735
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,040
you should go and get ready.

736
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,720
When Master Jingming
had the brocade sent,

737
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,640
he said

738
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:31,790
he would

739
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,390
come here soon.

740
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,080
So what?

741
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,080
Why don't you understand?

742
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,760
Master Jingming

743
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,680
will take you out

744
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:44,320
to make some clothes.

745
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,590
Come on. Go and change.

746
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,480
Go and change.

747
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,000
Your current outfit is too plain.

748
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,110
Go on. Go get ready.

749
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,000
Is it too plain?

750
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,390
Yes, it's too plain.

751
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,630
Go and change into something
bright and pretty.

752
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,480
What would happen to this family

753
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,470
without me?

754
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,230
Is the Shu brocade ironed?

755
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,600
Coming, coming.

756
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,080
It's ironed.

757
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,480
This brocade is truly nice.

758
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,670
I only dared to touch it
after washing my hands

759
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,690
and applying moisturizer.

760
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,320
Young Master.

761
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,440
Young Master.

762
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,560
Consort Jiangli is here.

763
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:34,950
Good morning.

764
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:35,840
Good morning.

765
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,880
By the way,

766
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,150
do you think

767
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,080
Miss Lian will like the Shu brocade?

768
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,960
The Shu brocade is rare.

769
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,520
I'm sure Miss Lian will like it.

770
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,960
Do you think this pattern is

771
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,230
too gaudy?

772
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,830
I don't really understand patterns,

773
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,590
but women

774
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,790
like flashy things, right?

775
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,360
It makes sense.

776
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,920
It's for Miss Lian?

777
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,510
Yes.

778
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,310
I didn't say anything.

779
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,960
What's the matter?

780
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,880
Good.

781
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,960
Very good.

782
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,270
Only Miss Lian deserves

783
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,400
fabric like this.

784
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,960
Don't you think so?

785
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,520
Young Master, Miss Lian is here.

786
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,720
Jiangli.

787
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,240
Master Jingming.

788
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,290
Miss Lian, thank you
for the tea last time.

789
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:28,750
Today, I've prepared

790
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,400
some Shu brocade

791
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,320
to thank you.

792
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,240
What's the matter?

793
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,520
Do you not like it?

794
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,490
Master Jingming, you misunderstand.

795
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,630
The Shu brocade

796
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,110
is too precious.

797
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,660
You should give it to Consort Jiangli.

798
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,190
It's fine.

799
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,600
This was chosen for you.

800
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,840
If she likes it,

801
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,630
I'll choose more for her next time.

802
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,030
No need.

803
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,190
I don't like it.

804
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,470
Got it.

805
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,010
By the way,

806
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:02,710
I was planning to take you
to Moon Jewelry

807
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,830
to pick out some jewelry.

808
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,710
Let's go.

809
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,630
Well...

810
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,630
Miss Lian,

811
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:12,000
you don't need
to let Master Jingming down.

812
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,920
Then I'll respectfully follow your lead.

813
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,230
Thank you, Master Jingming.

814
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,150
Please.

815
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,480
Who cares about your Shu brocade?

816
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,510
I don't want it.

817
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,080
Exactly.

818
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,270
Pah. You little girl.

819
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:35,310
You're just a two-faced woman.

820
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,440
When did you start seducing
Master Jingming?

821
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,350
If I'd known the brocade was for you,

822
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,630
I would've hidden a few needles
in it to stab you.

823
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,080
How shameless.

824
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,920
Right, My Lady?

825
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,000
Mr. Chu, what are you doing?

826
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,350
I'm testing the effects
of some medicines

827
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,630
to see if they're affected
by temperature.

828
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,920
Have you got any results?

829
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,240
Of course.

830
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:21,550
Smell this.

831
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,230
The smell of some medicines

832
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,230
will drastically change

833
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,630
if they're heated or cooled.

834
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,670
Your Grace, that's thunder god vine.

835
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,190
Trinkets!

836
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,710
