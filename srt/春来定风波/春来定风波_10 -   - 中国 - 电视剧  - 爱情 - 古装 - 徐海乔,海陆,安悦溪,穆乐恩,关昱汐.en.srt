What are you waiting for?

23
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,090
Hurry up and think of a way

24
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,580
to stop the Prefect's pain!

25
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,090
My Lady,

26
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,530
I've administered acupuncture
and medicine to the Prefect,

27
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,220
but the old illness is stubborn.

28
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,600
The Prefect is now suffering

29
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,300
from a surge of anger

30
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,340
that worsens his condition.

31
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,530
I currently

32
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,220
can't find any way to relieve it.

33
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,890
You're useless.

34
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,430
- Leave.
- Yes.

35
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,050
Xiulan,

36
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,540
you should go rest.

37
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,650
I'll stay and serve the Prefect.

38
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,820
No need to trouble you.

39
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,770
Every time the Prefect's headache
flares up,

40
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,140
I've been the one to attend to him.

41
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,490
I know

42
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,730
the pressure of the massage.

43
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,140
Qinian,

44
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,170
you haven't had your dinner yet.

45
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,690
Would you like to have dinner now?

46
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,030
My Lord, Consort Jiangli
seeks an audience.

47
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,610
What does she want?

48
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,730
The Prefect is unwell.

49
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,650
Tell her

50
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,490
to come another day.

51
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,080
My Lady,

52
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,480
Consort Jiangli heard
the Prefect's headache had flared up,

53
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,580
so she came to treat him.

54
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,450
She's not a physician.

55
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,320
She doesn't know anything.
Tell her to leave.

56
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,860
Wait.

57
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,170
Xiulan,

58
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,140
I heard that she treated

59
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,380
Qingqing's face injury.

60
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,170
Why not let her try?

61
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:01,830
What do you think, Qinian?

62
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,100
Let her in.

63
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,290
Yes.

64
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,580
Greetings, My Lord,

65
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,050
Lady Wang, Lady Shu.

66
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,630
I heard that the Prefect's headache
flared up,

67
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,650
so I came to treat him.

68
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,140
The private physicians couldn't cure it.

69
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,730
Stop fooling around.

70
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:25,860
Go back now.

71
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,730
Xiulan, Jiangli has good intentions.

72
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,420
Let her give it a try.

73
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,890
Don't refuse her kindness.

74
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,140
Sometimes, experience doesn't matter.

75
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,380
Maybe she can cure the Prefect

76
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,650
by accident.

77
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,610
Jinyi, you're wrong.

78
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,330
The Prefect's health

79
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,260
cannot be handled recklessly.

80
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,700
Enough.

81
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,540
Since she's here,

82
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,100
it's okay to let her feel the pulse.

83
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:53,450
Yes.

84
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,580
My Lord, your headache

85
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,700
is caused by blocked qi and blood flow.

86
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,770
I need to use a triangular needle

87
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:18,970
to bleed you.

88
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:21,610
How dare you!

89
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,770
You're being reckless.

90
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,340
Bleeding?

91
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,060
If the Prefect's health worsens,

92
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,940
can you take responsibility for it?

93
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,130
Xiulan,

94
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,410
if the Prefect misses treatment

95
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,140
because you stopped it

96
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,410
and continues to suffer,

97
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,140
how will you live with yourself?

98
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,460
But

99
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,260
Father is sweating profusely.

100
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,530
His collar is soaked.

101
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,280
He must be in unbearable pain.

102
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,890
If we don't treat it,

103
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,090
it will harm him deeply.

104
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,260
Lady Shu, please trust me

105
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,450
and let me use the needle.

106
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,180
Stop it.

107
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,180
How can you fool around

108
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,500
in the Prefect's Mansion?

109
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,530
Don't make things worse with Jingming.

110
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,390
Lady Shu, please calm down.

111
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,290
Sorry for not thinking it through.

112
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,420
But

113
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,060
I have something

114
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,770
that can relieve the Prefect's pain

115
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,580
without being consumed.

116
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,970
It can relieve the pain
and stop sweating.

117
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,750
Is it so miraculous?

118
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,380
Hurry and show it to us.

119
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:21,940
Shen Jiangli,

120
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,020
you better be careful

121
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,210
when speaking here.

122
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,250
Yes.

123
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,290
Your ink is quite special.

124
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,740
It has a unique fragrance.

125
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,820
After I smelled it,

126
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,770
my headache eased significantly.

127
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:06,930
I selected herbs

128
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,210
that can calm the mind
and soothe the heart.

129
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,450
I combined them with this inkstone

130
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,650
and made this fragrance.

131
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:13,890
It also helps

132
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,190
focus the mind, calm the spirit,

133
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,450
and stop sweating.

134
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,100
Not bad.

135
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,210
I've sweated much less now.

136
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:28,690
Good.

137
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,770
Amitabha.

138
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,180
Amitabha.

139
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,580
In the end, it was I

140
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,450
who insisted on letting Jiangli try.

141
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,140
I originally thought

142
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,620
that if it didn't work,

143
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,410
I'd take the punishment for her.

144
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:43,940
Fortunately,

145
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,180
Jiangli didn't let me down.

146
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,580
It won't come to that.

147
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,410
After all, Jiangli
is my daughter-in-law.

148
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:52,740
If anyone should be punished,

149
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,770
it should be me.

150
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,530
No need to trouble you.

151
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,850
You can't discipline
your daughter-in-law.

152
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,050
Stop trying to take mine.

153
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,500
But

154
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,740
this fragrance can only
temporarily ease the pain.

155
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,450
To cure it completely,

156
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,060
acupuncture is still needed.

157
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,530
My Lord, please allow me

158
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,180
to perform acupuncture on you.

159
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:12,730
Sure.

160
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,820
Can the acupuncture

161
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,660
cure it?

162
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,900
Lady Shu,

163
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,090
I once studied medicine

164
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,380
at the ancestral tomb.

165
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,060
One acupuncture session can only

166
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,430
temporarily alleviate the headache.

167
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,850
To cure it completely,

168
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,500
it'll take at least six months.

169
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,140
My mind feels much clearer now.

170
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,220
Come on.

171
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,530
Help me up.

172
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,420
Help me up.

173
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,250
Slowly.

174
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:27,820
Jiangli has always

175
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,970
cared about the Prefect's illness.

176
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,050
She's fulfilled her duty.

177
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,650
This is what a daughter-in-law
should do.

178
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,050
You are

179
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,690
both filial and capable.

180
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:42,870
You should be rewarded.

181
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,820
Thank you, My Lord.

182
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,410
This is what I should do.

183
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,460
I'll try my best to cure you.

184
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,260
If you want to reward me,

185
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,500
I have a request.

186
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,690
What do you want?

187
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,380
I want a medicine

188
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,100
called the Lei Pill.

189
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,050
Do you know
how precious the Lei Pill is?

190
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,410
I know.

191
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,740
How dare you ask for them then?

192
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,410
Only someone
who once stabilized the nation

193
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,890
can ask for it.

194
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:15,770
Jiangli,

195
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,500
don't think
that just because you treated

196
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,260
the Prefect's headache,

197
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,860
you can demand rewards

198
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,100
and elevate yourself.

199
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,050
My Lord, Jiangli

200
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,890
has a loose tongue.

201
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,140
Given that she treated your illness

202
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,980
with care,

203
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,690
please don't blame her.

204
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,050
Jiangli,

205
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:40,290
I'll reward you with some jewelry,

206
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,690
which will be more useful.

207
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,290
I don't want jewelry.

208
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,650
- I...
- Don't be rude.

209
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,170
Treating the Prefect is your duty.

210
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,670
You should thank the Prefect.

211
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,180
Come on.

212
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,620
Reward Consort Jiangli
with ten bolts of silk

213
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,410
and two boxes of gold and jewels.

214
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:02,980
Thank you, My Lord.

215
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,470
I'll polish it a bit more.

216
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:09,650
How is it?

217
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,840
The Prefect didn't reward me
with the Lei Pill.

218
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:14,490
It's okay.

219
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,810
I believe that in a little more time,

220
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,840
the Zhuge crossbow
will definitely succeed.

221
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,410
So, how's it going
with the Zhuge crossbow?

222
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,500
Logically speaking,

223
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,460
the blueprints should be right.

224
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,530
The craftsmen have made the appearance

225
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,610
of the crossbow
according to the blueprints,

226
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,170
but something went wrong

227
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,010
at some point.

228
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,580
But don't worry.

229
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,650
The craftsmen have been testing it

230
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:39,770
day and night.

231
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,980
My Lady,

232
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:42,650
to make the crossbow,

233
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,020
Master Jingming stayed up all night

234
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,930
without a single bite.

235
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:45,890
Please talk to him.

236
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:46,730
You talk too much.

237
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,060
From today on,

238
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:52,650
I'll accompany you.

239
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:29,650
Useless!

240
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,410
Useless! Useless!

241
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,760
A bunch of useless fools!

242
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:34,960
How many days has it been?

243
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,510
You can't even produce
a weapon blueprint.

244
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,940
Please calm down.

245
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,410
The scout reports

246
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,930
that the envoys have changed their plan

247
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,230
and are likely to arrive
ten days earlier.

248
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,650
Even if we finish the blueprint now,

249
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:46,890
we won't have time to make it.

250
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,820
Fine.

251
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,340
Since I can't make it,

252
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,740
I won't let anyone else produce it.

253
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,410
Keep a close watch on Lu Jingming.

254
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,820
- Go!
- Yes.

255
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,220
How's it going on your side?

256
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,650
- Young Master, My Lady.
- Yes.

257
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:10,550
Young Master,

258
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,990
the arrow loading is more controlled,

259
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,620
but the accuracy is still not good.

260
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,460
Then you two

261
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,220
can go find more materials

262
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,890
that can be used for the bowstring.

263
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:19,740
Go ahead.

264
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,580
- Yes.
- Yes.

265
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,250
Yunyi.

266
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:25,890
I'll take the arrows.

But I don't know how to shoot.

273
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,100
It's okay. Just try.

274
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,580

it feels like honey
doesn't work very well.

286
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,410
But we've also tried

287
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,980
beeswax and ice cubes.

288
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,790
Is it because the friction

289
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,860
between the arrow path
and the arrow is too great?

290
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,140
Maybe we should reduce it.

291
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,570
Let's read the books again

292
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:38,570
and find other material.

293
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:39,410
Alright.

294
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:42,570
Okay, let's go.

296
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,260
Mother,

00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,100
I want to eat the braised pork you make.

298
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,700
Okay.

299
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,100
I'll make braised pork

300
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:02,940
for you right now.

301
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,530
Yanyan,

302
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,170
does it still hurt?

303
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,820
You nodded

304
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,060
because you were unwell
because of the illness.

305
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:23,500
You shook your head

306
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,570
to avoid worrying your mother,

307
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:26,940
right?

308
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,410
I'm a little man.

309
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,570
I have to protect Mother.

310
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,340
Good boy.

311
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:36,890
From now on,

312
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,100
I will protect Yanyan,

313
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,460
and

314
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,050
we'll protect your mother together,

315
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,340
okay?

316
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,820
Pinky promise.

317
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,100
Pinky promise.

318
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,220
Let's make a pinky promise.

319
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,740
We must never go back on our word.

320
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:51,610
Don't worry.

321
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:53,980
Sleep for a while.

322
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,060
When you wake up, it won't hurt anymore.

323
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,570
And you'll have braised pork, okay?

324
00:15:58,930 --> 00:15:59,770
Good boy.

325
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,820
Young Master, look.

326
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,410
We found peanut oil yesterday.

327
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,500
Peanut oil not only reduces friction

328
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,460
but also cools down.

329
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:19,620
But right now,

330
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,570
it's not very stable.

331
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,300
It still needs to be re-adjusted.

332
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,930
What if we try

333
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,860
to find a stable oil

334
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,170
and mix it with peanut oil?

335
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,770
Well...

336
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:40,860
If you're tired,

337
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:41,980
you can go rest.

338
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,380
We've tested so many times

339
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,460
but still haven't succeeded.

340
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,050
Time is running out.

341
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,100
I understand.

342
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,410
Don't worry.

343
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,100
I will think of a way to solve it.

344
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,130
Wax oil.

345
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,370
You go try mixing wax oil

346
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,290
and peanut oil.

347
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,500
Yes.

348
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:27,800
Young Master.

349
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,130
- How's it going?
- Young Master.

350
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:29,880
We made it.

351
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,850
We made it, Young Master!

352
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:31,690
We made it!

353
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,220
We made it!

354
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,980
We made it!

355
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,780
This is great!

356
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,180
We made it!

357
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:40,770
Young Master, please guide us.

358
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:41,700
Should we

359
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,080
start mass-producing the crossbows?

360
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,220
20 crossbows within five days.

361
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,420
Even one is missing...

362
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,740
I will die for it.

363
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,960
- Go ahead.
- Yes.

364
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,020
(Master Jingming's Mansion)

365
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,060
Young Master,

366
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,910
someone infiltrated
the workshop last night

367
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,020
and cut all the bowstrings

368
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,050
of the crossbows.

369
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,180
How could this happen?

370
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,780
I don't know.

371
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,290
I had someone guarding it last night

372
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,260
and hid the crossbows in a secret place.

373
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,030
It's hard for ordinary people
to find them.

374
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,500
So, I think

375
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,420
the culprit must be very familiar

376
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,700
with the layout of the mansion.

377
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,500
It seems

378
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,940
there are still some rats left
in the house.

379
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,700
But now the envoys have arrived,

380
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,390
and Yanyan can't wait any longer.

381
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,260
What should we do?

382
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,530
My Lady,

383
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,740
the craftsmen have tried every way

384
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,130
to repair the crossbow,

385
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:47,810
but...

386
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,610
The Prefect is here.

387
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:00,660
Greetings, My Lord.

388
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:01,970
Sit.

389
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,660
My Lord,

390
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,330
we are fortunate to be sent here.

391
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,740
We welcome your guidance.

392
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,050
Back in Nanzhou,

393
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,050
we heard that you've been peaceful
in recent years

394
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,420
with a strong army.

395
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,220
Since we've come here,

396
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,090
please broaden our horizons

397
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,500
so we don't leave in vain.

398
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,430
Your Excellencies,

399
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,930
since you hold us in such high regard,

400
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,980
I'll certainly treat you
with the utmost hospitality

401
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,850
so you may return home with joy.

402
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,090
Come on.

403
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,130
Let's drink.

404
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:32,690
Come on.

405
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,260
I've heard

406
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,760
that your men are incredibly brave

407
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,570
and skilled
in horseback riding and archery.

408
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,460
The people in Beizhou

409
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,960
have ridden horses
across the grassland since childhood.

410
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,460
I'd love to see your skills

411
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,460
and have a match.

412
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,130
How about

413
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,180
a horseback race?

414
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:52,860
Sure.

415
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:55,740
Where's Jingming?

416
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,170
Father.

417
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,300
Well,

418
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,330
before Jingming left,

419
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,470
his horse got a stomach ache.

420
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,370
It'll probably take a little time.

421
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,090
He'll be here soon.

422
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:10,700
Father,

423
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,330
I'm willing to race with the two envoys.

424
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,530
Good.

425
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,370
Go on then.

426
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:16,370
Thank you, Father.

427
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,290
Jingxiu should be able to win.

428
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,100
We won.

429
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,300
Father,

430
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:52,700
Jingxiu won.

431
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,370
Father,

432
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,130
sorry for showing off.

433
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,170
Good.

434
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,330
The second place

435
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,810
is just a common knight from Beizhou.

436
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,050
I saw Master Jingxiu

437
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,670
was only slightly ahead.

438
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,130
If our bravest knight

439
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,690
were here,

440
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,290
you might not win.

441
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,420
The outcome is not important.

442
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,370
It's fine.

443
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,460
As long as you don't lose your dignity.

444
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,810
The horses of Dongzhou are indeed strong

445
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:31,700
and enduring,

446
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:33,740
but excellent troops and horses

447
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,610
might not be enough to compete

448
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,940
with the other states,

449
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,130
especially Xizhou.

450
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,060
Father,

451
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,610
the Golden Guards have prepared

452
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,330
a drill for the envoys.

453
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:45,460
Father,

454
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,260
Your Excellencies,

455
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,180
please enjoy.

456
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:49,650
Alright.

457
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,820
Guards.

458
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,410
That's it?

459
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,180
We've seen something

460
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,740
better than this in Xizhou.

461
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,400
Nothing special.

462
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,260
Leave.

463
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,410
Your Excellencies,

464
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,460
you've truly seen it all.

465
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,940
You came here after visiting Xizhou,

466
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,810
trying to incite trouble.

467
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,500
What are you really after?

468
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,700
Why would I lie to you?

469
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:31,330
It's too bad that you lack sincerity

470
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,770
and show us this kind of thing.

471
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:35,700
It's hard not to think

472
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,500
you're trying to fool us.

473
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,970
Master Jingxiu, please don't be mad.

474
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,130
I thought Dongzhou could be

475
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,460
the leader among the four states,

476
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:43,530
leading us to govern the world together.

477
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,980
But now it seems to be far behind
from Xizhou.

478
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,370
What a pity.

479
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,860
- You...
- Jingxiu.

480
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:50,660
Don't be rude.

481
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,940
My Lord, Master Jingxiu,

482
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,500
we must go back now.

483
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,290
Sorry for troubling you.

484
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:57,450
Goodbye.

485
00:23:59,130 --> 00:23:59,970
Wait.

486
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,130
Father.

487
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,330
Your Excellencies,

488
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,740
if you want to see our strength,

489
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,180
you have to be

490
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,020
patient.

491
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,570
What's this?

492
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,010
Why does this seem so familiar?

493
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,900
Have you forgotten?

494
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:50,980
In Xizhou,

495
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,610
they also showed us a crossbow

496
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,580
like this

497
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,940
that can shoot eight arrows at once.

498
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,260
Your Excellencies, do you want to count

499
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,380
whether the arrows of our crossbows

500
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,180
are more than those of Xizhou's?

501
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,260
Xizhou's crossbow

502
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,060
can shoot eight arrows at once.

503
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,260
What's even more amazing

504
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,020
is that all eight arrows can hit
the target at the same time.

505
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,300
Master Jingming,

506
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,540
if you can't hit the target with this,

507
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,420
even if you had a hundred arrows,

508
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,180
it would be useless.

509
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,220
A hundred arrows?

510
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:25,580
Good idea.

511
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,660
Next time, we can develop the crossbow

512
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,940
in this direction as well.

513
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,700
Master Jingming, hurry up.

514
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,260
I'm a little tired.

515
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,060
Master Jingming,

516
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,340
I said I was tired.

517
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,780
Is that why you brought
a few kids here to play

518
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,390
and entertain us?

519
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,020
Master Jingming,

520
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,540
are you bringing the kids here

521
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,260
to shoot slingshots?

522
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,740
Jingming,

523
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,220
the envoys are here.

524
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,780
How can you play like this?

525
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,990
- Father.
- Sit down.

526
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,460
This...

527
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,860
You can start now.

528
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,260
This...

529
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,740
My crossbow

530
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,080
can shoot ten arrows at once,

531
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,580
and it's small and light.

532
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,860
As for the accuracy,

533
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,460
you can see it for yourselves.

534
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,160
The most important thing is

535
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,540
three kids

536
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,900
can easily operate it.

537
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,220
If I remember correctly,

538
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,350
in Xizhou,

539
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,380
it requires five trained warriors

540
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,860
to operate the crossbow.

541
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,220
Could it be the legendary
Zhuge crossbow?

542
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,300
Of course.

543
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,460
This one

544
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,020
is only an exhibit

545
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,980
just to show you two.

546
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,740
In Dongzhou,

547
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,340
there are no less

548
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,860
than 100 similar crossbows.

549
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,340
Over 100 crossbows?

550
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,060
Weapon quantities

551
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,260
should not be easily revealed.

552
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,540
You should be discreet.

553
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,860
Father,

554
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,380
I apologize.

555
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,380
Earlier, the Prefect
seemed quite worried.

556
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,980
Was it intentional to make us

557
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,160
let our guard down?

558
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,500
Dongzhou is

559
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,340
truly full of hidden talents.

560
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,340
This visit

561
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,740
has been quite fruitful.

562
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,580
We hope to ally with Dongzhou

563
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,180
and join forces

564
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,820
to combat Xizhou's dominance.

565
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,500
Yes, yes.

566
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,700
That's right.

567
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,580
Your Excellencies, you have sharp eyes.

568
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,020
Come on.

569
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:56,860
Let's drink.

570
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,060
Cheers.

571
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,940
This time, during the envoys' visit,

572
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,540
Jingming's crossbow

573
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,260
has been in the spotlight.

574
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,820
Jingxiu is also good.

575
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,420
I'm truly pleased.

576
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,140
- You flatter me.
- You flatter me.

577
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,220
Jingming,

578
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,780
you've silently

579
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,100
done so much.

580
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,540
I must reward you properly.

581
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,180
Father,

582
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,700
I have

583
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,460
a request.

584
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,340
Tell me.

585
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,380
I want the Lei Pill.

586
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,580
You also want the Lei Pill?

587
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,980
- Yes.
- Both you and your wife

588
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,460
are asking for the Lei Pill from me.

589
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,300
What's it for?

590
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:51,450
My Lord,

591
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,640
why ask so many questions?

592
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,380
This time, Jingming
has done great service.

593
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,700
He's contributed to the nation.

594
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,820
This military demonstration

595
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,620
has prevented many wars.

596
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,420
All he's asking for is a pill.

597
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,460
Father,

598
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,860
Mother is right.

599
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,410
Jingming is righteous,

600
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:10,300
and Jiangli can save lives.

601
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,700
They must be using the pill for good.

602
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,220
Jingming has helped me resolve

603
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,820
an urgent crisis in Dongzhou.

604
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,380
It's stabilized the national affairs.

605
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,260
When the nation is stable,

606
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,440
it can prosper,
and the people can live in peace.

607
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,540
You can have

608
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:26,870
the Lei Pill.

609
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,140
Thank you, Father.

610
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,740
There's one more thing.

611
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,220
Lately, Jingming has improved a lot.

612
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,060
It's time for you to share

613
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,100
my burdens.

614
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,590
The position of Commander
of the Qilin Guards

615
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,710
has been vacant for a while.

616
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,020
From today onwards,

617
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,540
it will be your responsibility.

618
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,380
Thank your father now.

619
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,100
Thank you, Father.

620
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,020
Congratulations, Jingming.

621
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,160
In the future, if you have

622
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,720
any doubts regarding military matters,

623
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,660
feel free to consult me.

624
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,780
The door to the Golden Guards

625
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,020
will always be open to you.

626
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:13,940
Thank you, Jingxiu.

627
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,700
Now that you're the Commander
of the Qilin Guards,

628
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,100
you'll have to make achievements

629
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,570
to win everyone's respect.

630
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,380
Today, the Astrology Bureau reported

631
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,860
that an earthquake occurred

632
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,900
in the southern suburbs,

633
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,740
and the people are displaced
and suffering.

634
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,140
Now,

635
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:39,390
I command you to provide relief

636
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:40,940
and comfort to the people there.

637
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,220
Father, rest assured.

638
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,430
I won't let you down.

639
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,940
Congratulations, Jingming.

640
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,630
You can be on equal footing with me now.

641
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:52,140
I'm truly happy for you.

642
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,220
Jingxiu, I'll need your guidance

643
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,220
in the future.

644
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,280
Jingming,

645
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:00,000
your crossbow was hidden quite deep.

646
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,730
It wasn't hidden well enough,

647
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,660
so the strings of 20 crossbows

648
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,620
were cut,

649
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,330
almost ruining the whole plan.

650
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,820
How could this happen?

651
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,460
Then, how did you find

652
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,540
the silkworm silk again?

653
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:16,900
Jingxiu,

654
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,140
when did I ever tell you

655
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,020
the strings of the crossbow

656
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,340
were made of silkworm silk?

657
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,890
I saw it today on the training grounds.

658
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,780
Jingxiu, you truly have sharp eyes.

659
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,560
From such a distance,

660
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,760
you can tell the material

661
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,220
at a glance.

662
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:37,840
The strings were all cut.

663
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:38,980
Jingming,

664
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,630
could it be

665
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,100
an accident?

666
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,420
I always prepare

667
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,940
for the worst.

668
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,540
In fact, I prepared

669
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,340
these five crossbows in advance

670
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,300
and stored them at home

671
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,340
just to prevent such an accident.

672
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,660
Jingming, you really plan ahead.

673
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,620
Thank you for the compliment.

674
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,820
I must go now to lead the Qilin Guards

675
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,020
and complete Father's task.

676
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,580
Goodbye.

677
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,660
Go ahead, Jingming.

678
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,660
The useless fools at home

679
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,900
can't get anything done.

680
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,380
Lord Zhou.

681
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,860
Lord Zhou, please wait.

682
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,780
Master Jingxiu,

683
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,300
do you have some advice for me?

684
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,420
I wouldn't dare.

685
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,380
Lord Zhou, you are the first disciple

686
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,560
of the Wind Pavilion's chief.

687
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,940
By observing the stars at night,

688
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,660
you can see
the major events of the world.

689
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,740
What could I possibly advise you on?

690
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,900
However,

691
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,460
as the Prefect's eldest lineal son,

692
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:44,140
I'm quite concerned about the earthquake

693
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,020
so I'd like to ask

694
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:47,460
if you have any method

695
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,780
to help the Prefect resolve
the immediate crisis.

696
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,820
Well.

697
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,660
Lord Zhou,

698
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,220
why don't you come to my home
to discuss it in detail?

699
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,340
I happen to acquire a piece

700
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,580
of fine Hetian jade.

701
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,820
Why don't we

702
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,140
appreciate it together?

703
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:05,980
Alright.

704
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,020
I'll take the liberty

705
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,180
to accept your invitation.

706
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:10,860
Let's go.

707
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:23,900
Jiangli.

708
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,420
What's wrong?

709
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:31,860
Take this.

710
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,220
Take a look.

711
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,300
What is this?

712
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,140
Open it.

713
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,140
The Lei Pill!

714
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,660
This is the Lei Pill!

715
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:43,860
That's great!

716
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:44,980
With the Lei Pill,

717
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,940
I can cure Yanyan.

718
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,540
I'll go prepare the medicine.

719
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,700
Thank you so much.

720
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,500
It's what I should do.

721
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,700
Yanyan.

722
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,180
Mr. Cute, you've made up with Mother?

723
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,020
Yes.

724
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,700
Guess which hand I have something in.

725
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,800
You can try your best
to take it from me.

726
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:31,980
If you manage to take it,

727
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,420
it'll be yours.

728
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,180
Yanyan, you're so strong.

729
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,220
What is it?

730
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,220
Yanyan.

731
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,780
Come on.

732
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,420
Here, drink your medicine.

733
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,020
Mother,

734
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,980
what kind of medicine is this?

735
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,260
It's so bitter.

736
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,420
Yanyan,

737
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,060
this is a very special medicine.

738
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,630
After drinking it,

739
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,700
your illness will never flare up again.

740
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:07,980
Alright.

741
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,140
Drink slowly so you don't choke.

742
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,860
- Is it bitter?
- Yes.

743
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,220
Here.

744
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:27,860
Yanyan,

745
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,760
after you drink this special medicine,

746
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,180
your body will become really strong.

747
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,980
You can play cuju with me,

748
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,500
and we can even shoot arrows.

749
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:37,900
Would you like that?

750
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:38,900
Sure.

751
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,100
Good boy.

752
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,100
Mother, Mr. Cute,

753
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,420
come and look!

754
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:03,330
♪The sound of the flute lingers,
making the night more tender♪

755
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,280
What are we looking at?

756
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,260
They seem like a family.

757
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:12,560

Yulan.

764
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,240
Write a letter to Senior Brother.

765
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:48,590
We must return

766
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,100
to the Wind Pavilion asap.

767
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,580
Yes, Jiangli.

768
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,780
That potted bush lily has withered.

769
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,060
Throw it away.

770
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,420
Yes.

771
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,700
Are you going out?

772
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,100
We are leaving.

773
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,220
Leaving?

774
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,060
I've got the Lei Pill,

775
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,060
and you've got the Qilin Guards.

776
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,960
With your wisdom,

777
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,460
becoming the Young Prefect

778
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,080
is only a matter of time.

779
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,780
There's nothing more
I can help you with.

780
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,460
Where are you going?

781
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,300
To the place I came from.

782
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,500
Don't worry.

783
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,740
I will honor

784
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,500
our previous agreement.

785
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:11,820
Yanyan,

786
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,180
this is for you.

787
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,340
Thank you.

788
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,860
Actually,

789
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,820
Yanyan hasn't fully recovered.

790
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,980
You can stay here a little longer.

791
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,620
After all,

792
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,220
he can receive better care here.

793
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,020
We've already gotten

794
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,500
what we wanted.

795
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,860
It's time for us

796
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,900
to part ways.

797
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,580
Yes.

798
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,140
When will you leave?

799
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,040
The day after tomorrow.
