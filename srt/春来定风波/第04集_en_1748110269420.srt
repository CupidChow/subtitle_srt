1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,640
My Girlfriend is an Alien

2
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,640
Episode 16

3
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,800
This woman in Shenjiang is very vicious.

4
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,240
She seduced my second brother.

5
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,440
This time, the Taoist priest

6
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,520
must help me get rid of this evil spirit.

7
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,800
Don't worry, Your Highness.

8
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,160
I'm here.

9
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,000
I'll make this bitch

10
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,560
pay for it.

11
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,400
I'm relieved

12
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,720
that the Taoist priest is here.

13
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,200
Senior Sister, Her Highness is here.

14
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,280
She's on her way here.

15
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,240
Go and take care of Yan Yan.

16
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,240
Yes, Senior Sister.

17
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,400
Guards.

18
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,240
Yes.

19
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,360
Open the door.

20
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:25,840
Yes.

21
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,800
Guards.

22
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,000
No.

23
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,760
No.

24
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,840
Shen Jiangli,

25
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,080
how dare you?

26
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,480
You ruined my face five years ago.

27
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,240
Now you dare to come back?

28
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,480
Qingqing,

29
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,920
I told you five years ago

30
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,960
that I didn't do the wound on your face.

31
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,880
I did the bite.

32
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,320
Do you have any evidence?

33
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,000
You didn't talk to me like this before.

34
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,720
You are really a big-hearted person.

35
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,080
You must have been fooled by something dirty.

36
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,480
Guards.

37
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,600
Keep her under control.

38
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,800
Let Taoist priest Li have a good look

39
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,040
at what he's been fooled by.

40
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,200
Your Highness,

41
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,880
I feel a sense of evil

42
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,600
after I entered this room.

43
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,200
Can you lend me a NATO knife?

44
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:41,160
Five-star

45
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,840
riding,

46
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,480
Deserts.

47
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:22,580
A

48
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,800
Shen Jiangli,

49
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,720
you've been rebelled.

50
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,040
Qingqing,

51
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,280
I'm your second sister-in-law.

52
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,760
Don't be fooled by the evil.

53
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,400
Don't do stupid things again.

54
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,840
Second sister-in-law?

55
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,280
I don't have a sister-in-law

56
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,680
who is cruel and vicious like you.

57
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,520
Take her down!

58
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,640
You...

59
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,360
You're so rude!

60
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,680
I'll see who dares to do it.

61
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,240
How dare you!

62
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,520
You dare to fight with the second sister-in-law?

63
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,720
You're dead!

64
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,640
Qingqing,

65
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,640
what are you doing?

66
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,000
Brother,

67
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,640
you're just in time.

68
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,280
Shen Jiangli was rebelled

69
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,000
and his family is in trouble.

70
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,040
I asked Taoist Li to expel the evil.

71
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,120
Who gave you the guts

72
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,600
to talk about the evil here?

73
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,080
Get him out!

74
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:24,880
Yes.

75
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,240
Stop!

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,640
Brother,

77
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,200
Taoist Li is famous in the city.

78
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,920
He said that Shen Jiangli was rebelled.

79
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,760
How could it be fake?

80
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,320
Don't make me hear you say such nonsense again.

81
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,320
God bless you.

82
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,240
The second young master seems to have a lot of prejudice against Taoism.

83
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,200
I'm the one who was sent by the late emperor

84
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,120
to cultivate the body of Jin Gang.

85
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,640
If I can get this Tao,

86
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,560
will you be willing to apologize?

87
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,000
You're nothing.

88
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,960
How dare you ask me for a condition?

89
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,960
Brother,

90
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,000
I believe Taoist Li.

91
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,800
Why don't you take a look?

92
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,040
My husband,

93
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,480
since Qingqing said so,

94
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,600
let's take a look at Taoist Li.

95
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,320
He's not a bad person, right?

96
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,040
He looks too familiar.

97
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,520
Miss What'sэт into Taoist Li's heart?

98
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,560
Back to the Freedom身 Thailand.

99
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:34,680
Chief holy的心心

100
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,440
that東下那小亭

101
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,280
wants to fight with hesitation.

102
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,040
What does she want?

103
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,000
I think it's not worth talking about.

104
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,400
As long as you can hear the sound,

105
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,960
nothing can kill a human being.

106
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,440
Princess.

107
00:06:52,960 --> 00:07:05,400
What's wrong with you,

108
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,800
Your Grace?

109
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,320
Your Grace.

110
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,240
Is she having a runny nose?

111
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,260
This is not devoteenaudible.

112
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,060
It will not hinder defense.

113
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,060
is just a mixture of oil and vinegar.

114
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,980
The oil is lighter than the vinegar,

115
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,740
so the oil will stick to the surface.

116
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,740
And the vinegar will be easily burned.

117
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,740
So this pot that looks boiling

118
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,740
is not hot at all.

119
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,020
You guys go try it.

120
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,460
Don't try it easily.

121
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,740
The amount of oil and vinegar is considered.

122
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,860
If you can't control it,

123
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,060
it will still be burnt.

124
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:00,860
Go.

125
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,140
Hurry up.

126
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:07,780
young master.

127
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,460
You are here finally.

128
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:15,660
Young Master.

129
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,540
You really are here.

130
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:18,720
Look,

131
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:20,800
nothing happened.

132
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:22,900
Anybody there?

133
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,100
W-wait.

134
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,260
I am

135
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,340
the Qingchuan disciple of Taishang rev Samsung Army.

136
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,060
How could you touch me?

137
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,660
Exactly.

138
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,700
You are dodging the draft of footpaths.

139
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,060
You trap all brute and deceited monsters with these tricks.

140
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,900
You humiliate the reputation of Taoism

141
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,380
Yunyi, Yunjiu, take the Taoist priest

142
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,500
and let's go inside to have a chat.

143
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,540
Yes.

144
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,780
Young Master, Consort Yanyan,

145
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,100
I'm sorry.

146
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,180
Please forgive me.

147
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,420
I won't do it again.

148
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,020
Shut up.

149
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,740
You're a liar.

150
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,100
You've tricked us into coming here.

151
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,220
Take him down

152
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,100
and beat him 50 times.

153
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,340
Yes.

154
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,620
Please spare us.

155
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,300
Please spare us.

156
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,060
Please spare us.

157
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:05,700
Please spare us.

158
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,300
Please spare us.

159
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,020
Please spare us.

160
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,820
Please spare us.

161
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,540
Don't believe

162
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,060
these self-righteous lies anymore.

163
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:15,780
Yunyi,

164
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,780
you treated me like this

165
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,900
for a woman.

166
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,620
Have you forgotten

167
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,860
how I've been living these years?

168
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:25,860
Let's go.

169
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,580
Qingqing didn't do this before.

170
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,140
All these years,

171
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,660
it's because she...

172
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,220
I know it even if you don't say it.

173
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,340
What kind of person is Qingqing?

174
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,100
She must have done this

175
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,900
after hearing Wang Dali's instigation.

176
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,620
Where's sister-in-law?

177
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,380
Why did you find this for me?

178
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,580
I didn't do it.

179
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,300
I didn't do it.

180
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,100
I didn't do it.

181
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,860
I didn't do it.

182
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,620
I didn't do it.

183
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,420
I didn't do it.

184
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,380
Why did you find

185
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,700
such a fraud?

186
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,140
You, Taoist Li,

187
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,020
made me

188
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,180
show my face in front of Shen Jiangli.

189
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,660
Qingqing,

190
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,780
don't worry.

191
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,780
Let me explain.

192
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:15,940
I don't know

193
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,420
that Taoist Li is a fraud.

194
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:18,660
Otherwise,

195
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,620
let's send him to the court.

196
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,980
I don't care about

197
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,540
the Taoist Li's life

198
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,420
before I get involved in this.

199
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:28,860
Shen Jiangli,

200
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,300
I really underestimated you.

201
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,060
In fact, these years,

202
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,660
my father asked him

203
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,140
to travel around

204
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,020
to make him more open-minded.

205
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,420
He didn't have to be trapped in this house.

206
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,100
He always thought about the injuries.

207
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,900
The Lu family has always been a fierce army.

208
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,140
Since I joined the army,

209
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,060
I've been the one

210
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,660
to make all the mistakes

211
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,060
in the eyes of the people.

212
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,860
After what happened today,

213
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,460
I'd like to find the evidence

214
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,300
and show you the truth.

215
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:05,540
By the way,

216
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,260
I've been thinking about

217
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,700
something that

218
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,860
makes me feel uneasy.

219
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,420
Recently, my family is arranging Qingqing

220
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,620
to marry Su Ruian,

221
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,700
the son of the talented man in Jiangnan.

222
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,340
I think Qingqing

223
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,620
seems to like him.

224
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,660
He is a man of great power.

225
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,420
I do hear about it.

226
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,140
But Su Ruian

227
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,140
is the nephew of the First Madam.

228
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,260
Now I'm competing with the Young Master.

229
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,180
I don't think

230
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,220
she is so kind.

231
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,420
I'm afraid she's not a good person.

232
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,220
It seems that there's something wrong.

233
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,020
I'll send someone to inquire.

234
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,540
Okay.

235
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,420
I'm doing this for myself.

236
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,020
I don't want to have any more trouble.

237
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,580
Brother,

238
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,340
Consort Shou is really something.

239
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,580
The man who was in charge of the oil pot

240
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,700
scared me to death.

241
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,980
How did she know?

242
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,620
I heard that she can

243
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,620
make the man of the man know.

244
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,100
How did Consort Shou

245
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,220
know that she is the son of the General?

246
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,180
I don't know either.

247
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,980
The oil is easily burned in the air.

248
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,780
It must be

249
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,700
the white forest on the paper.

250
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,100
The Young Master is really something.

251
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,140
I don't know anything.

252
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,340
I think

253
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,460
she's a role-model.

254
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,220
Maybe.

255
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,940
Many people are crazy aboutism.

256
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,940
It must be the Labor bun Gespr害.

257
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,540
No matter who knows that

258
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:49,400
her father worked for

259
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,260
heraltism.

260
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,300
It'sç

261
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,420
One could become a happener

262
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:59,340
when getting under the surprise of becoming a new merman.

263
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,100
I hope you won't blame me

264
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,100
for not saving you.

265
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,620
Please don't blame me.

266
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,420
What's this?

267
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,620
Pigeon soup.

268
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,420
It's a warm soup.

269
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,660
Pigeon?

270
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:13,700
Yes.

271
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,020
Where did you get it?

272
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:16,900
It's...

273
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,580
It's nearby.

274
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:19,940
Momo,

275
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,660
you got my personality

276
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,940
and made soup for me.

277
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,700
How can I thank you?

278
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,060
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

279
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,260
I didn't know.

280
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,660
Your Highness,

281
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,180
can you consider

282
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,340
my filial piety?

283
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,700
Your Highness...

284
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,180
I met that bitch

285
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,380
in the city.

286
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,820
Really?

287
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,060
Absolutely.

288
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,940
I'm so bold

289
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,140
to lie to you.

290
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,540
I'm the elder sister

291
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,260
of that bitch,

292
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,300
and one day,

293
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,340
I met that bitch on the street.

294
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,140
She was so sure

295
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,740
that she was the one who caused Junruo's destruction.

296
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,300
I remember clearly

297
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,820
that bitch

298
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,260
had a scar on her face.

299
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:09,620
Senior sister,

300
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,740
the person who Momo gave her

301
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,020
on the portrait

302
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,220
should be around here.

303
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,500
Let's look for her.

304
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,420
Yes, senior sister.

305
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,060
Senior sister,

306
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,460
that person should be Atai.

307
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,580
I'll catch him with my sword.

308
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,620
Don't do it yet.

309
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,780
There are many people around.

310
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,820
Let's follow him.

311
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,300
What is the Golden House?

312
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,220
It's the owner of the house.

313
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,420
When they were in a bad state,

314
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,420
they were all like me.

315
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,700
They spent their days here.

316
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,740
They

317
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,380
didn't feel comfortable with me.

318
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,500
Someone is going to suffer.

319
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,860
It's not me.

320
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,780
I'm the one who deserves to be punished.

321
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,380
No, it's not me.

322
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,540
Who can I offend

323
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,020
with a villain like me?

324
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,980
If you offend the consort,

325
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,140
you'll be punished.

326
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,260
Go.

327
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,140
Who dares to touch the consort?

328
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:42,780
Tie her up.

329
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,940
Don't let her run away again.

330
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:44,780
Yes.

331
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,260
How did you find me?

332
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,780
You know it all.

333
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,340
You watched my whereabouts

334
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,060
and found out my past.

335
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,580
What are you afraid of me for?

336
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,500
I didn't expect you

337
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,780
to use this kind of

338
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,060
unkindness.

339
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:09,780
Forget it.

340
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,300
The low sound makes the night more unhappily.

341
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:27,260
The starlight makes the night more romantic.

342
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,460
The light turns blue and the story is not over.

343
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,820
It takes another thousand months.

344
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,700
The red candle burns and the wine is soaked.

345
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:44,780
From now on, I dare to go to the mountains.

346
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,860
The world is so dry and the north and west are scattered.

347
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,100
For today,

348
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:52,940
thank you.

349
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,580
You're welcome.

350
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,100
We're allies now.

351
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,500
I'll keep you safe.

352
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,660
Find me Lianwan as soon as possible.

353
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,700
Those people

354
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,220
are obviously looking for that Tai.

355
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,140
I'm caring about my consort.

356
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,980
Please protect yourself.

357
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:16,780
I see.

358
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:21,820
Let's go.

359
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,340
Thank you.

360
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,460
Thank you, Mr. Su, for accompanying me today

361
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,860
to relieve mywardness.

362
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:36,460
Meiyan,

363
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,900
you don't have to be so polite to me.

364
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,740
This food is delicious.

365
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,860
I've been to many places

366
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,060
and it tastes so nice...

367
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:53,900
Be careful.

368
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,020
Thank you.

369
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,340
It's fine.

370
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,780
The beauty is still beautiful.

371
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,380
You really don't care?

372
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:15,860
It's late.

373
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,180
Your mother is waiting outside.

374
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,380
Go back early.

375
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,580
See you next time.

376
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,500
What's wrong with you?

377
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,540
I failed.

378
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,780
What do you mean by that?

379
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,780
Shen Jiangli and Tai

380
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,740
can die.

381
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,860
They didn't die.

382
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,700
None of them died.

383
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,260
What are you going to do?

384
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,540
Please don't be angry.

385
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,060
It's because the second young master suddenly appeared.

386
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,660
Otherwise, they would have been killed.

387
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,340
Lu Jingming?

388
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,300
Yes.

389
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:10,140
He also brought Tai back to the second young master's mansion.

390
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,860
Useless.

391
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,900
Who are you looking for?

392
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,500
You can't do such a small thing.

393
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,020
If Tai goes out and talks nonsense,

394
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,780
I will be angry.

395
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,100
Please don't be angry.

396
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,020
Tai doesn't dare to ask for you.

397
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,740
If he goes out and talks nonsense,

398
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,020
it's also Shen Jiangli who went to fight Chengzhao

399
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,620
and made a confession to Tai

400
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,180
and slandered you.

401
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,420
Who are you?

402
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,180
Why do you ask me to come here?

403
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,540
Do you know the princess?

404
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,180
Princess?

405
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,580
I'm just a stinky beggar.

406
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,300
How can I have anything to do with the princess?

407
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,940
If you talk about the girl from the courier house,

408
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,620
I can say a few things.

409
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,980
This is the second young master's mansion.

410
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,740
The second young master and the second young lady

411
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,380
won't come here without any reason.

412
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,540
Behave yourself.

413
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,860
What's wrong with the second young master?

414
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,220
The second young master can just arrest anyone.

415
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,780
You're playing dumb, aren't you?

416
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:12,820
Yulan.

417
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,180
Yes.

418
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,540
Let me tell you.

419
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,500
We'll handle everything you do.

420
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,460
Now is the time to give you a chance.

421
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,020
Tai.

422
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,140
Do you know what this is?

423
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,580
This is the blood of the Xiren.

424
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,860
If you don't tell the truth,

425
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,660
I'll call you covered in honey.

426
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,460
The blood of the Xiren

427
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,620
is the most popular honey.

428
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,260
I'll tell you.

429
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,420
I'll tell you.

430
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,580
Last year,

431
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,740
Cheng Nan was lost.

432
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,860
I did that.

433
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,260
I just stole a piece of silver.

434
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,500
And that...

435
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,820
Last year, the restaurant was on fire.

436
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,900
I set the fire.

437
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,180
I just built a few hotels.

438
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:57,860
Boss Chen,

439
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,740
you asked someone to hit me with his right leg.

440
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,740
I was so angry that I set the fire.

441
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,460
And that...

442
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,100
That money...

443
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,380
Tell me about it five years ago.

444
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,500
Five years ago?

445
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,780
I don't remember.

446
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,460
You don't remember?

447
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,300
Let me give you a hint.

448
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,620
Five years ago,

449
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,260
on the day of the master's birthday banquet,

450
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,620
someone saw

451
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,860
you and half a servant

452
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,100
sneaked into the Master's Mansion

453
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,420
and poisoned the wine cup of the Master.

454
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,100
Fortunately, the guards found out.

455
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,700
But you escaped.

456
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,140
Nonsense.

457
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:27,980
I didn't.

458
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,460
If you don't want to see the coffin,

459
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,100
then go back to the Master's Mansion with me.

460
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,100
It's not that easy to talk there.

461
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,140
I was really near the Master's Mansion that day.

462
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,140
I was drunk.

463
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,380
I accidentally

464
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,540
dragged a girl down from the carriage.

465
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,980
Then I knew

466
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,460
it was the Princess.

467
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,380
Who is the girl?

468
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,660
No one.

469
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,580
It was an accident.

470
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,460
A-Tan, think it over.

471
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,580
Your master is going to kill you.

472
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,660
If I wasn't there today,

473
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,260
you would have been dead by now.

474
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,300
Now if only the Master's Mansion can save your life,

475
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,500
don't cut your own way out.

476
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,820
I'm most annoying

477
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,700
to deal with stupid people.

478
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,260
Take me away.

479
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,700
I'll tell you.

480
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,700
It's all

481
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,980
ordered by the Princess.

482
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,020
The Princess?

483
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,700
Tell me the truth.

484
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,980
If I think one word is fake,

485
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,740
I'll send you to the Master's Mansion.

486
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,220
The Princess sent someone to find me

487
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,980
and asked me to kill you.

488
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,220
The Princess gave the girl a lot of money.

489
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,780
Then the Princess found me again

490
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,820
and said I couldn't tell anyone about it.

491
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,940
Otherwise, I would die in a dead end.

492
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:44,780
She also said

493
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,100
if someone found me

494
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,780
and asked me to kill you,

495
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,820
it was

496
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,540
ordered by the Princess.

497
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,860
It's true.

498
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,100
Wang Danlin is so domineering.

499
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,900
He's really a vicious man.

500
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,300
He wants to kill someone.

501
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,660
Take him away.

502
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,500
Keep him under control.

503
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,380
Yes.

504
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:06,700
Let's go.

505
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,460
Now that I have the witness,

506
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,420
I finally wash away my grievance.

507
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,420
But Qingqing is innocent.

508
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,340
She's involved in the fight between Wang Danlin and me.

509
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,340
We should tell Qingqing the truth.

510
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,500
I was wrong about you

511
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,300
when you were betrayed.

512
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:35,220
Tomorrow, I'll take her

513
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,660
to explain it to Qingqing.

514
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:41,780
Senior sister.

515
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,340
Senior sister.

516
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,620
You asked me to investigate Su Ruian.

517
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,900
He's really suspicious.

518
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,700
What did you find?

519
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,660
Su Ruian is a bad guy.

520
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,860
He's not a talent from Jiangnan.

521
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:50,820
He's a fake.

522
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,660
Many people in Jiangnan know it.

523
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,260
But it's hard to tell

524
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,260
because of his father.

525
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,780
Even his acquaintance

526
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,020
was asked to take the exam by his father.

527
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,260
How did he win the game of chess

528
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,340
in the camp recently?

529
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,140
I think it's the same old trick.

530
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,940
Spend money and cheat.

531
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,220
Let's find out how he cheated.

532
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,620
Okay, senior sister.

533
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,460
Interesting.

534
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,020
What's interesting?

535
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,020
I investigated Su Ruian.

536
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,460
He's really suspicious.

537
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,500
Second Young Consort is really powerful.

538
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,020
With Tai's case,

539
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,980
Qingqing's grudge can be solved.

540
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,340
You're just in time.

541
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,380
Give me some money.

542
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,500
How much?

543
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,420
The more, the better.

544
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,100
Now you have the power to manage the household.

545
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,620
Just ask the accountant

546
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,460
how much you want.

547
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,380
You don't ask me what I want?

548
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,420
What do you want?

549
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,500
I want to see a big show.

550
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,380
Aunt Dan, it's been five days.

551
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,220
Why hasn't he come to me yet?

552
00:24:59,060 --> 00:24:59,860
Your Highness,

553
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,260
maybe Mr. Su is delayed.

554
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,380
What delay?

555
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,780
What does that grass bag want him to do?

556
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,900
Mr. Su is a talented man in Jiangnan.

557
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,980
A talented man in Jiangnan?

558
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,020
What do you mean?

559
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,420
You're just talking nonsense.

560
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,300
Shen Jiangli,

561
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,260
why do you always have a problem with me?

562
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,140
You ruined my reputation five years ago.

563
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,300
Now you want to ruin my marriage.

564
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,620
I didn't do what I did five years ago.

565
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,140
Now I'm helping you.

566
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,540
Su Ruian is not a good person.

567
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,540
I've sent a message to him.

568
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,940
He also sent someone to reply.

569
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,900
See you at the villa tomorrow at 9 a.m.

570
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,140
You'll know it.

571
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,700
Miss Su욱 these days

572
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,020
can't tell if he's real.

573
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,220
I'vewritten the contract for each of you.

574
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,900
I won't miss a single opportunity.

575
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,460
I'll buy you some lunch from you.

576
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,020
I hope you don't miss such an opportunity.

577
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,780
Please take care of her.

578
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,580
You can enjoy the show later.

579
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,300
Yes.

580
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,780
Mr. Su, the time has come.

581
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,940
It's time to show up.

582
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,580
I'm sorry.

583
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,700
It's a bit late.

584
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,700
May I ask your name?

585
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,500
Don't bother.

586
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,060
Just get started.

587
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,540
You're good at it.

588
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,020
Zitan Bai Yu.

589
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:27,820
Miss,

590
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,260
you're my opponent.

591
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,860
I made a reservation here

592
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,020
to make this arrangement.

593
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,100
Are you satisfied?

594
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,940
Yes, I'm very satisfied.

595
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,660
Please have a seat.

596
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,100
Liu Yan,

597
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,180
have a seat.

598
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,500
Are you not going to play?

599
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,180
I'm sorry, Miss.

600
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,380
My son is always so good at chess.

601
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,460
It's helpful for him to think about chess

602
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,460
when he's away from the chessboard.

603
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,140
You're really

604
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,780
extraordinary, Mr. Su.

605
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,620
I'm flattered.

606
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,340
I'm flattered.

607
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,500
Please have a seat, Miss.

608
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,660
Thank you for taking your precious me.

609
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,260
Four. This is the District Coach practice.

610
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,860
Please make an advanced move first.

611
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,100
No. 1, Tianyuan.

612
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,860
How out of places.

613
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,060
She Minnesota No. 1 Xia Tianyuan?

614
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,220
How ridiculous?

615
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,500
Seems that she's still outraged.

616
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,420
33.

617
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,380
One sauce per person.

618
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,040
Your Highness,

619
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,660
you may go ahead.

620
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,620
I'll bring you some petals.

621
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:50,980
That's alright.

622
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,040
What arika!

623
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,220
I surely have my reasons.

624
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,640
If you've lost,

625
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,500
Mr. Su, you're too confident.

626
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,540
In the past,

627
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,700
I saw you often

628
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,780
get in touch with that princess.

629
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,620
You're so good to me today.

630
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,820
Aren't you afraid that the princess

631
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,380
will be jealous if you know it?

632
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,660
That princess

633
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,300
really loves me.

634
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,860
It seems that you're going to have a good thing today.

635
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,580
You're lucky

636
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,340
to marry such a beautiful princess.

637
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,740
I never care

638
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,900
whether a woman's appearance is beautiful or not.

639
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,940
I'm just friends with that princess.

640
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,220
I admire the one who

641
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,460
has a good sense of humor

642
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,660
and is not different from me.

643
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,460
I don't admire you.

644
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,180
Miss, please give me 11 to 13.

645
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,580
Yes.

646
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,500
Su, it's your turn.

647
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,740
Let me think about it.

648
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,540
What's there to think about?

649
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,100
It's so funny.

650
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,860
A gentleman should not be concerned about his own life.

651
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,980
I have my own thoughts.

652
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:24,940
Mr. Su,

653
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,820
you've been thinking about it for a long time.

654
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,060
What happened?

655
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,340
Why is there no one here?

656
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:31,980
Where is he?

657
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,180
Are you done?

658
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:34,900
I've thought about it.

659
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,780
13 to 15.

660
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:43,940
Mr. Su,

661
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,100
13 to 15 is here.

662
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,620
Mr. Su, you must be tired.

663
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,580
I thought you said that you could think about it

664
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,860
if you sit further away.

665
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,500
Yes, I'm tired.

666
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,100
Go and get me some hot water.

667
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,020
What's going on behind?

668
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,140
Don't come in.

669
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,300
Mr. Su, you want to find them, right?

670
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,820
Mr. Su,

671
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,700
I've been playing with you for so long.

672
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,980
I'm really tired.

673
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,380
Look carefully.

674
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,940
This talented man in Jiangnan

675
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,060
is actually a famous man.

676
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,220
He can win the chess game.

677
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,980
It's not his own talent,

678
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,220
but these helpers.

679
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:29,820
This...

680
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,540
Miss,

681
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:31,900
don't talk nonsense.

682
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:32,900
I want to...

683
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,020
I don't know them.

684
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,420
What's going on?

685
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:37,940
You want to ask

686
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,740
why they took your money

687
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,820
but didn't listen to you?

688
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,020
I'm sorry.

689
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:34,820
I'm sorry.

690
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,620
I'm sorry.

691
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,420
I'm sorry.

692
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,180
I'm sorry.

693
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,020
I'm sorry.

694
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,020
I'm sorry.

695
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,020
I'm sorry.

696
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,020
I'm sorry.

697
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,020
I'm sorry.

698
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,020
I'm sorry.

699
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,020
I'm sorry.

700
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,020
I'm sorry.

701
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,020
I'm sorry.

702
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,020
I'm sorry.

703
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,020
I'm sorry.

704
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,020
I'm sorry.

705
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,020
I'm sorry.

706
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,020
I'm sorry.

707
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,020
I'm sorry.

708
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,020
I'm sorry.

709
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,020
I'm sorry.

710
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,020
I'm sorry.

711
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,020
I'm sorry.

712
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,020
I'm sorry.

713
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,020
I'm sorry.

714
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,020
I'm sorry.

715
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,020
I'm sorry.

716
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,020
I'm sorry.

717
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,020
I'm sorry.

718
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,020
I'm sorry.

719
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,020
I'm sorry.

720
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,020
I'm sorry.

721
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,020
I'm sorry.

722
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,020
I'm sorry.

723
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,020
I'm sorry.

724
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,020
I'm sorry.

725
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,020
I'm sorry.

726
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,020
I'm sorry.

727
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,020
I'm sorry.

728
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,020
I'm sorry.

729
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,020
I'm sorry.

730
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,020
I'm sorry.

731
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,020
I'm sorry.

732
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,020
I'm sorry.

733
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,020
I'm sorry.

734
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,020
I'm sorry.

735
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,020
I'm sorry.

736
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,020
I'm sorry.

737
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,020
I'm sorry.

738
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,020
I'm sorry.

739
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,020
I'm sorry.

740
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,020
I'm sorry.

741
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,020
I'm sorry.

742
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,020
I'm sorry.

743
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,020
I'm sorry.

744
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,020
I'm sorry.

745
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,020
I'm sorry.

746
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,020
I'm sorry.

747
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,020
I'm sorry.

748
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,020
I'm sorry.

749
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,020
I'm sorry.

750
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,020
I'm sorry.

751
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,020
I'm sorry.

752
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,020
I'm sorry.

753
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,020
I'm sorry.

754
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,020
I'm sorry.

755
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,020
I'm sorry.

756
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,020
I'm sorry.

757
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,020
I'm sorry.

758
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,020
