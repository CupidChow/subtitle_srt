1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,360
(I'm Shen Jiangli.)

2
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09,510
(Ordered by the Prefect of Dongzhou,)

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,400
(I am to marry Master Lu Jingming.)

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,400
On this auspicious day,

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,280
a perfect match

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,800
ties the knot.

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,550
(We once spent carefree,)

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,670
(harmonious moments together,)

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,640
(but peace and happiness)

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,200
(are not the way of the inner chambers.)

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:41,940
Master Jingming,

12
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,430
the situation at the border is urgent.

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,440
The Prefect has ordered you to go
to the mansion

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,670
to discuss the war.

15
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,800
(Within three days, Master Jingming)

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,330
(gathered weapons and supplies
and rushed to the battlefield.)

17
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,920
(As he fought for his country,)

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,200
(with his life uncertain,)

19
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,690
(I was framed at home,)

20
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,420
(and my mother-in-law, Lady Shu,)

21
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,950
(imprisoned me in the ancestral tomb.)

22
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,320
Take her away.

23
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,200
Let go of me.

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,000
- I grew up with Lu Jingming.
- Let go of me!

25
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,760
Why did you marry him?

26
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,840
If I can't have Lu Jingming,

27
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,150
you won't have him either.

28
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,150
Lady Shu was poisoned,

29
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,560
and Qingqing was disfigured.

30
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,200
It was all my trap.

31
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,350
Wang Danling.

32
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,400
You're such a fool.

33
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,280
You deserve to stay here forever.

34
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,150
(No one here can tell right from wrong.)

35
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,040
(I was framed,)

36
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,350
(but no one cared.)

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,070

59
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,030
(The Prefect of Dongzhou is ill.)

60
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,410
(Because of his prolonged illness,)

61
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,520
(his eldest daughter-in-law,
Wang Danling,)

62
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,710
(arranged)

63
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,240
(a seven-day prayer ceremony for him.)

64
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,430
Face the east.

65
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,800
Heaven and humanity rely on this.

66
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,960
Ordinary beings and sages convert.

67
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,430
Whoever seeks to enter the fold

68
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,680
must first profess the faith.

69
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,150
Master Jingxiu
and the two ladies are back.

70
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,040
There are so many women.

71
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,480
I've never heard

72
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,390
of a prayer ceremony

73
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,800
that needs such a grand scale.

74
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,560
It's guided by someone capable,

75
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,270
so it's different from other methods.

76
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:33,940
I understand.

77
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,680
(Lady Wang Jinyi)
Others think Shen Jiangli

78
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,320
(Lu Jingxiu)
guards the ancestral tomb,

79
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,450
but they don't know
it's because she offended you.

80
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,350
(Wang Danling)
She can't stay by your side.

81
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,730
(Zhang Xiulan, Lady Shu)
So, no matter what Danling does,

82
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,140
you think it's wrong.

83
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,150
You...

84
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,240
Danling, take us to offer incense.

85
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,120
- Yes.
- These rituals are indeed eerie.

86
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,310
Mother, please.

87
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,360
Look at those talismans.

88
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,510
Don't you feel something strange?

89
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,720
What's going on?

90
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,600
- What's happening?
- How frightening.

91
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,600
A coffin.

92
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,630
Why is there a coffin?

93
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,360
I knew it was ominous.

94
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,920
Jingxiu, if this is really haunted,

95
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,160
you must take me with you.

96
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,270
You have strong yang energy.

97
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,290
Mother, don't be afraid.

98
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,070
Who is playing tricks here?

99
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:31,790
Come out!

100
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,380
(Lu Jingming, the Prefect's second son)

101
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:11,020
(Shen Jiangli, Lu Jingming's consort)

102
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,310
Shen Jiangli.

103
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,160
Why is she back?

104
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,880
Danling,

105
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,360
long time no see.

106
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,640
What's wrong?

107
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,120
You look like you've seen a ghost.

108
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,240
Shen Jiangli,

109
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,120
why are you back?

110
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,100
Weren't you confined
at the ancestral tomb for reflection?

111
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,130
I'm also the daughter-in-law
of the Prefect.

112
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,040
Now that the Prefect is seriously ill,

113
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,830
I also want to pray for the Prefect

114
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,270
at your prayer ceremony.

115
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,930
You've guarded the ancestral tomb
for five years

116
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,680
and have grown rebellious.

117
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,920
Is this your way of praying?

118
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,270
How can you put a coffin here?

119
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,560
Are you cursing the Prefect

120
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,560
and trying to rebel?

121
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,670
Come on.

122
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,270
Take her back.

123
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,720
Consort Danling, don't rush.

124
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,350
Why don't we

125
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,720
open the coffin first

126
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,880
and see

127
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,270
who lies inside?

128
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,120
What does it

129
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,240
have to do with me?

130
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,110
Wang Danling,

131
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,560
do you remember

132
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Gao?

133
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,540
(Yuzhu, Consort Danling's maid)

134
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,950
I don't even know her.

135
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,120
Then why are you nervous?

136
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,600
Are you afraid that Gao will turn

137
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,070
into a vengeful ghost after her death

138
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,430
and come to take your life?

139
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,510
There are no ghosts in the world.

140
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,160
Even if there were,

141
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,950
I wouldn't be afraid.

142
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,600
Don't talk so confidently.

143
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,680
What if there really are ghosts?

144
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,350
Stop scaring me.

145
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,800
(Lady Wang Jinyi, the Prefect's consort)
Jiangli,

146
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,830
your story is quite captivating,

147
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,070
but you can't disrupt

148
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,190
the prayer ceremony.

149
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,710
Xiulan,

150
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,560
your daughter-in-law

151
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,920
is playing tricks
at the Prefect's Mansion.

152
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,560
Don't blame me for being harsh.

153
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,720
I have to consider
our family's reputation.

154
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,300
Come on.

155
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,390
Hold on, Jinyi.

156
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,800
If Jiangli has done wrong,

157
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,470
(Zhang Xiulan, Lady Shu, concubine)
it'd be my duty to punish her.

158
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,120
Since she's back,

159
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,030
why not let her explain it?

160
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,360
Jiangli,

161
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,800
do you have evidence?

162
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,790
If you don't,

163
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,320
no one can protect you.

164
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,030
If you do,

165
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,430
show it immediately

166
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,150
and convince Lady Wang

167
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,350
and Danling.

168
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,200
What are you doing? Let go!

169
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,120
Wang Danling,

170
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,080
take a good look

171
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,710
at who is inside.

172
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,560
What's going on?

173
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,470
I'm only getting more confused.

174
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,120
Lady Shu,

175
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,280
a few days ago,

176
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,520
Consort Danling almost killed me.

177
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,160
It was Consort Jiangli who saved me.

178
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:25,920
At that time,

179
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,630
we had already knelt for five days

180
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,990
without food.

181
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,350
I was so hungry and thirsty

182
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,990
that I nearly fainted.

183
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,630
I had no choice

184
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,160
but to secretly eat.

185
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,720
Even if I was wrong,

186
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,230
I shouldn't die for it.

187
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,800
How outrageous!

188
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,800
Drag her up here!

189
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,580
Are you trying to make trouble
with Consort Danling?

190
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,270
Knowing how important
this ceremony is to her,

191
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,830
how dare you eat food?

192
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,440
If you disrupt this ceremony,

193
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,930
you'll have to pay with your life.

194
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,820
My Lady, please spare me!

195
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,830
So noisy.

196
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,870
You're deliberately disturbing me.

197
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,560
Hurry up and drag her away!

198
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,000
Come on.

199
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,160
Drag her away!

200
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,740
(Yulan, disciple at Wind Pavilion)

201
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,440
Let go of me!

202
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,870
You haven't eaten anything, right?

203
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,550
Now, I'll let you eat your fill.

204
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,470
Stuff it in!

205
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,990
I don't want it! No!

206
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,470
Eat!

207
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,880
Eat it!

208
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,320
If anyone leaks

209
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,470
a word of today's events,

210
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,810
they will never be spared.

211
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,320
If anyone dares to disrupt
this ceremony,

212
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,350
this will be their fate.

213
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,040
Aim your hatred at the right person.

214
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,900
We are just following
Consort Danling's orders.

215
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,760
What's that sound?

216
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,550
Run!

217
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,950
Wang Danling's cruelty

218
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,680
has not diminished.

219
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,440
Thanks to your foresight,

220
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,600
I was able to return first
to gather information,

221
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,160
so we could uncover their evil deeds.

222
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,200
She was suffocated

223
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,400
not because of the beating

224
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,780
but from choking on food.

225
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,870
I could only try to use

226
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,790
the method of qi

227
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,710
to clear her throat.

228
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,040
Whether it works or not

229
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,560
depends on her luck.

230
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,990
You brought this woman here,

231
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,870
fabricated such a tricky story,

232
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,280
and tried to slander me
without evidence.

233
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,400
Do you really think
everyone here is a fool?

234
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,670
Come on.

235
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,710
Drag Gao away for interrogation.

236
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,950
Today,

237
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,870
since both ladies

238
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,920
and Jingxiu are here,

239
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,830
now is the time for interrogation.

240
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,870
What do you say, Jingxiu?

241
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,160
Jingming,

242
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,600
have you forgotten what Jiangli did

243
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,040
to Lady Shu and Qingqing?

244
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,200
Shen Jiangli,

245
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,200
who would believe your nonsense?

246
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,750
After you married Master Jingming,

247
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,230
you were so despicable

248
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,000
as to plot against Lady Shu
and Qingqing.

249
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,550
Lady Shu was kind so she only
sent you to the ancestral tomb.

250
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,280
When did you learn medicine?

251
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,920
How do you know if I know medicine?

252
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,160
Are you blind?

253
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,360
Gao is standing right in front of you.

254
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,320
Can't you see her?

255
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,440
How could you possibly revive the dead?

256
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,360
That day, I...

257
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,280
Yuzhu.

258
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,710
Miss Yuzhu, thanks for helping me prove

259
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,280
that you once saw Gao die.

260
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,680
I saved her. That's the real story.

261
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,200
I came here today

262
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,160
to expose Danling.

263
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,440
In the name of the Prefect's prayer,

264
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,620
she gathered a group of women

265
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,470
to form a yang-collecting formation

266
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,110
to pray for a son.

267
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,440
Danling made a big show

268
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,470
of praying for many days,

269
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,750
but the Prefect's condition
didn't improve.

270
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,560
So, there was another reason.

271
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,110
You stayed at the ancestral tomb
for five years.

272
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,440
What do you know
about prayer ceremonies?

273
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,910
I'd like to ask you this.

274
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,560
What kind of prayer ceremony

275
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,030
requires 27 women

276
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,630
who have had sons

277
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,320
to kneel for seven days?

278
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,790
What do you know?

279
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:56,600
This is the advice

280
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,920
of someone capable.

281
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,960
It's to pray for the Prefect's

282
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,040
longevity.

283
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,350
Longevity?

284
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,150
You mean to give birth to a grandson

285
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,880
so Master Jingxiu
can inherit his position?

286
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,560
Someone must've instigated you
and told you

287
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,040
such a sinister method
of asking for a son.

288
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,990
You were so bewitched

289
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,660
that you performed this ritual
in the name of the Prefect.

290
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,560
Are you praying for the Prefect,

291
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,320
or are you trying to take away his luck?

292
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,190
You...

293
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,710
Shut up!

294
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,950
I haven't finished.

295
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,320
Why are you in such a hurry?

296
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,630
Everything needs evidence.

297
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,280
If I really did as you said,

298
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,560
the women here can testify.

299
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,040
You want evidence?

300
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,000
Lady Shu,

301
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,120
please send servants to search

302
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,270
the four corners

303
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,280
of this yard.

304
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,310
You'll surely find the ritual tools.

305
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,400
Come on.

306
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,710
Dig it up.

307
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,920
- Yes.
- Yes.

308
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,440
Now, what do you want to say?

309
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,680
This is exactly

310
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,470
what Shen Jiangli buried to frame me.

311
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,430
You chose the seven days of the year

312
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,160
when the yang energy is the most intense

313
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,000
and selected the extreme yang spot
with the best feng shui.

314
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,360
Then you brought these 27 women

315
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,230
who have given birth
to sit in the formation.

316
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,870
This is a folk son-conception ritual,

317
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,470
called the yang-collecting formation.

318
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,440
I'm right, aren't I, Danling?

319
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,350
I didn't know at all.

320
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I really didn't know

321
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,530
what the yang-collecting formation was.

322
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,470
You don't know?

323
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,470
We just need to go to the altar
in your room

324
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,080
and look at the statues you've offered.

325
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,790
Other than the Jade Buddha,

326
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,750
there's also the Giver of Children.

327
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,760
Mom.

328
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,470
Jinyi, let's go.

329
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,990
We'll find out the truth.

330
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,270
Come on, let's take a look.

331
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,230
Why are you pulling me?

332
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,480
Jinyi,

333
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,440
your daughter-in-law
is really something.

334
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,480
No wonder she's a general's daughter.

335
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,470
She's so desperate
to help Master Jingxiu.

336
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,830
If it weren't for my daughter-in-law,

337
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,400
we wouldn't have discovered
her wolfish ambitions.

338
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,160
Wang Danling.

339
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,280
Jinyi, wait for me.

340
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,000
Wang Danling.

341
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,120
You...

342
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,520
Mother.

343
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:04,990
Danling,

344
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,430
what's going on?

345
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,560
I...

346
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,030
My Lady,

347
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:13,960
Young Master,

348
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,010
this matter

349
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,550
has nothing to do with Consort Danling.

350
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,560
I took the liberty to do this.

351
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,960
Nanny...

352
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,850
I've served

353
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,720
Consort Danling for many years.

354
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,760
I've seen her work hard
for the household every day,

355
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,030
keeping everything in order.

356
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,720
But she has no son.

357
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,190
I've been tending her
since she was young.

358
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,150
I've always been fond of her,

359
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,190
so I thought of this old method.

360
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,280
I lied to Consort Danling,

361
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,520
saying it was for the Prefect.

362
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,110
This has nothing to do with her.

363
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,360
Really.

364
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,960
Why didn't you say so earlier?

365
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,170
Seems like you just
thought up this excuse.

366
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,830
You were confined

367
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,480
for five years at the ancestral tomb.

368
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,870
Who are you

369
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,480
to criticize Consort Danling?

370
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,720
I can only

371
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,080
die

372
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,870
to prove

373
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,960
Consort Danling's innocence.

374
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,920
Consort Danling,

375
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,270
take care.

376
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
No!

377
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,400
Nanny!

378
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,510
Nanny!

379
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,990
Mom!

380
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,670
Mom!

381
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,360
Mom!

382
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,030
Mom!

383
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,750
Mom!

384
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,600
Mom!

385
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,190
Now,

386
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,720
the culprit has died,

387
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,520
but Danling,

388
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,650
you didn't manage the servants properly.

389
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,830
Stay in the mansion and copy scriptures

390
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,720
to reflect on your mistakes.

391
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,400
Yes.

392
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,190
Everyone,

393
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,440
if a word of today's events gets out,

394
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,800
there will be severe punishment.

395
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,190
You may leave.

396
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,710
- Yes.
- Yes.

397
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,670
Let's go back.

398
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,640
Danling,

399
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,310
your hairpin is crooked.

400
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,870
Today, Shen Jiangli's exposure

401
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,080
has wiped out that family's arrogance.

402
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,480
But why did she suddenly return?

403
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,580
I'm Shen Jiangli, your daughter-in-law.

404
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,630
Greetings, Mother.

405
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,920
Since you exposed Danling's

406
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,390
secret quest for a son,

407
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,660
I will forgive you for leaving
the ancestral tomb without permission.

408
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,100
But don't think that this

409
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,620
can make up for the wrongdoings

410
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,700
you committed

411
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,720
against Qingqing and me.

412
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,300
I know.

413
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,340
Jingming,

414
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,060
she can't stay in the city any more

415
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,940
after what she once did.

416
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,780
Send her back tomorrow.

417
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,820
No.

418
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,260
Go prepare the horses now.

419
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,460
Mother,

420
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,540
it was I who brought Jiangli back.

421
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:53,980
What?

422
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,100
It's been five years.

423
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,740
No matter what,

424
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,260
everything must come to an end.

425
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,980
Our mansion

426
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,780
cannot be without a mistress.

427
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,660
Fine.

428
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,420
You can stay for tonight.

429
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,180
But if there's any more trouble,

430
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,140
you must return to the ancestral tomb

431
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,620
and never come back.

432
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,620
What a bold move.

433
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,180
You're just back

434
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,860
and already stirring up chaos.

435
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,180
If I don't muddy the waters,

436
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,540
how can I catch fish?

437
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,820
Master Jingming,

438
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,660
do you like this gift

439
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,580
I prepared for you?

440
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,460
When did you learn medicine?

441
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,100
Why didn't I know about it?

442
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,840
I can only say

443
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,660
you judge me

444
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,700
based on what others say.

445
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,620
Or perhaps,

446
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,990
you never gave me a chance to know you.

447
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,900
Between you and I,

448
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,260
when did we ever have a chance?

449
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,940
When you returned from the battlefield,

450
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,430
you didn't intervene and let your mother

451
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,820
throw me into the ancestral tomb.

452
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,420
Did you ever seek the truth?

453
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,100
Perhaps, to you,

454
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,340
I'm not important at all.

455
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,420
When I returned home

456
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,320
from the battlefield in Xizhou,

457
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,500
Mother had the evidence,
but you refused to argue.

458
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,260
If you wanted my help,

459
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,740
you could've asked for it.

460
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,100
No need to mention the past.

461
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,980
There's no need for us
to revisit old matters.

462
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,160
I have my reasons
for returning this time.

463
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,620
If you want to negotiate with me,

464
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,900
come to the Rain Chamber to find me.

465
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:52,180
(Half a day ago)

466
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,200
Master Jingming,

467
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,340
it's been five years.

468
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,220
How have you been?

469
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,940
It's you.

470
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,980
I know your brother

471
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:09,460
is the most popular candidate
for the next Prefect now.

472
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,460
You don't want your brother

473
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,120
to become the next Prefect.

474
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,520
Having stayed in the ancestral tomb,

475
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,740
how do you know so much

476
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,740
about what's happening in the court?

477
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,380
You don't need to know

478
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,740
how I know that.

479
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,700
You just need to be sure

480
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,580
that I can help you.

481
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,500
Why should you help me?

482
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,420
Do you still remember

483
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,060
the old affection from five years ago?

484
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,140
Master Jingming, you're joking.

485
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,340
There's no affection

486
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,500
between us anymore.

487
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,580
It's only a deal.

488
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,220
What do you need me to do?

489
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,340
I want the Lei Pill.

490
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,220
Do you know what the Lei Pill is?

491
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,620
It was a gift from the former chief

492
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,780
of Wind Pavilion to the late Prefect.

493
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,780
There is only one in the world.

494
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,380
That's why I want this one.

495
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,380
Since you want the Lei Pill,

496
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,380
who do you want to save?

497
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,900
You don't need to know.

498
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,740
It's just a deal.

499
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,380
Both of us can get what we need.

500
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,460
A deal?

501
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,660
You still have a criminal record.

502
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,660
What can you do to help me?

503
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,100
Today is the last day

504
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,060
of Wang Danling's seven-day prayer.

505
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:28,820
Just wait and see.

506
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,100
I'll give you a gift for our meeting.

507
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:41,020
(Rain Chamber)

508
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,080
Jiangli,

509
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,900
it's been a long time
since anyone lived here.

510
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,620
According to the Dongzhou customs,
we need to scatter glutinous rice

511
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,730
when moving into a new house

512
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,520
to dispel bad luck.

513
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,860
You spent so long setting things up,

514
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,260
and I've worked hard

515
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,900
for many days as a servant.

516
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,860
I thought this time we'd finally

517
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,100
beat Wang Danling,

518
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,620
but unexpectedly,

519
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,740
we only took down a nanny.

520
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,460
No matter what,

521
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,660
we still saved an innocent woman.

522
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,220
The nanny who took the blame
for Wang Danling

523
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,020
was her wet nurse.

524
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:17,660
Without her,

525
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:20,780
Wang Danling would be
like a tiger without teeth.

526
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,190
Are you planning to stay here?

527
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,380
I have to stay here

528
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,300
to get

529
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,140
what I need.

530
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,260
Alright.

531
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,780
I'll go

532
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,940
wherever you go.
