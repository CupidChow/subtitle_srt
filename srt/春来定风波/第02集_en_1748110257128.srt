00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,640
My Girlfriend is an Alien

2
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,640
Episode 16

3
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,440
Young Master.

4
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,600
I've checked Dong Momo who guarded the ancestral tomb.

5
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,600
I found that she was a playboy.

6
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,680
She didn't know about the Consort's condition.

7
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,440
She didn't know that she came back.

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,560
Young Master.

9
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,720
I think that Consort Shao

10
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,760
seems to be different from before.

11
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,800
She used the life of the First Consort

12
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,240
to win the life of Lady Shu.

13
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,080
She even came back to life

14
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,240
to cure and save people.

15
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,400
I wonder how Consort Shao

16
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,200
learned this skill.

17
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,040
Find clues and continue to investigate.

18
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,360
Besides,

19
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,600
keep an eye on Yu Xuan.

20
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,000
When the dead goes in the holy tomb,

21
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:52,120
go in and check in and check if I have

22
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,080
이를 found any clues

23
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,840
before the dead sauce travellers come in.

24
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,400
And try to make sure

25
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,400
I won't let him go this time.

26
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,680
Don't worry. I promise.

27
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,200
Thank you, Consort.

28
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,440
Yuzhu,

29
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,600
you've suffered a lot.

30
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,200
You've been with me for so many years.

31
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,200
Don't worry.

32
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,160
I won't treat you badly.

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,760
I'll find you a good family in the future.

34
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,400
No, Consort.

35
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,920
I won't.

36
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,280
No, Consort.

37
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,720
I don't want to get married.

38
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,480
My mother is gone.

39
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,440
I only have you as my family.

40
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,640
Don't drive me away.

41
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,600
I just want to follow you forever

42
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,040
and serve you.

43
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,760
Fine.

44
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,760
Shen Jiangli,

45
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,560
I'm not like you in the Eastern State.

46
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,520
I'm not like you in the Eastern State.

47
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,720
I'm not like you in the Eastern State.

48
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,920
I'm not like you in the Eastern State.

49
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,120
I'm not like you in the Eastern State.

50
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,520
I'm not like you in the Eastern State.

51
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,720
I'm not like you in the Eastern State.

52
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,920
I'm not like you in the Eastern State.

53
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,120
I'm not like you in the Eastern State.

54
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,320
I'm not like you in the Eastern State.

55
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,520
I'm not like you in the Eastern State.

56
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,720
I'm not like you in the Eastern State.

57
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,920
I'm not like you in the Eastern State.

58
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,120
I'm not like you in the Eastern State.

59
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,320
I'm not like you in the Eastern State.

60
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,520
I'm not like you in the Eastern State.

61
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,720
I'm not like you in the Eastern State.

62
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,920
I'm not like you in the Eastern State.

63
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,120
I'm not like you in the Eastern State.

64
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,520
You...

65
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,920
Young Master.

66
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,720
‏Bring her alive. ‏Yes.

67
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,720
You are hurt.

68
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,120
This afforded injury is nothing.

69
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,120
Let me help you.

70
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,720
No need.

71
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,440
Come on.

72
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,440
Tell me. Who told you to come?

73
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,840
A doctor's heart is a person's heart.

74
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,560
I helped you to wrap it up

75
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,000
because you saved me just now.

76
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,280
Thanks.

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,760
Young Master.

78
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,720
Besides the wound on your body,

79
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,800
do you feel uncomfortable?

80
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,280
No.

81
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:26,960
No.

82
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,520
What are you doing?

83
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,680
Have you been having

84
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,800
a hard time recently?

85
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,200
And it hurts and itch at night.

86
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:35,960
It's very uncomfortable.

87
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,560
You have a fever.

88
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,000
A fever?

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,600
Didn't the doctor say...

90
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:44,920
Say what?

91
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,480
Nothing.

92
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,720
Did you get a fever

93
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,680
because of the miscarriage?

94
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,560
Shen Jiangli.

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,640
No wonder you pretended to be a good person

96
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,040
and didn't fight for the position of the master.

97
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,120
It turns out that you are in a critical condition

98
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,960
and it's hard to protect yourself.

99
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,480
If your brother knows this...

100
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,240
I'm warning you.

101
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,600
Mind your own business.

102
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,040
I'm also warning you.

103
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,560
If you get angry again,

104
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,400
it will be of no use to your wound.

105
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,320
Young Master.

106
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,640
Come back.

107
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:14,800
Where is he?

108
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,520
I'm sorry.

109
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,600
The thief was killed by the poison.

110
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,080
You two, wait for me outside.

111
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,240
Yes.

112
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,120
If you dare to reveal

113
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,240
the truth about the illness,

114
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,480
I won't let you go.

115
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,600
How is it going?

116
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:49,760
It...

117
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,640
It failed.

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,240
It was supposed to be a success.

119
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,520
But Young Master Weiwu suddenly appeared.

120
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,120
Did he leave any clues?

121
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,040
No.

122
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,800
He sent the dead.

123
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,560
He committed suicide after failing.

124
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,600
Useless.

125
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,800
Please calm down, Your Highness.

126
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,760
Lady Shu has ordered

127
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,040
to take him back to the ancestral tomb

128
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,720
if he makes any more mistakes.

129
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,880
We failed this time.

130
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,440
It's not a good idea to take him back.

131
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,320
What do you know?

132
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,440
He's been trying to get me out of the ancestral tomb.

133
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,080
He must have been planning to kill me.

134
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,640
He's not

135
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,520
as easy to deal with as he used to be.

136
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,520
If he comes back this time,

137
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,800
if he reveals the truth about the illness,

138
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,480
I can't.

139
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,920
I have to think of a way.

140
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,280
Young Master.

141
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,320
Lady Shu is on her way.

142
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,720
Do you know what she said?

143
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,440
She's just a small wound.

144
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,280
She's very thin.

145
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,400
We're on the scene.

146
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:53,880
What?

147
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,240
You're hiding something from me?

148
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,120
You're all fat, aren't you?

149
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,040
Son.

150
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,360
How's your wound?

151
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,400
Where did you get hurt?

152
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,960
Mother, don't worry.

153
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,560
It's just a scratch.

154
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,400
It's fine now.

155
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:12,960
Son.

156
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,840
You're in such a big trouble.

157
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,280
Why didn't you send someone to inform us?

158
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,000
If anything bad happens to you,

159
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,920
how am I supposed to live?

160
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:22,960
Mother.

161
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,200
Don't exaggerate.

162
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,760
It's just a scratch.

163
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,400
What do you mean?

164
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,920
You're all hurt.

165
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,640
You...

166
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,120
How did you take care of yourself?

167
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,320
Lady.

168
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,240
I deserve to die.

169
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,360
I heard from Li Er that

170
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,920
you got hurt to protect Shen Jiangli.

171
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,440
Is this true?

172
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,440
Mother.

173
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,440
I...

174
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,160
Enough.

175
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,240
I know it's true.

176
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,520
Shen Jiangli.

177
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,760
You're a jinx.

178
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,520
You're so mean

179
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,600
when you come back.

180
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,760
Son.

181
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,560
You're too soft on him.

182
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,960
Mother.

183
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,200
Five years ago,

184
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,920
you said Jiangli poisoned you.

185
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,840
How could I frame him

186
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,880
with my own life?

187
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,840
Speaking of which,

188
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,200
if it weren't for Ling Er,

189
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,240
how would I know

190
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,200
Shen Jiangli sent me flowers every day?

191
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
It's so poisonous.

192
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,360
You mean

193
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,480
Wang Danling was the one who reminded you of this?

194
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,240
Yes.

195
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,040
Son.

196
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,840
Take care of yourself.

197
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,760
I won't bother you.

198
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,280
Don't worry, Mother.

199
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,120
Let's go, Dongmei.

200
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:38,880
Yunjiao.

201
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,640
Follow me.

202
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,480
Yes.

203
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,360
Is there a secret between us?

204
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,280
Yes.

205
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,240
Your Highness.

206
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,360
Since Madam Shu is so surprised by you,

207
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,360
why don't you just listen to her?

208
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,440
If you regret it,

209
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,920
Madam Shu will send someone to take you back.

210
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,080
What's there to regret?

211
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,520
I don't want to go back to the place where I was wrong.

212
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,760
Lu Qingqing wanted to go out by herself.

213
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,800
It's none of my business if she's ruined.

214
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,840
And Madam Shu.

215
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,960
I was so kind to send her flowers.

216
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,040
She was allergic to pollen

217
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,640
and she slandered me for poisoning.

218
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,000
What kind of family are they?

219
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,720
The Princess is evil.

220
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
Madam Shu is vicious.

221
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,400
They deserve to be unlucky

222
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,560
and poisoned.

223
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,560
Greetings, Madam Shu.

224
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,600
Kneel.

225
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,440
What's wrong?

226
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,080
Madam Shu.

227
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,200
I don't know what I did wrong.

228
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,280
Why do I have to kneel?

229
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,200
You don't know what you did wrong?

230
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,240
That day,

231
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,920
I kept you in the mansion

232
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,520
because of Madam's arrogant words.

233
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,960
I also told you

234
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,560
if you cause more trouble,

235
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,080
I will send you back.

236
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,920
It's only been a few days.

237
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,200
You let my son get hurt

238
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,520
and didn't have the etiquette

239
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,920
to get married and get married.

240
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,840
You have no duty as a wife and father.

241
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,920
You're not wrong.

242
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,840
How dare you laugh?

243
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,320
Madam Shu.

244
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,640
The second young master got hurt.

245
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,440
I didn't send him to do that.

246
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
I'm not guilty.

247
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,520
Besides,

248
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,040
you put me in the ancestral tomb

249
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,800
and announced that I'm no longer the second young consort.

250
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,760
You don't recognize me as your daughter-in-law.

251
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,640
How can I

252
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,360
show you the etiquette of a mother-in-law?

253
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,680
I'm not saying that you used to be self-reliant.

254
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,440
In these five years,

255
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,240
you didn't give birth to a daughter for our Lu family.

256
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,600
With this,

257
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,120
I can punish you.

258
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,120
Madam Shu,

259
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,520
you're joking again.

260
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,160
I'm in the ancestral tomb.

261
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,440
I can't even leave the door.

262
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,680
How can I give birth to a child?

263
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,600
By myself?

264
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,400
You dare to use the fifth younger brother as an elder?

265
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,320
Dou Mei,

266
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,840
teach her the etiquette for me.

267
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,600
Yes.

268
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,320
You're against it.

269
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,000
Someone,

270
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,840
hold her.

271
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,520
Mother.

272
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:12,920
What?

273
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,840
I can't even teach her?

274
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,200
You're right.

275
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,080
Shen Jiangli doesn't know the rules.

276
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,200
She's a criminal.

277
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,800
But I'm worried that

278
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,000
because of her,

279
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,280
I've hurt my body.

280
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,240
Yun Jiu.

281
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:24,760
Yes.

282
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,560
Send Madam Shu back to the mansion.

283
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,120
Yes.

284
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,640
Leave this to me.

285
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,240
You...

286
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,360
Madam, calm down.

287
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,200
Young Master is still worried about you.

288
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,840
Let's go back first.

289
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,000
I'll ask the kitchen to prepare some silver earl for you.

290
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,680
Mother came to listen to Yuxuan today.

291
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,440
I apologize on her behalf.

292
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,520
There are some ice cubes and medicine here.

293
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,840
You can handle them yourself.

294
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,880
No need.

295
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,840
Don't move.

296
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,680
Did you find out

297
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,320
who sent you

298
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,840
to kill the thief last night?

299
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,960
It's hard to tell who sent me.

300
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,360
But I think it's me.

301
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,360
Don't worry too much.

302
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,840
You're right.

303
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,480
Master Zhou has been ill for a long time.

304
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,480
But he hasn't released him yet.

305
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,560
Young Master is the heir.

306
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,240
It shows that he has other thoughts.

307
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,840
Young Master is still young.

308
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
You're now

309
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,160
the biggest threat

310
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,480
to them.

311
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,880
Young Master,

312
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,240
you're in danger now.

313
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,560
What do you think?

314
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
If I were you,

315
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,840
I would find a capable assistant

316
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,680
in this situation.

317
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,120
For example,

318
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,200
someone like me.

319
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,000
Go on.

320
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,400
I can cure your illness.

321
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,600
I dare to say

322
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,720
that the hidden disease on you

323
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,160
can't be cured by anyone else in the city.

324
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,880
When your illness is cured,

325
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,880
you can do what you want

326
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,160
without any worries.

327
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,240
Go on.

328
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,760
Help me get the thunderball.

329
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,800
I'll try to get close to Master Zhou.

330
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,920
After I cure Master Zhou's illness,

331
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,440
you can take the position of Young Master.

332
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,880
Let's talk about your deal.

333
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,040
I want to know

334
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,920
why you're so generous.

335
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,280
I want the thunderball.

336
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,480
As for what I'm going to use,

337
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,160
you don't need to ask.

338
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,000
Young Master,

339
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,760
you're not in a bad position.

340
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,680
He's been in danger for the past few days.

341
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,280
The fight in the house

342
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,640
is more complicated than I thought.

343
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,040
Perhaps I was too calm

344
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,840
and crafty at first.

345
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,600
Don't get too high.

346
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,720
That was none of your business.

347
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:13,520
Shut it!

348
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,660
I am good if you don't mind what I am saying.

349
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:33,240
Maybe I will have more

350
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,720
It's much more relaxed than the House of Zhou.

351
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,720
Really?

352
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,720
Young Master, you are busy with your business.

353
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,720
I won't keep you.

354
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,720
Please.

355
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,720
Young Master, I'll send you here.

356
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,720
I'm sorry.

357
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,720
It's useless to care about me.

358
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,720
You don't have to think I have any difficulties.

359
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,720
You should know that our relationship

360
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,720
is mutual.

361
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,720
It's not mutual.

362
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,720
I got the Leiwen,

363
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,720
you got the position of Young Master.

364
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,720
Let's go where we want.

365
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,300
I hope you can come back without any

366
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,720
wind or rain.

367
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,720
I'm in my heart silently.

368
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,720
We knew each other

369
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,720
because of our parents' words.

370
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,720
We thought we would spend our lives together.

371
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,720
The past is not to be chased.

372
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,720
Can we wait until we are together?

373
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,720
The moon shines on the lake.

374
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,720
Where are you?

375
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,720
I'm here but I have no news.

376
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,720
The night leaves me.

377
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,720
I keep my thoughts.

378
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,720
I'm alone.

379
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,720
I only want to meet you once in my life.

380
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,720
Time flies.

381
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,720
It's all wrong.

382
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,720
I'm alone.

383
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,720
Time flies.

384
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,720
It's all wrong.

385
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,720
I can't keep you in my heart.

386
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,720
One by one.

387
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,720
The moonlight gradually covers the sky.

388
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,720
There is only a small distance between us.

389
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,720
Will you remember the thousand of words?

390
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,720
I'm here.

391
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,720
Young Master.

392
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,720
Young Mistress and Young Consort

393
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,720
are here to visit you.

394
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,720
They are in the main hall.

395
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,720
Younger sister is here.

396
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,720
Young Mistress.

397
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,720
Young Consort.

398
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,720
Young Mistress, you are so free.

399
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,720
You have time to visit our mansion.

400
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,720
Young Mistress asked you to copy the scriptures.

401
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,720
Why?

402
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,720
Have you finished copying the scriptures?

403
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,720
Don't worry about me.

404
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,720
I'm different from you.

405
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,720
I need to manage

406
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,720
all the affairs in Young Master's Mansion.

407
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,720
I really admire you.

408
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,720
You are so kind to me

409
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,720
in the Second Young Master's Mansion.

410
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,720
Thank you.

411
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,720
I'm very grateful.

412
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,480
how much you care about him.

413
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,200
It's all my husband's fault.

414
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,400
He cares about me too much.

415
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,960
He doesn't let me

416
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,080
do anything.

417
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,080
My husband said

418
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,760
that women are used to love

419
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,400
and not to do anything.

420
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,120
He can spend

421
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,280
only ten or eight housekeepers

422
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,720
to do anything.

423
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,200
It's not like

424
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,800
he can't afford it.

425
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,240
I heard that

426
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,840
a thief was arrested last night.

427
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,160
Is there anything wrong?

428
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:30,800
Nothing.

429
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,000
Brother, don't worry about it.

430
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,560
I didn't expect

431
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,160
that the second sister

432
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,280
would not leave this time.

433
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,160
Does Mrs. Shu agree?

434
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,360
Sister,

435
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,720
we have to deal with

436
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,840
the relationship between the two families.

437
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,280
Now the rumor is spreading outside.

438
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,480
We can't ruin

439
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,080
the reputation of the second young master's mansion.

440
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,360
Brother,

441
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,040
people outside are talking.

442
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,080
We are friends.

443
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,200
We should cooperate.

444
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,680
If you care about

445
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,720
our family affairs,

446
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,920
just come to me directly.

447
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,040
OK.

448
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,480
I'm being too talkative.

449
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,240
But for the reputation of the Lu family,

450
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,880
I have to say something.

451
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,560
What do you think, sister?

452
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,720
Brother, you are wrong.

453
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,920
Whether it's the Zhou family

454
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,520
or the common people,

455
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,600
there will be

456
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,880
some conflict between the mother-in-law and the son-in-law.

457
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,360
Who has the time

458
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,440
to hear the gossip

459
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,120
between the mother-in-law and the son-in-law?

460
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,320
OK.

461
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,720
Since the second brother and the second sister

462
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,640
are so close,

463
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,960
I can rest assured.

464
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,520
Brother,

465
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,000
I found a treasure today

466
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,400
and brought it here

467
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,640
to have a taste with you.

468
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,840
I'm also curious

469
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,800
what kind of treasure

470
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,120
can be in your eyes.

471
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,160
Please.

472
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,040
Go.

473
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,760
Let me ask 완전er Acting Chief of겠대� Schwebel

474
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,880
for your opinion on our向��.

475
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,640
Brother.

476
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,240
I specially invited Kunlun hashire

477
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,200
to build Engineer Xuan Tie's奶 sighs.

478
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,120
As they say,

479
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,280
nor would I lay my hands on my prey when a lot of shots are hit by the arrow.

480
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,560
If you have a little time,

481
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,240
please help me

482
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,200
see

483
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,080
whether he is wise with his words

484
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,160
Brother, you know that

485
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,120
I've been interested in painting myself.

486
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,800
I have to rely on you to see the result.

487
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,760
Erli, you're joking.

488
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,440
The battle between you and Xizhong

489
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,840
was a defeat,

490
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,040
but you fought bravely.

491
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,560
Everyone around you knows that.

492
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,520
I haven't met him for years.

493
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,080
I won't show my hatred to you.

494
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,880
I know you've been waiting for it for a long time.

495
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,000
So you don't feel inferior about thisMPчто that I've done?

496
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,680
Brother,

497
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,960
Jiang Li hasn't seen the world for five years.

498
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,440
Can you show him?

499
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,720
What's your identity?

500
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,520
Second Brother.

501
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,160
Let me see.

502
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,240
Are you all right?

503
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,000
Brother, I'm fine.

504
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,440
But

505
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,040
it's really hard to see.

506
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,560
Liu Er'er is too curious.

507
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,440
I'll teach her at home.

508
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,680
She should touch

509
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,960
and shouldn't touch anything.

510
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,920
She shouldn't touch anything.

511
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,840
Brother, Sister-in-law.

512
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,280
Please have some tea inside.

513
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,400
It's good that you're fine.

514
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,520
Second Brother,

515
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,280
how's your injury?

516
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,000
Don't worry about it.

517
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,320
The doctor came to see me.

518
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,840
It's fine now.

519
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,600
I'm relieved.

520
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,840
Sister-in-law,

521
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,280
you should care about your husband more.

522
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,680
In recent years,

523
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,840
Second Young Master has been obsessed with poetry and singing.

524
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,760
He was even criticized by the master.

525
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,240
You must not let him down.

526
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,480
I'm really worried about you.

527
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,080
How can I help you?

528
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,000
Thank you for your reminder.

529
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,760
I'm curious about one thing.

530
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,560
Why do you

531
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,200
care so much about

532
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,640
Jingming's future?

533
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,120
Sister-in-law,

534
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,320
why are you so against it?

535
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,520
I'm against it.

536
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,840
Danlin said it

537
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,760
to remind you

538
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,760
what is your duty.

539
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,080
He's good-hearted.

540
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,200
He heard that Madam Shu hit you,

541
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,120
so he came to visit you.

542
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,520
It seems that

543
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,720
my sister-in-law and I

544
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,920
haven't lost touch in the past five years.

545
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,800
She's as good to me as she was to me five years ago.

546
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,880
Shen Jiangli, you...

547
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,880
I don't care about the qi and feng.

548
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,600
You're so kind to visit me.

549
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,040
But you're so aggressive.

550
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,160
Jiahe Wan Shi Xing.

551
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,000
Sister-in-law,

552
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,080
you should keep

553
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,640
your memory in mind.

554
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,920
Brother, don't be angry.

555
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,240
I just want to talk to sister-in-law.

556
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,640
After all, we have a lot of past events.

557
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,040
You're so funny.

558
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,120
What past events do I have with you?

559
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,560
Sister-in-law's memory is really bad.

560
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,000
How about I help you

561
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,640
to remember

562
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,120
what happened five years ago?

563
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,960
I remember five years ago...

564
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,040
Shut up!

565
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,080
Ling Er, sit down.

566
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,440
Brother,

567
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,360
sister-in-law is really

568
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,840
talking too much.

569
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,720
You should talk to her

570
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,440
about the rules of the mansion.

571
00:25:59,080 --> 00:25:59,920
Brother is right.

572
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,840
Ling Er, don't be so impudent.

573
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,200
It seems that sister-in-law

574
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,680
is in a bad mood today.

575
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,360
Then we won't bother her anymore.

576
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,480
Let's go back, husband.

577
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,680
Let's go.

578
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,720
Let's go.

579
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,600
I'll get some more medicine for you.

580
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,240
I'll go.

581
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,880
Husband,

582
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,520
Shen Jiangli

583
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,360
is getting bolder and bolder.

584
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,880
Look at his arrogant face today.

585
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,400
Madam,

586
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,560
why are you arguing with him?

587
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,720
He's not as good as you.

588
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,800
He's got a lot of ways to punish him.

589
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,960
You're right.

590
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,920
My father is a general.

591
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,240
By the way,

592
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,120
I have a question.

593
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,920
What's so special about that sword?

594
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,480
Why is it so similar to Lu Jingming's?

595
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Five years ago,

596
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,600
he defeated the enemy

597
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,600
and fell into the trap of the enemy.

598
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,960
His army was destroyed.

599
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,040
The sword he saw today

600
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,560
was the one

601
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,800
that he used to lead the army.

602
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,880
No wonder.

603
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,200
Now, you're a great warrior

604
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,720
and the eldest son of the enemy.

605
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,600
You'll be the future master.

606
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,160
You don't have to take it to heart.

607
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,800
What's wrong?

608
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,680
It's a pity

609
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,080
that I'm not in good health.

610
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,120
I can't give you

611
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,320
a single daughter-in-law.

612
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,280
Ling.

613
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:08,920
Ling,

614
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,600
I'm satisfied with you by my side.

615
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,040
And I know what you mean.

616
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,160
It's natural to be selfish.

617
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,280
We're both young.

618
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,120
Don't worry about it.

619
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,080
Thank you for your understanding.

620
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,840
I'll do my best.

621
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,120
I'll do my best to help you

622
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,640
to get the position of Young Master.

623
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,320
Good girl.

624
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,800
Thank you for today.

625
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,440
It's okay.

626
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,440
Do you want me to

627
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,000
check your wound again?

628
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,680
I've checked it.

629
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,600
It's fine.

630
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,320
You were too impulsive today.

631
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,120
Didn't you see

632
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,840
that they were trying to get you in trouble?

633
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,640
It's been five years.

634
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,360
I've seen it.

635
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,960
Have a good rest.

636
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:18,920
I'm leaving.

637
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,160
When is the next treatment?

638
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,680
Didn't you say you wanted to make a deal with me?

639
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,360
Since you're making a deal,

640
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,400
why don't we show our sincerity first?

641
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,600
I'm taking care of Bao Xi in your mansion.

642
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,360
I'll have a mother-in-law

643
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,880
and a sister-in-law later.

644
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,480
They'll all come to me for trouble.

645
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,360
I don't have time to care about anything else.

646
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,640
What do you want?

647
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,360
If you want me to treat your illness,

648
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,640
you have to restore my identity as Second Young Consort.

649
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,840
You've always been Second Young Consort.

650
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,840
I'm just a nobody.

651
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,720
I've been treated by others

652
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,680
and treated by others.

653
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,400
I'm not Second Young Consort.

654
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,480
Besides,

655
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,360
if I'm bullied one day

656
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,920
and feel bad about it,

657
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,240
don't blame me.

658
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,200
I promise you.
