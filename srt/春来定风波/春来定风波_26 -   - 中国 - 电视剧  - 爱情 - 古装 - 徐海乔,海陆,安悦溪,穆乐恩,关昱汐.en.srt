Let go.

24
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,080
I need to see Master Jingming.

25
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,440
- Move.
- Let go.

26
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,160
Let me go.

27
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,380
I need to see Master Jingming.

28
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,880
Get in.

29
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,270
I need to see Master Jingming.

30
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,830
Let me see Master Jingming.

31
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,110
Let me out.

32
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,520
You want to see Master Jingming?

33
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,600
Everyone in Dongzhou knows

34
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
you risked people's lives

35
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,830
just to claim credit.

36
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,190
Now, the whole city
is petitioning Prefect

37
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,270
for your execution.

38
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,280
Master Jingming has been placed
under house arrest

39
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,430
for pleading on your behalf.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,040
I didn't do it.

41
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,400
Let me out.

42
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,570
I need to see Master Jingming.

43
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,330
We're at a critical moment
in the epidemic.

44
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,470
If the medication is stopped

45
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,670
or the prescription is changed,

46
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,720
the patients' bodies

47
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,840
won't be able to take it.

48
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,890
Please relay a message to the Prefect.

49
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,440
Let me treat the people first.

50
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,910
He can punish me afterward.

51
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,120
Your message won't help.

52
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,430
Besides, who in Dongzhou
would still dare

53
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,790
to take your medicine?

54
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,440
I must see Master Jingming.

55
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,280
Let me see Master Jingming.

56
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,030
Master Jingming.

57
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,520
Your Grace, why are you here?

58
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,280
I heard about Consort Jiangli.

59
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,320
Though I don't know medicine,

60
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,450
I believe in Jiangli's medical skills.

61
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,840
She would never

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,950
make such a mistake.

63
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,440
I agree.

64
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,750
Someone must be plotting
behind the scenes.

65
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,710
Young Master, Your Grace.

66
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,950
I've got news on the bandits

67
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,060
you had me investigate.

68
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,320
What bandits?

69
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,000
Jiangli discovered

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,950
that previously,

71
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,120
Dongzhou's military funds

72
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,510
were funneled through Jinsheng Bank

73
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:24,600
to support the bandits.

74
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,840
How is it?

75
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,840
Jiangli was right.

76
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,880
Those so-called bandits

77
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,600
are Lu Jingxiu's private troops.

78
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,280
Private troops?

79
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,950
Could it be that Jiangli's investigation

80
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,840
through Wind Pavilion's connections

81
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,280
alerted Jingxiu,

82
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,470
which led to her imprisonment?

83
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,190
If Lu Jingxiu has a private army,

84
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,910
it must be sizable by now.

85
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,670
After all these years,

86
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,630
he couldn't have just stockpiled troops.

87
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,400
He's probably

88
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,350
built up significant power.

89
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,400
Perhaps,

90
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,470
Jiangli's incident

91
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,790
may just be the beginning.

92
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,600
Jingxiu has been plotting for years.

93
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,350
This

94
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,670
will not end peacefully.

95
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,430
And behind it,

96
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,160
there may be an even greater crisis.

97
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,640
My mansion is riddled with danger.

98
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,230
Even if Jiangli is released,

99
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,430
she'll be trapped here with me.

100
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,310
This involves too many people

101
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,990
and is too dangerous.

102
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,520
Your Grace,
you should return to Xizhou asap.

103
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,680
No.

104
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,200
I'm staying not just for Dongzhou.

105
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,520
If we don't deal with Lu Jingxiu,

106
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,600
people like Wen Du

107
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,720
might keep stirring up trouble

108
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,520
in Xizhou.

109
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,870
Peace will never come between us.

110
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,470
We still need to think carefully

111
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,340
if there's a perfect solution.

112
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,350
How can you still stand here?

113
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:07,550
It's been two days.

114
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,300
Master Jingming
hasn't even left his room.

115
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,640
What else can he do?

116
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,740
Do you have a better plan?

117
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,550
I'll sneak in through the back window
and knock him out.

118
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,990
You can get Consort Jiangli out.

119
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,080
Let's run.

120
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,920
Go ahead.

121
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,150
I'll collect your corpse.

122
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,460
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

123
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,760
Don't worry, Jingming.

124
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,960
We were very careful.

125
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,400
No one saw us.

126
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,880
Jingming,

127
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,230
we heard about Jiangli.

128
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,040
What are you going to do?

129
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,230
Should we break her out of prison?

130
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,310
The priority now is to find out

131
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,800
the real cause of the patients' deaths

132
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,640
to clear Jiangli's name

133
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,160
and exonerate her

134
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,740
from killing people with medicine.

135
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,990
Actually, on the way back,

136
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,040
I tried to investigate the temple,

137
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,790
but Jingxiu's Golden Guards

138
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,990
had it surrounded.

139
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,960
My soldiers couldn't get close.

140
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,880
Jingxing,

141
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,230
watch your words.

142
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,720
We're investigating a case,

143
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,770
not having a war.

144
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,280
Jingming is right.

145
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,280
You should be careful with your words.

146
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,670
I'm just worried for Jingming.

147
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,400
Rumors are flying around the city.

148
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,080
They say Jiangli

149
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,160
used the people's lives

150
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,550
to help Jingming become the Prefect.

151
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,470
The public outrage is boiling over.

152
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,680
Also,

153
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,280
Jingxiu is fanning the flames.

154
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,760
He's putting on quite a show.

155
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,980
Yesterday, he was comforting the sick.

156
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,080
Today, he's brought in monks
to chant for the dead.

157
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,400
He's always attracting attention.

158
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,760
Let him be.

159
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,840
Right now, saving Jiangli

160
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,680
is more important.

161
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,040
So, what's our next move?

162
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,310
Young Master,

163
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,110
Princess Chuya's palanquin
stopped outside.

164
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,400
What is she doing here?

165
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,870
Jingming, it's not appropriate

166
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,350
for outsiders to see us here.

167
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,670
We'll take our leave.

168
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,310
We'll go now.

169
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,150
Master Jingming.

170
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,410
Your Grace, you came so late.

171
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,840
What is so urgent?

172
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,310
I've thought of a perfect solution.

173
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,200
What perfect solution?

174
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,520
My medicine couldn't have gone wrong.

175
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,520
What exactly is going on?

176
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,900
(Prefect's Mansion)
Father,

177
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,160
this is the list of the patients

178
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,960
and relief expenses I compiled.

179
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,310
Please take a look.

180
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,390
Not bad.

181
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:07,910
Well done.

182
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,250
My Lord,

183
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,700
Princess Chuya requests an audience.

184
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,470
What's she here for now?

185
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,080
She might be here to say goodbye.

186
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:15,830
Father,

187
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,160
with the plague spreading in Dongzhou,

188
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,400
maybe she's scared.

189
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,430
Bring the princess in.

190
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,360
Greetings, My Lord.

191
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,160
Greetings, Master Jingxiu.

192
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,710
I've come today

193
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:41,830
to ask the Prefect

194
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,320
to grant a marriage

195
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,560
between me and Master Jingming.

196
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,640
You want to marry Jingming?

197
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,510
Your Grace,

198
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,040
Jingming is currently a criminal.

199
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,910
Though it hasn't been clarified yet,

200
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,960
the fact that Father hasn't punished him
is already a mercy.

201
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,590
At this time, granting a marriage

202
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,160
wouldn't be appropriate.

203
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,630
Whether it's mercy or punishment,
it has nothing to do with me.

204
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,910
All I know is

205
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,280
that the Grand Princess of Xizhou

206
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,000
is to marry Master Jingming of Dongzhou.

207
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,280
Dongzhou has many fine young men.

208
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,430
Why insist on Jingming?

209
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,120
Besides,

210
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,320
didn't he

211
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,880
reject you in public that day?

212
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,670
He rejected me back then

213
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,310
because he had a consort.

214
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,910
But things are different now.

215
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,430
I believe

216
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,430
Dongzhou

217
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,710
needs someone like me to be his consort.

218
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,200
Your Grace,

219
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,360
with your background

220
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,830
and nobility in Xizhou,

221
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,280
you should marry someone
of equal status.

222
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,240
Only then can the alliance between us

223
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,430
be truly beneficial.

224
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,840
I'll even marry a criminal

225
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,160
if I like him.

226
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,950
I won't marry even a king

227
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,640
if I don't like him.

228
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,120
Among the four states,

229
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,160
I don't think there's a man

230
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,910
who matches my status.

231
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,590
So, Master Jingxiu,

232
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,550
you'd better drop that thought.

233
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,600
My Lord,

234
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,280
I want to marry

235
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,880
the one I love.

236
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,400
If I can marry Master Jingming,

237
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,670
the two states

238
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,340
will surely
form a century-long alliance.

239
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,550
Xizhou will also

240
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,070
start trading with Dongzhou

241
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,360
and reduce tariffs.

242
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,760
As for the pros and cons,

243
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,910
I don't think

244
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,120
you need a junior like me

245
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,830
to spell them out for you.

246
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,550
Summon Lady Shu and Master Jingming.

247
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,710
You're here.

248
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,520
The princess has requested
a marriage again.

249
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,790
She wants

250
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,280
to marry Jingming.

251
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,550
What?

252
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,480
Lady Shu,

253
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,590
we in Xizhou are straightforward,

254
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,550
so I'll speak plainly.

255
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,240
You are Master Jingming's mother.

256
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,120
If I marry him,

257
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,160
I'll treat you much better

258
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,950
than Shen Jiangli.

259
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,280
I can manage the household

260
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,550
and help with Master Jingming's work.

261
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:02,910
But

262
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:03,910
Jiangli...

263
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,000
Master Jingming,

264
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,710
will you marry me?

265
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,760
Jingming won't marry you.

266
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:15,550
I agree.

267
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,520
I agree

268
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,360
to marry the princess.

269
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,840
Jingming,

270
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,790
do you know the consequences?

271
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,670
Jiangli was just imprisoned,

272
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,310
and now you're rushing to marry another.

273
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,830
What will the people think of you?

274
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,590
Even if she was at fault,

275
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,550
they'll say you're heartless.

276
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,400
The princess is devoted to me.

277
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,400
She's willing to offer herself

278
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,750
even before the cause of the deaths

279
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,550
is known.

280
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,710
If I turn her down now,

281
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,360
wouldn't that be heartless too?

282
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,360
Jingming,

283
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,950
Jiangli...

284
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,040
Don't worry, Lady Shu.

285
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,280
I'll be Master Jingming's consort.

286
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,280
As for Shen Jiangli,

287
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,480
she can be his wife.

288
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,070
That wouldn't be unfair to her.

289
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:07,670
His wife?

290
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,070
Your Grace,

291
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,640
we still don't know
the cause of the deaths.

292
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,640
There's a chance Shen Jiangli
will be executed.

293
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,190
My Lord,

294
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,550
we in Xizhou

295
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,950
have no strict wedding customs.

296
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,880
But there is one rule.

297
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,190
Before the wedding,

298
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,310
there must be no bloodshed.

299
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,070
Otherwise, it's bad luck.

300
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,040
There's no evidence

301
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,430
that Shen Jiangli is the killer.

302
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,950
So, why not release her?

303
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,360
If I

304
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,160
marry Master Jingming

305
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,790
while the previous consort is executed,

306
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,430
it would make me seem
arrogant and cruel,

307
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,360
leaving her no way out.

308
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,480
Absolutely not, Father.

309
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,480
Shen Jiangli is a major suspect.

310
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,070
If we release her so easily,

311
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,830
how can we calm the people?

312
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,430
Master Jingxiu,

313
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,670
which do you think is more important,

314
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,120
the peace between Xizhou
and Dongzhou

315
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,950
or a case without proof?

316
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,200
Jingming,

317
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,670
what do you think?

318
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,480
Father, I'll do as you wish.

319
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,310
Fine.

320
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:12,360
Then I will grant

321
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,790
the princess's wish.

322
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,760
Thank you, My Lord.

323
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,600
Father...

324
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,360
Enough.

325
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,270
Father,

326
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,960
please listen to me.

327
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,760
If Chuya has to share

328
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,950
her husband,

329
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,160
isn't that unfair

330
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,790
to her?

331
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,400
What's your plan?

332
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,120
Since Jingming has been moved
by the princess's sincerity,

333
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,400
for the sake of Dongzhou's reputation,

334
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,550
he should abandon Shen Jiangli.

335
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,750
You...

336
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:41,790
My Lord,

337
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,710
this is Jingming's second marriage.

338
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,360
If Jingming abandons Jiangli,

339
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,120
it'd seriously damage Jingming

340
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,000
and the princess's reputations.

341
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,900
Besides,

342
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,360
we must consider

343
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,640
Yanyan's feelings.

344
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,150
Lady Shu,

345
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,040
what I'm concerned about

346
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,790
is the reputation
of the Prefect's family.

347
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,520
Shen Jiangli has committed grave crimes.

348
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,910
Though we could release her,

349
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,910
how can she still proudly be

350
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,830
a consort?

351
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,480
What will the people think?

352
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,520
They'll say we're showing favoritism.

353
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:09,750
Enough.

354
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,830
No need to abandon her.

355
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,000
Jingming,

356
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,040
why don't you divorce Shen Jiangli?

357
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,310
That is

358
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,710
because of the princess's kindness.

359
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,830
Shen Jiangli has caused

360
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,950
too many deaths.

361
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,310
If she's allowed

362
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,710
to be a consort,

363
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,830
it would only fuel public outrage.

364
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,360
Then it's settled.

365
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,830
I'll ask the Director of Astrology

366
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,280
to set the wedding date

367
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,820
and announce it to the world next time.

368
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,760
Thank you, My Lord.

369
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,160
Alright. You may leave.

370
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,030
Yes.

371
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,480
My wife and I have been

372
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,790
through so much together.

373
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,760
Our bond runs deep.

374
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,710
The two of us

375
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,590
cannot allow

376
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,280
anyone else to come between us.

377
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,670
Your Grace, I hope you can understand.

378
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,830
We're devoted

379
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,030
to each other

380
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,190

Your Grace, please understand.

382
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:17,910
I can't

383
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,040

00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,240
have no strict wedding customs.

388
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,400
But there is one rule.

389
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,710
Before the wedding,

390
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,830
there must be no bloodshed.

391
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,590
Otherwise, it's bad luck.

392
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,310
There's no evidence

393
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,950
that Shen Jiangli is the killer.

394
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,240

Zimo, Qingqing.

00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,720
Jiangli, are you okay?

409
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,470
Jiangli,

410
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,280
you've lost so much weight.

411
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,390
I'm fine.

412
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,870
Where's Master Jingming?

413
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,070
Did he not come?

414
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,480
Jingming...

415
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,800
What's wrong?

416
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,310
What happened to him?

417
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,550
He was...

418
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,630
He was suddenly called

419
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:27,790
to the military camp.

420
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,520
But don't worry, Jiangli.

421
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,550
He should be back soon.

422
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,240
I dreamed he came to see me yesterday.

423
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,350
I can't shake this unease.

424
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,480
I have to find him.

425
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,520
- Jiangli.
- Jiangli.

426
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,440
Lu Jingming and Chuya's marriage

427
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,480
cannot be hidden from her.

428
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:55,420
(Master Jingming's Mansion)

429
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,680
Greetings, My Lady.

430
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,880
You...

431
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,480
Greetings, My Lady.

432
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,110
Greetings, My Lady.

433
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,150
Young Master,

434
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,000
the nanny in charge asked

435
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,830
what kind of wedding decorations
you prefer.

436
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,880
Anything's fine.

437
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,840
Okay.

438
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,630
My Lady.

439
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,350
Whose wedding is it?

440
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,120
Mine.

441
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,040
In three days,

442
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,480
I will marry Princess Chuya.

443
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,880
Why?

444
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,870
You were able to come out safely

445
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,630
thanks to Princess Chuya's intercession.

446
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,760
You should thank her.

447
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,680
You agreed to marry Princess Chuya

448
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,350
to save me?

449
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,950
It's not just that.

450
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,150
Then why?

451
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,230
This plague

452
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,790
has had a huge impact.

453
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,150
Now, I've lost

454
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,760
the people's trust in Dongzhou,

455
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,480
and my position

456
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,870
in Dongzhou

457
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,240
is in a precarious situation.

458
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,720
If I marry Princess Chuya,

459
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,310
with the support of Xizhou,

460
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,820
the position of the Young Prefect

461
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,490
will be within my grasp.

462
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,790
I don't believe it.

463
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,200
You're lying again.

464
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,040
Shen Jiangli,

465
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,390
after all this,

466
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,550
can't you see

467
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,790
that in my position,

468
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,670
love alone

469
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,240
is not enough?

470
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,630
I need everything the princess can offer

471
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,350
to help me reach my goals

472
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,480
and protect what I want.

473
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,440
I don't believe it.

474
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,550
I don't believe you're someone
so obsessed with power.

475
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,280
I don't believe

476
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,200
you would give up our relationship

477
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,720
for fame and fortune.

478
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,630
The Master Jingming I know
is not like this.

479
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,000
I've always been like this.

480
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,440
I've always wanted one thing.

481
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,280
When you returned to the mansion

482
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,390
and made an agreement with me,

483
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,680
didn't you say

484
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,960
you could help me
become the Young Prefect?

485
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,390
Have you forgotten?

486
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,310
What happened?

487
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,440
We can face everything together.

488
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,960
This matter is settled.

489
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,350
If you keep pressing,

490
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,350
I won't have mercy.

491
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,800
Jingming,

492
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,520
I will say this only once.

493
00:20:58,870 --> 00:20:59,710
I know

494
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,630
the path ahead is dangerous,

495
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,110
but I don't need to always live

496
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,520
under your protection.

497
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,550
I don't need you to sacrifice for me.

498
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,480
I am your consort.

499
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:14,200
I can fight by your side.

500
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,110
I can face everything

501
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,200
with you.

502
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,480
I'm not afraid to face schemes;

503
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,480
I fear more

504
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,870
that you'll abandon me again.

505
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,830
I've said all I can.

506
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,970

Well...

520
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,310
Princess Chuya is about to be here,

521
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,350
so Master Jingming asked us to prepare.

522
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,600
Where's Yanyan?

523
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,680
Where has Yanyan gone?

524
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,000
He is with Lady Shu.

525
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,830
There are many people here.

526
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,870
Master Jingming is afraid
that he might get hurt.

527
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,350
You can leave now.

528
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,370
Then

529
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,590
I will take my leave.

530
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:03,350
My Lady, if you need anything,

531
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,760
just let me know.

00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,590
have been

535
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,960
through so much together.

536
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:23,390
Our bond

537
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:25,040
runs deep.

538
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,680
The two of us

539
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,960
cannot allow

540
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,390
anyone else to come between us.

541
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,150
Shen Jiangli,

542
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,030
I'll never let you go in this life.

546
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,070
Zimo,

547
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,310
you came just in time.

548
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,000
Please look at these prescriptions.

549
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,550
I don't know where the problem lies.

550
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,390
Jiangli,

551
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,110
Master Jingming
and the Grand Princess...

552
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,720
I don't know

553
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,920
what agreement they've reached,

554
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,040
and I don't want to argue
with him anymore.

555
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,960
I just want to control the epidemic now.

556
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,870
Don't hold back in front of me.

557
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,390
I don't understand

558
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,520
why things have changed so much

559
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,790
in just a few days.

560
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,480
I don't understand

561
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,920
why he doesn't trust me.

562
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,720
I could face it with him.

563
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,150
Is our relationship

564
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,790
just a piece of paper?

565
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,790
What does he

566
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,240
take these days between us for?

567
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,830
Shen Jiangli,

568
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,240
you've lost a lot of weight these days.

569
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,870
You can recuperate later.

570
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,310
Everything will get better.

571
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,690
Your Grace, thanks for your concern.

572
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,550
Master Jingming, you must've been idle.

573
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,470
The epidemic hasn't settled,

574
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,720
and the truth is still unclear.

575
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,720
Yet you still went shopping.

576
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,870
My marriage with Master Jingming

577
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,550
is of great importance to both states.

578
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,280
So, it must be done properly.

579
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,600
Lu Jingming,

580
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,630
have you forgotten

581
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,790
that you promised me

582
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,000
you'd protect Jiangli for life?

583
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,040
Times have changed.

584
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,600
Moreover,

585
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,000
this is my family matter.

586
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,590
There's no need to trouble you.

587
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,320
- You...
- Zimo.

588
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,390
Let's go.

589
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,960
When do you plan to tell her

590
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,310
about your divorce?

591
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,190
Divorce?

592
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,720
Chuya is the Grand Princess of Xizhou.

593
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,200
She's of noble status.

594
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,870
So, she should be the consort.

595
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:39,830
You're still a suspect

596
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,520
regarding the epidemic.

597
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,920
So, you can't be

598
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,040
the consort.

599
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,200
You should leave Dongzhou asap.

600
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,920
Divorce?

601
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,320
Yes.

602
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,390
We indeed need a divorce.

603
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,280
After the epidemic is over,

604
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,830
I will leave on my own

605
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:09,960
without your reminder.

606
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,240
Jiangli.

607
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,630
You...

608
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:23,630
Are you alright?

609
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,360
Young Master.

610
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,980
The physician is here.

611
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,230
Let her in.

612
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,540
Greetings, Master Jingming.

613
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,760
Greetings, Your Grace.

614
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,030
Ms. Gao, no need for formalities.

615
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,390
You must've been exhausted
after your long journey.

616
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:47,960
It's nothing.

617
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,350
Princess Chuya ordered this.

618
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,690
I don't dare claim any exhaustion.

619
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,750
Ms. Gao is the national physician
of Xizhou.

620
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,070
She's renowned for her skills
in medicine and poison.

621
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:59,390
She's taken care of me
since I was a child.

622
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,960
She is someone I trust.

623
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:02,970
Since she is one of our own,

624
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,250
I will speak frankly.

625
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,040
The reason

626
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:08,520
we invited Ms. Gao from far away

627
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,070
is to investigate the sudden deaths

628
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,110
of the patients here.

629
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,870
Ms. Gao, please help us.

630
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,310
Of course, I will.

631
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,550
Is there anything wrong?

632
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,750
May I inspect the prescriptions
and the pharmacy?

633
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,230
Of course.

634
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:22,470
Yunyi,

635
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,070
take Ms. Gao to the site

636
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:24,920
to inspect it

637
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,110
and explain the situation

638
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,390
along the way.

639
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,010
Ms. Gao,

640
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:29,930
this way, please.

641
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,830
I will take my leave.

642
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,360
Don't worry.

643
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,550
Be it fragrance or poison,

644
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,590
if Ms. Gao intervenes,

645
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,200
nothing will go undetected.

646
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:43,910
Let's hope so.

647
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,630
Everyone, drink the medicine.

648
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:48,550
Once you're better,

649
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,310
you'll reunite with your families.

650
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,390
Something's wrong with the medicine.

651
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,440
We won't drink it.

652
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,550
Think carefully.

653
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,590
When you were at your lowest,

654
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,110
who stepped forward?

655
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,520
Even when everyone doubted her,

656
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,830
she never backed down.

657
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,550
With your current condition,

658
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,310
if you don't accept treatment now,

659
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,870
it will be too late.

660
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:10,070
I hope you will give yourselves a chance

661
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,590
and trust us once more.

662
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,720
Look.

663
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,960
Look, she drank it.

664
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,830
You added licorice to the medicine,

665
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,590
which suppressed the bitterness.

666
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,410
You know medicine?

667
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:30,790
Let's try it too.

668
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,910
Thanks.

669
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,830
May I ask what your name is?

670
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,680
Ye Nanxing.

671
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,150
Goodbye.

672
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,000
Jiangli,

673
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,280
after taking this medicine,

674
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,540
the residual heat in their bodies
will be alleviated.

675
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,680
Then we should return.

676
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,200
These are the herbs

677
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:12,110
we collected from the site back then.

678
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,190
Sir,

679
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,520
after the patients died,

680
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,070
did anyone else enter the area?

681
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,870
No. Shortly after the incident,

682
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,880
Master Jingming ordered us
to seal off this place.

683
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,960
No one has entered.

684
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:26,200
Are these the medicinal residues
the patients consumed?

685
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,390
It's all here.

686
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,750
Please begin the examination now.

687
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,140
Have you found anything?

688
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,150
Please be patient.

689
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:47,970
The bowl in your left hand

690
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:49,580
was used by the deceased villager.

691
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,630
The one in your right hand

692
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:51,720
was used by Master Jingming

693
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,360
to test the medicine
for Consort Jiangli.

694
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,120
Is there a problem?

695
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,280
Sir, we need to return to the mansion

696
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,630
to check the details carefully.

697
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,960
Let's leave now.

698
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,520
Master Jingming, look.

699
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,200
The white powder on the left

700
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,320
is scraped

701
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,590
from the deceased victim's bowl.

702
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,520
I've compared it with your bowl.

703
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,150
There's no such substance in your bowl.

704
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,590
What is this?

705
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,830
Please give me some alkaline water.

706
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,440
Yunyi.

707
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:22,710
Yes.

708
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,680
It's slightly sticky to the touch

709
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,750
and resembles salt grains.

710
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,280
I think it's mirabilite.

711
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,120
Mirabilite?

712
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,720
Is it poisonous?

713
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,710
No.

714
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,070
I've seen the prescription before.

715
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,310
The victims of this plague

716
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,550
generally had mild dysentery symptoms.

717
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,790
If mirabilite was added,

718
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,150
it would exacerbate the dysentery

719
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,680
and cause rapid death

720
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,110
within a short period.

721
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,040
But I had people

722
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,350
inspect the herbs and residues

723
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,200
and didn't find any medicine.

724
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,310
That's the brilliance of the murderer.

725
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,310
Mirabilite is colorless and volatile,

726
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,150
and it dissolves in water

727
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,240
without high temperatures.

728
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,530
However, after a long time,

729
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,760
it will still leave traces.

730
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,630
It's truly malicious.

731
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,250
Master Jingming, look.

732
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,240
My hand just touched the white powder.

733
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,630
If I put my hand in the water now

734
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,070
and the color changes,

735
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:11,990
it will prove

736
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,960
that this is

737
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,830
definitely mirabilite.

738
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,830
It changed.

739
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,110
We must find out

740
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,480
who is behind this.

741
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,720
And

742
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,760
what is this?

743
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:30,240
I found this in another bowl.

744
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,430
However,

745
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,850
it doesn't seem like medicine,

746
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,020
so I brought it back

747
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,300
for Master Jingming to inspect.

748
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,280
This is...

749
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,320
Horse feed?

750
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,380
This is indeed horse feed,

751
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,310
but it's not the feed from our mansion.

752
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:53,960
This inferior horse feed

753
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,240
is used for horses that transport goods.

754
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,040
Ms. Gao,

755
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,720
to avoid alerting the enemy,

756
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,310
you must stay here

757
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,290
for now.

758
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,070
When the right moment comes,

759
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,150

send you to the mission.

761
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,040
Thank you, Master Jingming.

Lu Jingxiu is behind this again?

769
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,280

If you have any reasons,

777
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:32,920
tell me.

I won't hold it against you.

No.

780
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,630
You truly want to marry Chuya

781
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,290
and truly wish to divorce me?

782
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:45,910
Yes.

Jiangli,

807
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,550
will you really divorce Master Jingming?

808
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,520
What do you plan to do next?

809
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,190
From now on,

810
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,920
I'm no longer your sister-in-law.

811
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,920
The plague has been stabilized.

812
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,480
I don't want to know

813
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,960
about the conspiracies involved.

814
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,630
I only want to take Yanyan

815
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,040
and leave this place of strife.

816
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,550
But Yanyan is now with Lady Shu.

817
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,750
I don't know if she
will allow him to leave.

818
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,630
That's why I've come to find you.

819
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:49,950
Now,

820
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,040
Yanyan's identity
is different from before.

821
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,000
He's the Prefect's eldest grandson.

822
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:55,360
Lady Shu

823
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,630
won't let me take Yanyan away easily.

824
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,400
So, Jiangli,

825
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,110
how should I cooperate with you

826
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,440
to get Yanyan out?

827
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,590
Right now,

828
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:08,670
I can't enter the Prefect's Mansion

829
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,190
because I've been falsely accused.

830
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,520
But you can help me.

831
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,470
You can go and greet them there.

832
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,750
I'll disguise myself as your maid

833
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:16,590
and go in with you.

834
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,280
Zimo,

835
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,750
please wait for me outside.

836
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:24,550
The Prefect's Mansion

837
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:25,690
is heavily guarded now.

838
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,520
Even if you get in,

839
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:29,520
it will be

840
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,440
incredibly difficult

841
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,670
to sneak Yanyan out unnoticed.

842
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,190
But I have to take the risk.

843
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,590
I have no other way.

844
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,040
However hard it is, I must try.

845
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,190
We can first approach Lady Shu.

846
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,440
She is also a mother.

847
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,840
If she is willing to help you,

848
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,740
getting Yanyan out will be much easier.

849
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:49,710
But you must promise me

850
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,480
not to act recklessly.

851
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,000
Even if she refuses today,

852
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,420
we can always try again

853
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,970
as long as we don't alert the Prefect.

854
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,320
So,

855
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,400
you must follow my lead

856
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,320
in every action.

857
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,960
If you can do this,

858
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,680
I will take you
into the Prefect's Mansion.

859
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,320
Don't worry.

860
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,040
