You and your father

seem a bit...

24
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,420
All these years,

25
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,330
my father

26
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,090
remains unchanged.

27
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,500
Are you upset with him

28
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,780
for ignoring you these five years?

29
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,170
It's not just these five years.

30
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,980
When my mother was alive,

31
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,050
many affairs in the house

32
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,170
were already handled by Aunt Zou.

33
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,420
Father wasn't oblivious.

34
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,020
He just turned a blind eye,

35
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,580
favoring his concubine.

36
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,610
I just saw

37
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,700
Qilan's maid

38
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,450
buying so much Shu brocade.

39
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,490
I then realized, Aunt Zou

40
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,100
still manages the household.

41
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,170
Why should I go back

42
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,890
to upset their family?

43
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,480
(Peace and Prosperity)

44
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,330
Jingxiu.

45
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,380
Master Jingxiu and Jingming,

46
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,330
what are your orders?

47
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,260
You may leave now.

48
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,100
Yes.

49
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:54,810
Jingming,

50
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,610
Heard Xizhou spies entered the city.

51
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,930
Father asked me to patrol the city.

52
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,010
I didn't expect

53
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,300
to have this unexpected gain.

54
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:03,980
I also heard

55
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,050
that you seized my goods.

56
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,820
Please enlighten me.

57
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,650
What's inside these?

58
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,890
Recently, I discovered an iron mine

59
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,420
while traveling

60
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,420
and bought it.

61
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,020
The carriage carries mine goods.

62
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,300
You want to be a mine owner?

63
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,930
Weren't you interested in antiques

64
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,450
and calligraphy a while ago?

65
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,260
When did you start liking business?

66
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,100
Speaking of which,

67
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,890
it relates to my wife.

68
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,140
We've reconciled, loving as before.

69
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,170
I truly cherish this in my heart.

70
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,650
But she keeps complaining

71
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,170
that all her wedding gifts

72
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,260
are gone.

73
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,610
She keeps bringing it up at home.

74
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,650
So, I have no choice but to

75
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,380
find ways to help her

76
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,730
acquire some assets.

77
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,980
Ladies usually like jewelry,

78
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,260
or at most in antiques

79
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,450
and calligraphy.

80
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,330
Your wife is quite unique,

81
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,540
wanting to be a mine owner.

82
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,610
Jingming,

83
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,260
thinking carefully before you lie.

84
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,540
Jingxiu, that's not true.

85
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,300
Who says women

86
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,650
can't own property?

87
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,260
I'll be Dongzhou's first female mine owner.

88
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,650
If you ever need some,

89
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,270
for family's sake,

90
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,410
I can offer you a discount.

91
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,620
What a harmonious couple.

92
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,450
According to Dongzhou's law,

93
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,390
only with the mine owner's document

94
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,020
can ore be transported in and out of city.

95
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,860
Jingming,

96
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,970
I haven't seen any record

97
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,620
of such document here.

98
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,250
Document?

99
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,420
Oh, right.

100
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,700
(Mine Owner: Shen Jiangli)
These goods

101
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,330
were prepared by Jiangli,

102
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,700
so it's not recorded under my name.

103
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,500
That's why you can't find it.

104
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,940
Just a misunderstanding.

105
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,890
It's clear now.

106
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,020
Jingxiu,

107
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,420
we'll take our leave.

108
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,420
Go ahead.

109
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,490
Let's go.

110
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,850
Ore isn't like firearms.

111
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,700
It's not a prohibited item.

112
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,850
Does Dongzhou's law

113
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,180
have such bans?

114
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,180
There used to be,

115
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,090
but in recent years,

116
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,380
Dongzhou's encouraged trade,

117
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,410
and rarely applied rules.

118
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,380
Seems Jingxiu

119
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,090
is deliberately making it hard.

120
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,820
Fortunately,

121
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,410
I got the document ready earlier.

122
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,580
By the way,

123
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,980

00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,410
Are you really giving me the iron mine?

the rest can be sold.

00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,300
two gentlemen?

193
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,400
Ma'am,

194
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,250
it wasn't.

195
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,810
Jiangli gave me a ointment.

196
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:46,690
Shen Jiangli?

197
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,930
You still trust her?

198
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,050
Aren't you afraid she

199
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,020
might poison the ointment

200
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,260
and harm you?

201
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,620
Mother,

202
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,620
about earlier...

203
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,580
Enough, Qingqing.

204
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,890
It's my birthday today.

205
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,690
I don't want to talk about it.

206
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,690
Qingqing,

207
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,100
do you know?

208
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,140
You and Jingming

209
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,860
are the apples of my eye.

210
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,050
As long as you're happy,

211
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:11,970
I'll

212
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,410
be joyful and healthy.

213
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,770
Hurry up.

214
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:27,670
Come on,

215
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:28,810
there's the birthday banquet.

216
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,460
If we're late, it's on you.

217
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,410
Wang Danling cares much
about Lady Shu's birthday?

218
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,700
Yes,

219
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,650
more than you, the daughter-in-law.

220
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,980
I have prepared a gift.

221
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,140
How do you know I don't care?

222
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,860
Come with me to the side hall

223
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,890
and see what treasure

224
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:46,900
Wang Danling has prepared.

225
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,050
It's so mysterious.

226
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,380
If we're late,

227
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,620
mother will surely reprimand us.

228
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,740
Do you know why the last act of an opera

229
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:54,930
is called the Grand Finale?

230
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:58,890
No

231
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,020
mischief today.

232
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,380
Don't worry.

233
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,050
You're the Prefect and Lady Shu's good son.

234
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,620
They won't blame you.

235
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,500
Besides, we're allies now.

236
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:08,650
We share both honor

237
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:09,730
and disgrace.

238
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,050
I won't be a burden to you.

239
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,340
Do you think I'm afraid of that?

240
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:13,820
- I...
- What is it then?

241
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:17,730
Think for yourself.

242
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,530
How would I know what you think?

243
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,140
You're always so moody.

244
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,460
Wait for me!

245
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,700
Brother,

246
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,650
I sent someone to inquire.

247
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,810
The gifts from Master Jingxiu and Jingxing

248
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,650
are all rare and invaluable

249
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,740
treasures.

250
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,250
Well,

251
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,980
Consort Jiangli prepared this...

252
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,100
Aren't you from Master Jingming's Mansion?

253
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,410
What rare item

254
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,860
has Consort Jiangli prepared?

255
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,810
- I...
- I almost forgot,

256
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,340
Consort Jiangli comes from a humble family,

257
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,980
probably can't prepare

258
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,620
anything decent.

259
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,500
Our Lady's gift

260
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,570
is priceless.

261
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,690
Brother, tell her.

262
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,340
She won't understand.

263
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:01,770
Might as well not say.

264
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,820
Might as well not say.

265
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,530
This is Lady Shu's birthday banquet.

266
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,620
If you make any mistakes,

267
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:11,980
it will be

268
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,050
Lady Shu who loses face.

269
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,530
Brother,

270
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,370
what is this?

271
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,340
I don't know.

272
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,530
Xiulan, today is your birthday.

273
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:30,930
You're a year older now.

274
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,220
Jinyi,

275
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,860
even so,

276
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,500
your age

277
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,020
is still older than mine.

278
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,020
Congratulations.

279
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,050
Lady Shu, wish you eternal youth

280
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,290
and everlasting beauty.

281
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,050
Lady Shu, wish you perpetual youth

282
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,740
and eternal blessings.

283
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,290
Thank you. Please take a seat.

284
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,180
Lord Shen.

285
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,650
Greetings, Lady Wang.

286
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,570
Lady Shu, today is your birthday.

287
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,020
I've prepared a humble gift.

288
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,860
Wish you boundless fortune and longevity.

289
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,860
Thank you.

290
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,890
Traveled day and night,

291
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,170
fortunately we made it on time.

292
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:19,860
(Lu Jingxing, the Prefect's third son)

293
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,300
(Xiahou Yao, Lu Jingxing's consort)

294
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,410
Jingxing.

295
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:27,740
Your son, Lu Jingxing.

296
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,040
Your daughter-in-law, Xiahou Yao.

297
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,340
Greet Lady Wang and Lady Shu.

298
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:32,530
We're family.

299
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,500
No need to be formal.

300
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:34,650
Lady Shu,

301
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,980
knowing it's your birthday,

302
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,890
Yao and I traveled day and night.

303
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,260
My ferghana horse almost

304
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,140
died from exhaustion.

305
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,370
Ouch! Why pinch me?

306
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,620
Today is Lady Shu's Birthday.

307
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,590
Don't use the word "die".

308
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,820
It's fine.

309
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,740
My son Jingxing's

310
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,830
always been straightforward.

311
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:50,690
Since young,

312
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,340
he's been clear-hearted.

313
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,530
You brought Yao,

314
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,260
traveled miles to come

315
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,170
to celebrate for me.

316
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,410
I'm delighted

317
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,460
that you're here.

318
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,650
Lady Shu, I've also brought you a gift.

319
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,340
This is...

320
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,860
Oh my, what is this?

321
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:15,930
Amitabha.

322
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,140
In the eyes of nomadic tribes,

323
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,610
sheep symbolizes good fortune.

324
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,860
A sheep's skull represents auspiciousness.

325
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,460
Indeed.

326
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:24,690
Among nomads,

327
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,140
old cattle and sheep with merit

328
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,170
aren't easily slaughtered.

329
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,930
After they die of old age,

330
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,410
the owner invites monks

331
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,410
to inscribe sutras on their skulls

332
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,570
and hang them in the temple

333
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:34,410
as a tribute.

334
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,410
Jingxing grew up under Lady Shu's care.

335
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,570
He hopes to express

336
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,500
his gratitude through this gift.

337
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,530
Evil thoughts

338
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,980
lead to seeing sin;

339
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,770
Good thoughts

340
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,740
lead to seeing luck.

341
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,050
I really like this gift.

342
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,620
Glad you like it.

343
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,690
Since you like it,

344
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,100
servant,

345
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,200
move it to Lady Shu's room.

346
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,740
It's actually a sheep skull.

347
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,720
Look,

348
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,020
Jingxiu and Danling

349
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,530
also brought you a gift.

350
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,170
Lady Wang, Lady Shu.

351
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,250
Greetings.

352
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:28,340
The gift from Jingxing and Yao is

353
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,650
so clever and unique.

354
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,500
A sheep skull

355
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,380
has such stories behind it,

356
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,140
making our gift seem

357
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,260
less refined.

358
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,890
Ancients called the red coral "red gold".

359
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:46,980
It's rare for common families,

360
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,860
and even for

361
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,500
noble clans too.

362
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:54,020
Xiulan, see how Jingxiu
and Danling care for you.

363
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,980
You're thoughtful indeed.

364
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,260
My husband and I

365
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,530
are not good with words,

366
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,020
but we wanted to find the best thing

367
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,570
to celebrate your birthday.

368
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,170
Servant, take it away.

369
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,140
It's been so long.

370
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,530
Why haven't Jingming and his wife arrived?

371
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,380
Speaking of which,

372
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,020
it's your daughter-in-law's first time

373
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,810
to attend such a grand feast, right?

374
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,460
You can't hide away

375
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,740
what Jiangli gives you.

376
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:24,100
You must bring it out

377
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,290
and let us

378
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,340
have a look.

379
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,530
Of course, Jingyi.

380
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,570
Grateful for your concern, Lady Wang.

381
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:38,690
Your son, Lu Jingming,

382
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,260
Your daughter-in-law, Shen Jiangli,

383
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,810
wish you longevity

384
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,020
and happiness.

385
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,020
Good.

386
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:47,650
Father.

387
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,260
Jiangli?

388
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,020
That's Jiangli?

389
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,140
Sister Jiangli looks

390
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,860
even more spirited than the day

391
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,930
we met on the street.

392
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,810
They must live a happy life.

393
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,100
Mother,

394
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,740
this is the birthday gift

395
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,740
Jiangli prepared for you.

396
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,050
Isn't this just an ordinary embroidery?

397
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,530
I bet Jiangli has something else to give.

398
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,530
The sincerity matters most.

399
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,020
This gift

400
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,700
well represents my heartfelt wishes

401
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:19,940
and my utmost respect for Lady Shu.

402
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:21,660
Jiangli,

403
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:24,260
it's your mother-in-law's birthday.

404
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:26,500
How can you be so careless?

405
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:27,740
But Xiulan

406
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,500
is not someone to fuss over this.

407
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,610
It's the thought that counts.

408
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,570
Lady Shu has seen much.

409
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,330
She won't mind it.

410
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:39,890
Jingming,

411
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,460
why?

412
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,640
Did you spent all money on ores,

413
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:46,160
so the gift is so shabby?

414
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:48,050
If there's any trouble,

415
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,050
feel free to tell me.

416
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,260
I can lend you a hand,

417
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,530
so you wouldn't buy such a plain gift,

418
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,660
letting Lady Shu lose face

419
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,500
and disgracing our Lu Family.

420
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,530
Jingxiu, stop joking.

421
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,420
Actually, the gift...

422
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,500
I think Jiangli

423
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,340
has really done her best.

424
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:10,290
Everyone knows

425
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:11,610
Jiangli

426
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:12,940
just back from the ancestral tomb.

427
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,230
Giving this embroidery

428
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,940
was already her best effort.

429
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,810
Today is Lady Shu's birthday.

430
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,580
I don't want to argue with you

431
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,700
and disrupt the guests' enjoyment.

432
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,940
I advise you not to ask for trouble.

433
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,370
Jiangli, that's all you've got?

434
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,750
You're embarrassing yourself.

435
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,660
If you truly want to show sincerity,

436
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,940
you might as well

437
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,660
write 1,000 longevity characters.

438
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,260
It's also my fault

439
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,980
that I didn't remind her earlier.

440
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,370
Danling's words are really sharp.

441
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,500
But Jiangli's

442
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,660
embroidery seems shabby.

443
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,180
She might be at a disadvantage this time.

444
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,420
Thank you.

445
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:57,740
Servant,

446
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:58,980
take it away.

447
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,540
Lady Shu,

448
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,050
may I take a look

449
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,420
at this embroidery?

450
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,050
Go ahead.

451
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:16,970
Yao,

452
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,130
take a good look

453
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,050
and comment on the embroidery skills.

454
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,130
Jiangli,

455
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,810
how long have you practiced this?

456
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,130
Not long.

457
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,370
No need to belittle yourself.

458
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,290
You're clearly hiding your true skills.

459
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,370
Yao,

460
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,450
you have such a kind heart.

461
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,850
Jiangli,

462
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,290
Yao is trying to save your face.

463
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,570
Remember her kindness.

464
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,610
I wasn't.

465
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,660
I just spoke the truth.

466
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,290
This embroidery piece

467
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,980
is indeed a rare treasure.

468
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:09,530
This is...

469
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:11,500
Lady Shu,

470
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,810
this is the long-lost
double-sided embroidery.

471
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,050
Double-sided embroidery?

472
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:17,770
If the red coral

473
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,500
from the South Sea is priceless,

474
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,290
then this embroidery

475
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,050
is filled with deep sincerity.

476
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,700
Why is it filled with sincerity?

477
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,050
Yao,

478
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,020
you must be exaggerating.

479
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,770
You have keen eyes.

480
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,370
This gift is indeed

481
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,310
double-sided embroidery.

482
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,370
The double-sided embroidery

483
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,660
starts with sketching

484
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,570
design on the fabric,

485
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,260
then using threads

486
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,420
to outline a contour.

487
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,020
On the reverse side, the other

488
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,020
pattern is embroidered

489
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,090
with opposite structure.

490
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,940
The whole embroidery process

491
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,810
is extremely complex.

492
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,850
Each stitch demands precision

493
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,090
to ensure both sides

494
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,530
are exquisitely patterned

495
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,180
without damaging the other.

496
00:20:58,810 --> 00:20:59,650
Therefore,

497
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,420
Jiangli prepared this gift for you,

498
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,180
showing her deep care.

499
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,500
Lady Shu,

500
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,850
the embroidery I presented

501
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,570
has auspicious clouds and cranes on one side

502
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,130
and blooming begonias on the other.

503
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,020
The auspicious clouds and cranes

504
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,260
symbolize longevity and fortune,

505
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,980
while the begonias

506
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,460
represent nobility and elegance.

507
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,290
And the begonia flower

508
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,290
also carries the honor of Flower Consort,

509
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,660
perfectly matching

510
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,810
Lady Shu.

511
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,700
Begonias are known as the queen of flowers,

512
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,980
truly a national beauty.

513
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,260
Jiangli, you're so thoughtful.

514
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,700
No wonder Jiangli

515
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,770
and Jingming are a couple.

516
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,020
They always act low-key,

517
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,420
unlike some people

518
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:41,940
who make a big fuss

519
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,610
over small things.

520
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,900
Jiangli,

521
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:52,130
you truly have skillful hands.

522
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,850
I'm flattered.

523
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,860
Mother,

524
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,130
Jiangli's hands were pricked many times

525
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,100
while

526
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,050
embroidering this gift for you.

527
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,460
Jiangli is such a devoted child.

528
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,130
My teachings weren't in vain.

529
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:12,450
Servant,

530
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,130
bring out my bottle of Hundred Flower Dew

531
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,570
and reward it to Jiangli.

532
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,530
Thank you, Lady Shu.

533
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,660
Alright, everyone, take your seats.

534
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,020
Brother,

535
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,980
red coral of the South Sea,

536
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,420
quite a generous gift.

537
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,290
It must have cost lots of money.

538
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,580
Indeed.

539
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,660
Been to the South Sea?

540
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,520
No.

541
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:41,810
It must be quite expensive.

542
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,420
What's there to be proud of?

543
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,370
You humble people

544
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:46,940
always looking for shortcuts.

545
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:14,650
Father.

546
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,100
Very well.

547
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,370
Reward them.

548
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,130
Thank you, Prefect.

549
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,330
Today is Consort Shu's birthday.

550
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:00,170
Come on,

551
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,330
let's raise our glasses together.

552
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,300
Consort Shu.

553
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,770
As the saying goes,

554
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,260
"Dragon begets nine sons,

555
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:29,940
each different in their own way."

556
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,900
(Wang Chengyun, Great General)

557
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,090
Master Jingming is meticulous.

558
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,570
In my humble opinion,

559
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,130
he has the makings of greatness.

560
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,980
General Wang, you flatter me.

561
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:44,770
I just do what I can

562
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,130
to share

563
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,260
my father's burdens.

564
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,130
The Prefect's actions

565
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,610
have always been upright.

566
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:53,130
Lady Wang is esteemed.

567
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,370
Lady Shu is kind and gentle.

568
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:56,810
The Young Masters and Ladies

569
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,050
are courteous and decent,

570
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,530
beloved by the people of the city.

571
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:02,810
It's a pity though,

572
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:05,090
Consort Jiangli has lost her virtue.

573
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,980
She's been confined for years,

574
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,420
causing much gossip among the people.

575
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,050
I'm just worried that

576
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,740
it might affect

577
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,260
Master Jingming's reputation.

578
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,460
I've lived in the ancestral tomb for years,

579
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,740
devotedly honoring the Lu's ancestors,

580
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,530
praying day and night
for Prefect and Dongzhou.

581
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,260
If I had truly done something

582
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,610
that tarnishes my virtue,

583
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:31,260
how could I have sullied the ancestors?

584
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:35,940
Such a silken tongue.

585
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,460
But recently,

586
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,460
I heard that

587
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,940
Lord Shen's brother-in-law was

588
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:43,770
involved in the Salt and Iron Money scandal,

589
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:46,260
causing quite a stir.

590
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,900
Well, improper family conduct can bring

591
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,130
disaster to future generations.

592
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,460
I was thinking,

593
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,460
Lord Shen, you and your brother-in-law

594
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,770
are very close.

595
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,500
I wonder if you

596
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,020
were aware of the embezzlement.

597
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,330
It's none of my business.

598
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,740
I know nothing about it.

599
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:07,940
General Wang,

600
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,610
the Censorate

601
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,700
will handle this matter.

602
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:14,370
I trust they'll uncover the truth.

603
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,850
Why are you blaming

604
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,810
my father-in-law?

605
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:21,740
I merely thought

606
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,700
that Lord Shen, as kin,

607
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,290
should know more.

608
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,420
So I took this chance

609
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,420
to inquire further.

610
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:35,650
General Wang,

611
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:37,090
the lineages in Dongzhou

612
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,090
are interconnected.

613
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,700
Our Lu Family and Dongzhou's people

614
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,660
are like one family.

615
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,420
If, as you just said,

616
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:48,420
all clans are to be held accountable,

617
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,180
then my family can't escape blame either.

618
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:52,710
Indeed,

619
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,020
Jingming is right.

620
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,810
Dongzhou City is one family.

621
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:57,130
Technically,

622
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:59,260
my daughter and your daughter

623
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,940
are sisters-in-law,

624
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:02,130
which makes us kin too.

625
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,580
Father.

626
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:05,650
Father,

627
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,610
I remember you once said,

628
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,500
"To govern, be perceptive.

629
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,570
Treat people like kids.

630
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,700
Avoid collective punishment."

631
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,260
Is that right, Father?

632
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,130
Treat people like kids.

633
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,420
Well said.

634
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:20,900
General Wang,

635
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:23,460
you just said, "Dragon begets nine sons."

636
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,050
I think

637
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,660
it's quite true.

638
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,610
Jingming's temperament

639
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,420
is quite similar to mine.

640
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:52,370
Father,

641
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,980
just now, General Wang caused trouble,

642
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,740
and Master Jingming defended you.

643
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,180
You should thank him and my sister.

644
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:00,700
Alright.

645
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,860
Alright.

646
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:10,370
Master Jingming, Consort Jiangli,

647
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:13,610
Father always says

648
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:14,810
he wishes to meet with you.

649
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:17,090
Today is a perfect opportunity.

650
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,740
That old fellow just now

651
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,370
was truly crossing the line.

652
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,500
Jingming, thank you

653
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,610
for standing up for me.

654
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,130
Having my daughter marry you

655
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,660
is truly a blessing for the Shen Family.

656
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,300
You,

657
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,420
take good care of my son-in-law,

658
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,940
and soon bring an heir

659
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,540
to his mansion.

660
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:41,260
Today, I truly feel vindicated.

661
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,170
Jiangli,

662
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,180
if only you were sensible earlier,

663
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,050
our family would have been blessed sooner.

664
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,520
Well, well,

665
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,090
it's not too late for you

666
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,050
to honor me now.

667
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:54,610
Father.

668
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:58,020
Now you care for me, do you?

669
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,900
How dare you speak to me like that?

670
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,100
Father,

671
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,660
we're family,

672
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,700
and we both know

673
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,130
as long as appearances are kept,

674
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,500
we'll live our own lives in private.

675
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:09,700
You ungrateful girl,

676
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,500
how dare you speak such rebellious words!

677
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,260
A kind father has filial children.

678
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:14,810
Without a kind father,

679
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,260
how can kids learn to be filial?

680
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,100
Jiangli,

681
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:19,260
Father was drunk.

682
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,290
Please don't mind.

683
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:21,860
Never mind.

684
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,740
Enjoy your meal.

685
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:25,570
I'll take a walk outside.

686
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,500
How dare she!

687
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:36,460
Does she think marrying Jingming

688
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,700
lets her deny I'm her father?

689
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,860
Father.

690
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:44,530
Sorry about this.

691
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:55,660
I'm furious!

692
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:57,610
You shouldn't treat Jiangli like that,

693
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:58,940
especially before Jingming.

694
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:01,460
What happened?

695
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,530
I don't know.

696
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,050
That ungrateful girl.

697
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:07,730
Father,

698
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,370
it's not my sister's fault.

699
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:11,370
You disowned her back then.

700
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,970
She's trapped in ancestral tomb for ages.

701
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,850
You ordered us not to visit her.

702
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:15,980
It's natural that our

703
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,130
relationship grew distant.

704
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,130
In the future,

705
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:20,050
you should care more for Jiangli.

706
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:21,500
And Father,

707
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,700
what you said to Jingming...

708
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,700
Stop talking.

709
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:28,660
Mother,

710
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,260
happy birthday to you.

711
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:31,420
Thank you, sweetie.

712
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,310
Mother,

713
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,810
today the gifts from my brothers

714
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,290
are all quite unique.

715
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,090
However,

716
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:46,500
I still prefer

717
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,180
Jiangli's double-sided embroidery.

718
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,780
Mother,

719
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,850
seeing how capable Jiangli is,

720
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,260
let's forget past issues.

721
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:56,740
Do you think I'm only upset

722
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,020
about what happened back then?

723
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,370
If it weren't for her,

724
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:01,130
Jingming would have been with Danling,

725
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,770
and General Wang would have been on our side.

726
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,500
Jingming wouldn't need to be cautious,

727
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,130
and I wouldn't have to live in fear.

728
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:10,900
How can I not hold a grudge?

729
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,060
Mother,

730
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,370
I feel Jingming

731
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:16,810
- truly cares for her.
- Alright,

732
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:18,900
today is my birthday.

733
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,290
Say something to make me happy.

734
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,730
Father, Mother,

735
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:28,690
Lady Shu,

736
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,570
I'll take my leave.

737
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,740
Father,

738
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,020
I'm going for some air.

739
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,820
Ming,

740
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:56,780
it's been a long time

741
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:58,810
since I last called you that.

742
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:01,660
Although I married Jingxiu,

743
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,980
you have always

744
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,940
been in my heart.

745
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,540
My Lady,

746
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,420
I just saw Consort Danling
and Master Jingming

747
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:16,410
in the back garden.

748
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,540
I see. You may leave.

749
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,610
Wang Danling,

750
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,130
are you plotting against me again?

751
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,660
Today,

752
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:35,530
I'll settle all scores with you.

753
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:38,970
Young Master,

754
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,050
reports from Xizhou say

755
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,500
unfamiliar faces have intruded.

756
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,980
Their origins are unclear.

757
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,770
Send our people to monitor them.

758
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,740
Inform me of

759
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,130
any changes.

760
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:49,170
Understood.

761
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,210
Young Master.

762
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,260
Qilan.

763
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,660
Young Master,

764
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,850
is something troubling you?

765
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:11,940
Seeing you,

766
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,940
all my troubles disappear.

767
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,100
Young Master.

768
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,260
At today's banquet,

769
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:38,090
I noticed how much Jiangli has changed.

770
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:40,530
I was thinking,

771
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,420
since she is so calm now.

772
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,180
Over these five years,

773
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:45,700
she must have suffered a lot.

774
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,700
But

775
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:49,420
I have a question in mind.

776
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,290
Why does Consort Danling

777
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:53,180
push my sister so hard,

778
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,980
always opposing her?

779
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:57,930
She's

780
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,050
more of a hindrance than a help.

781
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:02,610
If she weren't

782
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:03,770
General Wang's daughter,

783
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:06,050
how could I have tolerated her until now?

784
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,500
To get the Qilin Guards,

785
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,050
I need General Wang's support.

786
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,460
Danling is quite jealous,

787
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,860
and she's the apple of the general's eye.

788
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,220
The Gerneral's always got her back.

789
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:18,570
Today,

790
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,940
by praising Lu Jingming,

791
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:23,900
he's sending me a message.

792
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:28,410
Qilan,

793
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,530
once I get the Qilin Guards,

794
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,940
I'll definitely take you into my mansion

795
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,650
as a secondary consort.

796
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,250
I'm more than content

797
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:41,300
only if you think that way.

798
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,610
I only wish you to be

799
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,570
free of worries.

800
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,620
Ming.

801
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,620
Ming,

802
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,820
I know,

803
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,860
you had no choice

804
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,250
being with Shen Jiangli.

805
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,250
If it weren't for her,

806
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:03,020
I should be by your side.

807
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,420
Your coldness towards me

808
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,380
is to protect me.

809
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,220
Wang Danling,

810
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,820
I respect you as my sister-in-law,

811
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,610
so I've been so tolerant.

812
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:14,530
But

813
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:15,650
if you continue to

814
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:16,570
cross the lines,

815
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:18,420
I won't be so lenient anymore.

816
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:19,890
Also,

817
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:20,940
when we were young,

818
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,130
I saw you as a sister.

819
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,170
My relationship with Shen Jiangli

820
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,380
is none of your business.

821
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:29,130
If you keep troubling her,

822
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:31,170
don't blame me for being harsh.

823
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:34,410
Jingming,

824
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:35,530
Danling,

825
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:36,980
what are you doing here?

826
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:38,530
Don't get me wrong.

827
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,900
Earlier

828
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:40,970
a familiar maid

829
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:42,730
told me Qingqing fell in the water,

830
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,050
so I hurried over.

831
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,380
Yeah, Jiangli.

832
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,050
Nothing has

833
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:50,820
happened between

834
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,980
Ming... Jingming and me.

835
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:54,860
Don't overthink it.

836
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,780
I trust you.

837
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,900
It's dark and windy here.

838
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,340
Let's head back.

839
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:03,490
Wait for me a moment.

840
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:06,020
I have some words

841
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,530
to say to Danling.

842
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,170
Are you sure

843
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,050
you don't need me here with you?

844
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,780
This is the Prefect's Mansion,

845
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,050
there won't be any danger.

846
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,140
Don't worry.

847
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:22,530
Alright.

848
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:24,900
But if anyone here

849
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,740
wants to harm you,

850
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,090
I won't let them go.

851
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,130
People in the city say

852
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:41,570
that Jiangli has changed a lot.

853
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,050
Seeing her today,

854
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,250
I feel like she's a different person.

855
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:46,890
Yao,

856
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,300
why do you think that's so?

857
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:52,090
Dealing with cunning people everyday,

858
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:53,460
if it were me,

859
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:54,940
I'd change too.

860
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,730
Yao, what do you mean?

861
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,300
You really know nothing, huh?

862
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,130
Go back to the banquet.

863
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,380
He's already left.

864
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:27,890
Stop pretending.

865
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,500
Why keep deceiving yourself?

866
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,820
Ming and I grew up together.

867
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,780
Our bond is unique.

868
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,780
You're the one deceiving yourself.

869
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,250
You don't have much

870
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,130
affection for either

871
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:42,820
Jingxiu or Jingming.

872
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:44,420
All you want

873
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:46,340
is the title of Prefect's Wife.

874
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,650
You're right.

875
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,020
That's exactly what I want.

876
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:53,500
My father has renowned achievements.

877
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,170
My mother's from a family of civil officials.

878
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,860
Whoever I marry should be the Prefect.

879
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,570
I was born noble.

880
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,860
The position of Prefect's Wife
should be mine.

881
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:07,860
With your background,

882
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,210
how dare you compete with me?

883
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,780
You should stay in ancestral tomb
