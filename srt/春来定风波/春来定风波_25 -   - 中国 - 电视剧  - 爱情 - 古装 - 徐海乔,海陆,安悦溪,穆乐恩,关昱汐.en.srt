22
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,720
Master Jingming.

23
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:48,830
Please sit.

24
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,350
Has there been any progress?

25
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,550
My men just sent word.

26
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,150
That lieutenant confessed.

27
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,600
Everything was under Wen Du's orders.

28
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,900
He also revealed

29
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,690
the person from Dongzhou involved was...

30
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,820
Was it Jingxiu?

31
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,880
My men

32
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,670
have captured Wen Du.

33
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,190
After three days
of sleepless interrogation,

34
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,660
he finally confessed.

35
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,840
The constant battles at the border
between the two states

36
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,000
were deliberately provoked
by him and Lu Jingxiu.

37
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,440
At the same time,

38
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,880
they spread rumors on both sides.

39
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,520
The information I received in Xizhou

40
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,160
said Dongzhou kept invading

41
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,120
and even tried to cross the border.

42
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,160
But what my men found was

43
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,750
that Xizhou soldiers

44
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,120
often sneaked into border villages

45
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,470
to harass

46
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,350
the villagers.

47
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,280
According to Wen Du's confession,

48
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,510
he always exaggerated

49
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,880
the military situation

50
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,310
in order to obtain

51
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,000
a large amount of military funds.

52
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,560
But in truth,

53
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,070
they only stationed troops to posture.

54
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,030
Each time, only a few hundred soldiers
were deployed

55
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,400
to create a false sense of war.

56
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,000
Yet the two of them

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,440
kept rising in military merit

58
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,040
in both Dongzhou and Xizhou.

59
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,820
What about the military funds?

60
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,440
I reviewed Wen Du's background.

61
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,910
He indeed purchased properties

62
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,170
across various parts of Xizhou,

63
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,940
and they were lavishly decorated.

64
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,790
After calculating,

65
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,790
he embezzled no less

66
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,750
than ten million taels of silver.

67
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,320
Wen Du did it for profit.

68
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,630
But what about Jingxiu?

69
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,720
As the lineal eldest son of the Prefect,

70
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,350
he has no need for such things.

71
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,750
So what did he do

72
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,700
with all that military funds?

73
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,000
Well,

74
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,000
Wen Du didn't know that.

75
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,440
Did Wen Du confess

76
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,960
whether it was Jingxiu

77
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,630
who leaked

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,880
my troop movement and route

79
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,400
to him back then?

80
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,560
You can tell me the truth.

81
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,560
Lu Jingxiu ordered Wen Du

82
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,950
to wipe them all out

83
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,240
and to leave no one alive.

84
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,440
Master Jingming...

85
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,080
I had already guessed it before,

86
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,790
but I didn't dare believe it,

87
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,870
nor did I want to.

88
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,910
Though Jingxiu
has always been competitive,

89
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,110
we are still brothers.

90
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,670
I never thought

91
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,120
he would

92
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,670
wish to see me dead.

93
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,400
So, what should we do next?

94
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,430
We must find out

95
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,800
what Jingxiu did

96
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,640
with the Dongzhou military funds.

97
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,310
I know

98
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,960
what happened back then

99
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,790
is a heavy blow to you.

100
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,080
But now is the most critical time.

101
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,760
If there's anything you wish to say,

102
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,720
you can tell me.

103
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,840
I'm not only your ally

104
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,520
but also your friend.

105
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,280
Rest assured, Your Grace.

106
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,760
I'm fine.

107
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,750
Go find out

108
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,110
why no word has come from Xizhou lately.

109
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,560
Young Master,

110
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,960
everything is proceeding as planned.

111
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,350
It's only a matter of time.

112
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,430
Please be patient.

113
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:23,950
Go.

114
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,430
Pressure them a little bit.

115
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,880
Yes.

116
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,550
Jiangli, I'll head back now.

117
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,970
Has the consort had lunch yet?

118
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,680
Not yet.

119
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,920
What's wrong?

120
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,190
Master Jingming,

121
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,520
you'd better ask her yourself.

122
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,470
Are you practicing some new skills?

123
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,080
You can read books upside down now?

124
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,720
You haven't even had lunch.

125
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,760
Is something troubling you?

126
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,000
Yes.

127
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,360
What about you?

128
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,080
Did you have lunch

129
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,200
with the princess?

130
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,840
We were talking,
and then it was mealtime,

131
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,350
so we had lunch together.

132
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,760
Do you know why the princess

133
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,200
wants to stay in Dongzhou?

134
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,640
Yes.

135
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,070
I heard from Mother

136
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,160
that she wants to find
a husband in Dongzhou.

137
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,870
Don't you think

138
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,470
she has a soft spot for you

139
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,760
and often hangs out with you?

140
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,760
What does she want from you?

141
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,040
Don't worry.

142
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,790
The princess and I

143
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,760
have indeed interacted more lately,

144
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:03,930
but what we discuss

145
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,830
is purely military affairs
between the states,

146
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,520
nothing more.

147
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,800
But don't you feel

148
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,550
she only wants to get close to you?

149
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,040
You've met twice,

150
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,160
but I didn't know what you talked about.

151
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,550
It was always just the two of you.

152
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,990
I was inconsiderate.

153
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,550
Forgive me for making you uneasy.

154
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,310
Today,

155
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,840
the princess and I discussed

156
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,600
matters about the border
between the states.

157
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,110
This matter

158
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,400
involves many parties.

159
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,280
Besides, I was worried

160
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,110
you might be drawn into danger,

161
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,960
so I didn't tell you.

162
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,520
But between the princess and me,

163
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,060
there is no personal affection.

164
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,430
If I've done anything

165
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,640
to make you misunderstand,

166
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,430
I offer my apology here.

167
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,350
I overthought it.

168
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,040
Your overthinking

169
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,640
means you hold me in your heart.

170
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,040
I should be happy about it.

171
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,910
So,

172
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,330
what do you plan to do next?

173
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,440
Lately,

174
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,070
we've discovered

175
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:05,910
that in recent years,

176
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,200
the military funds of both states

177
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,720
have all ended up in private hands.

178
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,790
Xizhou's funds

179
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,230
were embezzled by Wen Du.

180
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,720
As for Dongzhou's,

181
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,040
we don't know for now.

182
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,910
We have to trace where they went

183
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,430
to figure out the true intentions

184
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,910
behind all this.

185
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,110
Wind Pavilion

186
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,910
can help you with that.

187
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,550
It has branches all over the land

188
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,180
and hides among the common folk.

189
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,190
I believe they can uncover some clues

190
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,040
without letting word leak out.

191
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,240
If we use your men to investigate,

192
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,550
it would be too conspicuous.

193
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,710
Then I'll have to trouble

194
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,550
my consort.

195
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,270
Come here.

196
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,160
You didn't even eat lunch today.

197
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,760
Let me accompany you to eat later.

198
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,000
Your Grace.

199
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,830
I noticed
that while Lu Jingxiu's mansion

200
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,190
is elegant in design,

201
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,080
most of it is built with craftsmanship.

202
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,340
It may have cost a fortune,

203
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,000
but the interior decorations

204
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,070
seem fairly common.

205
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,120
Is there truly

206
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,830
nothing suspicious?

207
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,960
Your Grace,

208
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,280
nothing unusual was found.

209
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,200
Alright, I understand.

210
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,360
You may leave.

211
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,390
Yes.

212
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,300
(Liuyun Post House)
Your Grace,

213
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,490
how have you found your stay

214
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,850
at the post house these past days?

215
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:34,640
Speaking of which,

216
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,790
I haven't formally thanked you yet.

217
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,520
You came to Dongzhou.

218
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,040
As the Prefect's lineal eldest son,

219
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,590
of course, I should entertain you.

220
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,950
I had my servants prepare

221
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,880
a few rare treasures from Dongzhou.

222
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,550
Please enjoy them.

223
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,950
I've always loved these local things.

224
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,080
Is this an inkstone?

225
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,630
Young Master.

226
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,550
Young Master.

227
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,720
The flowers the princess praised today

228
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,280
have been delivered to the post house.

229
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,390
Did she accept them?

230
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,280
Of course.

231
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,950
She said she'd invite you
to the post house soon.

232
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,390
Good.

233
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,150
However,

234
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,480
the princess used

235
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,040
to hang out with Master Jingming.

236
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,000
Now, she's approaching you...

237
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,670
Is there something she wants?

238
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,950
There certainly is.

239
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,910
Princess Chuya is a wise woman.

240
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,440
If she's to choose a husband,

241
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,550
she must consider her status.

242
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,310
Jingming already has a consort.

243
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,160
But I don't.

244
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,590
Since I don't have a consort,

245
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,670
how could I not be her perfect choice?

246
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,550
I believe the princess

247
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,280
has a long-term vision.

248
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,430
Indeed, Young Master.

249
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,520
Jinchuan,

250
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,960
in the coming days,

251
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,390
send more items girls like

252
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,480
to the post house.

253
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,190
If I can marry the princess

254
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,360
and gain the power of Xizhou,

255
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,760
the things we want

256
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,280
will be within reach.

257
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,940
(Master Jingming's Mansion)

258
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,530
Jiangli, the Pavilion replied.

259
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,150
Look.

260
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,550
Take a look.

261
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,780
(All the military funds flowed
into Jinsheng Bank.)

262
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,310
Jinsheng Bank

263
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,240
is funding mountain bandits?

264
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,220
These past few years,

265
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,160
Jinsheng Bank has been

266
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,000
receiving money from the border,

267
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,990
but the money went
to several bandit groups.

268
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,160
Have you heard of bandits

269
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,640
causing trouble in Dongzhou?

270
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:06,830
In Dongzhou,

271
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,880
bandits rob travelers occasionally,

272
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,740
but they're never a serious threat.

273
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,760
Each region can handle them on its own.

274
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,530
There's no need for the Prefect
to send reinforcements.

275
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
Besides,

276
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,880
there are only a few bandits.

277
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,510
If they had tens of millions of taels
of silver behind them,

278
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,710
why would they become bandits?

279
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,100
But what if these so-called bandits

280
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,670
aren't really bandits at all?

281
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,830
Are you suggesting

282
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
the money

283
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,910
did go to them,

284
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,760
but they're not

285
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,360
bandits?

286
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,710
If that's true,

287
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,150
this must be

288
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,480
very dangerous.

289
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,580
If you want to get to the bottom of it,

290
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,790
you must be very careful.

291
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,360
Got it.

292
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,240
Don't worry.

293
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,590
I'll be careful.

294
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,030
(Ride with Wind)
Lately, I've been swamped.

295
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,710
If Lady Wang hadn't reminded me,

296
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,950
I'd have forgotten

297
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,400
it's been a while
since we dined together.

298
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,880
You work tirelessly for the people.

299
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,040
I can only handle these small matters

300
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,710
so you can enjoy a moment of rest.

301
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,880
Since Lady Wang arranged
this family dinner,

302
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,070
why isn't Master Jingxiu here?

303
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,830
- Jingxiu, he...
- Princess Chuya is here.

304
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,360
Greetings, My Lord.

305
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,070
Greetings, ladies.

306
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,120
You three came together?

307
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,240
Take a seat.

308
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,440
Father,

309
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,080
Jingxiu said the Golden Guards

310
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,120
had urgent business today,

311
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,300
so he won't be joining us.

312
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,980
Alright, have a seat.

313
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,120
Come on, let's drink.

314
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,160
Princess Chuya,

315
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,720
are you enjoying your time
in Dongzhou?

316
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,310
The princess has been resting
at the post house these days.

317
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,950
Jingxiu was worried
she might miss her homeland,

318
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,670
so he asked me and Yao

319
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,560
to take her horseback riding
outside the city.

320
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,080
That's right.

321
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,430
Princess Chuya is free-spirited.

322
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,040
We got along very well.

323
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,120
What a surprise that Princess Chuya

324
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,160
got along so well with Jingxiu.

325
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,280
Master Jingxiu was
thoughtful and attentive.

326
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,790
I had a great time.

327
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,070
By the way, Chuya,

328
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,360
you said you wanted to find a husband.

329
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,480
How is that going now?

330
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,040
I wonder if any of the men in Dongzhou

331
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,760
have caught your eye.

332
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,830
Actually,

333
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,640
I already have someone I like.

334
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,590
Which gentleman might that be?

335
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,430
Isn't it obvious?

336
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,430
I heard that lately,

337
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,760
Chuya has been hanging out
with Jingxiu.

338
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,590
I suppose those two

339
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,950
are fond of each other.

340
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,950
I greatly admire Master Jingxiu,

341
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,040
but the one I wish to marry

342
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,040
is Master Jingming.

343
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,070
Your Grace, are you sure?

344
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,400
Jingming already has a consort.

345
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,120
Yes.

346
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,760
Jingming already has a consort.

347
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,040
We can't let you share your husband.

348
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,000
Years ago,

349
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,790
I wandered to the border for fun

350
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,640
and ran into danger.

351
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,070
I was saved by a young general.

352
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,440
Though I didn't know his name,

353
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,670
I searched for him for many years.

354
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,590
It wasn't until I came to Dongzhou

355
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,830
that I discovered the one who saved me

356
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,430
was Master Jingming.

357
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,880
So, now I am certain

358
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,200
that he is the man

359
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,790
I want to marry.

360
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,190
What a surprise there was such a history

361
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,640
between Jingming and Chuya.

362
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,280
But recently, I heard

363
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,070
you often hang out with Jingxiu.

364
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,120
I see Master Jingxiu as a friend,

365
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,070
but I don't like him.

366
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,160
If that led to a misunderstanding,

367
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,590
then I sincerely apologize.

368
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,040
Your Grace, there's no need.

369
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,310
Thank you for your kind affection.

370
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,880
But I

371
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,240
already have a consort.

372
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,200
Come here.

373
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,040
I once promised her

374
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,860
she'd be my only one in this life.

375
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,320
So, I must decline

376
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,830
your kind intentions.

377
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,550
I don't care about the title.

378
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,240
You may not mind,

379
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,710
but I do.

380
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,160
My wife and I

381
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,640
have been

382
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,040
through so much together.

383
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,240
Our bond runs deep.

384
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,040
The two of us

385
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,190
cannot allow

386
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,640
anyone else to come between us.

387
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,790
Your Grace, I hope you can understand.

388
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,360
Your Grace,

389
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,200
ever since I met you,

390
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,710
I've admired your grace

391
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:54,880
and free spirit.

392
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,590
But as Jingming said,

393
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,430
we're devoted

394
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,520
to each other

395
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,360
in this life.

396
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,240
Your Grace, please understand.

397
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,400
I can't

398
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,390
share my husband with you.

399
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,590
With your status and charm,

400
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,440
you'll surely find someone
who cherishes you.

401
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,080
Chuya,

402
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,550
Dongzhou has thousands
of fine young men.

403
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,440
Jingming isn't fortunate enough.

404
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,390
Take your time.

405
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,240
You'll find the one who you like.

406
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,830
Since Master Jingming isn't interested,

407
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,760
I won't insist.

408
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,720
I merely answered truthfully

409
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,240
to the Prefect's question today.

410
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,920
Master Jingming, Consort Jiangli,

411
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,170
please don't take it to heart.

412
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,620
Your Grace, rest assured.

413
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,670
We won't.

414
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,320
Your Grace.

415
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,200
I'd like to speak with the princess.

416
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,280
Understood.

417
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,320
Don't take too long.

418
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,790
I'll wait for you over there.

419
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,830
Your Grace,

420
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,910
I'll leave you two to talk.

421
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,950
Your Grace,

422
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,790
there's something I'd like to say.

423
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:25,920
Consort Jiangli,

424
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,440
what would you like to tell me?

425
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,550
I truly admire

426
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,240
your honesty and straightforwardness.

427
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,920
You know exactly what you want,

428
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,310
and you're willing

429
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,150
to work for it.

430
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,540
That's something I respect.

431
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,870
You're not angry that I wish to marry

432
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,200
Master Jingming?

433
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,840
No.

434
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,870
Because I know your character.

435
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,720
Whatever you do,

436
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,440
you'll always speak openly.

437
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,870
You won't harm others in secret,

438
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,680
nor use your status to oppress them.

439
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,310
That's why I also want
to be open with you.

440
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,720
I believe

441
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,350
Jingming wouldn't have agreed

442
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,350
because I'm confident in our love.

443
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,790
I know

444
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,550
you wouldn't cling too tightly.

445
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,040
But I'm sure you'll feel bad about it.

446
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,830
You're right.

447
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,630
Five years ago, in a moment of crisis,

448
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,480
a bright and gallant
young general saved me.

449
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,150
His image

450
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,000
has stayed with me ever since.

451
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,790
I don't know

452
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,310
what kind of life he's lived
these five years.

453
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,240
But when I like someone,

454
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,350
I say it bravely.

455
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,520
Yet I saw the love between you two.

456
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,040
I could never

457
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,920
steal someone else's beloved.

458
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,120
Your Grace,

459
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,830
you'll definitely find a man

460
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,030
who has only you

461
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:45,870
in his eyes

462
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:46,870
and heart.

463
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,750
He'll accept you,

464
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,590
cherish you,

465
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,470
and understand you.

466
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,630
He won't make you fight

467
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,310
for his attention among other women

468
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,440
and waste your life.

469
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,960
Your world

470
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,280
should be much broader

471
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,350
and much brighter.

472
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,830
I think I understand

473
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,920
why Master Jingming

474
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,150
only has eyes for you.

475
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,390
And in my heart,

476
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,280
there's only him.

477
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,680
Forget it.

478
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,040
I don't want to be the one
who comes between you.

479
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,150
To both of you,
I can only offer my blessings.

480
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,390
Thank you, Your Grace.

481
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,480
Young Master,

482
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,360
what's wrong?

483
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,440
Chuya...

484
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,350
It's okay

485
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,720
that she doesn't want to marry me.

486
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,030
But today,

487
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,490
she said in front of Father
that she wanted to marry Jingming.

488
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,150
What does she take me for?

489
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,510
Please calm down, Young Master.

490
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,150
I have urgent news.

491
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,560
What is it?

492
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,200
The scouts report

493
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,230
that some time ago,

494
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,550
Wind Pavilion

495
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,790
tracked down Jinsheng Bank.

496
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,390
What?

497
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,070
It's Lu Jingming.

498
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,200
It's Lu Jingming again.

499
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,760
He must've had someone investigate it.

500
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,440
Fine.

501
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,830
Lu Jingming, I can't let you live.

502
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,630
Get out!

503
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:18,670
Yes.

504
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,520
One!

505
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,710
Two!

506
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:30,910
One!

507
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,120
Two!

508
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,390
One!

509
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,600
Two!

510
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:35,910
One!

511
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,120
Two!

512
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,430
One!

513
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,630
Two!

514
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,840
One!

515
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,630
Hey, what's wrong?

516
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,120
Master Jingming.

517
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,440
Greetings, Master Jingming.

518
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,410
What happened to him?

519
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,880
It seems he fainted due to heatstroke.

520
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,100
Get a military physician here.

521
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,320
Master Jingming.

522
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,750
Master Jingming,

523
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,650
many soldiers have had
similar symptoms lately.

524
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,110
At first, I thought it was heatstroke,

525
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,870
but now it seems unlikely.

526
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,960
Forgive me for my limited knowledge.

527
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,960
The symptoms are severe.

528
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,200
If this continues,

529
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,350
some may die

530
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,150
from diarrhea.

531
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,680
Please, Master Jingming,

532
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,200
find someone who can help immediately.

533
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,560
Ask two men

534
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,150
to carry him to a shady spot.

535
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,360
Yes.

536
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,030
Go call Consort Jiangli.

537
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:34,910
Yes.

538
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,590
Where have you been lately?

539
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,630
When

540
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,150
did the symptoms start?

541
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,960
I think

542
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,720
it was three days ago.

543
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:05,000
I chased a thief to an abandoned temple

544
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,350
in the west of the city.

545
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,790
No one worships there anymore.

546
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,920
Only a few beggars live inside.

547
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,550
Rest for now.

548
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:19,740
How is he?

549
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,680
It's a plague.

550
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,440
We must quickly gather all soldiers

551
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,040
with shortness of breath, heavy phlegm,

552
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,030
and severe diarrhea.

553
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,590
Do not let them contact others again.

554
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,840
Go do this.

555
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:30,950
Yes.

556
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,000
To stop the spread,

557
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,790
we must cut off the source asap.

558
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,590
- Yunyi.
- Yes.

559
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,480
Check the whole camp.

560
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,550
Anyone showing symptoms

561
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,590
must be gathered

562
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,830
in this tent.

563
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,190
Yes.

564
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,070
Everyone,

565
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,000
pack up

566
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,830
and move to another tent for now.

567
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,310
Yes, Master Jingming.

568
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,980
Are you feeling better?

569
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,230
How are you?

570
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,630
Help me. Please save us.

571
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,040
Their condition is very serious.

572
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,110
It must have started

573
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,520
from this place.

574
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,310
Help...

575
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,310
Post notices across the city now:

576
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,760
Anyone infected must go

577
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,960
to the temple in the west
of the city for treatment.

578
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,040
Tell them not to stay home

579
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,680
and risk infecting their families.

580
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,040
Yes.

581
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,160
My Lord.

582
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,760
How is the situation?

583
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,150
Master Jingming has had everyone

584
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,680
within a ten-li radius of the temple

585
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,960
relocated elsewhere.

586
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,390
Infected citizens have also

587
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,160
started going to the temple voluntarily.

588
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,630
Now, Master Jingming leads the troops

589
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,260
and is tending the sick there every day.

590
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,170
Though Consort Jiangli

591
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,630
has not yet found a cure,

592
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,830
her medicines have eased the symptoms.

593
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,480
That's wonderful.

594
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,440
Go back and tell them

595
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,150
they've both worked hard lately.

596
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,830
Once the epidemic passes,

597
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,650
I'll reward them
and Qilin Guards handsomely.

598
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:22,670
Yes.

599
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,520
Father,

600
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,920
Jingming can't be everywhere at once.

601
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,240
Let me take Golden Guards

602
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,400
to assist him.

603
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,310
Just focus on your own duties

604
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,110
and handle the city patrols.

605
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:36,520
Yes.

606
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,040
Mr. Chu.

607
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,010
(Prefect's Mansion)

608
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:42,270
Are you going to the temple
to help Jingming and Jiangli?

609
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,310
I'd like to go too.

610
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,800
Your Grace,

611
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,350
this is very serious.

612
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,720
The risks are beyond measure.

613
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:48,990
Please return.

614
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,390
Mr. Chu,

615
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,960
as the princess of Dongzhou,

616
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,800
how can I sit idly by

617
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,240
at the Prefect's Mansion

618
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,440
while the people suffer?

619
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,960
It's only right I do what little I can.

620
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,000
But you don't know medicine.

621
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,240
What could you do there?

622
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,440
Jiangli has taken all her maids

623
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,390
to help boil medicine.

624
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,040
I may not understand medicine,

625
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,350
but I can help with that.

626
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,280
Even a little help matters.

627
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,520
Very well.

628
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,870
But remember:

629
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,550
If you feel any discomfort,

630
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,800
tell me immediately.

631
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,440
Don't worry, Mr. Chu.

632
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,520
I'll be careful.

633
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:27,880
Still no cure?

634
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,140
(Acupuncture and Moxibustion)

635
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:29,980
Not yet.

636
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,110
How is it at the temple?

637
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,720
Mr. Chu is watching over things there.

638
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,660
Everything is in order.

639
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,350
Let me help you search.

(Bian Que's Classic of Medicine)

641
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:55,960
Any leads?

642
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,720
Did you find anything useful?

643
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,900
Your Grace,

644
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,640
the epidemic is spreading
through the city.

645
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,790
It's best you don't go out.

646
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,080
Jiangli is right.

647
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,440
For your safety,

648
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,040
I suggest we send someone

649
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,790
to escort you back to Xizhou in advance.

650
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,920
No.

651
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,680
I cannot return at a time like this.

652
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,110
In the face of disaster,

653
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,840
we should work together.

654
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,740
The people here are
the people of four states.

655
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,590
I've sent a letter.

656
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,240
The best physicians from Xizhou

657
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,160
will come with medicine

658
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,680
to help us through this together.

659
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,960
Your Grace, you're truly admirable.

660
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,280
In that case,

661
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,550
on behalf of Dongzhou,

662
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,790
thank you, Your Grace.

663
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,590
I'll help you search.

664
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:49,960
Jiangli,

665
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,840
come here.

666
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,190
Look at this.

667
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,630
This description does match

668
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,790
the symptoms of this plague.

669
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,950
But

670
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,110
this book is very old.

671
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,960
We don't know
if the prescription will work.

672
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,590
In that case,

673
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,920
we'll have to test it on someone.

674
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,480
I'll test it on myself.

675
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:17,670
No.

676
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,280
You're the only one among us
who understands medicine.

677
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,920
If something happens to you,

678
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,480
we'd be lost.

679
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,730
Precisely because I'm a physician,

680
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,310
I can describe the effects

681
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,440
more accurately.

682
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,550
But if the prescription doesn't work,

683
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,070
you...

684
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,120
Jiangli,

685
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,590
tell us honestly.

686
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,930
What are the odds it'll work?

687
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,040
Less than 50%.

688
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Less than 50%...

689
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,630
Understood.

690
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,150
But don't worry.

691
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,870
I'll do my very best.

692
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,630
Master Jingming.

693
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,280
Sir, don't be afraid.

694
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,240
Young Master, let me.

695
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,180
It's okay. I've got him.

696
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,840
Take care of him.

697
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,110
Help us, please.

698
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,550
Why are you here in person?

699
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,820
Don't let Consort Jiangli know.

700
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,240
Bring this over there.

701
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,080
Yes.

702
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,550
Shen Jiangli, stay away from me.

703
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,080
What's going on?

704
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,720
Didn't you use my medicine pouch?

705
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,150
Yunyi,

706
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,550
what's happening?

707
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,320
My Lady...

708
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,520
Well...

709
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,070
My Lady, listen.

710
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,390
Master Jingming didn't take the pouch

711
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:57,440
you prepared for him today

712
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,350
and personally tended the patients.

713
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,350
I've already been infected.

714
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,830
Can I test the medicine now?

715
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,720
So, that's what you were planning.

716
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:12,240
What if these prescriptions don't work?

717
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,830
You can't take the risk anyway.

718
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,630
Dongzhou needs you,

719
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,830
and I need you even more.

720
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,440
If someone must test the medicine

721
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,440
for the sake of the people,

722
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,230
that person

723
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,070
has to be me.

724
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,360
You're awake.

725
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,200
Your fever's gone.

726
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,350
How do you feel now?

727
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,790
Much better.

728
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,650
It's thanks to your medicine.

729
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,590
You scared me to death.

730
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,110
You must never do that again.

731
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,150
Does this mean

732
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,280
the prescription worked?

733
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,770
I'll send someone right away

734
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,980
to prepare the medicine
according to the prescription.

735
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,760
Don't overwork yourself.

736
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,590
Only by protecting yourself

737
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,070
can you save more people.

738
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,320
I'll go now.

739
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,630
Father,

740
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:33,870
after taking the medicine,

741
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:34,830
the sick citizens

742
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,310
have greatly improved.

743
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,870
Some of the first to recover

744
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,000
are already tending the others.

745
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,560
Good.

746
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,150
That's wonderful.

747
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,320
Jingming,

748
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,390
I heard you tested the medicine
on yourself.

749
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,920
Your compassion for the people

750
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,870
is truly a blessing for Dongzhou.

751
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,590
As your father, I am deeply proud.

752
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,150
Father,

753
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,680
actually,

754
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,590
the greatest credit belongs to Jiangli.

755
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,340
She's been staying up day and night
making medicine.

756
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,550
I believe the epidemic
will soon be under control.

757
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,160
Jiangli

758
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,760
is truly my good daughter-in-law.

759
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,680
I must reward you both generously.

760
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,150
Thank you, Father.

761
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,480
Right now, our top priority

762
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,150
is to completely contain the outbreak.

763
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,280
Sure.

764
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:25,110
Lu Jingming.

765
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,550
Shen Jiangli...

766
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,350
In that case,

767
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:36,680
don't blame me for showing no mercy.

768
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,360
Jinchuan.

769
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,750
Yes.

770
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,630
Come here.

771
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:49,040
Think of a way

772
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,550
to stir up something bigger.

773
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,240
Go now.

774
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,120
Yes.

775
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,480
Take it over there.

776
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,320
Sure.

777
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,150
Who are you?

778
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:31,990
What are you doing?

779
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,880
I'm the coachman delivering medicine.

780
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,800
The medicine

781
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,030
arrived,

782
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,230
but no one came to receive it,

783
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,710
so I came in to find someone

784
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,650
to ask where to put it.

785
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,960
Leave it in the courtyard.

786
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,510
Got it.

787
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,230
Hang in there a bit longer.

788
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,540
The medicine is almost ready.

789
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,070
You should go get some rest.

790
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:10,910
I'll take over.

791
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,230
Jiangli, it's fine.

792
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,400
Just go rest.

793
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,630
If you collapse,

794
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,800
we'll be short on hands,

795
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,850
and it'll cause more chaos.

796
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,840
Go on.

797
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,280
Very well.

798
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,590
I'll take your place

799
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,800
in six hours.

800
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,440
Jiangli, call me if you need anything.

801
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,320
Okay.

802
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,800
Father.

803
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,510
Father, Father.

804
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,840
What's wrong, Father?

805
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,590
Wake up.

806
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,160
Father...

807
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,400
- Miss.
- Father...

808
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,240
My condolences.

809
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,760
It's you.

810
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,240
My father was getting better.

811
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:53,250
But after taking the medicine
you brought today,

812
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,620
his condition suddenly worsened.

813
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,800
And now he's...

814
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,360
Is the medicine too strong

815
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,230
for the patients?

816
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,360
This is already the third patient

817
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,550
to suddenly die today.

818
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,820
- It can't be.
- Father...

819
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,630
All the medicine was carefully prepared.

820
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,520
Those infected today showed

821
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,480
major improvement
after taking the medicine.

822
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,110
Then why would these patients...

823
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,670
Jiangli, something's wrong.

824
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,150
A woman suddenly fell ill.

825
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:18,990
She died.

826
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,440
It's your medicine!

827
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,670
Give me back my father!

828
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,590
Give him back!

829
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,150
Miss, please calm down.

830
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:31,470
Father...

831
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:33,980
My Lord,

832
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:36,050
in the past two days,
sudden deaths among the sick

833
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,170
have drastically increased.

834
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,710
Bodies are being carried out

835
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,270
of the temple one after another.

836
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:42,110
It's a horrifying sight.

837
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,320
Father,

838
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:48,070
Shen Jiangli was far too negligent

839
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,420
at such a critical moment.

840
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:50,750
If she isn't severely punished,

841
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,310
how can we explain it to the people?

842
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,550
My Lord,

843
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,550
the citizens are wailing outside.

844
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,400
Everyone's saying

845
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,350
it's Consort Jiangli's medicine
that killed them.

846
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,160
Father,

847
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,670
I believe

848
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,660
Jiangli's prescription
couldn't have caused this.

849
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,360
I tested the medicine on myself.

850
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,500
If there truly were an issue,

851
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,360
how could I

852
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,710
still be standing here unharmed?

853
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:12,590
Father,

854
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,400
I spoke with an elderly physician

855
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,150
with decades of experience.

856
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,100
He confirmed that it was indeed
Consort Jiangli's prescription

857
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:19,840
that caused this.

858
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,920
Father, please summon

859
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,960
this physician to testify.

860
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,120
Jingming, if you don't believe it,

861
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,840
you can question him yourself.

862
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,710
Bring in the physician.

863
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,400
Tell us.

864
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,190
Was there a problem

865
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,310
with Shen Jiangli's medicine?

866
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,920
Based on my decades of medical practice,

867
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,190
it is indeed
Consort Jiangli's prescription

868
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,150
that was at fault.

869
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,670
The remedy appears curative,

870
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,690
but it contains poison
to cure the disease.

871
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,450
Master Jingming is a soldier

872
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,670
and trains himself every day.

873
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,590
He is strong,

874
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,230
so he can handle the toxic effects.

875
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,880
But the elderly, the weak, and the young

876
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,400
cannot bear such medicine.

877
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,470
Consort Jiangli is highly skilled
in medicine.

878
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,520
How could she

879
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,480
not know this?

880
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,230
Was she simply too eager to take credit?

881
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,590
Many people have died because of it.

882
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,800
They were the people of Dongzhou.

883
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,110
Jingming,

884
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,150
don't let your feelings for your wife

885
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,110
make you ignore the lives of the people.

886
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:18,950
There's something wrong
with Consort Jiangli's prescription.

887
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,070
The sick no longer dare

888
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,670
seek treatment at the temple.

889
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:24,070
They won't even touch
Consort Jiangli's medicine.

890
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,230
If this continues,

891
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,360
panic will spread.

892
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,840
For such a grave mistake,

893
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:31,070
Consort Jiangli must pay with her life

894
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,110
to calm the public anger.

895
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,840
Enough.

896
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,880
Stop talking.

897
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,110
Detain Consort Jiangli for now.

898
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,420
We'll decide this later.

899
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,070
Father,

900
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,460
something's fishy about this.

901
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:43,840
Please make the decision

902
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,920
after I uncover the truth.

903
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,640
Jingming,

904
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,880
the plague is spreading rapidly.

905
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,210
If we wait for your investigation,

906
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,520
won't the people of Dongzhou

907
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,400
end up buried with Consort Jiangli?

908
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,080
Father, please punish Shen Jiangli
according to the law,

909
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,440
and assign other physicians

910
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,550
to treat the people.

911
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,550
- Father.
- Jingming.

912
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,710
Stay out of this for now.

913
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,550
Without my order,

914
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,050
