(Rain Chamber)

23
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,700
Look, Yao.

24
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,450
This is Rain Chamber.

25
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,610
Rain Chamber

26
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,500
really is different from other chambers.

27
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,290
Of course.

28
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,610
Jingming

29
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,860
specially prepared

30
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,910
Rain Chamber for Jiangli

31
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,890
when they got married.

32
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,540
But

33
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,700
since Jiangli went
to the ancestral tomb,

34
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,330
Jingming had never come back.

35
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,140
It's rare

36
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,650
that Rain Chamber

37
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:16,890
is still in this state.

38
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,450
Jiangli

39
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,540
must be an extraordinary woman.

40
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,580
Since the battle five years ago,

41
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,980
Jingming has been in low spirits,

42
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,050
but after Jiangli returned,

43
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,260
Jingming has become much happier.

44
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,800
They've been through a lot.

45
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,330
I hope they'll get better and better.

46
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,260
Jingxing,

47
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,890
if we have

48
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,580
misunderstandings in the future,

49
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:51,980
what would you do?

50
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,700
How could we have misunderstandings?

51
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,170
Yao,

52
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,650
I usually

53
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,210
give in to you, don't I?

54
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,820
What do you mean by that?

55
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,930
What do you mean by that?

56
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,510
- You think
- I...

57
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,380
- I'm always
- No.

58
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,980
- unreasonable, right?
- I...

59
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,980
Is that how you see me?

60
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,420
No.

61
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,730
Sorry for being inarticulate, Yao.

62
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,320
Young Master,

63
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,800
this is the prototype of the crossbow

64
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,670
made by the craftsmen

65
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,360
according
to Consort Jiangli's blueprints.

66
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,260
Take a look.

67
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,450
Not bad.

68
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,170
Young Master,

69
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,540
I saw you try archery today.

70
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,030
Your hand injury must've been healed.

71
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,450
With the money and blueprints,

72
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,880
Consort Jiangli is truly impressive.

73
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,170
Young Master,

74
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,860
if we didn't have Consort Jiangli,

75
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,980
what would we do?

76
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,820
Why?

77
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,600
Have you completed
all the tasks I gave you?

78
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,280
Young Master,

79
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,180
there's been a prototype
for the second batch.

80
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,500
We can test them in a few days.

81
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:48,730
Good.

82
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,050
Keep working on it.

83
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,660
Yao.

84
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,020
- Yao.
- Let go of me.

85
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,580
Don't be angry; it's my fault.

86
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,930
Give it back to me.

87
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,140
Just forgive me.

88
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,390
Young Master, My Lady,

89
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,650
Master Jingxing has arrived.

90
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,060
He's already in Rain Chamber.

91
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,700
Jiangli.

92
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:21,690
Jingming.

93
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,560
- Where are they?
- Jiangli.

94
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:26,690
Jingming.

95
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,210
- Jingming...
- Who are you?

96
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,210
How dare you to intrude here?

97
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,290
Who are you?

98
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,820
What are you doing here?

99
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,180
What are you doing here?

100
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,890
Who's this little one?

101
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,450
So cute.

102
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,850
Usually, I really dislike

103
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,180
others pinching my cheeks,

104
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,060
but since you're a pretty lady,

105
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,410
I'll forgive you.

106
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,260
What's your name?

107
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,260
How old are you?

108
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,090
I'm Shen Yanyan,
four years old this year.

109
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,820
You can call me Yanyan.

110
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,180
Yanyan,

111
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:00,920
I've remembered you now.

112
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,620
Let me take a look at little Yanyan.

113
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,260
Yanyan looks just like Jingming

114
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,290
when he was a child.

115
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,330
He does look like Jingming.

116
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:16,740
Jingming, Jiangli.

117
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,850
Mother.

118
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,940
Jingxing, Yao,

119
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,680
it's rare for you to visit us.

120
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,090
Why don't we go to the study?

121
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,260
I'll make a pot of good tea.

122
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,500
Mother.

123
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,180
Yanyan, I told you to hide

124
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,410
when outsiders come, right?

125
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:39,370
Let's go.

126
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,450
Oh, I almost forgot.

127
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,020
We came

128
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,180
because we found a good place.

129
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,410
We came today to invite you

130
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,940
to go sightseeing and hiking together.

131
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,370
Yes.

132
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,580
Hiking and sightseeing?

133
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,770
That's right. Let's go out and relax.

134
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,650
Jiangli,

135
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:55,580
let's go together.

136
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,490
By the way, I brought you some flowers.

137
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,450
Thank you.

138
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,620
But I still have work to do.

139
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,650
There's always work.

140
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,040
You can continue when you're back.

141
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,140
Great.

142
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,380
Let's go hiking.

143
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,970
Staying in Rain Chamber all the time

144
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,920
- is so boring.
- Yanyan wants to go too, right?

145
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:09,890
Let's go.

146
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:10,730
Yanyan.

147
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,450
- Let's go, Jingming.
Yanyan.

148
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,410
Let's go play!

149
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,370
Jiangli,

150
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,020
the embroidery you presented
at the birthday banquet

151
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,860
was truly stunning.

152
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,500
The craft is complicated.

153
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,120
You must've worked on it
for a long time.

154
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,770
At that birthday banquet, I could tell

155
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,260
you must know something

156
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,330
about embroidery too.

157
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,020
I don't know much about embroidery,

158
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,500
but over the years, I've been traveling,

159
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,180
so I know a little about the craft.

160
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:55,610
However,

161
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:56,980
Jiangli,

162
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,210
I can see

163
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,450
that you treat Lady Shu very well.

164
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,210
Why not express your feelings

165
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,050
to her?

166
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:06,020
Lady Shu is my mother-in-law.

167
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,590
It's my duty to treat her with respect.

168
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,180
But some things

169
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,890
are better left unsaid.

170
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,330
How magnanimous.

171
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,380
I should learn from you.

172
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,020
I like your personality too.

173
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,260
If you have time,

174
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,700
you can visit me more often.

175
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,140
I'd love to.

176
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,890
Will you always be at Rain Chamber?

177
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,410
I...

178
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,770
Yanyan, we're going out to play.

179
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:40,850
Are you happy?

180
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,860
Yes.

181
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,330
- Be careful.
- Come on.

182
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,170
Slow down.

183
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,170
Slow down.

184
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,890
Let's go, Yanyan.

185
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,140
Let's go.

186
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,580
Yanyan.

187
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,090
Mother, Ms. Pretty.

188
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,850
These are for you.

189
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,330
Yanyan,

190
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,700
how sweet of you

191
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,410
to bring us umbrellas.

192
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,490
Jingming,

193
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,700
since Yanyan calls Jiangli Mother,

194
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,820
should he call me

195
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,650
Uncle Jingxing then?

196
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,500
This place...

197
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,890
Did Father bring us here
when we were kids?

198
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,050
So, when did you become a father?

199
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,290
It seems this place
hasn't changed at all.

200
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,260
Jingming, you...

201
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,860
Enough talking. Come help me out.

202
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,410
I'm not done yet.

203
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:50,810
- Let's go.
- This...

204
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,500
Jingxing and Yao

205
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,290
heard Yanyan calling me Mother.

206
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,690
Will there be a problem?

207
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,100
I've thought about it.

208
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,340
Honestly,

209
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,650
we needn't worry too much about it.

210
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,220
I've watched

211
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,690
Jingxing grow up.

212
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,500
He's kind by nature

213
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,460
and never liked the household struggles.

214
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,700
As for Yao, she's straightforward

215
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,380
and kind.

216
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,410
Even if they found out the truth

217
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,530
about Yanyan,

218
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,850
I believe they'd
keep it a secret for us.

219
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,010
But in the end,

220
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:28,980
whether to tell them

221
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,500
or not

222
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,170
is up to you.

223
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,010
Alright.

224
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,930
Let's go in.

225
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,460
- Let's go, Yanyan.
- Let's go.

226
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:44,740
Isn't this nice?

227
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:50,500
Mother,

228
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,890
this place is so fun.

229
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:52,730
Go have fun.

230
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,570
Young Master, My Lady,

231
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:58,890
we'll go prepare the food now.

232
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,060
Hold on.

233
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,810
What did you bring?

234
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,340
I told you we're having a picnic,

235
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,260
and you still prepared regular food?

236
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:09,810
How boring.

237
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,380
Today, we'll do things my way.

238
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,500
Yulan,

239
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,620
you start the fire.

240
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:14,610
Yunyi,

241
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,860
go gather some firewood.

242
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:16,960
Yes.

243
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:17,930
As for Yunjiu,

244
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,160
you go handle the fish.

245
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,220
Me?

246
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,650
I don't believe

247
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,690
others can handle the fish well.

248
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:26,860
Look at her.

249
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,770
Then look at you.

250
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,930
Then Yulan can handle the fish,

251
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,020
and Yunjiu can handle the fire, alright?

252
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,650
- Alright.
- Let's go.

253
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,810
As for picking wild mushrooms
in the mountains,

254
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,930
Jiangli...

255
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,940
I'll go.

256
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:40,610
Yao,

257
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,530
let Jingming and Jiangli go.

258
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,500
We'll go hunt wild rabbits.

259
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,050
People say

260
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,990
the wild mushrooms in Dongzhou
are the tastiest.

261
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,020
I've never seen them in the borderlands.

262
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:51,860
Jingming,

263
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,860
sorry.

264
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,150
Do you mind if I tag along?

265
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,980
I'm afraid Jingxing

266
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,490
will have to go hunt rabbits alone.

267
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,160
- I...
- It's okay.

268
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,320
It's just picking mushrooms.

269
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,340
Yao and I can do that.

270
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,010
- Let's go.
- Alright.

271
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,840
Well...

272
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,260
Jingming, let's go hunt...

273
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,890
I'll go hunt rabbits alone.

274
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,930
Mr. Cute.

275
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,100
Mr. Cute.

276
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,980
Let's go fly kites.

277
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,820
Let me see.

278
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:33,810
They got you

279
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:34,650
such a pretty kite.

280
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:36,530
Isn't it nice?

281
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,220
They say all the wild mushrooms here

282
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,460
are edible and super tasty.

283
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,820
Look, there's a bunch over there.

284
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,890
They might not look ordinary,

285
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,220
but they're full of flavor.

286
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:57,740
A tasty ingredient

287
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,410
is popular everywhere.

288
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,500
The mushroom

289
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,740
is this kind of ingredient.

290
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,460
At Mother's birthday banquet,

291
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,530
I already realized

292
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,100
you're a woman of bold moves

293
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,460
and a carefree spirit.

294
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,140
We'll be visiting you guys more often.

295
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,270
I hope you won't dislike it.

296
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,260
I'd love to have you at home.

297
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,500
But

298
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,170
I do have a favor to ask.

299
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,260
Aside from everyone at my home,

300
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,530
no one else

301
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,260
knows about Yanyan.

302
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,620
For reasons I can't explain,

303
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:30,770
I don't want

304
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:32,530
others to know about it.

305
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:40,770
I hope

306
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,690
you and Jingxing

307
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:43,980
can keep this secret.

308
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,240
You don't even have to ask.

309
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,410
We have

310
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,100
protected Yanyan well all the way here.

311
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,980
No one will know about him.

312
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,990
Thank you for understanding.

313
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,020
Don't worry, Jiangli.

314
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,460
I'm sure Jingming is telling Jingxing
the same thing now.

315
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,620
We will

316
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,890
keep our word.

317
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:07,890
Jiangli,

318
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,930
judging by his looks

319
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,890
and age,

320
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:12,980
is Yanyan...

321
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:13,980
Yao,

322
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,100
may I not answer that?

323
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,530
Actually, Jingxing

324
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,170
told me about you and Jingming.

325
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,010
Jiangli,

326
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,530
I didn't mean to defend Jingming.

327
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,650
I just think

328
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,570
you two are so perfect together.

329
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,290
Is there a misunderstanding?

330
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,050
The past doesn't matter anymore.

331
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,250
Now,

332
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,930
I've moved on.

333
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,290
I want to live well from now on.

334
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,460
Well said!

335
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,050
We women shouldn't mope around

336
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:58,980
over a man.

337
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:01,410
Jiangli,

338
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,140
no matter what you choose,

339
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,290
I'll support you.

340
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:11,770
What beautiful jade ganoderma.

341
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:14,380
Sir, did you just pick this?

342
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,370
That's right.

343
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:17,770
Well,

344
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,460
would you sell it to me?

345
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,500
My wife's bedridden.

346
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,530
I need this to treat her.

347
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,100
In that case,

348
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,020
please take the money,

349
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:28,980
and just tell me

350
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,050
where you found it.

351
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,500
I'll pick some myself.

352
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,650
I found it in the woods nearby.

353
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,890
In that patch of wildflowers.

354
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,610
There are not many left, Miss.

355
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,740
Please save a few for me.

356
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,250
Thank you, sir.

357
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,570
Yao, you can return first.

358
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,390
Tell them not to wait for me at dinner.

359
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,250
Jiangli,

360
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,860
what's the rush?

361
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,530
Your house has every herb.

362
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,800
Why go picking yourself?

363
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,980
Money can't buy timing.

364
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,890
Don't wait for me. Just go back.

365
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,860
Jingming, you wouldn't believe it.

366
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,100
At that time,

367
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,620
that rabbit

368
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,530
shot past me

369
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,720
like lightning.

370
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:12,980
But I wasn't about to lose.

371
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,620
I caught it very swiftly.

372
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,110
This rabbit is big enough

373
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,050
for a whole feast tonight.

374
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,460
Yanyan, be careful.

375
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,300
Yanyan,

376
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,290
look what I just brought back.

377
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,980
- Yao.
- Take it to play.

378
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,100
These are the mushrooms I just picked.

379
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:29,940
Pretty cool, right?

380
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,410
You came back alone?

381
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:33,980
Jiangli went to the woods

382
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,220
to pick ganoderma

383
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,170
and told me to come back first.

384
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,980
She went into the woods alone?

385
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,890
Don't worry, Jingming.

386
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,500
She should be on her way back by now.

387
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:47,620
Listen.

388
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,890
You eat first. Don't wait for me.

389
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:49,770
I'll go find her.

390
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,290
Young Master, I'll go with you.

391
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,130
Take care of Yanyan.

392
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,980
Jiangli will be fine, right?

393
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,930
This place should be

394
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,140
the one the old man mentioned.

395
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:30,730
Shen Jiangli.

396
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:33,730
Lu Jingming.

397
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:36,980
Lu Jingming.

398
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,130
Don't come closer.

399
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,860
Listen.

400
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,140
This is a Lu's trap.

401
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,500
Stepping on it is fine,

402
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,400
but it'll trigger once you lift my foot.

403
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,780
Don't come over.

404
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,090
If you come over,

405
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,370
we'll both get shot.

406
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,020
I'll find a way out myself.

407
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,420
Just stay put.

408
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,420
Don't be ridiculous.

409
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:20,900
Do you know martial arts?

410
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,950
How can you dodge arrows?

411
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,740
I know martial arts.

412
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:25,940
Let me take your place.

413
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:26,930
Now,

414
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:27,930
give me your hands,

415
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,300
and then

416
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,020
slowly slide to my foot.

417
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,180
Then gently move away.

418
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,420
You'll die.

419
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:35,450
Trust me.

420
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,370
Trust your ally.

421
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,370
Come on.

422
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:42,930
It's okay.

423
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,340
Come on.

424
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,410
Steady.

425
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,450
I've stepped on it.

426
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,740
Gently.

427
00:17:59,020 --> 00:17:59,860
Listen to me.

428
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,500
Once you're clear,

429
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,290
run to safety.

430
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:05,410
Okay.

431
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,540
Very good.

432
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:18,890
Good.

433
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:20,610
Very good.

434
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:25,690
Alright.

435
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,860
Run.

436
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,540
Careful!

437
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,130
It's okay.

438
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,610
We can go back on our own.

439
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:11,800
No need for them to fetch us.

440
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,460
This is to let them know

441
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,900
we're safe.

442
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,810
It seems

443
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,330
we barely

444
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,900
talked today.

445
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,770
I'm worried someone
will find out about Yanyan.

446
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,220
Jingxing and Yao are fine.

447
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:41,940
- If it's...
- Don't worry.

448
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,570
I've made sure

449
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,700
to hide Yanyan on the way here.

450
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,610
Thank you.

451
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,780
You're welcome.

452
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,660
I'm not just talking about that.

453
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,700
If it weren't for you today,

454
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,700
I might've been trapped here forever.

455
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,700
This trap

456
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,330
must have been set in advance.

457
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,540
That old man

458
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:10,980
must be one of them.

459
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,570
They know you too well

460
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,090
so they know

461
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,180
how passionate you are

462
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,570
about rare herbs.

463
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,330
How well Wang Danling knows me.

464
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,050
She hasn't given up even now.

465
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,770
I will find out

466
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:29,700
who set up this trap.

467
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,420
They'll pay with their life

468
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,360
for framing a consort.

469
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,020
A trap is just a tool.

470
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,420
In the enemy's hands,

471
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,570
it's a blade aimed straight at us.

472
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,130
But if we take control,

473
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,660
it might just serve us

474
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,460
in a different way.

475
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,540
Don't move.

476
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:12,890
It's gone.

477
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:14,610
What is it?

478
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:15,610
A firefly.

479
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,500
A firefly?

480
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:20,700
Catch it

481
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,840
and bring it back to Yanyan.

482
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,090
Does he like fireflies?

483
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:24,530
He's a kid.

484
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,330
Kids like pretty things.

485
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,130
Do you like them?

486
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,330
The light of fireflies is beautiful.

487
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,260
I like them, too.

Half for Yanyan,

492
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:45,860
and half for you.

493
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,420
Why split them
between me and Yanyan?

494
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,260
Because

495
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:53,530
both of you should be spoiled.

Let me see.

502
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:13,610
Be careful.

503
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,610

If you clap lightly,

511
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,220
the fireflies will come closer

512
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,260
because of the sound.

513
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,020
Really?

514
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:49,500
Did you catch one?

515
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,820
No.

516
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,260
Jingming, Jiangli,

517
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,940
you're back.

518
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,180
Where's Yanyan?

519
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,290
Yulan's taking him

520
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,370
to play over there.

521
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,090
I'll go check on him.

522
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:19,690
Yanyan.

523
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,340
Yanyan.

524
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,210
- Let's go.
- Yanyan.

525
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,370
- Yanyan.
- Yanyan.

526
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,120
Yanyan.

527
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,570
- Jiangli, it's my fault.
- Yanyan.

528
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,320
- Sorry for neglecting him.
- What happened?

529
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:30,860
Yanyan.

530
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,300
(Wind)

531
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,500
Yanyan, take your medicine.

532
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,330
I've never seen

533
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,770
this symptom before.

534
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,830
Prepare the carriage. We'll head back.

535
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:48,930
Be careful.

536
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,980
Yulan, go bring Yanyan's medicine.

537
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,820
Yes.

538
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:56,930
Yanyan.

539
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,060
Yanyan.

540
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,900
Does it hurt?

541
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,220
- Jiangli, here.
- Hurry.

542
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,130
Miss Yulan,

543
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:13,330
what illness does he have?

544
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,500
Why is his attack so terrifying?

545
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,090
Yanyan has a congenital weakness,

546
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,190
leading to insect disease.

547
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,580
When it flares up, it feels
like being bitten by insects,

548
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:21,660
causing excruciating pain.

549
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,500
Insect disease?

550
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:25,460
I've read about it in ancient texts.

551
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,610
It's said to be extremely eerie,

552
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,390
but I didn't expect it to exist,

553
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,370
let alone on a child.

554
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,980
Mother, I'm fine.

555
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:38,780
Yulan,

556
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,260
please look after Yanyan for me.

557
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:41,810
Alright, Jiangli.

558
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,700
It's alright, Yanyan.

559
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,300
You'll be fine.

560
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,340
You'll be fine.

561
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:51,690
Where are you going?

562
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,150
I'm going to find the Prefect.

563
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,900
I need Lei Pill from him.

564
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,810
I need to save Yanyan.

565
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,260
Stay calm.

566
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,500
Yanyan is my son,

567
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,820
right?

568
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,130
I knew it.

569
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:14,740
I always knew.

570
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:17,370
Yes.

571
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:19,220
Yanyan is your son,

572
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:20,980
the eldest grandson of the Prefect.

573
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:22,700
I'll tell the Prefect.

574
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,260
He won't ignore it.

575
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,570
Jiangli, please don't act impulsively.

576
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,410
Jingming.

577
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,810
Jingming, listen to me.

578
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,940
Yanyan's condition

579
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,500
is worsening.

580
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,420
Do you know how much he's suffering?

581
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,980
It's all my fault.

582
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,180
It's all my fault.

583
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,050
I shouldn't have kept him by my side.

584
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,500
I should've returned him to you.

585
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,680
It's all my fault.

586
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:44,330
You're the Prefect's son.

587
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:45,980
He's your son.

588
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,440
You go tell the Prefect.

589
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:49,020
He won't ignore him.

590
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,300
Jiangli,

591
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,700
stay calm and listen to me.

592
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,050
Yanyan's identity is special.

593
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,180
If we tell Father now

594
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,020
without a plan,

595
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:05,740
the Prefect's Mansion

596
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,940
won't be a sanctuary for him.

597
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,260
It will become the most dangerous place.

598
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,370
Jingxiu,

599
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:13,810
Danling,

600
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,260
and so many unseen enemies.

601
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,190
Not everyone wants
what's best for Yanyan, right?

602
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,780
Maybe

603
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,090
his illness won't be cured,

604
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,370
and we'll put him in greater danger.

605
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:27,810
Please believe me.

606
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,220
Let's figure this out.

607
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,610
Leave this to me,

608
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,780
alright?

609
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,320
Let's first check on the child.

610
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,610
I'm exhausted.

611
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,180
We're finally home.

612
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,180
What's this?

613
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,020
I prepared roast chicken for you.

614
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:13,180
You must not have eaten enough

615
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,370
during the picnic.

616
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,090
I haven't had roast chicken for long.

617
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,500
I'll get you a chicken leg.

618
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:26,850
Is it good?

619
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:27,690
It's delicious.

620
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:33,460
Let me try a bit.

621
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:35,940
It's so good.

622
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,850
I didn't expect Jingming

623
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,420
to have a child.

624
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:43,930
Yeah.

625
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,330
And he's already four.

626
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:47,770
But this little one

627
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:49,260
is so likable.

628
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:52,610
Yanyan...

629
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:54,980
I felt so sorry for him

630
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,770
when he had his attack today.

631
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,820
By the way,

632
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,610
Jiangli told me today

633
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,330
not to mention anything about Yanyan.

634
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:05,940
Jingming also told me about it.

635
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,420
Our household is full of gossip.

636
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,980
If people find out

637
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,090
that Jingming has a child,

638
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,260
who knows

639
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,570
what kind of trouble might arise?

640
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,530
We've learned such a big secret.

641
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,130
We must keep it to ourselves.

642
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:27,220
The envoys from Beizhou and Nanzhou

643
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,810
will visit us

644
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,220
in half a month.

645
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:31,420
What do you three

646
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,940
think about it?

647
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,170
Father,

648
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,940
I think

649
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,610
that since Beizhou and Nanzhou

650
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,290
rarely interact with us,

651
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,900
their visit now,
when Xizhou is invading us,

652
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,610
must be a probe,

653
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:44,980
not a simple visit.

654
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,570
They're weighing

655
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,090
whether to support us

656
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,700
or Xizhou.

657
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,020
That's right.

658
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,260
Jingxiu,

659
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,850
what's the use of pointing that out?

660
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:57,700
Who doesn't know

661
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,020
that the situation
between Xizhou and us is tense,

662
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,050
and Beizhou and Nanzhou
are waiting to pick sides?

663
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,660
Jingxing, haven't you always been idle?

664
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:08,940
Oh, you're not idle;

665
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,330
you're just sightseeing.

666
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,740
Since when does this lazy young master

667
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,090
care about the world's situation?

668
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,260
The rise and fall of a nation

669
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,430
is everyone's responsibility.

670
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:19,420
Besides, I'm the young master
of Dongzhou too.

671
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,260
Master Jingxing, tell us

672
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,420
your opinion then.

673
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:23,810
Since they're coming,

674
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:24,980
we can't be afraid.

675
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,180
We can just attack.

676
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,540
Jingxing,

677
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:32,700
we've had many border skirmishes
with Xizhou over the years,

678
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,940
which has drained our resources.

679
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,370
If we go to war with Beizhou
and Nanzhou now,

680
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:39,260
won't we be attacked from three sides?

681
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,180
Jingxing,

682
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,050
you're more suited for sightseeing.

683
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,530
War

684
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,980
isn't just about talking.

685
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,090
So what?

686
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,610
The men of Dongzhou are strong.

687
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,330
We can fight three enemies at once.

688
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,130
Jingxiu,

689
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,020
you command the Golden Guards.

690
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,020
How can you be so indecisive?

691
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,130
If we waver like this,

692
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,770
Beizhou and Nanzhou will laugh at us,

693
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,330
thinking we're all about the show.

694
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,500
It'll only embolden Xizhou.

695
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:08,700
Nonsense.

696
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:09,970
Father,

697
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:12,500
leave Jingxing out of this from now on.

698
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,330
Should I be left out

699
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:16,810
because I disagree with Jingxiu?

700
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,180
Father,

701
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,530
since when has Jingxiu
taken charge of Dongzhou?

702
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,810
Enough. Be quiet now.

703
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,700
Jingxing,

704
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,740
although you're young,

705
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,130
as a young master,

706
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,900
you should be careful with your words.

707
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,610
- Jingxiu.
- Yes.

708
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:34,770
The Golden Guards

709
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,460
haven't improved in ability

710
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,370
but have caused many problems.

711
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,420
There are always complaints

712
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,460
about them being submitted to me.

713
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,180
How are you managing the Golden Guards?

714
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,020
Father,

715
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:45,700
there must be a misunderstanding.

716
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:47,210
Father, don't worry.

717
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:48,850
This time, when the envoys come,

718
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,050
the Golden Guards will shine

719
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:52,660
to demonstrate our power.

720
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:55,900
Good.

721
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:02,650
Jingming,

722
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,500
why are you so quiet today?

723
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:08,700
I believe

724
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,290
that our forces are

725
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:11,660
about the same as Xizhou's,

726
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,220
and so is our grain supply.

727
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,810
If we go to war,

728
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,460
what will make the difference

729
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,220
is the quality of our weapons.

730
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:20,810
Good.

731
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:21,650
Go on.

732
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,720
Based on the overall situation,

733
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:25,130
if a war breaks out,

734
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,290
one side will need to improve

735
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,570
its weapons to gain the upper hand.

736
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:32,500
I think Xizhou

737
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,900
probably realized this years ago.

738
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,980
So, over the years,

739
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,220
Xizhou has been

740
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,180
constantly improving its weapons

741
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,250
and its military strength.

742
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,610
I once sent people to gather information

743
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:43,980
on the weapons they commonly use

744
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:45,460
and bought some to study.

745
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:47,170
I found

746
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:49,390
that while their weapons are excellent,

747
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,940
they're not so good

748
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,810
that they'd dare to initiate
an invasion.

749
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,100
So,

750
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,300
recently,

751
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:57,370
with Xizhou becoming so rampant,

752
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:59,130
it's clear

753
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:00,220
they must've made

754
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,750
a major breakthrough in their weapons.

755
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,610
Jingming is right.

756
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,460
The key to victory lies in weapons.

757
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,260
I've also ordered my men

758
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,260
to develop a few things,

759
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,980
but I'm not sure
if we can face them in battle.

760
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,740
Father,

761
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,810
are you having a headache again?

762
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,980
Don't worry about my health.

763
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,500
You three,

764
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,260
go back and think carefully.

765
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,570
If, in the end,

766
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:34,050
our weapons are no match for Xizhou,

767
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,420
how will we win with an unexpected move?

768
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,740
Go to work.

769
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,780
- Yes.
- Yes.

770
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:47,260
Let's go, Jingming.

771
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,580
Young Master.

772
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:58,610
How's it going?

773
00:32:58,770 --> 00:32:59,950
We've tried some new methods,

774
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:01,150
but none of them worked.

775
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,810
When the arrows are shot,

776
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:04,370
they're either too close or too far off.

777
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,660
We can speed things up now.

778
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,500
Yes.

779
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,820
Jingxing,

780
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,020
do you see?

781
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:12,940
To make Father happy,
Jingming is working

782
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,840
through the night to make the crossbow.

783
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,260
Don't be fooled

784
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,370
by his calm and collected appearance.

785
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:21,020
Jingxiu,

786
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,130
you can make weapons too

787
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:24,180
if you want.

788
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:25,940
Why complain behind Jingming's back

789
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,770
because you can't make them yourself?

790
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:42,820
Jingming,

791
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,370
did you just try
to ask Father for medicine?

792
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,660
How do you know

793
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,500
I need medicine?

794
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,130
Yanyan's illness is very strange.

795
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,470
It can't be something
ordinary medicine can cure.

796
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,850
Besides, you have various herbs at home.

797
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,530
I saw you were so absent-minded

798
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,020
just now in the hall.

799
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,660
It must be about Yanyan.

800
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,220
So, I guessed

801
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,610
you wanted to ask Father

802
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:05,810
for medicine to treat Yanyan.

803
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,220
Yanyan's illness

804
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,880
can only be treated with Lei Pill.

805
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,220
Lei Pill?

806
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,820
Jingming, are you out of your mind?

807
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:16,530
Lei Pill is so precious.

808
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,300
Good thing you didn't speak up just now.

809
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,900
Otherwise,

810
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,760
Father would be furious to see you

811
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,250
not caring about the current situation

812
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,340
but asking for Lei Pill.

813
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,050
Our big brother

814
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:28,860
wouldn't miss such a good opportunity.

815
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:31,900
I know I shouldn't do this,

816
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,090
but I have to.

817
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:43,660
(Rain Chamber)

818
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,460
Give me more time.

819
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,380
I already know about what happened

820
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,780
in the hall today.

821
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,820
The Prefect is already troubled

822
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,850
by the envoys from Beizhou and Nanzhou,

823
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,780
and his headache is getting worse.

824
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,860
If you bring it up now,

825
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,860
it may

826
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,250
backfire

827
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:41,170
and affect your future prospects.

828
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,460
I want to be the Young Prefect,

829
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,870
but I think Yanyan's illness
is more important.

830
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,380
I plan

831
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,250
to ask Father for Lei Pill

832
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,570
when he's happy

833
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,140
as the crossbow is finished.

834
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,340
But Yanyan's illness can't wait.

835
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:01,730
I have a plan.

836
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,010
No.

837
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,420
I haven't told you.

838
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,500
I know what you want to do.

839
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,500
All the physicians in the city

840
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,340
are helpless

841
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,280
with Father's illness.

842
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:11,020
If you rashly try to treat him,

843
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,170
it's too dangerous.

844
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,140
Jingming,

845
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,570
since I cured your hidden illness

846
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,730
and Qingqing's face injury,

847
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,530
I have an 80% chance

848
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,020
of curing Father's illness.

849
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,530
I trust your ability,

850
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:25,780
but he is not an ordinary man.

851
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,300
Father is the Prefect.

852
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,940
Treating him

853
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,920
is not a trivial matter.

854
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:33,020
Besides, you don't know his condition.

855
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:34,860
What if something goes wrong

856
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,940
during treatment?

857
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,250
If Father punishes us,

858
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:38,900
what will we do?

859
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,220
Trust me.

860
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,460
Before the envoys arrive,

861
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:44,130
I'll do everything I can

862
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,650
to finish the crossbow

863
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,620
and solve Father's immediate problem.

864
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,380
Once Father is happy,

865
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,460
he'll definitely ask me

866
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,460
what reward I want,

867
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,250
and I can then rightfully ask

868
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,090
for Lei Pill.

869
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:55,730
I trust you.

870
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:57,570
I hope you can also trust me.

871
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,070
I really don't have time

872
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,580
to wait for you to finish the crossbow

873
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,400
and ask for rewards.

874
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,250
Please let me try, okay?

875
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,180
Jingming.

876
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,980
In that case,

877
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,460
whatever the consequences are,

878
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,780
I'll face them with you.
