(Land of Peace)
Don't talk nonsense.

23
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,660
I don't even know them.

24
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,250
What's going on?

25
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:46,810
Are you wondering

26
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,660
why they took your money

27
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,680
but refused to obey you?

28
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,090
Because I am richer than you.

29
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,060
A reputation bought with money

30
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,370
will never truly belong to you.

31
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,780
This downfall of yours is long overdue.

32
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,970
You claim not to care
about a woman's appearance,

33
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,450
but your words and actions

34
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,330
show no respect for women at all.

35
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:11,580
Who do you think you are?

36
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,100
My Lady.

37
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,170
Su Rui'an,

38
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,010
after investigation,

39
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,860
your father bribed someone

40
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,330
to take the provincial exams for you.

41
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,050
How dare you.

42
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,730
Guards,

43
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:29,890
take him to the authorities.

44
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,730
How dare you.

45
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,800
I'm about to marry
the Commandery Princess.

46
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,650
Why don't I remember

47
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,580
ever betrothing my sister to you?

48
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,050
When did I ever say I'd marry you?

49
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,420
They're

50
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,380
Master Jingming

51
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,520
and the Commandery Princess.

52
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,580
Greetings, Master Jingming, Your Grace.

53
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,660
Jingming,

54
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,050
I'll head back first.

55
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,300
Yunjiu,

56
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,330
escort the princess back.

57
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,490
Yes, Young Master.

58
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,220
Well?

59
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,640
Did you enjoy the show?

60
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,490
The show is over.

61
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:05,730
It's time to go home.

62
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,010
You...

63
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,380
You are Consort Jiangli.

64
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,420
Mr. Su, do you still wish

65
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,970
to admire the moon with Consort Jiangli?

66
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,650
How dare you covet my wife.

67
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,100
Yunyi,

68
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,950
take him away.

69
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:18,840
Yes, Young Master.

70
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,660
Do it.

71
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,330
Sorry. I'm sorry.

72
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,700
Move.

73
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,650
Let's go back, Consort Jiangli.

74
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:37,770
Come on.

75
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,260
(Prefect's Mansion)

76
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,300
I knew she wasn't up to anything good.

77
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,930
A so-called talented scholar
from Jiangnan?

78
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,140
She just wanted

79
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,210
to upset Qingqing and me.

80
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:56,890
My Lady, please calm down.

81
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,680
Luckily, Consort Jiangli
noticed it in time,

82
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:00,930
so nothing serious happened.

83
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,700
That's right.

84
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,650
This time Shen Jiangli handled it well.

85
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,450
Just thinking about this matter

86
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,290
makes me...

87
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,820
If she dares to make Qingqing suffer,

88
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,360
I'll sort it out with Lady Wang.

89
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,450
Su Rui'an

90
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,850
is really useless.

91
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,140
Originally, I wanted to use him

92
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,580
to trap Lady Shu

93
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,820
by making her daughter a laughingstock.

94
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,580
But I didn't expect

95
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,330
he'd be exposed so soon.

96
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,070
My Lady, please calm your anger.

97
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,060
It's Consort Jiangli's fault

98
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,580
for meddling in this.

99
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,270
There hasn't been

100
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,090
a peaceful day
since Shen Jiangli's return.

101
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,140
Su Rui'an's true colors
have been revealed.

102
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,060
I wonder if Lady Shu will suspect

103
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,210
that you arranged

104
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:48,940
this whole thing.

105
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,890
So what if she suspects it?

106
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,090
If she asks about it, I'll just say

107
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,620
I was fooled by Su Rui'an too.

108
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,580
I want her to have a taste

109
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,290
of suffering in silence.

110
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,260
Could Shen Jiangli

111
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,850
really be that kind-hearted?

112
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,610
Your Grace,

113
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,380
Consort Jiangli
is waiting outside again.

114
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,380
Would you like to see her?

115
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,140
After all,

116
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,060
your face was ruined because of her.

117
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,210
How dare she come?

118
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,180
She must be here to claim credit.

119
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,380
Your Grace,

120
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,600
I have something to say to you.

121
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,940
I have nothing to say to you.

122
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,970
Don't think
that I'd feel grateful to you

123
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,410
because of what happened yesterday.

124
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,970
I just want to explain
what happened back then.

125
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,530
You know Jingming's temper.

126
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,530
Since he is willing to let me stay,

127
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,820
it means he believes me.

128
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,740
You know very well

129
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,290
what kind of man Jingming is.

130
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:50,900
In the end,

131
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,530
this is still about Master Jingming.

132
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:53,890
What happened yesterday

133
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,890
was probably for him too.

134
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,740
How dare you even mention the past?

135
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,970
I have nothing to say to you.

136
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,180
There was a hidden truth back then.

137
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,250
Get out.

138
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:07,770
I told you to get out.

139
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:08,610
Qingqing.

140
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:10,940
Qingqing.

141
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,850
Calm down.

142
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,180
Hurting your health over this
is not worth it.

143
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,700
I can't bear to see you upset.

144
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,220
Your Grace,

145
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,580
I just want to explain everything.

146
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,600
If you don't open the door,

147
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,090
I will wait here all day today.

148
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,330
Jiangli, what are you doing here?

149
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,580
Are you here to apologize

150
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,970
for what you did to the princess
five years ago?

151
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:47,900
Wang Danling,

152
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,820
you really know how to twist the truth.

153
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,970
Don't you know
who disfigured the princess

154
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,580
in your heart?

155
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,140
Jiangli, what does this mean?

156
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,210
Are you now desperate
after being rejected here

157
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,330
and attacking me

158
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,530
without reason?

159
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,360
Attacking you without reason?

160
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:06,730
Consort Danling,

161
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,450
do you still remember

162
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,580
an old acquaintance
with a scar on his face?

163
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,820
I think his name was Tai.

164
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,010
I met him,

165
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,540
and we reminisced a lot about the past.

166
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,700
I wonder if you remember him.

167
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,620
What's this nonsense?

168
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,210
I don't know him.

169
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:26,980
Shen Jiangli,

170
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,650
I warn you.

171
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,380
Many people have tried to slander me,

172
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,970
but I, as Master Jingxiu's consort,

173
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,820
live an upright life.

174
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,180
You can't just slander me.

175
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,740
Such sweet words.

176
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:42,650
You know best

177
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,850
what really happened.

178
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,740
You finally left the ancestral tomb.

179
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,740
I advise you not to cause trouble again

180
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,180
and repeat the same mistake.

181
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,700
If you go back to that ancestral tomb,

182
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,820
you may not come out again.

183
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,430
The weather is really nice today.

184
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,650
Consort Jiangli,

185
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,820
wait here patiently.

186
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:19,880
Your Grace,

187
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,500
don't you think the events of that day

188
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,740
were full of coincidences?

189
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,090
Don't you want to know
the reason behind it?

190
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,620
Give yourself the truth

191
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,390
and give me the justice I deserve.

192
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,740
(Five years ago)

193
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,930
It's the Prefect's
birthday banquet today.

194
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:57,930
It's so lively outside.

195
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,100
Your Grace, why do you look so gloomy?

196
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,220
This is the hibiscus cake I made.

197
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,100
Try one.

198
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:06,650
Thank you.

199
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,220
The mansion is livelier
than usual today,

200
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,530
but I feel uneasy inside.

201
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,620
These fish were born

202
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,650
in this pond.

203
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,950
Do you think they know

204
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,870
there are bigger lakes and oceans
in the world?

205
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,760
They're celebrating
the Lantern Festival outside, right?

206
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,380
I want to go out and see it.

207
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:25,980
Your Grace,

208
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,100
why don't you experience

209
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,260
the folk bustling streets?

210
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,290
But Father and Mother won't let me go.

211
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:33,610
Consort Jiangli,

212
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:36,280
the Prefect doesn't allow
the princess to go out casually,

213
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,410
especially to places like this
with mixed crowds.

214
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,510
Since you can't go out as the princess,

215
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,860
why don't you change your identity?

216
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:44,810
Jiangli,

217
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:45,650
do you have a plan?

218
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,810
How about this?

219
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,740
I'll have someone bring me
a set of my clothes,

220
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,220
and you can ride in my carriage.

221
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,500
No one will know.

222
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,690
Can this really work?

223
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,530
If we get caught,

224
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,740
we'll just be scolded a bit.

225
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:01,130
But...

226
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,300
Nanny Dai,

227
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,170
you go take a stroll with the princess.

228
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,930
It's the Lantern Festival today.

229
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,500
There are so many beautiful lanterns

230
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,650
and also dough figurines.

231
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,500
So many delicious and fun things.

232
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,440
Just go with her for a bit
and come back.

233
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,380
Nanny Dai...

234
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,690
Fine, fine.

235
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,340
As long as the princess is happy.

236
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,650
Jiangli, you should go with me too.

237
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,460
I'd love to,

238
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,340
but

239
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,670
today is the Prefect's birthday,

240
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:25,930
and Jingming isn't here.

241
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,290
If I'm also not here,

242
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,620
it'll be hard to explain.

243
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,930
You go enjoy yourself.

244
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,410
You can tell me when you're back.

245
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,050
Then I'll bring a pretty lantern

246
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:33,890
for you.

247
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,530
It's so hot outside.

248
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,460
What if something happens to her?

249
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:42,980
Then

250
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,500
we'll be blamed.

251
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:28,490
Jiangli.

252
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:29,730
Jiangli.

253
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:33,930
Invite the princess to my mansion.

254
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,740
(Master Jingming's Mansion)

255
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,050
Have some cold congee,

256
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,120
and you might feel better.

257
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,700
Jingming,

258
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,220
why did you call me here?

259
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,380
Don't you remember

260
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,460
how she harmed me back then?

261
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,300
Qingqing,

262
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,170
you've gone too far today.

263
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,990
What happened back then

264
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,460
was not Jiangli's fault.

265
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,130
Jingming,

266
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,460
don't be fooled by her acting.

267
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,340
She's just playing the victim.

268
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,170
Bring him here.

269
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,010
Yes.

270
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,130
Go.

271
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:18,890
Kneel.

272
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:20,980
Who is he?

273
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,820
He's the one who harmed you back then.

274
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,980
Today's lantern event is so lively.

275
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,300
(Five years ago)
Nanny, I want to play a bit longer.

276
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,340
Your Grace,

277
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,620
I don't think

278
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,570
this is the way to the lantern event.

279
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,820
Get out of the way.

280
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:48,890
Your Grace.

281
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,460
Get out of the way.

282
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,300
Come with me.

283
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:53,980
Do you know who I am?

284
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,260
You can't touch me.

285
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,140
I don't care who you are.

286
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,500
- I've been paid, so I'll do the job.
- Help!

287
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,340
Help!

288
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,870
- Let go of me!
- Help!

289
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:03,730
You smell so good.

290
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,160
Help me!

291
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,260
You want me to play rough, huh?

292
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,290
Hurry! Save the princess!

293
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,690
Shen Jiangli,

294
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,650
you persuaded me to come out

295
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,810
and even lent me a carriage.

296
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,810
It must be you.

297
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,460
Don't be afraid.

298
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,700
I'm here.

299
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:40,940
Qingqing,

300
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:42,530
back then,

301
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,620
I let you ride my carriage

302
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,980
to see the lanterns.

303
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:47,770
I really wanted you to go

304
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:48,980
and have a good time,

305
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,620
but I never imagined

306
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,340
it would cause you harm.

307
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,770
You can resent me

308
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,410
and misunderstand me,

309
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,140
but I don't want you

310
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,740
to remain in the dark.

311
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,650
You are the biggest victim

312
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:02,860
in this matter,

313
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,410
and you deserve to know the truth.

314
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,010
Tai,

315
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,140
tell the princess

316
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,290
everything you said to me.

317
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,980
If you conceal even a bit,

318
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,460
you know how cruel I can be.

319
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,820
Speak.

320
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,530
Consort Danling coerced and lured me.

321
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,050
She asked me

322
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,740
to drag Consort Jiangli

323
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,130
from the carriage

324
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,740
during the lantern viewing.

325
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,810
Only later did I realize

326
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,260
it was the princess

327
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,140
who was inside.

328
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,980
Your Grace,

329
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,020
forgive me.

330
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,220
It's all my fault.

331
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,100
I was momentarily confused.

332
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,340
So, you're saying

333
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,770
Sister Ling was behind it?

334
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:43,980
How could that be?

335
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,460
Sister Ling is gentle and kind.

336
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,740
She treats me like a sister.

337
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,860
How could she do
such a despicable thing?

338
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:53,500
I don't believe it.

339
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,650
You're the one who did the evil first

340
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,980
and now you're framing Sister Ling.

341
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,300
Qingqing,

342
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:01,980
it really wasn't me.

343
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,260
If it had been me,

344
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,910
I wouldn't have used
such a lowly method.

345
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,220
You were contemptible back then.

346
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,810
Of course, you'd do such a thing.

347
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,890
Your Grace, I'm telling the truth.

348
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,220
Consort Danling

349
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,570
was afraid I'd expose everything,

350
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,530
so she sent someone to kill me.

351
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,530
I've been hiding for years.

352
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,810
Days ago, Consort Danling's men

353
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,290
found me.

354
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,290
Thanks to Consort Jiangli,

355
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,100
- I was saved.
- Shut up.

356
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,740
Don't you dare smear Sister Ling.

357
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,410
If you still don't believe me,

358
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,050
I can find someone to testify.

359
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,380
When Consort Danling gave the orders,

360
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,570
there was a maid present.

361
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:40,410
Her name was...

362
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,410
Her name was Hexiang.

363
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,020
Hexiang?

364
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,140
Are you referring

365
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,260
to Sister Ling's maid?

366
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,290
Your Grace,

367
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,530
Hexiang has been missing for years.

368
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,290
I don't know

369
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,380
if I can find her,

370
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:01,020
but she's the only one

371
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,340
who can testify right now.

372
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:07,530
Yunyi,

373
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:08,890
take him away.

374
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,370
Yes.

375
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,180
Yunjiu,

376
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,220
go investigate.

377
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:18,410
Yes.

378
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:20,370
Qingqing,

379
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:22,860
I know this matter

380
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,050
has caused you great harm,

381
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:25,730
but

382
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,410
if you think about it carefully,

383
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,620
is Sister Ling really

384
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,650
as good as you say she is?

385
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,220
Qingqing,

386
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,530
I don't care how others see me,

387
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,340
but I won't let anyone smear me

388
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,570
with something I didn't do.

389
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,700
I will surely

390
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,500
find Hexiang.

391
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,580
(Rain Chamber)

392
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:08,410
Qingqing

393
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,020
is just having trouble accepting it.

394
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,420
Don't hold it against her.

395
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,370
Of course.

396
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,300
Young Master,

397
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,210
My Lady,

398
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,370
I've had people investigate.

399
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,210
Miss Hexiang seems

400
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,560
to have appeared in Hong Village
in the west of the city.

401
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,500
Hong Village?

402
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,570
That place is full of thieves
and scoundrels.

403
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,610
Why would a young girl

404
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,900
like Hexiang go there?

405
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,460
I don't know.

406
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,490
Send someone
to bring her back immediately.

407
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:35,610
Yes.

408
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,260
By the way,

409
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,610
I'm short of some medicinal herbs.

410
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,050
Let's go buy some tomorrow.

411
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,300
Sure.

412
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,140
Delicious meat buns!

413
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:50,970
Sir.

414
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,740
Ma'am, are you here for a consultation

415
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,610
or medicine?

416
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:55,460
Or,

417
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,430
is there something wrong?

418
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,340
Do you have paper?

419
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,570
Yes. Please wait.

420
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,260
(Prescription)

421
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,460
Ma'am, you must be an expert.

422
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,220
This prescription is rare.

423
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,920
When working, it removes decay
and helps tissue grow.

424
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,980
But the key

425
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,180
is in how it's prepared

426
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,290
instead of its medicine.

427
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:33,370
If any step is wrong by even a little,

428
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,330
the medicine won't be effective.

429
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,020
Thank you for the reminder.

430
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,770
Please wait a moment.

431
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,150
I'll prepare the medicine for you.

432
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,000
She used to love the cakes
from Dingfeng Cake next door.

433
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,260
Go buy some.

434
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,340
Yes.

435
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,260
What's this?

436
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,020
This is modified Taiyi ointment,

437
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,420
which can regenerate issue.

438
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,890
The princess's facial wounds

439
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,900
can be treated.

440
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,050
She can grow new skin in three months

441
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,660
if she uses it continuously.

442
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:22,700
So you're

443
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,260
getting medicine for Qingqing,

444
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,810
not for yourself.

445
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,130
I'm fine.

446
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:28,810
Anyway,

447
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,100
we should first treat the scars
on your sister's face.

448
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,600
You haven't eaten yet, right?

449
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,290
Would you like

450
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,130
some snacks?

451
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,700
You're acting strangely today,

452
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,500
being unusually kind.

453
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,660
Once we find Hexiang,

454
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,610
I'll take you to see mother

455
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,610
and explain everything.

456
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:01,970
Do you think

457
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,850
I still care

458
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,660
about Lady Shu's opinion?

459
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,740
Besides,

460
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,850
her prejudice toward me

461
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,180
can't be washed away by just one thing.

462
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,020
I know

463
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,740
you endured a lot of suffering

464
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,500
because mother misunderstood you

465
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,740
and punished you by sending you
to the ancestral tomb.

466
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,180
Let's not bring up the past anymore.

467
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:25,700
Between allies,

468
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,420
it's about equality and mutual benefit.

469
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,500
You can help me get the Lei Pill,

470
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,130
and for the rest,

471
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:32,660
I can cooperate with you.

472
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,030
Let's not mention old matters,

473
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,540
so we don't spoil the mood.

474
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,260
If you're really bored,

475
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,260
you can fan the fire.

476
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,260
Alright.

477
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:58,740
Be careful, it's hot.

478
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,570
Forget it. Let me do it.

479
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,370
Then, let me go chop

480
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,470
some new firewood for you.

481
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,900
How can the great young master

482
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,980
chop firewood?

483
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,290
You go inside and rest.

484
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:11,610
Wait.

485
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,500
Take this away.

486
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,060
My Lady,

487
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,430
I've confirmed repeatedly.

488
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,020
When we contacted Tai back then,

489
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,900
we were cautious.

490
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:46,090
Moreover, it's been so many years.

491
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,220
I'm sure

492
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,630
there is no concrete evidence left.

493
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,220
Shen Jiangli thinks
that she can threaten me

494
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,500
by finding Tai.

495
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,290
How ridiculous.

496
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,420
Except...

497
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,740
Except that Hexiang is still alive.

498
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,740
I'm worried...

499
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,980
Why panic?

500
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,770
Now, Hexiang is deaf,
mute, and illiterate.

501
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,980
What kind of leverage is that?

502
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:12,980
That maid

503
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:15,020
served me for a few years.

504
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,020
Out of old feelings, I spared her life.

505
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,940
I'm kind enough.

506
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,700
I've not visited you for a while.

507
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,050
Look at you.

508
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,570
You've become quite haggard.

509
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,850
Come on, sit down.

510
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,810
At your age,

511
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,390
you shouldn't be troubled.

512
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,570
I've just made a new batch of hairpins

513
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:44,900
and picked a few

514
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,260
of the most valuable ones for you.

515
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,090
Do you like

516
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:49,610
this peach blossom hairpin?

517
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,020
Come on.

518
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,180
Let me put it on for you.

519
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,980
Qingqing, at your age,

520
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,460
you're in your prime,

521
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,970
so everything looks good on you.

522
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,860
Qingqing?

523
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,050
Your Grace,

524
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,290
Master Jingming and Consort Jiangli
are here to see you.

525
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:22,390
Greetings, Master Jingming.

526
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,220
Danling, how thoughtful of you

527
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,660
to bring hairpins and a mirror to match.

528
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,350
Are you afraid that Qingqing
might forget something?

529
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:32,290
What a coincidence.

530
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,460
I also brought a gift today.

531
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,040
Qingqing,

532
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:38,120
this is the Taiyi ointment
I specially made for you.

533
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,090
Use it every morning and evening.

534
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,810
When this jar runs out,

535
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,130
your scars

536
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,420
should be gone.

537
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,130
Who wants your hypocritical ointment?

538
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,700
Qingqing, just take it.

539
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,260
This is also Jiangli's kind gesture.

540
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,090
I believe Jiangli

541
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,850
would never have
her kind gesture backfire

542
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,460
like she used to.

543
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,050
Danling, don't beat around the bush.

544
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:03,660
None of us are in the mood

545
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,610
to listen to your roundabout hints.

546
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,130
I'm just worried about Qingqing.

547
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,610
After all,
this is not a proper medicine.

548
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,150
I'm afraid something might go wrong.

549
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,370
I went with my wife

550
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:17,740
to buy the medicine and prepare

551
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,770
the ointment.

552
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:19,970
What?

553
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,660
Do you think

554
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,770
I'd harm my own sister?

555
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,410
I...

556
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,500
Qingqing,

557
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,390
the matter from back then

558
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,130
was a design to frame me.

559
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,050
Today, I'm going to present

560
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,050
the truth to you.

561
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:43,210
Hexiang.

562
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,570
Jiangli,

563
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,090
why bring a maid that I sent away?

564
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,370
Could it be

565
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,900
you bribed Hexiang

566
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,280
to frame me?

567
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,530
Danling, you're so calm.

568
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,260
It seems you know
Hexiang was poisoned

569
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:00,090
and is now deaf, mute,

570
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,220
and illiterate.

571
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:08,290
Is this your witness?

572
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:11,260
When Hexiang served me,

573
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:14,180
she was such a clever girl.

574
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,610
Now that she's with you,

575
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,500
why is she deaf and mute?

576
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,080
Did someone

577
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,760
fear Hexiang
would reveal the truth,

578
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,460
so they poisoned her

579
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,330
and brought her to Qingqing

580
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,980
to confuse the situation

581
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:28,220
and twist the truth?

582
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,660
Shen Jiangli,

583
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:33,660
how vicious of you.

584
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,220
You can't even spare a maid
like Hexiang.

585
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:38,610
Qingqing,

586
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,260
when we found Hexiang,

587
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:42,660
she was already like this.

588
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:44,210
Master Jingming,

589
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,350
you don't know the vicious methods
in the inner chambers.

590
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,460
If Jiangli

591
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,430
wanted to show you this,

592
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,620
but she was afraid
you'd notice something fishy,

593
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,740
she'd surely poison Hexiang

594
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,570
behind your back.

595
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,340
Danling,

596
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:58,220
don't judge others by yourself.

597
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,420
If it really was me,

598
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,260
why did Hexiang become so frightened

599
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:04,500
when she saw you, trembling in fear?

600
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,740
Anyone with eyes can see

601
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,050
who Hexiang is afraid of.

602
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,980
It's because you pressured her.

603
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,660
Hexiang can't speak.

604
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,220
Only I can save her,

605
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,090
so she's desperate.

606
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:24,500
Qingqing,

607
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,770
actually, I usually

608
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,980
don't argue like this with others,

609
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,310
but I'm afraid you'll misunderstand me

610
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:33,290
if I don't explain clearly.

611
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:34,650
Sister Ling,

612
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,740
I...

613
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,570
Since everyone believes

614
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,050
that Hexiang would tell the truth,

615
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,980
why don't we let Hexiang speak

616
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,320
and come to a conclusion?

617
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:44,860
Shen Jiangli,

618
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,090
what more do you want?

619
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,290
With Hexiang like this,

620
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,460
how can she speak?

621
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,500
Mr. Song,

622
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:54,690
please come in.

623
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:03,970
Mr. Song,

624
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:05,260
why are you...?

625
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,290
Mr. Song,

626
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,130
why are you here?

627
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,850
Master Jingming and Consort Jiangli

628
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,740
asked me for help.

629
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:14,450
Qingqing,

630
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:17,180
Mr. Song is your first tutor.

631
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,340
He's a man of virtue.

632
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,850
You'll believe him, right?

633
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,090
Mr. Song, what do you want to say?

634
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,700
I don't want to say anything,

635
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,850
but I know a little

636
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,370
about tapping signaling.

637
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,850
Tapping signaling?

638
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,900
Hong Village in the west of the city

639
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,660
used to be a place full of gamblers.

640
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,020
To make cheating easier,

641
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,020
they invented tapping signaling.

642
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:43,290
After the Prefect ordered a crackdown,

643
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,700
many of the gamblers left,

644
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,370
but the method
still survives in the village.

645
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:48,860
Mr. Song,

646
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,610
since Hexiang cannot speak,

647
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,370
I'll ask the questions.

648
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:55,130
Please deliver the message by tapping.

649
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:56,850
Hexiang can nod

650
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,260
or shake her head in response.

651
00:27:59,050 --> 00:27:59,900
Yes.

652
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:02,930
Hexiang,

653
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,670
all the parties involved are here today.

654
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:05,660
You just need to answer

655
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,460
Jiangli's questions.

656
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:17,690
Hexiang,

657
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,020
first question.

658
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,540
Five years ago,

00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:21,980
did you know about Tai

660
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:23,370

661
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,420
