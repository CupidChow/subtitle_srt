22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,850
Over there.

23
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,560
Those lanterns are so beautiful.

24
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,560
How thoughtful.

25
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,510
I'm glad you like them.

26
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,880
Jiangli spent

27
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,280
several days preparing them.

28
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,160
This is what I should do.

29
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,280
Yao helped a lot too.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,720
What I did was nothing.

31
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,470
It was Jiangli who ran around
taking care of everything.

32
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,230
My daughter helped too.

33
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,040
She also put in a lot of effort.

34
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,440
Seeing my sisters-in-law perform

35
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,880
at the Peace Banquet,

36
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,750
I believe you must've worked hard on it.

37
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,880
It moved me deeply.

38
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,160
So after the lantern event,

39
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,750
I prepared a floral banquet for everyone

40
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,230
to enjoy and appreciate.

41
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,840
A floral banquet?

42
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,510
That's unheard of

43
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,040
in Xizhou.

44
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,120
How wonderful.

45
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,350
Qilan also

46
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,280
ran around

47
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,880
and helped a lot.

48
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,120
Grand Lady, Princess Chuya,

49
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,790
I prepared lotus lanterns for everyone.

50
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,670
We can make wishes together.

51
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,670
Grandmother, it's so delicate.

52
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,630
Yes, yes.

53
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,720
It's so beautiful.

54
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,160
Grand Lady,

55
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,560
I had this made

56
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,750
by the most famous artisan

57
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,670
in Dongzhou.

58
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,560
It's perfect for making wishes.

59
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
We can make a wish?

60
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,440
Yes, we can.

61
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,720
I'm done.

62
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,670
I also prepared sky lanterns
for everyone.

63
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,000
We can release them together

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,500
to pray for peace in the four states.

65
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,720
That's wonderful.

66
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,350
What is

67
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,720
this lovely fragrance?

68
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,430
Grand Lady, you smelled it?

69
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,790
It's Jiangli's idea.

70
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,200
In Dongzhou,

71
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,910
the sky lanterns carry blessings.

72
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,910
Ordinary sky lanterns

73
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,110
are usually made
from flame-resistant white cotton.

74
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,600
The sky lanterns

75
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,760
Jiangli prepared for you

76
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,960
have different flowers

77
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,430
pressed into them.

78
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,310
Your lantern

79
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,670
has gladioli.

80
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,080
This flower

81
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,870
is strong and resolute like you.

82
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,600
Grandmother, what a beautiful meaning.

83
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,240
This one is for the princess.

84
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,960
It has dendrobium flowers.

85
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,760
They symbolize sharpness and courage,

86
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,430
just like the princess.

87
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,870
They also stand

88
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,790
for auspiciousness and purity.

89
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,280
It's a blessing from Dongzhou

90
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,470
to the princess.

91
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,090
Thank you, Consort Jiangli.

92
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,430
I really like it.

93
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:09,910
We're glad you like it.

94
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,760
What's wrong?

95
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,200
Princess Chuya, were you burned?

96
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,360
It's nothing serious.

97
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,310
Just a small injury. It's nothing.

98
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,470
And what counts as serious?

99
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,200
Chuya is the princess of Xizhou.

100
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:35,470
Is this...

101
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,470
Is this how Dongzhou treats its guests?

102
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:38,990
Shen Jiangli,

103
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,760
look at the trouble you've caused.

104
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,200
Guards,

105
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,230
take her away.

106
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,400
Confine her to the Prefect's Mansion
for punishment.

107
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,600
See?

108
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,280
You just said it was fine.

109
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,310
I saw that the consort

110
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,520
didn't do it on purpose.

111
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,160
You're the princess of Xizhou.

112
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,870
You represent Xizhou.

113
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,230
If we just let this go,

114
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,520
outsiders will think

115
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,550
Xizhou is easy to push around.

116
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:19,990
So,

117
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,280
whether it was intentional or not,

118
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,720
we must be serious about it.

119
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,760
Understood.

120
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,760
My Lady, Your Grace,

121
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,330
Consort Qilan requests an audience.

122
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,990
Grandmother,

123
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,400
why do you think she's here?

124
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,840
It must be about the rivalry
among consorts.

125
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,910
Be smart.

126
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,520
Don't get yourself entangled.

127
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,120
Sit first.

128
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,240
Your Grace,

129
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,400
I'm here today

130
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,160
to plead for my sister.

131
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,310
Sister?

132
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,430
You may not know.

133
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,910
Consort Jiangli

134
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,280
is not only my sister-in-law,

135
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,600
but we also share a father.

136
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,280
She can be

137
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,670
careless at times,

138
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,670
but she means no harm.

139
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,670
However, at the lantern event today,

140
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,280
I truly don't know why

141
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,870
everyone's lanterns were fine,

142
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,720
except for yours.

143
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
If not for your quick reflexes,

144
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,310
it would've seriously hurt you.

145
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,790
I believe

146
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,640
Jiangli didn't do it on purpose.

147
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:30,870
I hope you can

148
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,640
show her mercy.

149
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,680
Mercy?

150
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,870
I never said she'd be punished.

151
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,350
Your Grace, you're here

152
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,470
as a symbol of harmony
between our two states.

153
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,040
As Jiangli has hurt you,
she'll surely be punished.

154
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,720
Your Grace,

155
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,640
please plead for her before the Prefect.

156
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,550
This is your internal affairs.

157
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,290
I believe Lady Wang and the Prefect

158
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,230
will know what to do

159
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,070
with this.

160
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,670
You're right.

161
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,110
You are Consort Qilan?

162
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,230
Who is your husband then?

163
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,470
Lu Jingxiu, the Prefect's eldest son.

164
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,600
How old is he this year?

165
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,960
How tall is he?

166
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,720
What does he look like?

167
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,280
Has he been to Xizhou?

168
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,040
Your Grace, why are you asking this?

169
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,350
I'm just asking out of curiosity.

170
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,390
It's nothing.

171
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,190
Men from Xizhou are different

172
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,000
from yours in Dongzhou,

173
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,040
especially the Prefect's sons.

174
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,120
They must be extraordinary.

175
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,670
Tell me more about him.

176
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,120
Sure.

177
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,760
My husband...

178
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,010
Young Master,
I have something to report.

179
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,030
What is it?

180
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,030
The man in black who was tailing you

181
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,840
during the siege at Lingshui

182
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,400
showed up recently in Dongzhou,

183
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,280
but our men lost him.

184
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,510
Dongzhou?

185
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,790
Could it be

186
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,280
someone in Dongzhou has been

187
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,890
colluding with Xizhou all along?

188
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,040
Bad news!

189
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,120
Why in such a panic?

190
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,250
Consort Jiangli held
a lotus lantern event,

191
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,500
and Princess Chuya was burned.

192
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,480
She's now confined.

193
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,320
What?

194
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,670
Father.

195
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,360
Jingming,

196
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,240
why the rush?

197
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,400
Father,

198
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,240
I heard

199
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,710
about Princess Chuya being burned.

200
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,150
I believe

201
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,480
something's fishy about it.

202
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,880
Please

203
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,360
don't punish Jiangli for now.

204
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,280
No need to plead for her.

205
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,670
Father,

206
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:49,710
you...

207
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,480
I already let her go.

208
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,070
Before you arrived,

209
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,190
Princess Chuya

210
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,910
sent word saying

211
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,590
that she believed Jiangli
didn't mean any harm

212
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,790
and that her injury wasn't serious.

213
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,630
She didn't want to make
a big deal out of it.

214
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,400
It seems Princess Chuya

215
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,830
is quite magnanimous.

216
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,430
Thank you, Father.

217
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,720
Then

218
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:13,950
I'll take my leave.

219
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,270
Sure, go ahead.

220
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,270
You...

221
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,160
Are you okay?

222
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,070
I'm fine.

223
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,400
Why are you suddenly back?

224
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,160
I heard about the lantern event

225
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,190
and rushed back overnight.

226
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,160
Then you should rest well tonight.

227
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,400
Are you still thinking
about the lantern event?

228
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,270
White phosphorus?

229
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,300
Its ignition temperature
is extremely low,

230
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,270
and it ignites easily in air.

231
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,760
To be safe,

232
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,790
the culprit behind it

233
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,480
must've acted on the spot

234
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,140
instead of spreading it in advance.

235
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,940
They had access to the lanterns

236
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,220
and could attend the event.

237
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,120
It's not hard to guess who it is.

238
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,260
We have to make the enemy hurt.

239
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,040
Let's find evidence first.

240
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,830
Master Jingming,

241
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,640
the princess invites you
to the post house

242
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,590
for a meeting.

243
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,480
You've met the princess before?

244
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,510
Never.

245
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,280
Forge tit.

246
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,240
If she's asked to see you,
it must be important.

247
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:32,790
As for today's matter,

248
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,360
please thank her on my behalf.

249
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,190
Don't worry. I will.

250
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,520
Then wait here for me to return.

251
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,960
Don't worry.

252
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,570
- Let's go.
- Please.

253
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,000
Grandmother,

254
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,190
try this osmanthus cake.

255
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,600
Alright.

256
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,200
Chuya,

257
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,950
you look quite pleased today.

258
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,400
Did something good happen?

259
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,910
I believe

260
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,520
I've found the one who saved my life.

261
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:06,950
Who is it?

262
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,240
That day,

263
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,430
I saw someone

264
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,760
who looked just like him.

265
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,910
I believe

266
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:15,950
it must be him.

267
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,710
He looked extraordinary

268
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,760
and moved freely
within the Prefect's Mansion.

269
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,280
He must be

270
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,880
the Prefect's son.

271
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,760
The Prefect of Dongzhou

272
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,400
has three sons.

273
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,910
Which one is it?

274
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,790
His third son, Lu Jingxing,

275
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,000
was still very young five years ago.

276
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,040
Yesterday,

277
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,950
I also asked Consort Qilan

278
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,790
about his eldest son, Lu Jingxiu.

279
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,430
It didn't match.

280
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,080
So,

281
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,310
it must be...

282
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,670
Master Jingming is here.

283
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:51,790
In that case,

284
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,360
you two should talk properly.

285
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,750
Master Jingming.

286
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,880
Your Grace.

287
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,480
I came today

288
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,100
to thank you for speaking

289
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,430
on my wife's behalf.

290
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,760
Master Jingming, please sit.

291
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,880
I know

292
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,160
she didn't mean to hurt me.

293
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,160
But I pleaded for her

294
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,950
not just for her sake

295
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:54,910
but for yours.

296
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,790
For me?

297
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,790
I wanted you to come and thank me.

298
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,040
You don't remember me?

299
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,590
Five years ago,

300
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,550
on our border...

301
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,670
You want us to be rough, huh?

302
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,510
Get her!

303
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:24,420
(Five years ago)

304
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,670
Get lost!

305
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,950
Let's go.

306
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,520
Miss, where do you live?

307
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,360
This area is unstable.

308
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,670
Bandits often pass through.

309
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,120
You should head home soon.

310
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,910
Thank you for saving me.

311
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,120
I haven't asked your name yet.

312
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,310
I'm just an ordinary soldier
of Dongzhou.

313
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,590
You needn't keep it

314
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,000
in your heart.

315
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,760
But how will I find you again?

316
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,640
We don't need to meet again.

317
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,760
If peace comes between our two states,

318
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,590
countless people like us will meet.

319
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,000
It's you.

320
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,390
I never thought

321
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,950
you'd be the princess of Xizhou.

322
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,520
Nor did I expect

323
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,430
you'd be a master of Dongzhou.

324
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,500
After returning to Xizhou,

325
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,160
I sent people to search for you,

326
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,710
but I never found any trace.

327
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,040
Not long after that,

328
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,070
the Battle of Lingshui

329
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,590
broke out between our states.

330
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,360
Xizhou

331
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,190
sent General Wen Du.

332
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,600
And Dongzhou's troops

333
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,280
were ambushed

334
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,070
while pursuing him.

335
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:46,860
Our forces were wiped out,

336
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,510
and I

337
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,000
was gravely injured

338
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,000
and withdrew from the battlefield.

339
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,600
Wen Du

340
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,480
is a high official of Xizhou.

341
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,160
He's always been pro-war.

342
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,590
I remember

343
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,170
it was Dongzhou

344
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,360
who started the battle at Lingshui,

345
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,460
and he immediately led troops
to fight back.

346
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,150
So, he was

347
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,830
against my peace mission this time.

348
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,770
What do you mean, Your Grace?

349
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,310
It was Xizhou

350
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,070
who provoked the war,

351
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,520
and Dongzhou only responded.

352
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,000
Was it not Dongzhou
who started the fire first,

353
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,640
burning a whole village on our border?

354
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,190
It was because Xizhou first captured

355
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,040
over 100 hostages from our border.

356
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,070
What is going on here?

357
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,950
All these years,

358
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,950
I've felt there was something strange

359
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,560
about the Battle of Lingshui.

360
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,160
Since then,

361
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,310
Jingxiu has led

362
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,520
all battles between us.

363
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,670
I've counted.

364
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,240
There were

365
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,550
five major wars

366
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:00,950
and over a dozen

367
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,240
skirmishes.

368
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,110
Yet all those combined

369
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,390
didn't cause as many casualties

370
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,280
as the Battle of Lingshui alone.

371
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,240
Why is that?

372
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,310
Now it seems

373
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,680
someone was behind this.

374
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,350
I'll send people to investigate again

375
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,720
in Xizhou.

376
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,760
Good.

377
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,000
I'll look into things here

378
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,550
in Dongzhou as well.

379
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:28,740
Lu Jingming,

380
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,480
if you need my help,

381
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,490
just come and find me.

382
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,200
Thank you, Your Grace.

383
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,550
(Ride with Wind)
Why not stay longer, Grand Lady?

384
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,520
You can enjoy the sights of Dongzhou.

385
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,350
I do enjoy

386
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,390
the scenery here,

387
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,760
but there are things to do in Xizhou.

388
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,310
I dare not linger.

389
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,790
In that case,

390
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,040
I'll say goodbye to you both here.

391
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,670
My Lord,

392
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,000
I won't return with Grandmother.

393
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,150
I can't control her anymore.

394
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,960
My Lord, I'll leave her to your care.

395
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,590
Sure.

396
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,440
Since you want to stay,

397
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,240
you must have unfinished matters.

398
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,520
If you need assistance,

399
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,480
just let me know.

400
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,350
I'll do my utmost to help.

401
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:24,390
Thank you, My Lord.

402
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,790
I wish to stay and seek a husband.

403
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:30,710
A husband?

404
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,240
Sorry, My Lord.

405
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:33,480
She's been spoiled by me

406
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,040
since childhood.

407
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,240
She's headstrong

408
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,910
and unruly.

409
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,000
However,

410
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,760
I believe

411
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,960
if the two states form ties by marriage,

412
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,630
it would benefit both sides.

413
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,150
But I only have three sons,

414
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,480
and all of them are married.

415
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,410
The princess is of noble birth.

416
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,680
Well...

417
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,520
My Lord,

418
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,520
if I truly like someone,

419
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,920
I don't care about their background

420
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,350
or their marital status.

421
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,070
I just want to stay
and have a look first.

422
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,920
As for whether the two states

423
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,520
can be joined through marriage,

424
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,680
we'll see if any Dongzhou men

425
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,390
can catch my eye.

426
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,200
Very well.

427
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,350
Please take care of her.

428
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,310
You're too kind, Grand Lady.

429
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,350
The princess is a distinguished guest.

430
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,310
Please rest assured, Grand Lady.

431
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,390
See?

432
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,810
The Prefect treats you well.

433
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,590
Don't always throw a tantrum

434
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,790
and bother him.

435
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,550
Got it, Grandmother.

436
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,040
Mother.

437
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,680
We were so close.

438
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,720
If peace between the two states

439
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,110
is ruined because of Shen Jiangli,

440
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,240
she'll have to die.

441
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,920
It's too bad

442
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,480
that Princess Chuya
was only lightly injured,

443
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,150
and Shen Jiangli

444
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,630
got off unscathed.

445
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,040
Qilan.

446
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,390
Master Jingming.

447
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,610
- Qilan.
- You're here.

448
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,790
I heard the princess of Xizhou

449
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,930
was hurt at the lantern event.

450
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,200
Did you do this?

451
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,150
I knew nothing of it.

452
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,760
How would I dare interfere

453
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,390
in matters between two states?

454
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,800
Master Jingming,

455
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,440
do you suspect me?

456
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,440
How could I suspect you?

457
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,200
You're kind and clever.

458
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,350
I trust you the most.

459
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,480
Then why do you

460
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,350
look so troubled?

461
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,070
Yesterday,

462
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,680
I heard Jingming and Princess Chuya

463
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,410
stayed at the post house
for quite a while.

464
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,630
And today,

465
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,790
Princess Chuya reported to Father

466
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,590
that she wants to seek a husband here.

467
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,550
Who is your husband then?

468
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,920
How old is he this year?

469
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,440
How tall is he?

470
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,790
What does he look like?

471
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,390
Has he been to Xizhou?

472
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,280
He must be quite impressive.

473
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,680
Tell me more.

474
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,960
(Is she interested in Master Jingxiu?)

475
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,650
(I'd better stay away from her.)

476
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,150
If Jingming gets close
to Princess Chuya,

477
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,280
Father will surely hold him
in higher regard.

478
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,280
Then Jingming will have
the upper hand again.

479
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,000
I must stir up some trouble

480
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,480
for him.

481
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,960
Don't worry, Master Jingxiu.

482
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,390
I'll take care of it.

483
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,920
(Just as Master Jingming suspected,)

484
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,040
(there was something wrong)

485
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,550
(with the Battle of Lingshui.)

486
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,200
Mentor!

487
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:35,990
What's wrong?

488
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,590
Another nightmare?

489
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,110
Maybe it's because of the visit
from Xizhou.

490
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,310
It brought back some memories,

491
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,550
so now I feel a bit unsettled.

492
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:55,040
Let the past go.

493
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:57,550
Try to sleep.

494
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,070
I'll always be here with you.

495
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,480
- Mother.
- You're here.

496
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,320
Mother.

497
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,590
Sit down.

498
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,530
- Come on.
- Come on.

499
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,070
You've probably heard of it.

500
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,310
Princess Chuya is staying here

501
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,960
to find a husband.

502
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,880
Yes, I heard.

503
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,960
The Prefect has instructed

504
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,520
you two to look after her.

505
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,630
She's of noble status.

506
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,870
You must protect her.

507
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,150
Do not let any negligence

508
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,140
harm the relationship
between our two states.

509
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,280
I understand.

510
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,680
In my view,

511
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,920
Qilan should be the one

512
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,040
to host the princess.

513
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,270
After all,
at the lantern event last time,

514
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,920
Jiangli hurt the princess.

515
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,390
I'm afraid the princess
might hold a grudge

516
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,040
if she sees Jiangli.

517
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,150
Jinyi,

518
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,830
the princess may not be that petty.

519
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,680
Besides, this hasn't been settled.

520
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:22,070
How can you blame Jiangli so quickly?

521
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,110
You can't just blame her

522
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,240
whenever something goes wrong.

523
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,830
Xiulan,

524
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,720
I was only making a suggestion.

525
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:32,310
Why are you getting so defensive?

526
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,760
Mother.

527
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,800
Lady Shu.

528
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,040
I should be the one

529
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,550
to host the princess,

530
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,390
but I've been

531
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,040
feeling unwell lately.

532
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,760
I've caught a chill these days.

533
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,040
I'm afraid I can't manage.

534
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,720
Has the private physician checked?

535
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,550
Yes.

536
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,480
He told me to rest in bed.

537
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,920
Then you should rest properly.

538
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,830
Jiangli, you will take charge

539
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,070
of looking after the princess.

540
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,040
Yes. I'll see to it.

541
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,280
Very well.

542
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,440
Handle it properly this time.

543
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,790
Consider it a chance

544
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:06,960
to make up for your mistake.

545
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,080
Jiangli.

546
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,110
Jiangli,

547
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,240
I've looked into everything

548
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,040
you asked.

549
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,000
Muxiang and Shuixiang were

550
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,240
in charge of the lantern event,

551
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,990
but I found nothing suspicious

552
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,480
about them.

553
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,590
But white phosphorus

554
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,650
wouldn't appear in lanterns
for no reason,

555
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,790
and it just happened to be
in the princess's lantern.

556
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,830
Yulan, keep digging.

557
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,040
Yes, Jiangli.

558
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,520
Why are your hands so cold?

559
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,310
I was so caught up talking

560
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,600
that I didn't notice.

561
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,200
Were you discussing the lantern event?

562
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,720
There's still no progress.

563
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:02,960
Don't worry.

564
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,920
Everything leaves traces.

565
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,920
The one behind it won't escape.

566
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,110
By the way,

567
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,720
when Lady Wang and Lady Shu

568
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,610
asked me and Qilan
to look after the princess,

569
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,910
she...

570
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,150
Is something wrong?

571
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,630
Ever since Ms. Zou passed,

572
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,830
Qilan has competed with me
over everything.

573
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,590
But this time, when Lady Wang

574
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,480
asked her to take charge,

575
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,960
she claimed to be ill and refused.

576
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,550
I feel something's off.

577
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,760
You're right

578
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,440
to be cautious.

579
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:35,820
Just pay more attention.

580
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,600
However,

581
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,300
the princess

582
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,720
isn't hard to get along with.

583
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,850
You just need to treat her with respect.

584
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,960
You speak

585
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,110
as if you know her well.

586
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,840
It's a coincidence.

587
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,350
Five years ago,

588
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,550
on our border,

589
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,070
she was attacked by bandits.

590
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,720
I happened to pass by and saved her.

591
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,200
So, we met once.

592
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,240
The princess

593
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,870
is staying here to find a husband.

594
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,400
Does she already have someone in mind?

595
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,080
It's not you, is it?

596
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,080
Don't worry.

597
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,110
In this life,

598
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:10,590
I only love you.

599
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,200
Have some tea, Consort Jiangli.

600
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:19,630
You too.

601
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,820
(Liuyun Post House)

602
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,790
Your Grace,

603
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,630
you're our honored guest,

604
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,920
so I prepared

605
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,280
this poetic banquet for you.

606
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,110
How thoughtful.

607
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,480
I really like it.

608
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:51,630
What's this smell?

609
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,200
There is

610
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:54,440
a light fruity fragrance.

611
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:56,920
I made it myself.

612
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,890
It's the pear fragrance.

613
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,240
If you like it,

614
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,490
I can have more sent to you

615
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:01,880
and you can take it back to Xizhou.

616
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,390
Thank you, Consort Jiangli.

617
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,440
You must know

618
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,960
I stayed here

619
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,280
to seek a husband.

620
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,350
But the noblemen who've sent
their visiting cards these days

621
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,760
are quite disappointing.

622
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,550
No need to rush, Your Grace.

623
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,790
Marriage is a major life decision.

624
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,700
It's not just about family background
or education.

625
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,380
Character and personality matter more.

626
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,960
Whether you love each other

627
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:26,310
and can get along

628
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,850
for the rest of your life
is more important.

629
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:31,350
You're right.

630
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,800
Your Grace,

631
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,150
what kind of man do you like?

632
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,590
Maybe I can help keep an eye out.

633
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,280
Naturally, someone handsome,

634
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,240
elegant,

635
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,040
and manly,

636
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,680
like

637
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,440
Master Jingming.

638
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,230
Your Grace,

639
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,680
I heard

640
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,550
you and Jingming knew each other

641
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:52,760
from before.

642
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,440
Five years ago,
on the border of Dongzhou,

643
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,790
he once saved me.

644
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,680
This time, I came to Dongzhou

645
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,790
to find him

646
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,440
and express my gratitude.

647
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,590
There's no need, Princess.

648
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,580
Your identity as the princess
of Xizhou doesn't matter.

649
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,000
Jingming would

650
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,960
help anyone in danger.

651
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,760
Yes.

652
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,550
That's what makes him so special.

653
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,830
Truly unforgettable.

654
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,550
If only

655
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:21,200
I could have a husband like him.

656
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,440
You're so cool and sincere.

657
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,240
You'll surely find someone you like.

658
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,480
Your Grace, please enjoy your meal.

659
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,350
I'll take my leave.

660
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,520
I'll walk you out.

661
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:39,980
(Liuyun Post House)

662
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,150
Please stay, Your Grace.

663
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,300
What are you doing here?

664
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,210
The timing seemed about right,

665
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,520
so I came to take you home.

666
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,590
Greetings, Master Jingming.

667
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:51,920
Your Grace.

668
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,280
We'll head back now.

669
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:54,990
Master Jingming.

670
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,890
Wait.

671
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,400
There's something I'd like to discuss.

672
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,630
What is it, Your Grace?

673
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,630
You asked me to look into something,

674
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,680
and I've received a reply.

675
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,040
I'd like to talk in detail,

676
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,390
but

677
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,350
there are too many people here.

678
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,410
This is not a good place.

679
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,480
Master Jingming,

680
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:10,680
please come inside with me.

681
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,790
I need to talk with the princess.

682
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,680
Let Yunjiu escort you home first, okay?

683
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,020
Do I need to wait for you?

684
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:19,960
No need.

685
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,280
I'll be home once I'm done.

686
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:22,950
Yunjiu.

687
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,110
Master Jingming, this way.

688
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:26,950
Please.

689
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,060
(Liuyun Post House)

690
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:31,910
My Lady?

691
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,840
My Lady?

692
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,720
Let's head back.

693
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,760
Master Jingming, have a seat.

694
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,080
We've found him.

695
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,920
A lieutenant under Wen Du's command.

696
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,060
(To Grand Princess)
He confessed to inciting conflict

697
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,000
between the two states.

698
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,920
Can a mere lieutenant

699
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:02,680
have such power?

700
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,240
According to his statement,

701
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:05,550
he's a spy from Nanzhou

702
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,240
planted in Xizhou.

703
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,590
Everything he did

704
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,920
was to drain the strength

705
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,070
and resources of Dongzhou and Xizhou,

706
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:15,200
so Nanzhou could grow its power

707
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,550
while the two of us were fighting.

708
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,000
Your Grace,

709
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,310
do you believe him?

710
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,150
Do you think

711
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,760
there's more to it?

712
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,790
When we searched his home,

713
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,790
we found forged letters of challenge

714
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,070
and letters of close contact

715
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,590
with Nanzhou.

716
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,870
I don't think it's so simple.

717
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,140
The war records

718
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,590
start

719
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,720
from the Battle of Lingshui.

720
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,310
What does that mean?

721
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,520
Before that,

722
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,790
Dongzhou and Xizhou
had fought over 20 battles,

723
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,240
yet none were recorded,

724
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,200
and the reports start exactly
from the Battle of Lingshui.

725
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,490
Besides,

726
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,550
in that battle,

727
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,280
our forces were equal in strength.

728
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,480
Why was Dongzhou's army

729
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,150
completely wiped out in the end?

730
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,480
Are you saying

731
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,720
someone wanted us to see those reports

732
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:08,110
to mislead us?

733
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,430
Perhaps

734
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,960
someone leaked my strategies

735
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,920
to Wen Du in advance.

736
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,550
Or perhaps

737
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:22,720
they set up

738
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,040
that entire battle for me.

739
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,560
They wanted me

740
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,790
to die there.

741
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,210
They just didn't expect me

742
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,870
to survive.

743
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,200
But my men

744
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,200
interrogated Wen Du

745
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,200
about the Battle of Lingshui.

746
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,680
He only said

747
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,350
that all was fair in war

748
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,450
and that you acted recklessly
out of ambition

749
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,960
so you fell into his trap.

750
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,110
If what you said is true

751
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,630
and Wen Du knew your strategy
in advance,

752
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,240
then someone in your army

753
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,310
must have betrayed you.

754
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,590
Think carefully.

755
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,280
Was there

756
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,870
anyone suspicious?

757
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,840
I don't know.

758
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,390
Could it really be

759
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,480
that the Battle of Lingshui

760
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,920
was my mistake for being headstrong?

761
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,280
I know

762
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,310
you've never let go

763
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,720
of what happened back then.

764
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,680
But I believe

765
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:22,830
the soldiers who died

766
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,150
wouldn't want to see you

767
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:25,830
living in sorrow.

768
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,000
I hope

769
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,630
you can still be
the brightest young general

770
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,480
in the four states.

771
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,920
I'll do everything I can

772
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,150
to help you uncover the truth.

773
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,280
If someone really framed you,

774
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,720
I won't let them go.

775
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,150
Thank you, Your Grace.

776
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,200
I'll take my leave.

777
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:50,870
You can just call me Chuya.

778
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,940
(Liuyun Post House)

779
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,800
By the way, Yunyi,

780
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,480
any new leads

781
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,390
on that man in black?

782
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:08,710
Young Master,

783
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,800
none of our men

784
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,920
have found anything.

785
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,870
It's like he vanished into thin air.

786
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,760
Keep watching

787
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,040
Jingxiu's mansion.

788
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,680
Yes.

789
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,340
(Liuyun Post House)

790
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,390
Mother.

791
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,200
Qilan.

792
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,110
How's your health now?

793
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,880
Do you feel better now?

794
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,190
No need to worry, Mother.

795
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,230
I've gotten much better.

796
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,150
I just need a few more days of rest.

797
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,040
Once you recover,

798
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,800
go visit the princess more often.

799
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,590
Don't let Shen Jiangli

800
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,750
hog all the attention.

801
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,710
Others might think

802
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,840
we lack manners.

803
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,550
Besides,

804
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,400
you already know

805
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,400
why Chuya stayed here.

806
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,480
Yes, Mother.

807
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,480
She's looking for a husband.

808
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,750
Good.

809
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,880
Sit down.

810
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,190
You often stay in the inner chambers,

811
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,590
so you may not know
about the situation in Xizhou.

812
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:19,320
Chuya is the late Prefect's
eldest daughter.

813
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,190
Now,

814
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:23,480
her younger brother is the Prefect.

815
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,520
He's only seven years old.

816
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,040
So, Chuya and the Grand Lady are helping

817
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,250
with state affairs in Xizhou.

818
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,630
Chuya's status is extremely noble.

819
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,480
Though she says

820
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,190
she doesn't care

821
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,550
about status or background

822
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,440
when choosing her husband,

823
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,190
not just anyone

824
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,440
can match her.

825
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,710
Even if Chuya likes someone,

826
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,960
Xizhou might not agree.

827
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,590
So, I've been thinking.

828
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,360
Is there anyone in Dongzhou

829
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,150
worthy of marrying her,

830
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,630
the Grand Princess of Xizhou?

831
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:58,920
I don't know.

832
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,150
Of course, you do.

833
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,040
It's obvious.

834
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,800
Look. Jingxiu

835
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,460
is the Prefect's lineal eldest son.

836
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,070
His status matches Chuya's.

837
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,710
Chuya is helping
with state affairs in Xizhou.

838
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,670
She must be magnanimous

839
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,630
and sensible.

840
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,960
Jingxiu

841
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,270
has been in court for years,

842
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,440
helping the Prefect with state affairs.

843
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,110
Their experiences

844
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,360
are remarkably alike.

845
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,800
Mother, are you suggesting

846
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,840
the princess marry

847
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,750
Master Jingxiu?

848
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,840
See?

849
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,920
Qilan, you're so clever.

850
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,190
Of course,

851
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,670
this would be unfair to you.

852
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,960
But I'll talk to Jingxiu.

853
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,040
You'll still be his wife.

854
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,190
I understand.

855
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,800
I come from humble origins.

856
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,040
As long as I can help Master Jingxiu,

857
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,440
I'll do whatever it takes.

858
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,630
Good.

859
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,000
Jingxiu is the Prefect's
lineal eldest son.

860
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,230
His status is too high

861
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:08,230
for him to court Chuya personally.

862
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:09,750
So,

863
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:10,990
I hope

864
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:13,070
you can help them meet more often

865
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:14,760
so they can

866
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:16,480
grow closer.

867
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,070
I understand.

868
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,800
Alright.

869
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,750
Go back to get some rest.

870
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,190
Please rest early, Mother.

871
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,880
I'll take my leave.

872
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,710
My Lady,

873
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,110
will Consort Qilan

874
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,700
help Master Jingxiu marry the princess?

875
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,350
If she knows her place,

876
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,710
she should understand

877
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,710
that she'll rise and fall

878
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,670
along with Jingxiu.

879
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,840
Why would she be upset about it?
