My Lady.

Please.

25
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,990
Please see Ms. Qilan.

26
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,040
I beg you, My Lady.

27
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,680
My Lady...

28
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,640
She's coming.

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,590
No need to wait.

Consort Jiangli won't come out.

00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:57,990
Hurry back.

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,270
- Miss Yulan.
- Yulan.

33
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,440
Jiangli.

34
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,750
Jiangli.

35
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,160
Jiangli.

36
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,470
Jiangli, please come out and see me.

37
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,630
Please come out, My Lady.

38
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,550
Jiangli.

39
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,200
Jiangli.

40
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,200
Go back.

41
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,150
There's nothing left to say between us.

42
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,830
Jiangli,

43
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,870
I brought your favorite bush lily.

44
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,110
Look.

45
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,430
Jiangli,

46
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,150
I'm begging you to spare my mother.

47
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,240
No.

48
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,920
She is the criminal, Zou.

49
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,550
She made a momentary lapse.

50
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,360
She lost her mind because of jealousy.

51
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,550
I know you're in pain,

52
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,150
but she must be punished
for what she's done.

53
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,550
How about this?

54
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,430
I'll have Father abandon her

55
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,930
and send her back to the countryside.

56
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,220
She'll copy scriptures every day

57
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,940
and kneel
before Madam's memorial tablet,

58
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,750
praying and repenting

59
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,600
day and night.

60
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,720
I swear she'll never

61
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,040
appear before you again.

62
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,000
Is that okay, Jiangli?

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,030
I beg you.

64
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,870
Anyone who does wrong

65
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,310
must be punished.

66
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,760
Go back.

67
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,550
Jiangli,

68
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,640
I know.

69
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,310
I know you despise the Shen family,

70
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,030
but so do I.

71
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,640
We both have such a disgraceful father.

72
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,960
And I...

73
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,960
I have such a vulgar mother.

74
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,600
I wished to escape there every day.

75
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,270
You know that, Jiangli.

76
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,150
You've always known.

77
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,680
Since I was little I swore

78
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,190
I'd make something of myself.

79
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,630
I never dared slack off,

80
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,840
always hoping that one day

81
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,090
I could escape the Shen family.

82
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,030
But no matter how hard I try,

83
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,560
I can't change

84
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,360
the fact that I was born
into this family.

85
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,960
No matter how wrong she is,

86
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,830
she's still the one
who gave me life and raised me.

87
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,630
Everything she did

88
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,270
was for me, Jiangli.

89
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,710
Jiangli.

90
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,630
Jiangli, I beg you.

91
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,310
We're sisters,

92
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,790
and we grew up together.

93
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,710
I beg you.

94
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,830
Please have mercy on my mother.

95
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,800
Please spare her life.

96
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,980
Are you the only one with a mother?

97
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,160
Can you bring my mother back?

98
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,070
At least Zou

99
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,300
was there as you grew up,

100
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,680
and she could see you get married.

101
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,710
What about my mother?

102
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,670
She's never even

103
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,590
got to see me grow up.

104
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,760
It's my fault.

105
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,550
Jiangli, you can hit and scold me.

106
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,120
You can do whatever you want to me.

107
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,810
From now on, my mother and I

108
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,870
will serve you like slaves

109
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,870
to atone for our sins.

110
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,310
I'm begging you, Jiangli.

111
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,630
Please show some mercy
for me and my mother.

112
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,760
Shen Qilan,

113
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,310
she killed my mother.

114
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,950
A life for a life.

115
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,950
I will never forgive her,

116
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,120
nor will I forgive

117
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,580
anyone from the Shen family
on my mother's behalf.

118
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,600
Jiangli, I beg you.

119
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,600
I beg you, Jiangli.

120
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,350
My Lady...

121
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,590
Jiangli...

122
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,110
Jiangli...

123
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:04,950
Go back.

124
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,990
Jiangli...

125
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,190
My Lady,

126
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,600
please don't do this.

127
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,670
If Master Jingxiu knows about it,

128
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,310
he'll feel bad for you.

129
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,520
Master Jingxiu...

130
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,840
Yes, Master Jingxiu.

131
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,790
Master Jingxiu.

132
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,720
Master Jingxiu.

133
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,910
Master Jingxiu.

134
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,870
Master Jingxiu, please save my mother.

135
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,790
Qilan.

136
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,190
Qilan, get up.

137
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,150
Master Jingxiu,

138
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,240
my mother was wrong,

139
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,040
but everything she did

140
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,960
was for me.

141
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,720
I grew up

142
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,840
relying only on her.

143
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,820
My mother only did this because Father

144
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,310
was going to give me away.

145
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,520
So, my mother

146
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,950
had to resort to this.

147
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,830
Otherwise,

148
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,310
she would never have dared.

149
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,360
So, Master Jingxiu,

150
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,510
for the sake of our affection,

151
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,360
please save my mother's life.

152
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,920
Please, Master Jingxiu.

153
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,900
I beg you, Master Jingxiu.

154
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,440
Please, Master Jingxiu.

155
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,590
Master Jingxiu.

156
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,270
Master Jingxiu.

157
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,510
If you can step in

158
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,950
and save my mother,

159
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,160
I swear...

160
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,080
I swear I'll serve you

161
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,190
and Lady Wang

162
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,550
more carefully from now on.

163
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,950
Please, Master Jingxiu.

164
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,260
I beg you, Master Jingxiu.

165
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,750
Please save my mother.

166
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,240
Please, Master Jingxiu.

167
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,560
I beg you, Master Jingxiu.

168
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,910
- Please, Master Jingxiu.
- Qilan.

169
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,020
- I beg you.
- Qilan.

170
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,600
Qilan, listen to me.

171
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,920
Seeing you like this truly pains me.

172
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,070
But blood should be paid with blood.

173
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,960
Even if you plead with the Prefect,

174
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,480
it won't change anything, Qilan.

175
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,340
Take a good look at your mother
for the last time.

176
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,750
Is this my food?

177
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,830
I don't want it.

178
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,510
I want food from Tianxiang Tavern.

179
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,990
You, go buy it for me.

180
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,070
Hey.

181
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,360
Do you know who I am?

182
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,990
My daughter is Master Jingxiu's
Lady Lan.

183
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,920
I'm her mother,

184
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,630
so Master Jingxiu is my son-in-law.

185
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,750
Hey, hey.

186
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,840
I'm talking to you. Can you hear me?

187
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,920
You fool.

188
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,150
Pah.

189
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,270
With attitudes like yours,

190
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,130
you'll never get promoted
or make any fortune.

191
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,200
Qilan,

192
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,350
you're here.

193
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,400
Qilan, you're here.

194
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,840
Is this food from Tianxiang Tavern?

195
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,110
It smells amazing.

196
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,790
Glutinous rice lotus root.

197
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,960
It's truly delicious.

198
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,440
How tasty.

199
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,200
Qilan, are you here to take me out?

200
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,270
Has Master Jingxiu resolved everything?

201
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,560
Food from Tianxiang Tavern is the best.

202
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,320
It's tasty.

203
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,870
Truly tasty.

204
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,960
My daughter knows me best.

205
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,350
Qilan,

206
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,590
you're such a clever,

207
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,790
sweet girl.

208
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,670
Someday,

209
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,480
you'll soar and become a phoenix.

210
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,960
From now on,

211
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,870
you'll have to rely on yourself.

212
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:09,340
(Master Jingxiu's Mansion)

213
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,080
Qilan,

214
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,110
I'm sorry.

215
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,480
As Master Jingxiu's concubine,

216
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,750
I should follow your lead in everything.

217
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,870
What my mother did was wrong.

218
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,750
No one could've changed the outcome.

219
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,510
I hope it hasn't affected you.

220
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:11,570
Mrs. Lian,

221
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,670
you're quite healthy.

222
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,240
Though you were exposed to poison,

223
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,630
thankfully, it was brief

224
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,080
and did no lasting harm.

225
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,640
Take the medicine I prescribed on time

226
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,790
and you'll recover.

227
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,560
Thank you, Consort Jiangli.

228
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,870
Mother.

229
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,040
Master Jingming, Consort Jiangli,

230
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,390
thank you for your great kindness

231
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,240
and for saving my mother from danger.

232
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,990
I have nothing to repay you,

233
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,400
but I'm willing to serve you both

234
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,390
for the rest of my life.

235
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,920
Get up.

236
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,870
There's no need for this, Miss Lian.

237
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,270
I don't require anything from you.

238
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,080
Just remember:

239
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,600
Life often goes

240
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,390
beyond our control,

241
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,910
but every path we walk is one we choose.

242
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,600
It was not too late for you to make up

243
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,840
for your mistake this time,

244
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,120
but you must remember this
in the future.

245
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,120
I'll remember your advice,
Master Jingming.

246
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,710
I know you acted out of love
for your mother,

247
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,840
but be careful not to stray again.

248
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,840
Thank you, Jiangli.

249
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,670
If anything happens in the future,

250
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,440
come to me.

251
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,360
Take Mrs. Lian home to rest.

252
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,120
Mother, let's go.

253
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,870
How many people

254
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,440
can come to their senses in time

255
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,780
like Miss Lian did?

256
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,120
Lian Wantang isn't a bad person
by nature.

257
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,200
She was just misled.

258
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,920
If her mother

259
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,990
hadn't been saved,

260
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,750
who knows what she might've done?

261
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,750
Sometimes, people make choices

262
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,360
they don't even want

263
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,630
because they have to.

264
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,480
And in time,

265
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,720
they just go along with it.

266
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,990
Don't overthink it.

267
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,590
At least

268
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,130
the outcome this time is a good one,

269
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,400
right?

270
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,720
It smells wonderful.

271
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,360
My daughter has really grown up.

272
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,720
You know I love lilies.

273
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,960
What?

274
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,840
The flowers aren't for me?

275
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,080
Jiangli's mother's case was concluded.

276
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,960
She must be overwhelmed with emotion,

277
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,260
so I wanted to give her some lilies
to help calm her mind.

278
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,790
My daughter

279
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:48,840
is so thoughtful.

280
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,240
Then, that other pot of lilies

281
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,560
must be for me, right?

282
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,430
If you like them,

283
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,270
I'll send more tomorrow.

284
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,600
So,

285
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,320
this one isn't for me either?

286
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,870
Then who is it for?

287
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,990
No one.

288
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,350
By the way,

289
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,310
I have something to do.

290
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,230
I'm leaving now.

291
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,280
This child...

292
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,630
You are

293
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,840
never calm.

294
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,150
Mother, you're awake.

295
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,150
Yanyan.

296
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,360
Come here.

297
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,440
You're back.

298
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,390
Yulan brought me here.

299
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,640
She said seeing me

300
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,560
would make you feel better.

301
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:37,870
Of course.

302
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,270
Seeing you makes me the happiest.

303
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,320
How's Mentor doing?

304
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,910
He misses you a lot.

305
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,790
Your herbs are growing well.

306
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,030
But where did he go?

307
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,960
Who knows?

308
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,080
It seems he's been busy lately.

309
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,880
How did you know

310
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,750
I was talking about Mr. Cute?

311
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,760
You little rascal.

312
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,120
Teasing your own mother now?

313
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,190
I wasn't.

314
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,640
I miss Mr. Cute.

315
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,320
I'm going to find him and play.

316
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,120
Slow down.

317
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,670
Mr. Cute.

318
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,360
Yanyan, you're back.

319
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,790
Mr. Cute.

320
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,400
I missed you so much.

321
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:32,150
Did you miss me?

322
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,400
Of course, I did.

323
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,440
Mother said

324
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,100
she doesn't know

325
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,630
what you've been busy with lately.

326
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,430
Have you been very busy?

327
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,390
Not at all.

328
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,150
But from today on,

329
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,790
you can't call me Mr. Cute anymore.

330
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,080
Then what should I call you?

331
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,280
Mr. Ugly?

332
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,160
You have to call me Father.

333
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,310
No way.

334
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,360
I have to ask my mother first.

335
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,360
I'll only call you that if she agrees.

336
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,680
And how can we

337
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,760
get your mother to agree?

338
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,430
Let me think.

339
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,390
Of course, I'm the key.

340
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,670
Can you tell me in secret?

341
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,710
Come on.

342
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,510
Let's make a pinky promise.

343
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,600
We must never go back on our word.

344
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,550
Mother.

345
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,040
Something's wrong.

346
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,280
Go check on Mr. Cute.

347
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,880
What happened?

348
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,120
He said his head hurts,

349
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,520
and he's lying in bed.

350
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,000
But no matter how I called him,

351
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,600
he didn't answer.

352
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,760
I'll go look.

353
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,840
Yanyan, hurry.

354
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:09,030
Jingming.

355
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,110
What's wrong?

356
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,320
Where does it hurt?

357
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,710
Let me see.

358
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,720
Is it your chest?

359
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,760
Mother,

360
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,950
Mr. Cute just ate this.

361
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,910
He is not poisoned, is he?

362
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,960
Almonds?

363
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,000
How could you eat almonds?

364
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,790
Don't you know you can't eat them?

365
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,760
Spit it out.

366
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,600
Mother, I'll call someone.

367
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,630
Here.

368
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,670
Let me check your pulse.

369
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,000
How did you know

370
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,670
I can't eat almonds?

371
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,560
It's not hard to find out

372
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,760
what you can or can't eat.

373
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,230
You're lying.

374
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,190
You knew because Yanyan

375
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,230
can't eat them, right?

376
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,360
Why scare me again?

377
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,120
I don't want to talk to you.

378
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,190
When will you tell me

379
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,560
about five years ago?

380
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,710
Alright.

381
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,520
I'll tell you.

382
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,870
But for every story I share,

383
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,760
you have to share one too.

384
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,030
Deal.

385
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,310
Five years ago,

386
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,100
when you were sent
to the ancestral tomb,

387
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,470
I actually went to see you.

388
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,560
But before I got inside,

389
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,320
I overheard you cursing

390
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,320
my mother and Qingqing,

391
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,280
so I left.

392
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,910
That's impossible.

393
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,080
I'd never say such a thing.

394
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,840
Why didn't you tell me back then?

395
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,560
I didn't believe you.

396
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,720
Hexiang was afraid
I'd hold her accountable,

397
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,630
so she hid the truth.

398
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,760
It wasn't until a few days ago,

399
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,040
when you sent her medicine

400
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,080
for her hearing,

401
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,800
that she felt guilty

402
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,680
and

403
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,420
(Statement)
confessed everything

404
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,800
back then to Mr. Song.

405
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,350
Mr. Song wrote down the truth

406
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,540
(Please forgive Hexiang)
and gave the statement to me.

407
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,950
That's how I found out.

408
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,880
Hurry, Master Jingming is coming.

409
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,840
My Lady,

410
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,880
since Lady Shu ordered you
to copy scriptures,

411
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,840
you might as well listen to her.

412
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,960
If you sincerely repent,

413
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,390
Lady Shu will surely send someone
to bring you back.

414
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,670
What do I have to repent for?

415
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,180
I don't want to return
to that chaotic place.

416
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,190
Lu Qingqing went out herself to play.

417
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,490
What does her disfigurement
have to do with me?

418
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,280
And Lady Shu.

419
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,470
I kindly gave her flowers,

420
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,750
but she was allergic to the pollen,

421
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,190
yet she accused me of poisoning her.

422
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,560
What kind of people are they?

423
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,450
The Commandery Princess is spoiled,

424
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,600
and Lady Shu is vicious.

425
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,070
They deserve to suffer.

426
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,280
They deserve to be poisoned.

427
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:07,990
Back then,

428
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,800
I waited day and night for you.

429
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,630
I was afraid I'd miss you if you came.

430
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,950
The life at the ancestral tomb

431
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,430
was bitter

432
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,160
and harsh.

433
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,120
Waiting for you

434
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,190
was my only hope.

435
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,600
But later,

436
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,320
I thought you had abandoned me.

437
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,630
Unexpectedly,

438
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,840
you'd come so early to see me.

439
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,840
We were married

440
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,000
to honor our elders' promise.

441
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:44,990
Before the wedding,

442
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,040
we barely knew each other.

443
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,070
That day, I came back

444
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,150
but heard you at the tomb entrance,

445
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,040
so I thought you were cruel
and heartless.

446
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,800
If only back then

447
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,590
I could...

448
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,670
Five years ago, you left without a word.

449
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,390
Where is Master Jingming?

450
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,950
He left before dawn.

451
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,400
Later,

452
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,000
I heard from others

453
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,470
that you had received a military order.

454
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,960
Jingming,

455
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,670
can you tell me

456
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,360
what happened to you
over the five years?

457
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,630
What exactly

458
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,280
is your nightmare?

459
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,400
Alright.

460
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,040
I'll tell you.

461
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,910
Do you find anything unusual?

462
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,400
Mentor,

463
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,080
Xizhou's been invading us frequently.

464
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,390
In this battle,

465
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,350
we must crush their arrogance.

466
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,270
Master Jingming,

467
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,800
you must not be careless.

468
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,910
I believe Xizhou's repeated attacks

469
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,270
hide a bigger scheme.

470
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,330
Whatever they're scheming,

471
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,550
we'll strike them down

472
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,320
and drive them back to their den.

473
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,760
After this, they won't dare return.

474
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,270
Mentor,

475
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,590
why trouble yourself

476
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,870
to act as a military advisor
for such a small battle?

477
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,500
There's no such thing as a small battle.

478
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,760
We must give it our all.

479
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,340
Besides,

480
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,490
have I ever missed a battle
when you lead the troops?

481
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,950
I worry when I'm not there.

482
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,160
I understand.

483
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,830
I'll keep your teachings in mind.

484
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,600
Mentor,

485
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,710
now,

486
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,150
we've cornered them

487
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,150
in the valley.

488
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,870
Why not strike tonight

489
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,520
and take Tiemu Mountain in one sweep?

490
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,550
Then

491
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,080
our borders

492
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,330
can extend to the mountain.

493
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,480
With the terrain on our side,

494
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,400
it's hard to attack.

495
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,510
It would thus

496
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,400
bring peace to the borders.

497
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,630
Since you know Tiemu Mountain
is hard to attack,

498
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,640
why still go?

499
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,600
We've won two battles in a row.

500
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,350
I know their strength.

501
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,630
This is the perfect time to strike.

502
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,350
What if they have reinforcements?

503
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,710
If they have reinforcements,

504
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,080
why are they cornered

505
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,680
in the valley?

506
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,800
- But...
- Mentor,

507
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,600
I know you're worried.

508
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,230
But I'm certain

509
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,900
that this time, we will win.

510
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:11,040
Master Jingming. We'll win. We'll win.

511
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,360
Mentor!

512
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,360
I finally understand.

513
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,390
You crawled out from piles of corpses.

514
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,000
Give yourself peace.

515
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,070
♪May you be free from a long journey♪

516
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:34,410
♪May you return without suffering
from the storm♪

517
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:41,180
♪I quietly search in my heart♪

518
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:45,220

♪Flowers blossom like snow
and grass luxuriant♪

520
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,800
Please give me another chance.

521
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,390
Let me make up for the hardship
you endured

522
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,670
and for all the time

523
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,920
Yanyan grew up without a father

524
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,840
by his side.

525
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:06,990
Is that okay?

526
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,500
I used to think marriage was just

527
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,020
a matter of family arrangement.

528
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,580
Then I finally met you,

529
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,260
and I understand

530
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,700
what it means to hold hands

531
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,740
and grow old together.

532
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,140
From now on,

533
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,900
I just want to be with you

534
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,940
day after day,

535
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,620
year after year.

536
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,460
(Master Jingming's Mansion)
Young Master,

537
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,880
My Lady, Princess Qingqing is here.

538
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,780
Qingqing, you're here.

539
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,860
Jiangli.

540
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,460
I couldn't find you just now.

541
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,420
Look.

542
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,380
These are the lilies I trimmed for you.

543
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,340
Sit.

544
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,860
They're lovely.

545
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,540
So pretty. I really like them.

546
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,660
Qingqing is getting better and better

547
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,940
at pleasing your sister-in-law.

548
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,540
Jingming, if I please your wife,

549
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,380
doesn't that mean I please you too?

550
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,780
Fair point.

551
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:27,260
Oh, Qingqing,

552
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,380
try the medicinal dish

553
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,420
I made later.

554
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,380
Jiangli,

555
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,260
the medicine you made last time

556
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,540
not only made me feel healthier

557
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,340
but even improved my skin.

558
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,380
Then have more later.

559
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,700
Yulan.

560
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,660
Let's go.

561
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,940
What a cute child.

562
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,060
With a closer look,

563
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,100
I think he looks like Jingming.

564
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,100
Who is this child?

565
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,500
- He's...
- Oh, Jiangli,

566
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,740
I just remembered.

567
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,820
We're having dinner
with Lord Wang tonight,

568
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,820
aren't we?

569
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,340
- It's about time.
- Yes.

570
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,180
Let's go

571
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,540
and get ready.

572
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,140
- Sure.
- Qingqing,

573
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,100
we won't keep you here.

574
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,620
Go home and eat.

575
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,740
Let's meet again next time.

576
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,060
Next time.

577
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:22,420
(Rain Chamber)

578
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,380
What?

579
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,940
Are you still worried

580
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,540
about Qingqing seeing Yanyan earlier?

581
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,460
She didn't recognize him, right?

582
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,620
I know what you're afraid of.

583
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,860
You're worried

584
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,260
that once Yanyan's identity
is made public,

585
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,740
he won't just be our child anymore.

586
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,380
I just want Yanyan

587
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,420
to grow up happily.

588
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,860
I don't want to burden him.

589
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,980
But it's a sensitive time now.

590
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,180
Dongzhou and Xizhou are at odds.

591
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,460
The Grand Lady

592
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,940
and Grand Princess of Xizhou

593
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,180
offered to visit this time.

594
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,460
It feels like a good sign.

595
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,380
Still, it concerns
the safety of both states.

596
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,740
Everyone is

597
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,380
taking it very seriously.

598
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,560
Let's think about it more.

599
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,820
Come on, drink.

600
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,660
Lady Shu's pearl hairpin today

601
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,820
is truly beautiful.

602
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,580
Xiulan, you shouldn't only focus

603
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,900
on dressing yourself.

604
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,340
Jingming and Jiangli

605
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,260
are such a loving couple.

606
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,500
Why is there no good news?

607
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,540
They're still young.

608
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,980
It's more pressing for Jingxiu.

609
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,340
His mansion

610
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,220
can't go

611
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,140
without a consort forever.

612
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,220
You're right.

613
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:00,180
But I really haven't had time

614
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,340
to manage Jingxiu's household matters.

615
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,180
You know the Grand Lady

616
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,060
and Grand Princess of Xizhou are coming.

617
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,900
To prepare for such a grand banquet,

618
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,740
I'm exhausted.

619
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,340
I'm not as lucky as you, Xiulan.

620
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,260
You're right.

621
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,460
A worry-free life

622
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,980
is the best

623
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,980
anti-aging secret.

624
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,780
Yes indeed.

625
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,220
Xiulan, you must protect

626
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,580
that youthful beauty of yours.

627
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:28,860
After all,

628
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,180
pleasing a man with beauty is different

629
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,540
from pleasing him with virtue.

630
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,660
Since you both

631
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,900
care so much for each other,

632
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,300
why not let the kids help?

633
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,340
Have three daughters-in-law
organize the banquet.

634
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,820
You two just supervise.

635
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,100
Thank you for your trust, Father.

636
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,860
But I'm new to Dongzhou.

637
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,900
This is too serious.

638
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,420
I fear I may overlook something.

639
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,940
- Well.
- How about this?

640
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,900
Let the Shen sisters handle it together.

641
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,180
Jiangli is Jingming's wife,

642
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,020
while Qilan is merely
Jingxiu's concubine.

643
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,100
Let Jiangli take full charge,

644
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,140
and Qilan assist.

645
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,420
Jinyi, you're so lucky.

646
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,620
Your daughter-in-law gets to relax.

647
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,980
Lady Shu,

648
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,460
enough.

649
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,780
The Peace Banquet is approaching,

650
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,900
yet you two still bicker

651
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,540
in front of the children.

652
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,460
How childish.

653
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,620
- Sit down.
- If you've got energy to spare,

654
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,460
worry about the kids.

655
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,460
They still have no children.

656
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,740
If this continues,

657
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,340
Dongzhou is in danger.

658
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,620
Jingxing,

659
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,740
your two brothers are buried
in state affairs.

660
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,860
It's understandable.

661
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,700
You two should stop playing around.

662
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,660
It's time for you to have a child.

663
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,580
Father,

664
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,460
Jingxiu and Jingming
haven't had children yet.

665
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,700
I can't jump ahead of them.

666
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,980
They should go first.

667
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,740
I've had enough.

668
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,980
I'm going to rest.

669
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:10,900
You all continue.

670
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,220
Goodbye, Father.

671
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,300
How annoying.

672
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,460
Sit down and eat.

673
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,540
What's Father so angry about?

674
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,780
Jingxiu has no child,

675
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,700
but Jingming's...

676
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,500
Jingming...

677
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,580
Jingming's...

678
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,820
Well, Jingming's...

679
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,140
Jingming's...

680
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,100
Rain Chamber.

681
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,420
The medicinal dishes there

682
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,820
are amazing.

683
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,100
Well.

684
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,420
Qingqing, how about we go try some?

685
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,340
Enough.

686
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,380
What are you talking about?

687
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,340
I can't understand a word.

688
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,900
Wait, wait.

689
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,180
I'll come with you to Jingming's place.

690
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,540
I...

691
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:05,500
Lady Shu.

692
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,960
We have things to attend to at home.

693
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,300
Right, we might not make it today.

694
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,500
Let's visit another time.

695
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,100
You rest early.

696
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,340
We'll take our leave now.

697
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,500
Qingqing, I need to talk to you.

698
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,580
Come with us.

699
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,380
Yes.

700
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,060
Mother, I have something to do.

701
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,660
- Let's go.
- I'll check on the dish.

702
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,620
Qingqing, hurry.

703
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,740
You...

704
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,340
Stop right there.

705
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,140
Go.

706
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,500
Stop right there.

707
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,900
I want to go too.

708
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,300
These children are so strange.

709
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,660
Let me see

710
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,340
what they are hiding from me.

711
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,660
She's hiding from me, too.

712
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,580
Looks like this is serious.

713
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,660
Let's go. Hurry up.

714
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,620
Jiangli,

715
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,140
Lady Shu is coming this way.

716
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,700
Hurry and hide Yanyan's things.

717
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,660
Yes.

718
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,140
Lady Shu, there are
some medicinal dishes.

719
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,780
Shall we taste them together?

720
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,340
No, no need.

721
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,900
Jiangli,

722
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:11,980
what is this?

723
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,260
My Lady!

724
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,740
My Lady.

725
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,460
Young Master asked me
to bring you the ledger.

726
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,940
Grandmother.

727
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,700
- Grandmother.
- I told you not to run around.

728
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,060
This...

729
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,380
Whose child is this?

730
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,900
Please forgive me, My Lady.

731
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,020
He's my grandson.

732
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,020
It's been hard on us.

733
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,020
His father went out of town
to make a delivery,

734
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,220
and his mother happened to be ill.

735
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,540
There was no other way,

736
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,900
so I had to bring him with me.

737
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,580
He's still too young.

738
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,140
Sorry for disturbing you two.

739
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,620
Sorry about this.

740
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,500
I'm so sorry.

741
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,380
It's alright.

742
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,740
Since his mother is sick,

743
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,540
go back and take care of them both.

744
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,320
Well, I'll have this month's wages

745
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,500
given to you early.

746
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,180
Oh,

747
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,140
he left this rattle drum

748
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,580
here last time.

749
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,820
Take it back with you.

750
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,860
Give me the ledger.

751
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,220
Go on.

752
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,060
Yes, yes.

753
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,580
Thank you, My Ladies.

754
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,540
Let's go.

755
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,500
I really

756
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,100
can't bear seeing

757
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,380
other people's children now.

758
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,460
Jiangli, look.

759
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,900
Nanny Dong's grandson
is running around already.

760
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,140
When I see other families

761
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,500
playing outside
with their grandchildren,

762
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,860
my heart

763
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,900
just aches.

764
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,860
Even the nanny's grandson here
is at this age.

765
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,700
Now I finally understand

766
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,220
what it feels like to envy others.

767
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:42,980
Jiangli,

768
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,700
can you really bear to see me

769
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,380
unable to sleep at night
over my grandchild?

770
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,020
Can you really stand

771
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,460
to see me

772
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,580
always envying others?

773
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,860
Jiangli.

774
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,980
I know

775
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,020
you've been back for a while now.

776
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,460
You and Jingming

777
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,980
are so sweet now.

778
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,820
As your mother, I'm truly happy for you.

779
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,820
But you can't just

780
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,540
enjoy life with each other, right?

781
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,780
Jiangli,

782
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:11,980
please give me

783
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,220
a chubby little grandson soon,

784
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,700
so the Prefect and I

785
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,900
can enjoy our twilight years with him.

786
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,660
I understand.

787
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,940
My dear daughter-in-law.

788
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,380
I'll have the physician
prescribe you some herbs

789
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,340
to nourish your body

790
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,940
so you'll get pregnant soon.

791
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,700
Dongmei, let's go.

792
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:32,720
- Be careful.
- Hurry.

793
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,200
Hurry. Make sure to nourish yourself.

794
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,360
Make sure to nourish yourself.

795
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,260
Rest here. Rest.

796
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,380
Let's go, Dongmei.

797
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,860
Yulan, go fetch Master Jingming.

798
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,410
