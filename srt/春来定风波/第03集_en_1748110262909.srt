00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,800
The eyes are basic permission

00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,840

5
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,000
Zhoulu loves obama

00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,100
boir

7
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:06,100
If I don't think about it, I won't think about anyone

8
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:13,100
If it's destined to be a cloud of frost and a snowy day

9
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:21,100
How can I hate the youth and forget about the past?

10
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,100
The Legend of Xiao Chuan

11
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,100
Episode 16

12
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,100
The young consort has returned to her home.

13
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,100
From now on,

14
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,100
the young consort will be in charge of all the matters of the Yi Ying.

15
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,100
Yes.

16
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,100
Yes.

17
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,100
The young consort will be in charge of all the matters of the Yi Ying.

18
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,100
Yes.

19
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,100
The young consort will be in charge of all the matters of the Yi Ying.

20
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,100
Yes.

21
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,100
Yun Jiu,

22
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,100
take the accounts of the house to the young consort.

23
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,100
Yes, I will take them.

24
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,100
I want to go out.

25
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,100
I have already done what I promised you.

26
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,100
When can you fulfill what you promised me?

27
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,100
Don't worry, I will not break my promise.

28
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,100
Okay.

29
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:25,100
Consort, this is the account book of the house. Please have a look.

30
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,100
Let me introduce you to everyone.

31
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,100
This is my bodyguard, Yu Lan.

32
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,100
I hope everyone will treat her well in the future.

33
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,100
Yes, Consort.

34
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,100
I know that the young master is always kind to everyone in the house.

35
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,100
As the hostess, I will not treat everyone badly.

36
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,100
So I asked Yu Lan to prepare a gift for everyone.

37
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,100
Mother, the water for the tea is the ice mountain snow water that my husband ordered.

38
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,100
The tea and the cakes are made by my daughter-in-law.

39
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,100
Jingxiu has been missing for a few days.

40
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,100
What is she busy with?

41
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,100
My husband is busy with managing the Golden Armor Guards.

42
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,100
A few days ago, my father asked her and my brother to discuss

43
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,100
whether they should be the only one

44
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,100
to be the leader of the Golden Armor Guards.

45
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,100
As you know, my husband has the Golden Armor Guards.

46
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,100
If he can get the Golden Armor Guards,

47
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,100
it will be almost equal to getting the position of Young Master.

48
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,100
I heard that the poisonous woman is still not gone.

49
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,100
Isn't Second Brother very annoyed recently?

50
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,100
He still has the heart to think about the Golden Armor Guards.

51
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,100
Not only is he back,

52
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,100
he also changed his mind.

53
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,100
I also heard that my brother has regained his identity.

54
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:49,100
Now that they are back together, he is very arrogant and domineering.

55
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,100
My husband and daughter-in-law went to visit them.

56
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,100
Who would have thought that they were so rude

57
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,100
that they didn't respect their elders and their families?

58
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,100
They humiliated my husband and daughter-in-law.

59
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,100
How could this happen?

60
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,100
My brother was protected by my father.

61
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:16,100
Now, Second Young Consort is also a trouble.

62
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:21,100
I'm just worried that my husband's life

63
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,100
will be even worse.

64
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,100
I'm the rightful wife of the master,

65
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,100
but I have to live by their face.

66
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,100
What does Young Consort mean?

67
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,100
What gift is she preparing for so long?

68
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,100
Didn't you accompany her in the ancestral mausoleum?

69
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,100
What do you think you are doing?

70
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,100
Don't talk to me!

71
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,100
I don't want to cause any trouble.

72
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,100
You, come here.

73
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:03,100
I don't know why you are asking me out.

74
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,100
Nanny Dong, it's been a long time.

75
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,100
Young Consort!

76
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,100
You still remember me?

77
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,100
How could I forget?

78
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,100
When I was in the ancestral mausoleum,

79
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,100
you were very kind to me.

80
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,100
Should I let you eat a chicken bone

81
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,100
or let you taste the chicken bone?

82
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,100
I can't!

83
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,100
I was wrong!

84
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,100
I shouldn't have prepared the food

85
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,100
for you and let you eat the chicken bone.

86
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,100
You ate the chicken bone and now you are eating the chicken bone.

87
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,100
I was wrong!

88
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,100
I was wrong!

89
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,100
Please forgive me, Nanny Dong.

90
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,100
Young Consort, Second Young Consort will definitely punish her.

91
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,100
Her life in the manor will be hard.

92
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,100
I'm sorry! Please forgive me!

93
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,100
This is a reward from Young Consort.

94
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,100
I can forget the past.

95
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,100
I don't want to meddle in these trivial matters.

96
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,100
I hope everyone will do their best in the future.

97
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,100
Take this back.

98
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,100
It's your dinner.

99
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,100
Thank you, Young Consort!

100
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,100
Young Consort is so kind.

101
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,100
Let's do our best for her.

102
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,100
I came back to take over the manor

103
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,100
not for these trivial matters.

104
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,100
I'm not interested in these.

105
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,100
You should do your best.

106
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,100
I won't treat you badly.

107
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,100
Yes!

108
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,100
One more thing.

109
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,100
Without my permission,

110
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,100
no one can enter and leave the manor.

111
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,100
Yes!

112
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,100
Yulan,

113
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,100
reward!

114
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,100
Take back the power of the family.

115
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,100
Then you can take Yanyan here.

116
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,100
I understand your worries.

117
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,100
But don't worry, Mother.

118
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:42,100
My husband and I have already planned it.

119
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,100
Thank you, Mother,

120
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,100
for hiding this from me.

121
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,100
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

122
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,100
But the doctor said

123
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,100
you're not in a good condition.

124
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,100
I didn't mean to say that.

125
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,100
You should be careful in the future.

126
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,100
Yes!

127
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,100
I'm protected by you.

128
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,100
Please take care of me.

129
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:16,100
I'll talk to you about good things.

130
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,100
Don't worry.

131
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,100
I'll protect you.

132
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,100
Get up.

133
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,100
Thank you, Mother.

134
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,100
Brother!

135
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,100
Can you help me?

136
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,100
Where did the little monkey come from?

137
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,100
Why is it in the sky?

138
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,100
Brother, can you help me?

139
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,100
This poor and cute little boy

140
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,100
was stuck in a hole?

141
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,100
Why are you stuck here?

142
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,100
It's hard to say.

143
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,100
Can you pull me out first?

144
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,100
Thank you.

145
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,100
You're a good person.

146
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,100
Who are you?

147
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,100
Why are you in Tingyu Pavilion?

148
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,100
I'm...

149
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,100
Yanyan, come back!

150
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,100
Yanyan, come back!

151
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,100
Oh, no!

152
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,100
My mother is looking for me.

153
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,100
I have to go back.

154
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,100
Thank you.

155
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,100
Mother, you're back.

156
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,100
Didn't you say you couldn't run around here?

157
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,100
You little rascal!

158
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,100
Mother, don't pinch my ears.

159
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,100
I'm wrong.

160
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,100
Look at what you got.

161
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,100
Mother?

162
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,100
You're not obedient at all.

163
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,100
Why does this face look familiar?

164
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,100
I don't know.

165
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,100
I thought I had a pet mouse.

166
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,100
Didn't you promise me

167
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,100
to stay in the house?

168
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,100
Who is this kid?

169
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,100
It has nothing to do with you.

170
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,100
I'm mother's little baby.

171
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,100
Don't bully my mother.

172
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,100
Otherwise, even if you just helped me,

173
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,100
I would let the mouse bite you.

174
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,100
Mother!

175
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,100
Yanyan, I'm fine.

176
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,100
Go to the house and wait for me.

177
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,100
Mother!

178
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,100
You can't run around

179
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,100
without my permission.

180
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,100
I'm telling you,

181
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,100
I'll settle the matter

182
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,100
you ran away from.

183
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,100
Go!

184
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,100
What brings you here today?

185
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,100
This kid calls you mother?

186
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,100
My kid calls me mother.

187
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,100
Does he call you mother?

188
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,100
He's your kid?

189
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,100
It has nothing to do with you.

190
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,100
I hope you know

191
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,100
we can talk about the deal.

192
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,100
We can talk about the rest.

193
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,100
See you.

194
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,100
When did this kid become so weak?

195
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,100
What has he been through these five years?

196
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,100
Your Highness,

197
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,100
I made some medicine and cakes today.

198
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,100
I said I'd bring them to you

199
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,100
and have a taste.

200
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,100
Why are you so excited today?

201
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,100
You like to make medicine and cakes.

202
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,100
I remember you didn't make these before.

203
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,100
I was just thinking about her a few days ago.

204
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,100
What's wrong with Ling'er?

205
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,100
Who do you think

206
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,100
is not fighting among the two brothers?

207
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,100
You have a headache again?

208
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,100
Have some tea.

209
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,100
Go ahead.

210
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,100
Jingming was the one who

211
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,100
killed the assassin a few days ago.

212
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,100
Jingxiu and Ling'er went to visit him.

213
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,100
But Jingming

214
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,100
made them feel a little uncomfortable.

215
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,100
Danling is an honest kid.

216
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,100
He's upset.

217
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,100
He'll get sick when he gets home.

218
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,100
Jingming is not

219
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,100
aware of this.

220
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,100
It's all

221
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,100
Jingxiu's fault.

222
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,100
Jingxiu hasn't been able to

223
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,100
solve the missing weapons of the Jinling Guards.

224
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,100
He's been working with the craftsmen

225
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,100
to develop weapons.

226
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,100
He's in a hurry.

227
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,100
He probably doesn't listen to me.

228
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,100
Why are you blaming Jingxiu again?

229
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,100
Jingxiu is worried about the Jinling Guards

230
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,100
and is worrying about me.

231
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,100
Jingming is really...

232
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,100
What's wrong with Jingming?

233
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,100
Mrs. Shu is here.

234
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,100
Why didn't you ask someone to pass the message?

235
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,100
I need someone else to pass the message.

236
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,100
You're here.

237
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,100
How about I go back

238
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,100
and ask someone to pass the message

239
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,100
before I come to say hello to you?

240
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,100
You're talking too much.

241
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,100
Sit down.

242
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,100
Sit down.

243
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,100
I'm talking to Mrs. Shu.

244
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,100
Here.

245
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,100
Pour some tea for Mrs. Shu.

246
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,100
Young Master,

247
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,100
I got the message

248
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,100
that Madam was going to

249
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,100
the Master's house to see you.

250
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,100
That's too much.

251
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,100
You can just go to the Master

252
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,100
and ask for tea.

253
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,100
But Madam even told the Master

254
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,100
about it.

255
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,100
She really thinks that

256
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,100
the people of the House of Young Master

257
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,100
are easy to bully.

258
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,100
Why are you being so impulsive?

259
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,100
It's true.

260
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,100
Young Master,

261
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,100
what Yunjiu said

262
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,100
is not entirely true.

263
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,100
Young Master is being too impulsive.

264
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,100
We're being too passive.

265
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,100
I heard that he's developing weapons.

266
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,100
If he really succeeds,

267
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,100
the Jinling Guards...

268
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,100
Young Master,

269
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,100
we have to be careful.

270
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,100
I've been holding back

271
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,100
for the sake of the overall situation.

272
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,100
But building weapons

273
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,100
is not an easy task.

274
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,100
I've been preparing for so long.

275
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,100
If we want to succeed,

276
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,100
we have to find a way.

277
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,100
By the way,

278
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,100
the Zhu Ge descendant I asked you to visit...

279
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,100
Zhu Ge descendant is in the village in the west city.

280
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,100
But that old man

281
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,100
has a very weird temper.

282
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,100
I went to the sixth floor before.

283
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,100
He always asked me to leave for nothing.

284
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,100
He also said that

285
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,100
even if you went,

286
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,100
he wouldn't see you.

287
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,100
If I can get the map of Zhu Ge's alliance from him,

288
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,100
the Jinling Guards will have the strongest weapons.

289
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,100
You find those skilled generals

290
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,100
and bring them to see me.

291
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,100
Yes.

292
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,100
I heard that

293
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,100
I was angry after Wang Danlin went back.

294
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,100
I think

295
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,100
he deliberately showed it to your father.

296
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,100
Did he come to see me?

297
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,100
Why did he blame me?

298
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,100
I'm afraid they designed it

299
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,100
because they wanted you to be angry

300
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,100
and invite you to join them.

301
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,100
I'm not as good as the second young master.

302
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,100
The soldiers come to fight, the water comes to cover.

303
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,100
What am I afraid of them?

304
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,100
I'm not afraid of them.

305
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,100
I'm afraid of them.

306
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,100
What am I afraid of them?

307
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,100
They don't offend me, I don't offend them.

308
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,100
Today is the last treatment.

309
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,100
I only have three acupuncture points today.

310
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,100
Feng Chi, Dazhui, He Gu.

311
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,100
I said it in advance.

312
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,100
It may hurt a little.

313
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,100
Just take the needle.

314
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,100
Give me your hand.

315
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,100
I told you

316
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,100
it would hurt a little.

317
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,100
It doesn't matter.

318
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,100
You have to pay more attention in the future.

319
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,100
Don't be greedy.

320
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,100
Take the prescription I prescribed you.

321
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,100
Your disease will be cured soon.

322
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,100
OK.

323
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,100
Young master.

324
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,100
Young master, the soldiers are here.

325
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,100
I know.

326
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,100
I'll go back first.

327
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,100
Senior sister.

328
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,100
It's only a few hours after the war.

329
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,100
Poor Yan Yan is so young.

330
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,100
She has to endure this pain.

331
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,100
I want to get the thunderbolt as soon as possible.

332
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,100
What's your next plan?

333
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,100
The timing is not waiting.

334
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,100
I will write a letter

335
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,100
asking senior brother to find Mr. Zhuge's residence.

336
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,100
Tomorrow you take the invitation to the Dingfeng Pavilion.

337
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,100
I'll take you to shoot arrows.

338
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,100
Shoot arrows?

339
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,100
Shoot arrows?

340
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,100
To be precise,

341
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,100
it's Zhuge Lian Nu.

342
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,100
Senior sister.

343
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,100
Mr. Zhuge didn't even see the second young master.

344
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,100
Will he help us?

345
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,100
Senior brother said he had a problem.

346
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,100
I have found a way to cure him.

347
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,100
It's not difficult.

348
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,100
Look.

349
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,100
Is it there?

350
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,100
Let's go and find it.

351
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,100
OK.

352
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,100
Is this Mr. Zhuge's house?

353
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,100
Please.

354
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,100
Are you Mr. Zhuge?

355
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,100
Mr. Zhuge, how are you?

356
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,100
I'm Shen Jiang Li.

357
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,100
I'm here to visit you.

358
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,100
I didn't mean to scold you.

359
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,100
You forced me to say it.

360
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,100
Mr. Zhuge,

361
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,100
have you been bleeding from purple blood recently?

362
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,100
No.

363
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,100
It's because of the decayed tooth.

364
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,100
But it doesn't hurt or itch.

365
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,100
The tongue is yellow and greasy.

366
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,100
The nose is dry.

367
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,100
It's also cold and hot.

368
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,100
The food is not enough.

369
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,220
It's due to the symptoms of gas and

370
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,100
the spirit of the soul.

371
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,100
How do you know?

372
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,100
You're not even a little bit worse.

373
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,100
You have a tooth decay.

374
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,100
This is more common in the young sea.

375
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,100
The elderly may also have a disease.

376
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,100
But if you get a tooth decay,

377
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,100
you must treat it as soon as possible.

378
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,100
If you get a tooth decay,

379
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,100
it will spread and rot.

380
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,100
I thought it was just a mouth wound.

381
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,100
I've been waiting for this.

382
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,100
Don't worry.

383
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,100
Jiang Li can treat this disease.

384
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,100
I don't know the tricks of you liars.

385
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,100
First, you say something that is too exaggerated.

386
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,100
You make people so cold and sick.

387
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,100
Then you say you can treat it.

388
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,100
How many people are you?

389
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,100
You're being fooled by this.

390
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,100
You're so cruel.

391
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,100
Mr. Zhuge.

392
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,100
Go.

393
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,100
Otherwise, I won't let you off.

394
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,100
Mr. Zhuge.

395
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,100
If you think we're liars,

396
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,100
then see if our Dinfeng Pavilion's

397
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,100
defeat is real or not.

398
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,100
Mr. Zhuge.

399
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,100
I'm a teacher in Dinfeng Pavilion.

400
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,100
I'm good at all kinds of medical problems.

401
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,100
Miss.

402
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,100
Why didn't you take it out earlier?

403
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,100
Then I'll have to trouble you with this disease.

404
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,100
But I have a condition.

405
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,100
Even during the treatment,

406
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,100
you can't ask me what medicine I used.

407
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,100
Why?

408
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,100
When you recover,

409
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,100
Jiang Li will tell you the reason.

410
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,100
Young Master.

411
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,100
Young Master.

412
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,100
Young Mistress went out again.

413
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,100
That girl Yu Lan has two hands.

414
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,100
I lost her again.

415
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,100
It's not that you lost her.

416
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,100
They don't want you to follow them.

417
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,100
Enough.

418
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,100
I didn't mean to let you monitor them.

419
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,100
But after the assassination incident,

420
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,100
it's good to have someone to protect you.

421
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:40,100
I've never seen you care about someone so much.

422
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,100
No wonder people often say

423
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,100
farewell is a blessing in disguise.

424
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,100
What?

425
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,100
You're free?

426
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,100
Yunyi.

427
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,100
You can rest.

428
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,100
Yes.

429
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,100
I'll leave these to you today.

430
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,100
You look stable.

431
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,100
You've fully recovered.

432
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,100
It's really good.

433
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,100
You're not weak anymore.

434
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,100
Young Mistress.

435
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,100
Can you tell me

436
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,100
what medicine you used?

437
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:37,180
I used the

438
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,100
You're not going to kill me

439
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,100
for asking for punishment.

440
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,100
Now you're my benefactor.

441
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,100
This medicine is three times more toxic.

442
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,100
It can also cure disease.

443
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,100
This is a p-bomb.

444
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,100
It has the effect of anti-inflammatory.

445
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,100
If you control the amount of use,

446
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,100
it can also cure disease and save people.

447
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,100
You're really a disciple of Dingfeng Pavilion.

448
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,100
You're bold and careful.

449
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,100
I admire you.

450
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,100
You saved my life.

451
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,100
I'm just a man of the clouds.

452
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,100
I don't have much savings.

453
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,100
Dingfeng Pavilion has saved

454
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,100
the people of the world.

455
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,100
I shouldn't have taken any gifts

456
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,100
for your treatment.

457
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:28,100
But I have a request.

458
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,100
You're working so hard.

459
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,100
You didn't even notice the tea was cold.

460
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,100
I have something to do.

461
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,100
Are you trying to break the bridge?

462
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,100
You don't need me when you're well.

463
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,100
You didn't have this attitude

464
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,100
when you asked me to treat you.

465
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,100
You can tell me what you need.

466
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,100
Make a lotus-shroud with this drawing.

467
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,100
After the production,

468
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,100
it can be shot 12 times in a row.

469
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,100
And the children can operate it.

470
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,100
If you wait for the second young master

471
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,100
to think about it,

472
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,100
when you make it,

473
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,100
your brother will be the master.

474
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,100
Did Mr. Zhuge give it to you?

475
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,100
You don't have to worry about it.

476
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,100
The drawing is in our hands now.

477
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,100
The Jinling Guards are a hot mountain.

478
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,100
They lack strength and limited equipment.

479
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,100
If you can solve the problem of this skill,

480
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,100
it's a good move.

481
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,100
You can get the master's appreciation

482
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,100
and consolidate your position

483
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,100
to fight against your brother.

484
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,100
You can also

485
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,100
convince people with your talent.

486
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,100
That's why you can find

487
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,100
these capable generals to be your slaves.

488
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,100
You look so happy.

489
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,100
It seems you've done a lot of homework.

490
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,100
Of course.

491
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,100
I can do everything to get the thunderball.

492
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,100
A good knight in the palace must be strong.

493
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,100
The Jinling Guards are

494
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,100
neither weapons nor money.

495
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,100
What's the point of telling you this?

496
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,100
Young Master,

497
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,100
you're just thinking about it.

498
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,100
Money won't come out.

499
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,100
Why don't you

500
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,100
go with me to the garden?

501
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,100
Let's go.

502
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,100
Don't think too much.

503
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,100
Let's go.

504
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,100
Young Master,

505
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,100
Young Master.

506
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,100
What's this?

507
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,100
Young Master,

508
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,100
why don't you go for a walk?

509
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,100
Maybe you'll find something in the sky.

510
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,100
You knew it.

511
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,100
Of course.

512
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,100
The most difficult thing in the world

513
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,100
is money.

514
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,100
But it's so short.

515
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,100
Where did you get so much money?

516
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,100
Young Master,

517
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,100
I've been saving what I've earned

518
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,100
for you.

519
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,100
Return it to me soon.

520
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,100
Keep it.

521
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,100
Yes.

522
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,100
Guards.

523
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,100
I'll pay you back.

524
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,100
As for the thunderball,

525
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,100
I need to wait for a chance to ask for it from my father.

526
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,100
I believe that the Young Master

527
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,100
won't keep me waiting for too long.

528
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,100
Young Master,

529
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,100
there's so much money.

530
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,100
What's this?

531
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,100
It looks like I've never seen it before.

532
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,100
Young Master,

533
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,100
why did the Young Consort

534
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,100
get so much money?

535
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,100
Young Master,

536
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,100
how did the Young Consort

537
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,100
get so much money?

538
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,100
Yunyi,

539
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,100
I've sent someone to investigate.

540
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,100
The Young Consort must have left the ancestral temple a long time ago.

541
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,100
But as for the direction after leaving the ancestral temple,

542
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,100
it still needs time.

543
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,100
She must have gone to

544
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,100
a very unusual place.

545
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,100
Keep investigating.

546
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,100
Yes.

547
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,100
Master,

548
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,100
I'm here to tell you

549
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,100
that Qingqing should be back tomorrow.

550
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,100
Qingqing is coming back?

551
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,100
That's great.

552
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,100
It's all your fault.

553
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,100
You had to let me go out to practice.

554
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,100
I didn't even know if she was suffering outside.

555
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,100
It's good to let Qingqing go out to practice.

556
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,100
Speaking of Qingqing,

557
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,100
the child's face is also injured

558
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,100
because of Li.

559
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,100
Forget it.

560
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,100
I won't say it.

561
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,100
This sister has already let it go.

562
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,100
She let Li out.

563
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,100
Isn't Jiang Li

564
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,100
always in the ancestral temple?

565
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,100
Why did she suddenly come back?

566
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,100
This sister must be

567
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,100
worried about her child.

568
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,100
She doesn't want Li to be alone in the ancestral temple.

569
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,100
This sister is really a Bodhisattva.

570
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,100
You're too much.

571
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,100
Our child

572
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,100
is not as annoying as Danling.

573
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,100
But fortunately,

574
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,100
she and Jingming are a good couple.

575
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,100
I think it's only a matter of time

576
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,100
before she gives birth to a child.

577
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,100
It's not like Danling is eager to have a child.

578
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,100
She actually did those ridiculous things.

579
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,100
What happened?

580
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,100
You don't know yet.

581
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,100
Danling is praying for you.

582
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,100
She actually did a child-seeking ritual in the dark.

583
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,100
There is such a thing?

584
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,100
Isn't this nonsense?

585
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,100
Sister, don't talk nonsense.

586
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,100
That's all the servants' own decision.

587
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,100
The wrong servants

588
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,100
have committed suicide for their sins.

589
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,100
Danling is completely unaware of it.

590
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,100
Besides,

591
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,100
Danling is a famous family.

592
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,100
How can she do such a thing?

593
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,100
Speaking of Qingqing,

594
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,100
this child

595
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,100
is also at the age of marriage.

596
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,100
Should we choose for her this time?

597
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,100
I think we can choose.

598
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,100
My daughter doesn't need anyone else to care about her.

599
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,100
Sister, I don't mean anything else.

600
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,100
You misunderstood.

601
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,100
It's just that a few days ago,

602
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,100
my distant nephew Su Ruian came to visit me.

603
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,100
I think this child is the same age as Qingqing.

604
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,100
That's why I'm thinking about it.

605
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,100
That talented man in Jiangnan, Su Ruian?

606
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,100
I also heard about this Su Ruian.

607
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,100
Why don't you let Qingqing contact him?

608
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,100
If Qingqing is interested...

609
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,100
My Qingqing's status,

610
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,100
talent and character,

611
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,100
is perfect for anyone.

612
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,100
Yes.

613
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,100
He is also a talented man.

614
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,100
He is also my distant relative.

615
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:06,100
Then let him try it.

616
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,100
Okay.

617
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,100
Since the master and sister both think it's appropriate,

618
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,100
I'll tell that child

619
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,100
to ask Qingqing to meet him.

620
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,100
Okay.

621
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,100
Master.

622
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,100
Master.

623
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,100
This...

624
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,100
I'll drink the soup.

625
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,100
I'll drink the soup.

626
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,100
I'm Su Ruian.

627
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,100
Greetings, Your Highness.

628
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,100
You don't have to be so polite.

629
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,100
Please, Your Highness.

630
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,100
Liu Yan.

631
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:58,100
Please take Nanny Dai to the back yard to have tea.

632
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,100
You actually know the names of the people around me.

633
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,100
As long as I'm interested,

634
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,100
it's not a problem.

635
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,100
I'll drink the tea.

636
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,100
Your Highness, please have some tea.

637
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,100
Snowy Cliff.

638
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,100
I heard that you like snowy cliffs the most.

639
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:30,100
I traveled to Shu Zhong and drank this tea a thousand years ago.

640
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,100
I still remember it.

641
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,100
But the snowy cliff is not easy to preserve.

642
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:38,100
After leaving Shu Zhong, I rarely drank this tea.

643
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,100
How did you get it?

644
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,100
I said,

645
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,100
as long as I'm interested.

646
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,100
Your makeup is really unique.

647
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,100
I've only seen a woman

648
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,100
in the flower shop in the corner.

649
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,100
It's rare to see a woman with a flower.

650
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,100
You know so much about women's makeup.

651
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,100
You...

652
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,100
care about women's beauty?

653
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,100
People have their own taste in beauty.

654
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,100
Qingqing.

655
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,100
Qingqing.

656
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,100
Sister-in-law, you're here.

657
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,100
You used to call me Sister Ling.

658
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,100
Father always said I was rude.

659
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,100
It doesn't matter.

660
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,100
It's my fault.

661
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,100
It's not.

662
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,100
You've been back for so many days.

663
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,100
I just came to see you.

664
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,100
I know you're busy.

665
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,100
Mengmeng, go prepare some tea and snacks.

666
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,100
Yes.

667
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,100
I'll go prepare now.

668
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,100
You look like a peach blossom.

669
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,100
You're in a good mood.

670
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,100
Sister Ling is not going to fight me.

671
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:55,100
Then let me make a fortune.

672
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,100
Sister, you've been eating peach blossoms lately.

673
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,100
Sister Ling, you...

674
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,100
I'm angry.

675
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,100
All right.

676
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,100
I was wrong.

677
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,100
Don't be angry.

678
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:12,100
I heard from Madam that

679
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,100
she wanted to make you and Su Ruian together.

680
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:19,100
It seems that you two get along well.

681
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:23,100
She's not bad.

682
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,100
It's just...

683
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:32,100
I'm afraid she might care about you.

684
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:38,100
It's all because of that Shen Jiangli.

685
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,100
By the way,

686
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,100
I don't know...

687
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,100
Let's just stop.

688
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,100
What do you want to say?

689
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,100
It doesn't matter.

690
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:51,100
Shen Jiangli came back from the ancestral forest.

691
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,100
How could he come out?

692
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,100
He's different from the past.

693
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,100
I don't know what kind of martial arts he used

694
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,100
to make your brother listen to him.

695
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,100
Not only did he break his ban,

696
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,100
he also restored his identity as the second concubine

697
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,100
and let her take care of the family.

698
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,100
Is my brother married?

699
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,100
Did he forget what this woman did to me?

700
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,100
This time I saw Shen Jiangli,

701
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,100
he changed into a different person.

702
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,100
He's so talented.

703
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,100
No wonder your brother is interested.

704
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,100
It's strange.

705
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,100
He used to be a little bit cowardly.

706
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,100
He looked like a pebble.

707
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:26,100
Now he's a master of medical skills.

708
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,100
He made your brother so interested in him.

709
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,100
Did he get hit by something dirty?

710
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,100
I want to see

711
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,100
what kind of woman Shen Jiangli is.

712
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,100
Qingqing, calm down.

713
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,100
Calm down.

714
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,100
I want to see

715
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,100
whether Lu Jinning is a woman

716
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,100
or his sister.

717
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,100
I want to see

718
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,100
whether Lu Jinning is a woman

719
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,100
or his sister.

720
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,100
I want to see

721
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,100
whether Lu Jinning is a woman

722
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,100
or his sister.

723
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,100
I want to see

724
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,100
whether Lu Jinning is a woman

725
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,100
or his sister.

726
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,100
I want to see

727
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,100
whether Lu Jinning is a woman

728
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,100
or his sister.

729
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,100
I want to see

730
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,100
whether Lu Jinning is a woman

731
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,100
or his sister.

732
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,100
I want to see

733
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,100
whether Lu Jinning is a woman

734
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,100
or his sister.

735
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,100
I want to see

736
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,100
whether Lu Jinning is a woman

737
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,100
or his sister.

738
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,100
I want to see

739
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,100
whether Lu Jinning is a woman

740
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,100
or his sister.

741
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,100
I want to see

742
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,100
whether Lu Jinning is a woman

743
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,100
or his sister.

744
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,100
I want to see

745
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,100
whether Lu Jinning is a woman

746
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,100
or his sister.

747
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,100
