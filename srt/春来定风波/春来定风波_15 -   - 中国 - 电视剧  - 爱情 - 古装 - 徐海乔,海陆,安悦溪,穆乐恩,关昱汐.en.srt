22
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,230
Greetings,

23
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,430
Consort Danling.

24
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,240
Consort Danling, please have some tea.

25
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,960
Consort Danling, please have some tea.

26
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,760
Consort Danling,

27
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,160
please have some tea.

28
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,950
You really have no manners.

29
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,880
I've been feeling unwell recently.

30
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,950
Now that you're in the mansion,

31
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,950
you should learn to share
some of my worries.

32
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,160
I should teach you some manners.

33
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,160
This is something I should do.

34
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,320
You can do the accounts, right?

35
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,040
Take these ledgers,

36
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,990
and carefully check them over

37
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,950
to see if there are no mistakes.

38
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,830
Yes.

39
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,300
(Ledger)

40
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,400
Is Consort Danling teaching you?

41
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,320
This is Master Jingxiu's Mansion,

42
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,750
not your maiden home.

43
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,030
Don't be so rude.

44
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,790
Consort Danling,

45
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,700
my maid is new here

46
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,820
and doesn't know the rules.

47
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,240
Please forgive her.

48
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,350
I'll be sure to discipline her.

49
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,680
Forget it.

50
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,270
You just came,

51
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,320
so you might make some mistakes.

52
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,560
You can check here

53
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,560
so I can teach you

54
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,150
anytime I need to.

55
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,800
Qilan, you should be more careful.

56
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,240
Master Jingxiu's Mansion

57
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,190
is different

58
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,910
from your family's

59
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,640
small household.

60
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,520
Yes.

61
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,560
It's so simple,

62
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,910
yet you still make mistakes.

63
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,590
I was distracted earlier
from exhaustion.

64
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,590
Please forgive me, Consort Danling.

65
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,280
Since that's the case,

66
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,200
kneel for half an incense stick of time.

67
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,240
My Lady,

68
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,680
Ms. Qilan is weak.

69
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,550
Why not

70
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,220
let me take the punishment
on her behalf?

71
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,000
What are you?

72
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,550
Come on.

73
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,350
Take her away!

74
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,270
Yes.

75
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,190
Wait.

76
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,870
Consort Danling,

77
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,200
Fuling doesn't know the rules

78
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,120
because I've failed to teach her.

79
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,800
Please forgive her.

80
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,420
I'm willing to take the punishment.

81
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,350
You have more backbone

82
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,120
than your mother.

83
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,080
My mother?

84
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,910
Last night, your mother

85
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,950
knelt right here and begged me

86
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,950
to treat you well.

87
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,350
Yesterday, when your mother
knelt to offer tea,

88
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,250
she was far more respectful
than you.

89
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,400
Forget it.

90
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,350
How well you treat her.

91
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,470
Since that's the case,

92
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,880
you'll kneel
for an incense stick of time

93
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,680
because of her.

94
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,720
Fuling.

95
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,840
Hurry.

96
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,190
I...

97
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,680
Thank you, My Lady.

98
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,520
My Lady.

99
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,080
My Lady.

100
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:07,990
My Lady...

101
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,400
My Lady...

102
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,900
Help her up, and let her continue.

103
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:11,920
My Lady.

104
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,040
My Lady, Ms. Qilan is weak.

105
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,440
Please ask the private physician
to take a look at her.

106
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,800
A concubine's daughter

107
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,880
isn't so fragile.

108
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,360
Yuzhu,

109
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,280
continue.

110
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,880
Ms. Qilan has always been weak.

111
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,830
If anything really happens,

112
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,440
Master Jingxiu will surely be furious.

113
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,990
What are you

114
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,950
to threaten me with Master Jingxiu?

115
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,470
How tricky and concealed.

116
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,160
The thunder god vine

117
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,040
can be used as medicine,

118
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,110
but it also has toxicity.

119
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,040
If consumed in large amounts,

120
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,590
it can cause confusion,

121
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,750
and in serious cases,
it can lead to death.

122
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,280
I remember Yunniang said

123
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,470
that Mother's medicine killed ants,

124
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,600
so I thought someone

125
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,350
had poisoned her medicine.

126
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,630
But the medicine

127
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,160
was misleading.

128
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,830
Who could have thought

129
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,920
they poisoned the bracelet instead,

130
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,630
letting it touch Mother's skin every day

131
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,440
to kill her without a trace?

132
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,230
How malicious.

133
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,950
To avoid alerting the enemy,

134
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,920
you should put the bracelet back asap.

135
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,790
You're right.

136
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,390
Though the bracelet

137
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,320
was found in Tian Xiaozhen's room,

138
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,920
we can't be certain it's her.

139
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,040
This matter

140
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,280
most likely involved Zou Jiaoyue

141
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,950
and Tian Xiaozhen.

142
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,470
They must've

143
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,870
left traces behind.

144
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,320
We need to investigate further.

145
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,120
I've already sent Yunniang

146
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,520
to look for the other one.

147
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
I remember Mother

148
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,870
should have had two bracelets.

149
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,040
Are you alright?

150
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,620
You haven't been resting well, right?

151
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,360
Here.

152
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,600
These are

153
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,990
brain-refreshing herbal teas.

154
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,550
Take them.

155
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,870
Thank you, Zimo.

156
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,520
You're becoming more like a father.

157
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,640
Jiangli.

158
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,110
Yulan, where's the consort?

159
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,800
Jiangli went to see Zimo.

160
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,120
Jiangli.

161
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,160
Here, put this on.

162
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,960
It's late and chilly.

163
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,150
Take care not to catch a cold.

164
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,560
I'll do it myself.

165
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,790
Remember to drink
the herbal tea every day.

166
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,710
Got it.

167
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,630
Shen Jiangli.

168
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,360
Jingming.

169
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,360
Where have you been?

170
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,280
I came to talk to Zimo about something.

171
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,920
Can you tell me

172
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,520
before you leave next time?

173
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,230
Otherwise, I'll worry about you.

174
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,770
You might leave without saying goodbye
like last time.

175
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,280
This coat belongs to Mr. Chu, right?

176
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,920
Mr. Chu, thank you

177
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,000
for your concern.

178
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,280
You're too kind.

179
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,760
Let's go home.

180
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,470
Zimo, I'll head back now.

181
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,000
Alright.

182
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,040
Let's go.

183
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,320
If you need Mr. Chu next time,

184
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,160
you can invite him to our mansion

185
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,560
so you won't have to run out at night.

186
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,240
I came to talk to Zimo

187
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,400
about my mother.

188
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,600
I'm not a child.

189
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,750
How could I get lost?

190
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,320
My Lady, you're awake.

191
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,520
Is your hand really okay?

192
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,770
Do you really not need
to see the physician?

193
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,990
I'm fine.

194
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,750
I'm just worried about you.

195
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,320
Why would they treat you like that?

196
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,870
They even involved your mother.

197
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,790
- What if...
- Fuling.

198
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,080
Don't say such things again.

199
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,200
Lady Lan, you're awake.

200
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,930
What are you doing here?

201
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,200
Consort Danling sent me here

202
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,280
to check on Lady Lan.

203
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,800
Thank her for her concern.

204
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,280
I've been a bit exhausted lately,

205
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,800
and my strength is running low.

206
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,630
Consort Danling understands

207
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,440
since your family

208
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,710
has nothing much to do.

209
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,710
Consort Danling
also asked me to tell you

210
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,590
that since you married Master Jingxiu,

211
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,290
even though you're just a concubine,

212
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,110
don't forget to share
the consort's burden.

213
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,110
You can't be so fragile.

214
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,590
I'll remember her teachings.

215
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,080
Finish these ledgers asap.

216
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,750
Consort Danling will inspect them.

217
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,670
Understood.

218
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,040
Fuling.

219
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,240
Yes.

220
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,190
Qilan,

221
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,630
I've prepared the things
for your return visit.

222
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,110
Thank you, Master Jingxiu.

223
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,740
(Ledger)

224
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,500
(Shen Mansion)

225
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,310
Mother.

226
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,590
Mother.

227
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,910
Mother.

228
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,560
Don't hide it. I know everything.

229
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,990
Let me see.

230
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,830
I know it all.

231
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:50,200
Wang Danling is so cruel.

232
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,920
How dare she treat me like this!

233
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,800
Though I'm just a concubine here,

234
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,960
I've never been

235
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,590
humiliated like this!

236
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,920
Mother,

237
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,680
it's my fault

238
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,470
for implicating you.

239
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,790
Qilan,

240
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,390
I'm very happy

241
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,990
to see you with a good husband.

242
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,750
However hard she tries to humiliate me,

243
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,720
I can endure it.

244
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,720
However,

245
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,120
I'm afraid you'll be bullied

246
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,590
in the mansion.

247
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,670
I haven't slept

248
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,110
for days and nights.

249
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,310
Qilan,

250
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,110
has she been bullying you?

251
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,440
Of course not.

252
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,470
Mother,

253
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,350
Master Jingxiu treats me very well,

254
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,800
so she's wary

255
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,080
and won't do anything to me.

256
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,280
That's good.

257
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,550
Qilan,

258
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,110
now I can rest easy.

259
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,440
But

260
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,550
Wang Danling

261
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,990
is not easy to deal with.

262
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,230
Even if Master Jingxiu cherishes you,

263
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,080
you still need to be careful.

264
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:46,870
I understand.

265
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,830
Mother, don't worry.

266
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,360
Have you applied medicine?

267
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:04,790
Yunjiu,

268
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,040
we are

269
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,870
at a marriageable age.

270
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,950
Indeed.

271
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,280
Yunyi,

272
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,590
I've never asked you

273
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,200
what kind of woman you like.

274
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,830
I still think

275
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,080
a cute, delicate woman

276
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,360
is the most lovable.

277
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,320
We're different.

278
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,110
I like

279
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,440
tall,

280
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,870
cool women.

281
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,950
What a surprise.

282
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,630
This medicinal dish is
from Consort Jiangli

283
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,560
to Master Jingming.

284
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,790
Okay, thank you.

285
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,710
Miss Yulan,

286
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,240
have you finished

287
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,320
Consort Jiangli's work?

288
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,070
Yes.

289
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,720
If you're not busy,

290
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,160
would you like to sit down,

291
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,240
enjoy some cakes,

292
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,360
and have tea?

293
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:13,920
No need.

294
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,320
I've had lunch today.

295
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,390
Miss Yulan,

296
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,510
would you like

297
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,910
to sit down and chat?

298
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,840
Chat about what?

299
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:26,510
Well,

300
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,590
is Wind Pavilion...

301
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,080
Sorry, I can't tell you anything
about Wind Pavilion.

302
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,720
What did you say, Yunyi?

303
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,940
(Prefect's Mansion)

304
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,840
Sir,

305
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:05,950
what are you doing?

306
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,240
The former Director of Astrology

307
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,240
used to step on my back
to get on the horse.

308
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,030
Please get up.

309
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,960
We don't have such rules here.

310
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,240
Driving the carriage is your job;

311
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,030
being the Director of Astrology is mine.

312
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,280
Neither job is more noble

313
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,920
than the other.

314
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,060
Don't do this in the future.

315
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,470
Alright.

316
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,910
Princess Qingqing.

317
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,150
How did you know it was me?

318
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,080
Your Grace,

319
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,390
this carriage is taking me
to the Astrology Bureau.

320
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,710
I don't think

321
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,040
you're heading there.

322
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,480
I want to go to Moon Jewelry.

323
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,760
If you want to go, just go.

324
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,560
No need to do this.

325
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,590
Your carriage to the Astrology Bureau

326
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,910
will pass by Moon Jewelry,

327
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,080
so you can give me a ride.

328
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,870
Greetings, Consort Danling.

329
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,070
The ledgers you asked me to check

330
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,040
have been finished.

331
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,190
You're just brushing me off.

332
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,350
What kind of thing is that?

333
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,670
These ledgers have been
carefully reviewed.

334
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,190
Indeed, My Lady.

335
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,110
Ms. Qilan has not slept
for several nights

336
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,670
because of these ledgers.

337
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,960
Who are you

338
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,720
to speak to Consort Danling?

339
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,560
It seems

340
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,390
it isn't an issue of attitude

341
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,590
but rather of ability.

342
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,590
In that case, I should

343
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,390
teach you about the rules.

344
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,270
Yuzhu,

345
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,520
take the ledgers of the mansion

346
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,280
in the last year to her room.

347
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,320
You should

348
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,240
check them one by one

349
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,190
to practice.

350
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,550
My Lady,

351
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,000
Ms. Qilan's health

352
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
has just recovered. Could we...

353
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,080
Did you hear a single word

354
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,000
of what I said earlier?

355
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,670
Today,

356
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,110
I'll teach you a lesson

357
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,590
on behalf of Lady Lan.

358
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,160
Stop.

359
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,490
Consort Danling, please calm down.

360
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,870
I'll go over the accounts properly.

361
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,910
Please don't hold it against her.

362
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,110
My Lady...

363
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,270
My Lady.

364
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,110
How lowly

365
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,910
yet fragile.

366
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,430
My Lady,

367
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,920
she seems to be in poor condition.

368
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,190
Perhaps something happened.

369
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,800
Should we call the physician?

370
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,520
If anything goes wrong,

371
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,750
Master Jingxiu

372
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,600
might blame you.

373
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:27,470
How unlucky.

374
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,420
Take her back to her room.

375
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,560
Thank you, My Lady.

376
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,160
Ms. Qilan.

377
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,640
What's wrong with her

378
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,760
fainting all the time?

379
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,650
Congratulations, Lady Lan.

380
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,980
You're pregnant.

381
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,360
Really?

382
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,080
Pregnant?

383
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,870
Thank you, physician.

384
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,720
In that case,

385
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,490
please give me some antiabortifacient.

386
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,670
Yes.

387
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,480
My Lady, come on.

388
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:55,750
How could you not know

389
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,350
you were pregnant?

390
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,990
Fuling.

391
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,800
Stay here then

392
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,320
to take care of Lady Lan.

393
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,870
Miss Yuzhu, thank you for your concern.

394
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,760
My Lady,

395
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,440
Master Jingxiu

396
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,510
might find out

397
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,000
about her pregnancy soon.

398
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,520
What do you know?

399
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,590
Only by knowing earlier

400
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,960
can I make arrangements sooner.

401
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,010
My Lady, please don't be impulsive.

402
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,440
If something happens to her baby,

403
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,190
Master Jingxiu will surely blame you.

404
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,640
How could I let something

405
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,190
happen to her child?

406
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,320
If it's a boy,

407
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,760
I'll be happy for Master Jingxiu.

408
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,080
But if she has a boy,

409
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,430
our lives...

410
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,780
It'd be better if that boy
were born without a mother

411
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,390
so I could raise her son for her.

412
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,830
I understand.

413
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,720
I happen

414
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,110
to know a formula

415
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,780
that can protect the pregnancy,

416
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,720
but it might weaken the mother
after childbirth.

417
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,110
If she takes it every day,

418
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,320
she will be weak

419
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,830
after giving birth

420
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,070
and unable to care for herself.

421
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,870
Be careful with this.

422
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,230
Understood.

423
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,190
Yuzhu,

424
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,670
who will become

425
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,430
the most respected woman in Dongzhou?

426
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,760
Of course, it will be you.

427
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,990
No.

428
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,150
It'll be the future wife of the Prefect.

429
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,400
Qilan.

430
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,120
Danling.

431
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,590
I've made this antiabortifacient
for you.

432
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,800
You must take it every day.

433
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,110
Thank you,

434
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,800
Consort Danling.

435
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,240
You should focus on your health.

436
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,760
Don't worry
about the house affairs for now.

437
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,390
You can learn it later.

438
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,070
The priority right now

439
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,720
is for Master Jingxiu to have an heir.

440
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,590
I understand.

441
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,240
Qilan.

442
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,040
Don't move.

443
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,320
Look at you.

444
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,440
You're pregnant now.

445
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,320
You don't have to curtsy anymore.

446
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,590
Qilan is so sensible.

447
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,560
I've brought you some tonics.

448
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,520
You need to take good care of yourself.

449
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,590
Thank you, Mother.

450
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:51,990
Mother,

451
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,790
I've also prepared antiabortifacient

452
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:55,790
and various tonics

453
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,200
to help Qilan nourish her pregnancy.

454
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,640
Good, Danling.

455
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,320
You've always liked the scriptures.

456
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,640
Lately, copy more scriptures

457
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,800
and pray for Qilan.

458
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,630
It's Qilan's first pregnancy,

459
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,640
so you must be extra careful.

460
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,280
Don't let anything go wrong.

461
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:13,160
Mother, I'll remember your teachings.

462
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,080
Alright.

463
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,750
There are so many people around you.

464
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,040
You must be tired.

465
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,960
We'll go back now.

466
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,880
Rest well.

467
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,080
Mother, take care.

468
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,400
Mother, take care.

469
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,350
Master Jingxiu, I'll...

470
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,270
Leave then.

471
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,470
Qilan,

472
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,240
you're pregnant,

473
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,560
yet I still had you manage
the household.

474
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,430
It must've been hard.

475
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,680
To carry your child

476
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,920
is my blessing.

477
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,040
How could it be hard?

478
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,310
My Lady,

479
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,340
she's just pregnant
with Master Jingxiu's child.

480
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,340
Look at her smugness.

481
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,600
My Lady,

482
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,630
don't worry too much.

483
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,240
She's already taken the medicine.

484
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,150
Everything will be fine.

485
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,390
Why her?

486
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,080
It's been five years.

487
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,430
Master Jingxiu hasn't looked at anyone,

488
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,190
but why did he marry Shen Qilan?

489
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,430
What's so good about her?

490
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,600
Danling.

491
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,840
Young Master.

492
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,360
You may leave now.

493
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,430
Yes.

494
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,120
Danling,

495
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,760
I've been busy these days

496
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,830
and haven't checked on you.

497
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,830
You're not upset with me, are you?

498
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,860
How could I be, Master Jingxiu?

499
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,960
Qilan's pregnancy

500
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:21,150
is a great joy for our mansion.

501
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,590
Don't you think so?

502
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,870
Of course.

503
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,550
We've been married for many years,

504
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,910
yet I haven't had children.

505
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,310
Now that Qilan

506
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,830
can help you with this,

507
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,430
I am

508
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,630
truly happy.

509
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,480
She's helping us with this.

510
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,360
Danling,

511
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,670
you're my consort

512
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,270
and the child's lineal mother.

513
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,190
So,

514
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,760
the child is also yours.

515
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,320
Yes.

516
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:49,030
There are some things

517
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:49,950
I need to tell you.

518
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,800
I can let go of the past grudges

519
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,760
between you and Qilan,

520
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,670
but when it comes to the child,

521
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,800
I won't tolerate it.

522
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:02,040
Because this is my child

523
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,390
and the child of our Lu family.

524
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,140
Master Jingxiu, don't worry.

525
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,240
I understand.

526
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,750
I'll take good care of Qilan

527
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,190
and ensure the child is born safely.

528
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,430
Good.

529
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:27,950
Your wine.

530
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,120
Sir, please come in.

531
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,000
Waiter.

532
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,830
Bring us a few jars

533
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:36,950
of your best Nu Er Hong wine.

534
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,680
Sir, please wait a moment.

535
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,720
Captain Wang, this isn't quite right.

536
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,000
The army has a strict order:

537
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,110
No drinking during training.

538
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,000
You're acting so timid.

539
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,600
Now, in Dongzhou,

540
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,640
who doesn't know

541
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,760
Master Jingxiu's concubine is pregnant?

542
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,590
Let's take a break.

543
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,590
Sit down.

544
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,510
Sit.

545
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,590
Though Master Jingxiu gave us

546
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,520
half a day off,

547
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,520
we are still Golden Guards.

548
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,920
Eat if you want to;

549
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,390
leave if you don't.

550
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,550
What's wrong with Golden Guards

551
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,000
relaxing a little?

552
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,750
Since you're so strict with the rules,

553
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,080
why don't you go to Qilin Guards?

554
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,230
I...

555
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:11,670
Come here.

556
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,680
Let me tell you.

557
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,680
Dongzhou

558
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,880
will belong to Master Jingxiu

559
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,480
sooner or later.

560
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,400
Master Jingxiu

561
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,150
values this child.

562
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,390
It's been five years,

563
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,110
and I still have no child.

564
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,670
But Shen Qilan got pregnant
soon after she came.

565
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,590
Tell me.

566
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,040
Will Master Jingxiu

567
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,520
favor her even more in the future?

568
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,150
My Lady,

569
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,270
Master Jingxiu will always love you.

570
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,320
He has never blamed you for this.

571
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,070
After all these years,

572
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,320
you two are so loving.

573
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,870
We all see it.

574
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,670
No.

575
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,000
Does love matter that much

576
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,720
in the Prefect's family?

577
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:22,190
The Prefect dotes on Lady Shu,

578
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,000
but after all these years,

579
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:27,150
Lady Wang still gave birth
to Master Jingxiu

580
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,390
and secured her position
as the Prefect's wife.

581
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,240
But didn't we say

582
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,350
we only wanted the child?

583
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,480
Even if they had a child,

584
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,480
they'd still call you Mother.

585
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,800
Even so,

586
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,870
I don't think Shen Qilan

587
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,720
is so easy to deal with.

588
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,320
She seems weak and frail,

589
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,870
but didn't you notice

590
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,620
how Master Jingxiu has changed

591
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,000
since she entered the mansion?

592
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,800
Well...

593
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:02,920
How can Shen Qilan

594
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,190
compare to you?

595
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,640
Master Jingxiu...

596
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,550
Master Jingxiu

597
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:09,080
must've just been momentarily charmed.

598
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,870
Sir, look.

599
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,480
It's time to pay for the wine...

600
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,230
Use the credit.

601
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,160
Sir,

602
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,630
our profits are thin here.

603
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,110
You haven't paid last year's bill.

604
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,910
Who do you think you are?

605
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,560
Do you know

606
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,110
that Lady Qilan is pregnant?

607
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,560
Everyone is celebrating.

608
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,680
- Yes.
- Yeah.

609
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,870
How dare you

610
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,480
cause trouble now?

611
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,680
Sir,

612
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,910
it's only right

613
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,760
that you pay for your drinks and food.

614
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,640
Is that so?

615
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,680
I'm telling you.

616
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,390
Master Jingxiu makes the rules.

617
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,520
How can you resort to violence?

618
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,400
How can you hit him?

619
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,960
How dare you talk back?

620
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,390
I'll kill you!

621
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,600
Who is it?

622
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,440
Is this how Master Jingxiu leads

623
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,630
Golden Guards?

624
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:26,480
How can you point your saber
at commoners so easily?

625
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,480
Master Jingming.

626
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,760
What Master Jingming?

627
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,960
He's just a loser

628
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:34,110
to Master Jingxiu...

629
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,720
The Prefect loves his people.

630
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:41,180
If he knew you were bullying
the shopkeeper like this,

631
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,470
he wouldn't let it go easily.

632
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,390
If the Prefect knows about today,

633
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,110
Master Jingxiu
won't have it easy either.

634
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,750
- This...
- I'm not sure

635
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,860
if you'll survive his rage.

636
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,180
Master Jingming.

637
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,480
Master Jingming, please spare us!

638
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,720
I won't dare again!

639
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,590
I will

640
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,550
clear the debts here

641
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,470
right away.

642
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,590
I'll do it now.

643
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,520
And?

644
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,070
Oh, yes.

645
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:05,990
Yes, yes.

646
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:09,100
I'll compensate for the tables, chairs,

647
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,060
and dishes broken today.

648
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:10,970
Anything else?

649
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,560
Anything else?

650
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,110
Master Jingming,
I truly know my mistake.

651
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,110
I'm so sorry.

652
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,110
Please forgive me.

653
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,240
Forgive me.

654
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,150
In Golden Guards,

655
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,000
I'm sure you're not the only

656
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,830
domineering ones.

657
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,880
Master Jingming, rest assured.

658
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,830
I'll go back

659
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,280
and tell the brothers in Golden Guards

660
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,830
to be cautious in speech and behavior.

661
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,260
We won't make the same mistake again.

662
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,270
Hurry up and leave!

663
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:41,580
- Thanks, Master Jingming.
- Thanks, Master Jingming.

664
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:48,640
Your Grace,

665
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,080
what style would you like to see?

666
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,830
We just received a batch

667
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,960
of peony jade pendants.

668
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,390
I'd like to see the men's styles.

669
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,110
We have the finest cool jade
from Beizhou.

670
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:00,590
Take a look.

671
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:03,950
Look at this.

672
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,560
It's truly beautiful.

673
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,630
Jiangli.

674
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,150
Qingqing,

675
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,230
did you come alone?

676
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,940
Where are your maids and nannies?

677
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,840
I came to buy a gift for Mr. Chu.

678
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,640
The other day, my face was scratched
by a flower branch,

679
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,630
and it was Mr. Chu who helped treat it.

680
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,590
He treated your wound,

681
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,960
so you want to give him a gift?

682
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,520
What about me?

683
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,880
Jiangli...

684
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,310
I'm teasing you.

685
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,440
It must be fate.

686
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,760
The ointment
that healed your facial scar,

687
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,850
the modified Taiyi ointment,

688
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,880
was also developed by Zimo.

689
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,760
I just used

690
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,270
his ointment to help you.

691
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,750
It's Mr. Chu?

692
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,710
Didn't he tell you?

693
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,230
Zimo never leaves his name

694
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,000
after doing good deeds.

695
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,200
Jiangli,

696
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,880
you know Mr. Chu well.

697
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,480
What do you think

698
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,560
I should give him as a gift?

699
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,190
Zimo has traveled
through all four states,

700
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,560
helping people everywhere.

701
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,440
He doesn't care

702
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,040
about material things.

703
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,150
I think I know what to give him now.

704
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,440
The arrogance of Golden Guards

705
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,460
must be because Master Jingxiu
is indulging them.

706
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,090
You should've taken them to the Prefect.

707
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,510
Then Master Jingxiu will be punished

708
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,260
for failing to discipline
his subordinates.

709
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,660
Do you think Master Jingming
didn't see that?

710
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,790
With Golden Guards
causing such a scandal,

711
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,940
the Prefect will surely punish
Master Jingxiu.

712
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,570
Master Jingxiu is so proud,

713
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:29,580
and Lady Lan is pregnant,

714
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,900
attracting everyone's attention.

715
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,560
If he is punished by the Prefect now,

716
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,110
he will surely be enraged.

717
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:35,840
He can't do anything to Master Jingming,

718
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,040
but what about the shopkeeper?

719
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,590
It'll only cause him harm.

720
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,220
Then why help him in the first place?

721
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,800
So, that's why Master Jingming did this.

722
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,840
Is there really nothing
we can do about it?

723
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,630
They'll be doomed by their own actions.

724
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,920
Can you understand it?

725
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,400
How is it?

726
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,590
Your writing

727
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,080
is truly powerful.

728
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,150
Come on, sit.

729
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,280
Oh, right.

730
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,200
Try this.

731
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,280
Is it delicious?

732
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:22,150
This is the best pastry
I've ever tasted.

733
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,550
Come on, try it.

734
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,470
You should try it too.

735
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,790
Try this piece.

736
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,150
Danling is here.

737
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,050
Greetings, Master Jingxiu.

738
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,230
Greetings, Danling.

739
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,510
I've prepared some children's toys

740
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:42,330
and clothes for Qilan.

741
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,920
Qilan, take a look. Do you like them?

742
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,210
Danling, you're very thoughtful.

743
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,640
They're really cute.

744
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,040
I'm glad you like them.

745
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,360
Danling, you're so thoughtful.

746
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:57,000
Danling, stay and have dinner with us.

747
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:00,230
I have work to do,
so I'll head back first.

748
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,670
I won't disturb you two any longer.

749
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,760
Alright.

750
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,630
Danling, take care.

751
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,150
Master Jingxiu, look.

752
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,470
Look.

753
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,560
Look at these shoes.

754
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,150
They're really beautiful.

755
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:24,990
Summer and autumn.

756
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,040
It's clearly spring and reversal.

757
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,520
Spring and reversal.

758
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,460
(Master Jingming's Mansion)

759
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:46,960
Miss Yuzhu.

760
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,150
Don't think that you can rise
to prominence

761
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,470
just because Lady Lan is pregnant

762
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:53,890
with Master Jingxiu's child.

763
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,790
I'm telling you.

764
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,040
She's only a concubine.

765
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,030
Even her child has to call

766
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,880
Consort Danling Mother.

767
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,960
Everyone knows the status

768
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,250
of the Wang family in Dongzhou.

769
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,520
You should think about it.

770
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,480
Miss Yuzhu, you're right.

771
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:13,880
The Wang family's reputation

772
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,440
is well-known in Dongzhou,

773
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,940
but since Lady Lan came,

774
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,430
she's been putting the consort first.

775
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,670
She's never been disrespectful.

776
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,480
We never intended to compete
with the consort.

777
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,890
Why be so aggressive

778
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,880
and not let us go?

779
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,520
Because you standing here

780
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:29,300
with a humble background

781
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,360
is a mistake.

782
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,190
A low-born concubine's daughter

783
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,280
living under the same roof
as our consort

784
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,310
makes me feel unlucky.

785
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,400
Right and wrong are not things

786
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,470
for you and me to judge.

787
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,310
Regardless, the Prefect
granted the marriage

788
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:42,790
between Lady Lan and Master Jingxiu,

789
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:44,120
and Master Jingxiu proposed this.

790
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,510
Was your earlier remark

791
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,960
questioning the Prefect

792
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,960
or blaming Master Jingxiu?

793
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,070
You...

794
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,630
Lady Lan is pregnant,
so I can't stay long.

795
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,590
Consort Danling is in good health.

796
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,080
I assume you must be quite free.

797
00:39:59,070 --> 00:39:59,990
Feel free to leave.
