Thank you.

26
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,040
My family finally has an heir.

27
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,760
It's truly comforting.

28
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,470
Indeed.

29
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,830
You're truly blessed.

30
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,120
How fortunate.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,960
Yanyan?

32
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,720
Yanyan?

33
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,830
Yanyan?

34
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,800
Yanyan?

35
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,470
Don't worry. In the Prefect's Mansion,

36
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,960
he'll definitely be safe.

37
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,670
Let's split up.

38
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,640
I'll go that way.

39
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,870
Then I'll go this way.

40
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,520
- Yanyan?
- Yanyan?

41
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,150
Yanyan,

42
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,590
why are you here alone?

43
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,750
Who are you?

44
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,750
I'm your mother's younger sister.

45
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,240
You should call me Aunt.

46
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,550
Are you catching fireflies?

47
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,520
Let me help you.

48
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,990
Yanyan?

49
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,390
Yanyan?

50
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,640
Yanyan?

51
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,520
Let me catch one for you.

52
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,640
Look at this.

53
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,480
Yanyan?

54
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,240
- Yanyan?
- Yanyan?

55
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,030
Look over there.

56
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,480
Shall we catch that one?

57
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,150
Come on.

58
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,270
Yanyan?

59
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,240
Yanyan!

60
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,590
Yanyan!

61
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,520
Shen Qilan, you...

62
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,830
Go on.

63
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,520
Mother.

64
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,630
Yanyan,

65
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,310
didn't I tell you not to run off?

66
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,870
I was just catching fireflies with Aunt.

67
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,430
Don't worry, Jiangli.

68
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,710
A firefly flew toward the lake just now.

69
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,870
Come here.

70
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,590
Yanyan.

71
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,240
You mustn't run off again.

72
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,550
If we can't find you,

73
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,920
your mother will be worried.

74
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,430
I will remember.

75
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,670
Good boy.

76
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,470
Jiangli, you're truly fortunate

77
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,870
to have married such a fine man
as Master Jingming.

78
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,600
Even after so long apart,

79
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,990
he still treats Yanyan like his son.

80
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,550
You're getting insolent.

81
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,640
Yanyan is my son.

82
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,150
Please don't be offended,
Master Jingming.

83
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,390
Sorry for speaking out of turn.

84
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,080
But

85
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,510
Jiangli suddenly brought back a child,

86
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,630
and you just believed her?

87
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,280
Shen Qilan, you...

88
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,940
So, this is the kind of manners

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,160
they teach

90
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,550
at Master Jingxiu's Mansion.

91
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,040
Yanyan, how about I take you
to see the fireworks?

92
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,160
Fireworks!

93
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,040
I want to see fireworks!

94
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,960
Let's go.

95
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,390
Shen Qilan,

96
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,680
if you dare to harm Yanyan,

97
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,510
I won't let you go.

98
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,950
Jiangli, what are you worried about?

99
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,040
I'm Yanyan's aunt, after all.

100
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,680
You can't run off again.

101
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,760
Do you hear me?

102
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,070
Yes.

103
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,950
Yanyan,

104
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,550
come here. Let me hold you.

105
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,550
Grandfather, Grandmother.

106
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,470
Good boy.

107
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,070
How are you so adorable?

108
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,310
- Look.
- Look.

109
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:28,960
Isn't it beautiful?

110
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,990
So beautiful!

111
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,720
So pretty!

112
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,790
- Look at this.
- Do you like it?

113
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,200
It's stunning!

114
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,120
Look!

115
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,200
Isn't it beautiful?

116
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,840
That one is beautiful too.

117
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,770
♪The wind and moon
fall through our fingers♪

118
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,010
♪Like a dream that will return
to the starry night♪

119
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,480
So beautiful.

120
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,580
♪Turning into cycles flowing in time♪

121
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,040
So pretty.

122
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,680
That one's the highest.

123
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,240
Do you like it?

124
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,200
Yes.

125
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,480
Mr. Chu, why don't you go over there?

126
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,310
The view's better on that side.

127
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,840
The view

128
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,160
doesn't matter.

129
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,040
What matters is being with family.

130
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,040
If you're alone,

131
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,630
it doesn't matter where you watch from.

132
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,640
Go on.

133
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,310
Your family is over there.

134
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,430
I have other things to do after this.

135
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,240
I'll have to leave for a while.

136
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,720
Where are you going?

137
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,870
When will you leave?

138
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,950
And when will you be back?

139
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,680
You're asking me
so many questions at once.

140
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,280
I don't know how to answer you.

141
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,720
Then start from the beginning.

142
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,680
Mr. Chu,

143
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,430
when you return,

144
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,950
will you watch the fireworks

145
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,480
with me again?

146
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,560
Great.

147
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,600
Yanyan has finally

148
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,680
been acknowledged this time.

149
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,070
Now I don't have to worry
about slipping up.

150
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,760
Yanyan has finally returned

151
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,390
to his rightful family.

152
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,830
But

153
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,800
I don't think Jingxiu

154
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,480
is happy about this.

155
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,230
The Prefect's eldest grandson

156
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,830
is Jingming's son.

157
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,800
How could he be happy?

158
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,570
Let's not talk about that.

159
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,950
Do you remember

160
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,230
that Jingming and Jiangli

161
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,750
told us not to tell anyone?

162
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,750
We were so afraid of slipping up

163
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,630
that we fled Dongzhou in the night.

164
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,270
Of course.

165
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,040
If we had stayed back then,

166
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,820
with how loose our tongues are,

167
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,870
we definitely would've
let something slip.

168
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,990
It's okay now. Everyone's happy.

169
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,640
Let's drink.

170
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,360
- Here.
- Cheers.

171
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,040
Master Jingxiu,

172
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,320
don't let today's events trouble you.

173
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,040
This wine

174
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,960
needs to be savored slowly.

175
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,720
Relax, Master Jingxiu.

176
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,910
We'll have children

177
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,320
sooner or later.

178
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:16,990
Besides,

179
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,080
this child may now be

180
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,790
a strength to Master Jingming,

181
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,480
but perhaps someday,

182
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,630
he'll become a blade pointed at him.

183
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,120
Do you have a plan?

184
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,670
A plan? Not really.

185
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,520
But that is

186
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,630
how the world works.

187
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,270
The way of heaven avoids fullness.

188
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,800
Excessive prosperity leads to decline.

189
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,670
The time

190
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,680
for the fire to die out

191
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,200
is near.

192
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,630
Good wine.

193
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,440
What's on your mind?

194
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,270
In ten days,

195
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,150
it'll be Mr. Song's initiation ceremony.

196
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,670
Yanyan

197
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,990
will formally become his disciple.

198
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,200
It should be a happy occasion,

199
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,910
but I just can't shake this unease.

200
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,470
Think about it.

201
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,400
Now that Mother and Father

202
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,960
have acknowledged Yanyan,

203
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,960
that means from now on,

204
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,360
he'll have the Lu family backing him up.

205
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,840
So surely, only good things will happen,

206
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,510
nothing bad.

207
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,510
Don't overthink it.

208
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
Get some rest.

209
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,300
(Master Jingming's Mansion)

210
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,280
Yunyi.

211
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,600
I think Master Jingming
and Consort Jiangli

212
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,480
are already deeply in love.

213
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,380
Yanyan's identity
has also been confirmed.

214
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,320
It's time.

215
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,240
Yunyi, I'm still nervous.

216
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,670
I think Miss Yulan

217
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,910
is gentle, graceful,

218
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,790
and skilled in martial arts.

219
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,480
She's a perfect match for you.

220
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,320
You are

221
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,270
a dignified man,

222
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,310
Master Jingming's trusted aide,

223
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,080
and our mansion's second-best fighter.

224
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,240
You have nothing to be afraid of.

225
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,080
Miss Yulan

226
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,630
is already waiting.

227
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,960
Yunyi,

228
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,120
how well you know

229
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,040
about romance.

230
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,560
Are you here

231
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,110
to see Master Jingming?

232
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,510
No.

233
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,910
Are you here

234
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,870
to see Consort Jiangli?

235
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,670
No.

236
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,400
Who are you here to see?

237
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,750
You.

238
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,750
Me? What for?

239
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,240
There is indeed something

240
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,990
I wish to tell you.

241
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,440
We've known each other

242
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,630
for a while now.

243
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,670
I'm sure you have some idea

244
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,870
of my character and conduct.

245
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,790
Well, I don't, actually.

246
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,500
There's no time then.

247
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,440
You...

248
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,080
Are you here to borrow money from me?

249
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,960
No. Please don't misunderstand.

250
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,750
You scared me.

251
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,710
Come on.

252
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,910
What's this?

253
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,840
I wonder if you know my feelings.

254
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,850
Jiangli once said to me:

255
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:41,830
When mountains crumble,

256
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:42,760
rivers run dry,

257
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,670
thunder rumbles in winter,
snow falls in summer,

258
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,710
and heaven and earth unite,

259
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,220
only then would I part with you.

260
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,080
"Part with you"?

261
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,080
What do you think?

262
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,670
She said she has someone she likes.

263
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,400
It's okay.

264
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,870
There are plenty of flowers
in the world.

265
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,270
No need to cling to just one.

266
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,200
Romantic things are just too hard.

267
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,320
She recited a poem to my face,

268
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,270
but the poem was for someone else.

269
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:35,260
(Master Jingming's Mansion)

270
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:38,080
Father, Mother, hurry up!

271
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,950
It's my big day today.

272
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,600
We can't be late.

273
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,390
You're acting so serious about it.

274
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,880
Yanyan,

275
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,660
have you memorized
the Encouraging Learning

276
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,580
I've been teaching you?

277
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,470
Father,

278
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,790
I can recite it now.

279
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,270
Good boy. Let's go.

280
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:06,220
(Master Jingming's Mansion)

281
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,030
Mother, I want a candied hawthorn.

282
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,470
Yanyan,

283
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,560
how about later?

284
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,870
After class,

285
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,720
I'll get you the whole bunch, okay?

286
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,720
It's a deal then.

287
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,240
- Let's make a pinky promise.
- Let's make a pinky promise.

288
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,550
- Come on.
- Let's go.

289
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,510
Let's go.

290
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,750
Yanyan, be good.

291
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,670
What's wrong with you?

292
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,720
Watch where you're going.

293
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,440
Crazy old woman.

294
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,660
(Hanlin School)

295
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,150
Greetings, My Lord.

296
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:56,480
My sons Jingxiu, Jingming, and Jingxing

297
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,240
have all learned well
under your teaching.

298
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,790
This time, I entrust you

299
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,280
with my eldest grandson.

300
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,390
It's my duty.

301
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,560
Grandfather, Grandmother.

302
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,720
Yanyan.

303
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,680
Yanyan,

304
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,360
greet Mr. Song.

305
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,910
Greetings, Mr. Song.

306
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,990
Very good.

307
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,750
Mr. Song, you're a man of great talent.

308
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,790
I believe Yanyan will flourish

309
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,200
under your guidance.

310
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,080
With your vision and talent, My Lord,

311
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,910
your grandson must be highly gifted.

312
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,310
To teach him

313
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,200
is truly my honor.

314
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,790
Thank you, Mr. Song.

315
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,920
Please.

316
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,080
Yanyan.

317
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,670
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

318
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,360
- Okay, let's go.
- Come on, Yanyan.

319
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,180
From the primal chaos came Yin and Yang.

320
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,860
Of all things,
humans are the most divine.

321
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,610
Humans are an unusual creature
in the world

322
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,360
for they stand above all
by virtue and mind.

323
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,060
- A pillar among the three realms.
- Xuan!

324
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,040
Xuan!

325
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,360
That's my Xuan!

326
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,040
- That's my Xuan!
- You can't go in.

327
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,690
What's going on?

328
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,040
This woman is trying to break in.

329
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,080
That's my Xuan!

330
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,480
Stop her.

331
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,320
Xuan!

332
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,560
Xuan!

333
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,960
Xuan! That's my Xuan!

334
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,150
That's my child!

335
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,360
Xuan!

336
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,720
You silly woman.

337
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,320
Stop this. He's not your son.

338
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:08,990
Look carefully.

339
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,240
He's the Prefect's eldest son.

340
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,950
He's my Xuan.

341
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,120
He's my child.

342
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,510
I won't get it wrong.

343
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,150
Xuan.

344
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,750
Come to me.

345
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,560
I missed you so much.

346
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:21,750
Xuan.

347
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,710
My Lord.

348
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,120
She doesn't seem

349
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,560
to be faking it.

350
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,120
Perhaps we should take her in
for questioning.

351
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:29,720
- After all,
- My child.

352
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,030
Yanyan is now your eldest grandson.

353
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,880
I beg you.

354
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,710
Please give me back my child.

355
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,440
I beg you.

356
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,080
Take her inside.

357
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,790
I beg you.

358
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,510
Xuan.

359
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,400
Tell me.

360
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,200
Why did you say Yanyan is your child?

361
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,870
If there's a single lie in your words,

362
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,090
you'll be executed on the spot.

363
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,600
My name is Qingniang.

364
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,390
I'm from Pei Village.

365
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,990
I have a four-year-old child

366
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,000
named Xuan.

367
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,230
He went missing six months ago,

368
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,360
and I've been searching for him since.

369
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,360
A few days ago,

370
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,910
neighbors told me

371
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,910
they saw Xuan in Dongzhou.

372
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,040
So I came to look for him.

373
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,040
And today,

374
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,670
I finally saw him.

375
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,870
Six months ago?

376
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,110
I remember Jiangli

377
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,000
returned six months ago too.

378
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,510
All these years,

379
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,760
you've smeared my name over and over.

380
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,040
Now you use Yanyan
to stir up more trouble.

381
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,000
I'll say it once.

382
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,320
Yanyan is the child of me
and Master Jingming.

383
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,870
Mother, I'm scared.

384
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,160
Don't be scared.

385
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,270
I'm here.

386
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,520
Tell the truth.

387
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,120
Who told you to say this?

388
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,760
Everything I said is true.

389
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,360
Xuan is my son.

390
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,630
If he's yours,

391
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,280
why doesn't he recognize you?

392
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:02,190
I don't know what they did to him.

393
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,630
He's only been away for half a year,

394
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,800
and he's forgotten about me.

395
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,230
This is ridiculous.

396
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,800
It's Qingniang today.

397
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,000
It might be someone else tomorrow

398
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,460
coming here to fight for my grandson.

399
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,910
This woman seems mentally unstable.

400
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,280
Go find a child

401
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,230
around Yanyan's age.

402
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,550
Understood.

403
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,640
Xuan...

404
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,390
Do you have any proof

405
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,320
that Yanyan is your child?

406
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,000
There's a scar on Xuan's wrist.

407
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,870
He got burned by the stove

408
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,040
when he was young

409
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,120
because of my negligence.

410
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:53,920
My Lord,

411
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,280
there really is a scar.

412
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,880
Yanyan does have one on his wrist.

413
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,150
When I was boiling medicine,

414
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,280
he got burned by accident.

415
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,950
Xuan is my son.

416
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,670
Give him back.

417
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,000
Xuan.

418
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,670
Don't you recognize your mother?

419
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,760
Come to me.

420
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,230
Come here.

421
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,440
Qingniang.

422
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,710
Look.

423
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,600
Your Xuan is right here.

424
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,120
No, he's not my Xuan.

425
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,310
Qingniang,

426
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,590
look carefully.

427
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,600
This is Xuan.

428
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,430
He's not my Xuan.

429
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,200
He's not my son.

430
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,110
Xuan,

431
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,280
come to me.

432
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:36,120
Don't you recognize me, Xuan?

433
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,600
I miss you so much.

434
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,080
Xuan...

435
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,790
Jiangli,

436
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,870
what is going on?

437
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,160
Father,

438
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,310
Yanyan really is my child with Jiangli.

439
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,520
There's no doubt about that.

440
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,000
Jingming,

441
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,150
don't be fooled.

442
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,080
Think about it.

443
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,960
No one has ever heard

444
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,150
of her giving birth.

445
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,390
It's been five years.

446
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,870
It's impossible
there was no news at all.

447
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,760
We can't confirm
if she's given birth before,

448
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,310
but if she took someone else's child

449
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,430
and faked it,

450
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,670
there must've been some traces left.

451
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,510
My Lord,

452
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,200
perhaps we should send someone

453
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,600
to search Rain Chamber.

454
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,840
Father.

455
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,640
Guards.

456
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,280
Search Rain Chamber.

457
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,710
- Yes.
- Yes.

458
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,630
You check over there and there.

459
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,710
- Yes.
- Yes.

460
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,070
Search thoroughly.

461
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,620
(Spirit Tablet of Shen Yanyan)

462
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,550
Xuan,

463
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,870
I'm here.

464
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,910
Xuan, don't be afraid.

465
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,280
My Lord, we found this in Rain Chamber.

466
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,340
(Spirit Tablet of Shen Yanyan)

467
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,700
(Spirit Tablet of Shen Yanyan)

468
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,600
This is outrageous!

469
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,510
How could

470
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,000
such filthy tricks

471
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,560
be used on a living child?

472
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,230
We have the evidence and a witness.

473
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,910
What else do you have to say?

474
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,680
My Lord,

475
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,630
it seems the real Shen Yanyan

476
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,320
died at the ancestral tomb.

477
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,320
To return to Master Jingming,

478
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,820
Shen Jiangli stole someone else's child
to pose as her own.

479
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,680
I'm not an impostor!

480
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,150
I'm Mother's child!

481
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,510
Father,

482
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,600
this matter

483
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,360
must not be concluded so soon.

484
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,040
Give me a chance.

485
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,520
I'll restore the truth.

486
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,480
Take this woman away.

487
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,350
Yes.

488
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,440
- Come to me.
- Move.

489
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,520
My son...

490
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,970
- Xuan, I'm your mother.
- Until the truth comes to light,

491
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,520
Shen Jiangli is not
to leave the mansion.

492
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,960
- Yes.
- My Lord...

493
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:15,750
Jingming.

494
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,510
Don't worry.

495
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,470
I've got this.

496
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,120
Mother...

497
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,080
Let Yanyan

498
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,870
stay with me for now.

499
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,550
Grandfather...

500
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,040
You didn't see it.

501
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,240
Lady Shu looked

502
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,520
so mad today.

503
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,000
She was so smug before.

504
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,790
So,

505
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,350
is Yanyan really not

506
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,520
Jingming's child?

507
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,000
Well, that doesn't matter anymore.

508
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,550
With all the evidence,

509
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,230
she's already been dragged into the mud.

510
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,920
Today,

511
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,560
I just wanted to test them,

512
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,390
so I suggested searching Rain Chamber.

513
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,630
But I didn't expect

514
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:20,190
they'd actually find
the child's spirit tablet.

515
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,080
Luckily, Qilan reminded me

516
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,200
that Shen Jiangli's return

517
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,470
couldn't be so simple.

518
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,910
Mother, you're getting sharper.

519
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,000
If Shen Yanyan really isn't

520
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,710
the Prefect's eldest grandchild,

521
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,560
then heaven is clearly helping you.

522
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,120
It's best to settle this matter early.

523
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,600
Besides,

524
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,120
my sister has always been
a troublemaker.

525
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,480
She never cared about the Shen family

526
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,210
and refused to stay
at the ancestral tomb.

527
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,200
Now,

528
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,230
she even brings back a child
with no clear origin.

529
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,390
If we give her more time,

530
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,190
who knows what else might happen?

531
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:56,760
Let's see what kind of storm
she'll stir up.

532
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,470
Alright.

533
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,430
- Come on.
- Let's have a drink.

534
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,120
Mother.

535
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,920
Qilan.

536
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,880
Master Jingxiu.

537
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,680
Put it down.

538
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,680
We acknowledged the child

539
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,710
just a few days ago,

540
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,910
but something like this
happened yesterday.

541
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,280
Is heaven

542
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:28,080
trying to disgrace our family?

543
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,600
Don't worry, Father.

544
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,870
I've taken care of it.

545
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,310
What happened yesterday

546
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,430
won't leak out.

547
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,120
But someone

548
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,560
must be behind this.

549
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,720
I can prove it.

550
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,870
Yanyan is definitely my child.

551
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,000
But that woman already gave evidence

552
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,120
in the hall,

553
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,790
and we found a spirit tablet
in Rain Chamber.

554
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:49,750
Perhaps...

555
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,270
Forget it.

556
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,590
I've sent people to Pei Village

557
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,630
to gather information.

558
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,600
We'll know tomorrow.

559
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,710
Sometimes,

560
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,080
what we see

561
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,320
isn't the truth.

562
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,710
I hope this is just a scheme

563
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,040
so our family's name stays clean

564
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,760
and our bloodline remains pure.

565
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,960
My Lord,

566
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,430
there was something odd about yesterday.

567
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,390
I might have a way

568
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,040
to test it.

569
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,040
Mother!

570
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,760
Mother!

571
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,430
Mother!

572
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,320
Mother!

573
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,960
Mother!

574
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,150
Xuan.

575
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,230
Mother!

576
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,200
- Xuan.
- Mother.

577
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,640
Xuan.

578
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,920
Xuan, don't be afraid.

579
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,230
Everything's fine, Xuan.

580
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,550
I'm here.

581
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,800
How could she prove it any more clearly?

582
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,910
If Yanyan weren't her son,

583
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,230
how could she risk her life
to protect him?

584
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,070
Yanyan...

585
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,640
Is Yanyan

586
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,870
really not our grandson after all?

587
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,150
The people I sent
to Pei Village yesterday

588
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,150
came back today.

589
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,840
Everything they found

590
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,600
matches Qingniang's story.

591
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,760
Jingming.

592
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,680
With all the evidence in front of us,

593
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,630
how am I supposed to believe you?

594
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,070
Father,

595
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,520
if Jiangli

596
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,470
had taken that test,

597
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,320
I'm sure she would've done the same.

598
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,800
She came back despite the danger

599
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,920
just to get the Lei Pill

600
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,910
and save Yanyan's life.

601
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,040
Back then,

602
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,150
you and Jiangli came to me
for the Lei Pill.

603
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,520
Was it to save Yanyan?

604
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,120
Yes.

605
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,430
She went through so much.

606
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,910
I was with her

607
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,390
every step of the way.

608
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,640
Father,

609
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,030
please give me more time.

610
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,150
I'll uncover the truth

611
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,520
down to the last detail.

612
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,880
Fine.

613
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,390
You have three more days.

614
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,880
Yes.

615
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,920
How frustrating.

616
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,550
Yanyan looks just like Jingming

617
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,520
when he was a child.

618
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,000
How could he not be our grandson?

619
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,230
I also hope Yanyan

620
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,280
is our grandson.

621
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,160
Oh, my.

622
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,280
This work never ends.

623
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,990
Excuse me, you two.

624
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,040
May I ask something?

625
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,630
Is there someone named Qingniang here?

626
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,150
- Yes.
- That's right.

627
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,230
What do you need from her?

628
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,200
I heard

629
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,080
she had a daughter, right?

630
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,150
A daughter?

631
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,230
I remember she had a son.

632
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,560
They say he's got a round face
and big eyes.

633
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,680
Qingniang treasures

634
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,150
her son dearly.

635
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,470
Then may I ask

636
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,520
if you know where he is now?

637
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,840
I heard her son was taken.

638
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,390
She's been searching for him.

639
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,960
What do you need from her?

640
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,880
Who's asking for her?

641
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
No, nothing.

642
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,520
She definitely has a son, right?

643
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,160
- Yes.
- That's right.

644
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,000
Sorry to bother you.

645
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,280
- What are they up to?
- I remember it's a son.

646
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,190
Give me back my Xuan!

647
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,470
Xuan!

648
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,520
My Xuan...

649
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,600
Xuan...

650
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,150
Give back my Xuan!

651
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,950
My Xuan!

652
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,310
Sir,

653
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,620
is this woman from your village?

654
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,640
Yes.

655
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:51,710
She's Qingniang from our village.

656
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,950
Do you know if she has a child?

657
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,470
Yes.

658
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,600
She has a four-year-old son.

659
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,430
She talks about him all the time.

660
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,770
- Thanks, sir.
- Thanks, sir.

661
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,030
Miss,

662
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,640
is this woman from your village?

663
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,950
Yes. I remember her.

664
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,840
She often comes
to buy children's clothes.

665
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,800
Do you know what her child looks like?

666
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,830
About this tall,

667
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,190
with a round face and big eyes.

668
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,910
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

669
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,360
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

670
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,160
Who is it?

671
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,600
Master Jingming,
please don't make it hard for me.

672
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,000
I won't trouble you.

673
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,950
I'll just stand here

674
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,560
to talk to her.

675
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,840
Yes.

676
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,920
Jiangli,

677
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,600
it's me.

678
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,230
Is Yanyan alright?

679
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,360
He just wants to see you.

680
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,120
Everything else is fine.

681
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,150
Qingniang is very certain.

682
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,360
Have you ever doubted me?

683
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,360
Never.

684
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,630
I promised to protect you and Yanyan.

685
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:26,230
Five years ago,
I trusted others too easily,

686
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,430
which led to you and Yanyan

687
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,230
suffering outside for so long.

688
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:35,600
So this time,

689
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,910
no matter what happens,

690
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,320
I'll stand by your side.

691
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,520
Please believe me.

692
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:51,790
♪The night fades away;
I put away my longing♪

693
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:57,260

- Young Master.
- Young Master.

700
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,310
We went to Pei Village

701
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,600
and interviewed the villagers.

702
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,750
They confirmed Qingniang
indeed had a son,

703
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,320
but he disappeared six months ago.

704
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,880
Based on their descriptions,

705
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,840
he looks very much

706
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,420
like Young Master Yanyan.

707
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,870
It's such a coincidence

708
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,800
as if it was all planned.

709
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,000
This is indeed suspicious.

710
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:47,760
Take a team with you

711
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,940
and keep investigating in Pei Village.

712
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,710
Talk to more of the older villagers.

713
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,320
I'll go see Mr. Chu.

714
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,400
There must be

715
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,560
something I missed.

716
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,030
- Yes.
- Yes.

717
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,030
Mr. Chu.

718
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,760
Master Jingming, what's wrong?

719
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,840
Why visit me so late?

720
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,430
I'll speak plainly.

721
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,760
Recently,

722
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,910
a woman has come here,

723
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,440
and she insists

724
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,600
that Yanyan is her son.

725
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,470
The details she provided

726
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,000
match Yanyan perfectly.

727
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,670
I sent people to investigate

728
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,000
but found no flaws.

729
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,910
This is your family matter,

730
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,430
so I couldn't interfere.

731
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,950
I remember you once said

732
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,670
that five years ago

733
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,430
when Jiangli was pregnant,

734
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,310
it was you who brought her
to Wind Pavilion

735
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,350
and ensured

736
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:47,040
her and Yanyan's safety.

737
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,040
So now,

738
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,040
only you and Wind Pavilion

739
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,870
can prove their innocence.

740
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,520
You know there's no peace
in the Prefect's Mansion.

741
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,590
Everyone

742
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,120
has their agenda.

743
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,360
I'm afraid that in Dongzhou,

744
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,360
only you and I

745
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,080
want to ensure their safety.

746
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:08,840
So,

747
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,600
you believe her?

748
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,400
Five years ago,

749
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,280
because I didn't trust her,

750
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,080
she suffered at the ancestral tomb.

751
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,670
But today,

752
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,120
no matter what others say

753
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,950
or present as evidence,

754
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,430
I only believe Shen Jiangli.

755
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,680
You're no longer the same

756
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,600
as five years ago.

757
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,040
It seems Jiangli made the right choice

758
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,960
by staying.

759
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,200
Let's go.

760
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,360
I'll go with you.

761
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,680
Please.

762
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:55,500
(Prefect's Mansion)

763
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,670
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

764
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,520
This is Mr. Chu.

765
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,000
We are investigating it
by the Prefect's orders.

766
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,520
- Yes.
- Yes.

767
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,080
Stay away.

768
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,190
Give me back my child!

769
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:13,920
Stay away!

770
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,030
Don't be afraid.

771
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,020
We're here to help you find your child.

772
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,030
Xuan...

773
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:23,990
Qingniang,

774
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,230
this isn't a bad man.

775
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,560
This is Mr. Chu.

776
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,440
Please tell him again

777
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,880
when and where

778
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,040
your Xuan

779
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,150
went missing.

780
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,630
Six months ago,

781
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,710
I brought Xuan to Dongzhou for fun.

782
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:41,630
He said he wanted to row a boat,

783
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,600
so we came to Ping Lake.

784
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,190
I told him to wait at the pavilion,

785
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,040
while I went to find the boatman.

786
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,310
But when I came back,

787
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,960
my Xuan

788
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,480
was gone.

789
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,480
My Xuan is gone...

790
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,960
My Xuan is gone...

791
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,830
Give me back my Xuan!

792
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:04,230
Give me back my child!

793
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,750
My Xuan!

794
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,840
My Lord,

795
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,190
Qingniang has been crying
every day in the mansion.

796
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,000
If word of this gets out,

797
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,560
it'll damage our family's reputation.

798
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:15,960
My Lord,

799
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,630
you need to make a decision quickly.

800
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,440
Father,

801
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,440
I've investigated the truth behind this.

802
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,040
What exactly happened?

803
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,510
Are you trying to create false evidence

804
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:32,000
to exonerate your wife?

805
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,030
Father,

806
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,230
please bring everyone involved

807
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,480
to the hall,

808
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,550
and I will

809
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,600
reveal the truth.

810
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,760
Okay.

811
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,720
You have my permission.

812
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,720
Don't be afraid.

813
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,400
Where's Yanyan?

814
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,110
There's too much going on today.

815
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,880
I've arranged for Yanyan
to stay at home.

816
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,360
Jingming,

817
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,670
what's really going on?

818
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,790
Tell us then.

819
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,520
Xuan, Xuan.

820
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,280
Xuan...

821
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,150
What's going on here?

822
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,750
She didn't recognize
any other child that day.

823
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,320
Because Qingniang

824
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,400
didn't recognize a person

825
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,840
but attire.

826
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,800
That day,

827
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,750
Yanyan's uniform

828
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,230
was different from usual.

829
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,830
The cloud-patterned belt
around his waist

830
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,590
was of a style and color

831
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,410
that didn't match
our family's usual attire.

832
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:50,960
- Don't be afraid.
- Someone must've

833
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,920
tampered with it.

834
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,150
What?

835
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,120
- I'm here.
- Mr. Song.

836
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,760
Yes.

837
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,110
Xuan.

838
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,270
Don't be afraid. Let me see.

839
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,720
My Lord,

840
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,920
this belt

841
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,880
is indeed different from the one

842
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,270
I had someone send

843
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,400
to the mansion.

844
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,000
How bold

845
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,750
to tamper under my nose!

846
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,550
Bring him here.

847
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,920
Mr. Song, please save me.

848
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,710
It was a momentary lapse.

849
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,630
You scoundrel!

850
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,480
You've disgraced me completely!

851
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,630
Tell the Prefect everything

852
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,600
you did now!

853
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,400
