from now on,

all family affairs, big or small,

26
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,700
shall be managed by her.

27
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,780
Understood.

28
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:52,730
Yunjiu,

29
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,140
bring the family ledger

30
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,810
for your lady to review.

31
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,300
Yes, I'm on it.

32
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,940
I'm going out for a while.

33
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,300
I've already fulfilled my promise to you.

34
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,370
When will you

35
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,050
honor yours?

36
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,540
Don't worry.

37
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,300
I won't go back on my word.

38
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:13,490
Good.

39
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,650
My Lady, here is the family ledger.

40
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,490
Please review it.

41
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,420
First, let me introduce everyone.

42
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,610
This is

43
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,140
my personal guard, Yulan.

44
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,490
I hope you'll treat her with sincerity.

45
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,570
Yes, My Lady.

46
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,100
I know Jingming

47
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,450
has always been kind to everyone here.

48
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,570
As the lady of the house,

49
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,050
I won't mistreat you either.

50
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,400
So I specially

51
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,650
asked Yulan to prepare gifts for you.

52
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,540
Mother,

53
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,100
the water for your tea

54
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,700
was the glacial snow collected
by Jingxiu's order.

55
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,770
And I made
the morning tea pastries in person.

56
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,700
It's been days since I saw Jingxiu.

57
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,140
How's he doing?

58
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,210
He's busy with managing the Golden Guards.

59
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,490
A few days ago,

60
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,330
Father summoned him and Jingming

61
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,170
to choose one of them

62
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,860
as the commander of the Qilin Guards.

63
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,190
As you know,

64
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,100
Jingxiu already leads the Golden Guards.

65
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,730
If he also secures the Qilin Guards,

66
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,210
it'd almost guarantee him
the heir's position.

67
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,320
I heard that evil woman
hasn't left yet.

68
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,890
Shouldn't Jingming
be swamped with troubles?

69
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,820
How does he have a mind
to covet the Qilin Guards?

70
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,980
Not only has she returned,

71
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,100
but she's changed her ways.

72
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,890
I just heard

73
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,820
Jingming reinstated her status.

74
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,020
Now they've reconciled as a couple,

75
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,770
and she's acting arrogant.

76
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,380
Jingxiu and I

77
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,450
went to visit them,

78
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,730
but who'd have thought

79
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,580
that couple showed no respect,

80
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,170
ignored seniority and courtesy,

81
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,450
and rejected our goodwill.

82
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,820
They even humiliated

83
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,890
Jingxiu and me.

84
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,330
How could this happen?

85
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,650
Jingming has Father's favor.

86
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,610
Even Consort Jiangli

87
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,610
became someone not to be trifled with.

88
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,410
I'm just worried

89
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,180
life will become even harder

90
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,140
for Jingxiu from now on.

91
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,180
I'm the legitimate wife of the Prefect,

92
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,210
yet I have to endure their disdain.

93
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,620
What does My Lady mean?

94
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,740
Why is this gift taking so long to prepare?

95
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,580
Nanny Dong,

96
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,650
you've been serving My Lady for long.

97
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,970
What do you think she's up to?

98
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,780
(Dong, the nanny of the family)
Don't talk to me.

99
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,290
I don't want any trouble.

100
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,890
You, come here.

101
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,460
What... what...

102
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,410
do you need from me, My Lady?

103
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:04,690
Nanny Dong.

104
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,650
Long time no see.

105
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:10,730
My...

106
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,610
My Lady.

107
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,620
Do you... still remember me?

108
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,650
How could I forget?

109
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,430
When I was confined in the ancestral tomb,

110
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,090
you showed me "kindness" with that meal.

111
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,450
Should I make you
piece together chicken bones,

112
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,530
or let you taste

113
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:39,820
what those bones felt like?

114
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,890
No, no, please don't!

115
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,040
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

116
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,620
I shouldn't have replaced

117
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,140
your vegetarian meals with chicken bones,

118
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,260
making you

119
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,330
eat them

120
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,210
and reassemble them...

121
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:55,700
I was foolish.

122
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,850
I'm sorry.

123
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,090
I'm really sorry.

124
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,570
- She
- My Lady, please spare me.

125
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,590
- is so cruel.
- Sorry.

126
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,580
My Lady will surely punish her harshly.

127
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,740
Her days here won't be easy.

128
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,820
I was wrong.

129
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,450
My Lady, please forgive me.

130
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,290
This is for you from My Lady.

131
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,620
What's past is past.

132
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,090
I won't dwell on it.

133
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,890
And I have no interest

134
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:29,890
in these dirty games.

135
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,940
So I hope you'll do your duties properly.

136
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,850
Take this back.

137
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:37,790
Consider it your dinner.

138
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,450
Thank you, My Lady!

139
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,700
Thank you!

140
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,210
My Lady repays evil with kindness.

141
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,620
Such a noble heart!

142
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,020
Then let's serve her well from now on.

143
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,260
I've returned to take over family affairs,

144
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,060
not to deal with these trivial matters.

145
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,060
I have no interest in them.

146
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,650
As long as

147
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,060
you do your duties properly,

148
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,620
I won't treat you unfairly.

149
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,120
- Got it.
- Got it.

150
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,340
One more thing.

151
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,410
Without my permission,

152
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,940
no one is allowed

153
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,860
to enter or leave Rain Chamber freely.

154
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:12,740
- Understood.
- Understood.

155
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:15,930
Yulan.

156
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,460
Reward them.

157
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,430
(I've regained control of the house.)

158
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,600
(Now I can bring Yanyan here.)

159
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,090
I understand your concerns, Mother.

160
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,620
But please don't worry.

161
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:38,700
Jingxiu and I

162
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:40,970
already have a plan.

163
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,700
And thank you, Mother,
for not telling Father

164
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,820
about the fertility rituals.

165
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,510
It wasn't just for your sake.

166
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,260
The physician said

167
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,850
the Prefect can't handle any shocks.

168
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,650
And let me say this,

169
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,450
from now on,

170
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,580
you must weigh your actions carefully.

171
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:02,610
Understood.

172
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,330
I've relied on your protection, Mother.

173
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,700
I'll trouble you to pull the strings

174
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,970
and speak well of

175
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,590
Jingxiu and me in the future.

176
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:17,850
Don't worry.

177
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,060
I'll shield you.

178
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:21,850
Now, get up.

179
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:22,970
Thank you, Mother.

180
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,460
Sir.

181
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,460
Sir.

182
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,410
Can you help me?

183
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,380
Where did this child come from?

184
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,140
Why is he at the Rain Chamber?

185
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,260
(Shen Yanyan, Shen Jiangli's son)
Sir,

186
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,110
can you help me,
a poor, adorable little boy

187
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,740
who is stuck in a dog hole?

188
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,740
How did you even get stuck?

189
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,170
It's a long story.

190
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,410
Can you pull me out first?

191
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:06,610
Thank you!

192
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,260
You're such a good person!

193
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,460
Who are you?

194
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,100
Why are you here?

195
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,130
- I'm...
- Yanyan!

196
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,500
Come back right now!

197
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:15,770
Yanyan!

198
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,020
Get back here now!

199
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,860
Oh no, sir.

200
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,690
My mother's looking for me.

201
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,410
I have to go.

202
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,220
Thank you.

203
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,260
Mother, you're back.

204
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,140
Didn't I tell you
not to run around here?

205
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,770
You little rascal.

206
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,570
Mother.

207
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,730
Stop pulling my ear.

208
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,980
I was wrong.

209
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,340
Look at the mess you've made!

210
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,460
"Mother"?

211
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,410
You never listen!

212
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,690
Why does his face look so familiar?

213
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,970
(Rain Chamber)
Anyone would think I gave birth

214
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:50,840
to a hole-digging rat.

215
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,260
Didn't you promise me

216
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,570
you'd stay inside?

217
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,410
Whose child is this?

218
00:09:58,690 --> 00:09:59,570
None of your concerns.

219
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,570
I'm Mother's precious little darling.

220
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,890
Don't bully my mother.

221
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,220
Or even if you helped me just now,

222
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,500
I'll still set rats on you!

223
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,530
It's okay, Yanyan.

224
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:12,690
Mother's fine.

225
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,740
Wait for me inside.

226
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,450
- Go now.
- Mother…

227
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,410
No more running off

228
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,380
without my permission.

229
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:18,890
And listen,

230
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,020
I'll deal with you later

231
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,100
for sneaking out.

232
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,100
Go.

233
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,890
Jingming,

234
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,940
what brings you here?

235
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,340
That child called you "Mother."

236
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:33,890
My child

237
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,290
naturally calls me Mother.

238
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,810
Or should he call you Mother instead?

239
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,340
Is he your child?

240
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,500
It has nothing to do with you.

241
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,690
Jingming, let's be clear.

242
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,460
We can discuss business,

243
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,060
but nothing else.

244
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,100
I won't see you out.

245
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,140
(When did she have this child?)

246
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,770
(What exactly happened
these past five years?)

247
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,570
Qinian,

248
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,410
(Lu Qinian, Lord of Dongzhou)
I prepared medicinal dishes and pastries

249
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,980
and brought them for you to taste.

250
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,380
Why this sudden interest, honey?

251
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,720
When did you take up herbal diets?

252
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,860
I don't recall you doing this before.

253
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,920
It's just... a few days ago, Danling...

254
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,930
What happened to her?

255
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,140
Siblings quarrel all the time.

256
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,260
The headache again?

257
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:29,890
Have some tea.

258
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:31,490
Go on.

259
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,570
Well, someone intruded on

260
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,650
Jingming's mansion.

261
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,620
Jingxiu and Danling went to visit,

262
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,450
but Jingming...

263
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,480
he made things quite awkward

264
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,890
for them both.

265
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,620
Danling is such a gentle soul.

266
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,810
She bottled up her distress

267
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,860
and fell ill from anger afterward.

268
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,380
How could this be?

269
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,890
Jingming has no sense of propriety.

270
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:56,570
Actually...

271
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:57,810
if we're being fair,

272
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,410
the fault lies with Jingxiu.

273
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,140
Lately,

274
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,890
Jingxiu has been working day and night

275
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,460
with craftsmen to solve

276
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,220
the Golden Guards' weapon shortage.

277
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:08,740
Stressed and impatient,

278
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,050
his words were likely too harsh.

279
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,620
Now you're blaming Jingxiu?

280
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,890
His efforts for the Golden Guards

281
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,220
are meant to ease my burdens.

282
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,100
That Jingming, really...

283
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,340
What about Jingming?

284
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:28,860
Lady Shu, you're here.

285
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,380
Xiulan, why weren't we announced?

286
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,100
Do I need permission to enter?

287
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,020
Oh, Jinyi, you're here.

288
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,620
Shall I go back and have the servants

289
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,460
announce you properly first,

290
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,890
then return to pay respects to Qinian?

291
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,690
Enough of that.

292
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,060
Take a seat.

293
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,140
Sit, please.

294
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,100
I was just chatting with Jinyi.

295
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,650
- Here.
- Pour tea for Lady Shu.

296
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,500
(Master Jingming's Mansion)

297
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,410
Young Master,

298
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,530
we've received word.

299
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,770
Lady Wang has told the Prefect on you.

300
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,570
This is too much!

301
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,380
Master Jingming causing trouble is one thing,

302
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,080
but now Lady Wang is playing the victim.

303
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,050
Do they really think us

304
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,040
is so easy to bully?

305
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,760
Why are you hitting me?

306
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,930
Well, it's true!

307
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:24,650
Young Master,

308
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,330
Yunjiu isn't entirely wrong.

309
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,100
Master Jingming is aggressive.

310
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,690
We're too passive right now.

311
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,340
And I heard he's developing new weapons.

312
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,410
If he succeeds, the Qilin Guards...

313
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,980
Young Master, we must be prepared.

314
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,690
We've endured for the bigger picture,

315
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,170
but crafting weapons isn't easy.

316
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,170
Jingxiu has prepared for so long.

317
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,100
If we want to compete,

318
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,740
unexpected tactics are a must.

319
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:55,890
By the way,

320
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,020
that descendant of Zhuge
I sent you to visit...

321
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,290
He's in West City's Mao Village,

322
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,050
but the old man is…

323
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,570
eccentric.

324
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,050
I've gone six times,

325
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,080
and each time he just waves me away.

326
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:10,380
He even said that even if you went,

327
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,460
he wouldn't meet you.

328
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,740
If we could obtain the design

329
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,020
for the Zhuge Crossbow,

330
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,410
the Qilin Guards would have
the strongest weapon.

331
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:20,960
Find skilled craftsmen

332
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:22,570
and bring them to me.

333
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:23,650
Understood.

334
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,160
I heard

335
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,100
Wang Danling collapsed in anger
after returning.

336
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,410
Honestly,

337
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,570
she's probably acting for your father's sake.

338
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,650
She came looking for a fight.

339
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,340
How is this my fault?

340
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,340
This was likely a trap

341
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,930
to provoke you

342
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,340
into recklessness.

343
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,220
I don't have your patience for schemes.

344
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,570
If they attack,

345
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,500
I defend.

346
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,140
Why should I fear them?

347
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,620
No trespassing,

348
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,570
no trouble.

349
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,340
Today is the final treatment.

350
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,140
I'll only target three acupoints today.

351
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,930
Fengchi, Dazhui, and Hegu.

352
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,810
I'll warn you upfront.

353
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,860
It might hurt a bit.

354
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,080
Just proceed with the needles.

355
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,570
Give me your hand.

356
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,770
Like I said,

357
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,290
this one may sting.

358
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,250
It's fine.

359
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,170
From now on, be careful.

360
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,100
Avoid cold exposure.

361
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,380
Take the medicine I prescribed,

362
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,980
and you'll recover soon.

363
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:04,730
Alright.

364
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,220
Young Master,

365
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,410
the craftsmen have arrived.

366
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,580
Got it.

367
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,570
Then I'll take my leave.

368
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:26,650
Senior Jiangli.

369
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,570
The parasite attacks last for hours.

370
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,650
Poor Yanyan, he's too young

371
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,570
to endure such pain.

372
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,500
I must obtain Lei Pill quickly.

373
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,650
What's your next move, Senior Jiangli?

374
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,740
We can't just sit by.

375
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,530
I'll send a letter,

376
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,020
ask Senior Brother

377
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,170
to locate Mr. Zhuge's residence.

378
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,810
Bring Wind Pavilion's visiting card tomorrow.

379
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,600
I'll take you to archery practice.

380
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,860
Archery?

381
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,770
To be precise,

382
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,930
a Zhuge Crossbow.

383
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,020
Senior Jiangli,

384
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,260
Mr. Zhuge won't even see Master Jingming.

385
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,330
Will he really help us?

386
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,740
I heard he has a chronic illness.

387
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,940
I've found a treatment.

388
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,780
It shouldn't be hard.

389
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,330
Look.

390
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:25,290
Is that the place?

391
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,420
Let's go check.

392
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,260
Okay.

393
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,220
Excuse me, is this Mr. Zhuge's home?

394
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,050
Are you Mr. Zhuge?

395
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,810
Greetings, Mr. Zhuge.

396
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:09,740
I'm Shen Jiangli,

397
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:10,980
paying my respects.

398
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,530
I didn't mean it.

399
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,700
You forced me to speak.

400
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,220
Mr. Zhuge,

401
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,330
recently, have your teeth

402
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,500
oozed purple-tinged blood?

403
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,020
The roots rot,

404
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,260
yet without pain or itch.

405
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,430
Your tongue coating is yellow and thick,

406
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,420
your nose bridge sunken,

407
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,050
with chills, fever,

408
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,090
loss of appetite,

409
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,630
diarrhea, labored breathing,

410
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,850
even delirium at times.

411
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,530
How… how do you know?

412
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,180
Not a single detail is wrong.

413
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,020
You suffer from Noma,

414
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,290
a disease mostly seen in children,

415
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,700
but adults can contract it too.

416
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,570
But once one is infected,

417
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,130
treatment must begin immediately.

418
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,900
To hide illness from the physician

419
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,740
is to invite rotting cheeks and lips.

420
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:53,400
Honestly, I...

421
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,810
I… I thought it was just mouth ulcers.

422
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,180
I've delayed until now…

423
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,650
Don't worry.

424
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,020
I can

425
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:02,500
cure this illness.

426
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:05,850
Did you really think

427
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,420
I wouldn't know your swindler's tricks?

428
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,240
First, you spout exaggerated claims

429
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,110
to shock people into confusion.

430
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,900
Then you declare you can cure them.

431
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,300
How many

432
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,980
have been cheated of their wealth

433
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,330
and left to die in despair?

434
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,290
Mr. Zhuge,

435
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,110
leave now,

436
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,700
or my crossbow won't show mercy.

437
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:28,980
Mr. Zhuge,

438
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,260
if you doubt us,

439
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,620
see for yourself

440
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,700
if this Wind Pavilion's visiting card
is real.

441
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,260
(Visiting Card)
Mr. Zhuge,

442
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,700
I studied under Wind Pavilion

443
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,530
and specialize in rare, complex illnesses.

444
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:46,650
Miss,

445
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,090
why didn't you show this sooner?

446
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,870
Then I'll entrust my treatment

447
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,330
to your care.

448
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,850
But I have one condition,

449
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,660
even during treatment,

450
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,500
you must not ask

451
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,980
what medicine I'm using.

452
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:00,460
Why is that?

453
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,570
Once you've recovered,

454
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,710
I will explain everything.

455
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:13,700
Young Master,

456
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,570
My Lady has gone out.

457
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,010
That maid Yulan is sharp.

458
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,530
I lost track of them... again.

459
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,900
It's not your fault.

460
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,530
They didn't want to be followed.

461
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:26,450
Enough.

462
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,130
The point wasn't to spy on her.

463
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,570
But after that assassination attempt,

464
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,370
it's just prudent

465
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,790
to have guards nearby.

466
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,810
Young Master, I've never seen you

467
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,220
care for someone like this.

468
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,700
No wonder they say,

469
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,290
"Absence makes the heart grow fonder."

470
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:43,870
What?

471
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,370
Don't you have anything to do?

472
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:46,940
Yunyi,

473
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,060
take a break.

474
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,410
Understood.

475
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,180
Finish all these

476
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,420
by today.

477
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,090
Your pulse is steady now.

478
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,660
You're fully recovered.

479
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,700
It's really gone.

480
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,540
No more rot.

481
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,420
Young lady,

482
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,740
won't you tell me

483
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,220
what medicine you used?

484
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,020
I used arsenic.

485
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,500
What?

486
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,260
You dared use lethal poison?

487
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,180
That's precisely why

488
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,660
I didn't disclose the prescription earlier.

489
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,900
When I first examined you,

490
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,380
the disease had festered deeply.

491
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,820
Ordinary remedies were useless.

492
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,180
I feared the truth

493
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,820
would distress you,

494
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,020
hindering recovery.

495
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,180
So I beg your forgiveness.

496
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,680
You don't owe me that.

497
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,900
I owe you instead.

498
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,660
Now,

499
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,820
you're my lifesaver.

500
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,260
"All medicine carries toxicity."

501
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,460
Even poison, rightly used, can heal.

502
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,740
Arsenic

503
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,260
erodes sores and rotted flesh.

504
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,260
In controlled doses,

505
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,700
it saves lives.

506
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,500
Truly, a disciple of Wind Pavilion.

507
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,100
Bold yet meticulous.

508
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,340
I'm impressed.

509
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,780
You've saved my life,

510
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,220
but I've lived as a recluse

511
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,020
with little wealth to offer.

512
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,020
The mission of Wind Pavilion

513
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,140
is to heal the world.

514
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,140
I treated you,

515
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,980
seeking no reward.

516
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,170
However…

517
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,780
I want to ask for one thing.

518
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,500
You've been so focused.

519
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,230
Your tea has gone cold.

520
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,340
What brings you here?

521
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,300
Do you burn bridges after crossing them?

522
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,180
I'm no longer needed, huh?

523
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:51,380
When you sought me for treatment,

524
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,460
your attitude differed.

525
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,780
Speak your purpose plainly.

526
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,940
(Zhuge Crossbow)
Once this kind of crossbow

527
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,100
is built,

528
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,260
it can fire up to twelve arrows in a row.

529
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,860
Even a child could operate it.

530
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,260
If we wait for you

531
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,830
to figure it out on your own,

532
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,140
by the time it's finished,

533
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,860
Jingxiu will already be the Prefect.

534
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,780
Did Mr. Zhuge give this to you?

535
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,260
That's none of your concern.

536
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,140
The blueprint

537
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,380
is now in our hands.

538
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,340
The Qilin Guards are a hot potato,

539
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,340
lacking combat strength,

540
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,300
limited in equipment.

541
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,380
If you can solve this thorny issue,

542
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,980
it'd be a masterstroke.

543
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,620
First,

544
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,220
you'd earn the Prefect's favor,

545
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,620
solidifying your position

546
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,420
against Jingxiu.

547
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,060
Second, you'd win soldiers' hearts by merit,

548
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,170
securing loyalty.

549
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,100
That's why you sought out

550
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,970
skilled craftsmen for the crossbow.

551
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:46,660
Jiangli, you're speaking so confidently.

552
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,500
Seems you've done your research.

553
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:49,570
Of course.

554
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,140
For the Lei Pill,

555
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,460
I'd spare no effort.

556
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,540
"A craftsman must first

557
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,100
sharpen his tools."

558
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,420
The Qilin Guards' problem is twofold,

559
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,160
no weapons,

560
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:03,530
and no funds.

561
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,700
Why am I even telling you this?

562
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,100
Jingming,

563
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,260
brooding here

564
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,500
won't make money.

565
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,140
Why not take a stroll

566
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,980
with me in the garden?

567
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,100
Come on.

568
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,420
Stop overthinking for now.

569
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,100
Let's go.

570
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,620
Jingming.

571
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,820
What's this?

572
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,220
Jingming,

573
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,020
sometimes a walk outside

574
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,100
brings unexpected fortune.

575
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,340
So...

576
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,700
you'd already guessed.

577
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,500
Of course.

578
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,980
Nine out of ten difficulties

579
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,500
boil down to money.

580
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,260
But in such a short time,

581
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,420
where did you raise this much?

582
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:05,980
Jingming,

583
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,780
my earnings
from years of practicing medicine

584
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,220
lent to you for now.

585
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,660
Repay me promptly.

586
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:15,780
Keep it safe.

587
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,820
Understood.

588
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,420
Someone.

589
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,940
I'll repay you.

590
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,420
As for the Lei Pill,

591
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,900
I need the right moment to ask Father.

592
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,020
I believe

593
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,340
you won't make me wait too long.

594
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,220
Young Master.

595
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,540
Th-this... this much silver... This...

596
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,980
"This" what?

597
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,940
Stop gawking like a country bumpkin.

598
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,860
Young Master,

599
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,140
how did My Lady

600
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,460
acquire so much wealth?

601
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:55,860
Young Master.

602
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,060
She's been at the ancestral tomb.

603
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,340
Where'd the money come from?

604
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,700
Yunyi.

605
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,740
I've already sent men to investigate.

606
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,940
My Lady likely left there long ago.

607
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,380
But her whereabouts after leaving...

608
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,700
I need more time.

609
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,180
Given her current state,

610
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,860
she must have visited

611
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,380
somewhere extraordinary.

612
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,020
Keep digging.

613
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,460
Understood.

614
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,020
Qinian,

615
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,780
I came to inform you

616
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,180
Qingqing should return tomorrow.

617
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,260
Is Qingqing coming back?

618
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,100
Wonderful.

619
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,330
This is all your fault!

620
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,220
Forcing our daughter to "go out to train".

621
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,010
Who knows what hardships she's endured.

622
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,990
Letting her gain experience
was for the best.

623
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,300
Speaking of Qingqing...

624
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,360
Jiangli caused the scar on Qingqing's face...

625
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,580
Ah, never mind.

626
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,980
Even you've forgiven it.

627
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,580
You released Jiangli, after all.

628
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:54,220
Jiangli?

629
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,940
Wasn't she confined to the ancestral tomb?

630
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,900
Why is she back?

631
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,860
Xiulan pitied her daughter-in-law.

632
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,580
Couldn't bear Jiangli withering away alone.

633
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,700
Xiulan.

634
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,620
You have Bodhisattva compassion.

635
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,740
You flatter me.

636
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,780
My daughter-in-law may lack

637
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,220
Danling's charm,

638
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:18,180
but at least she and Jingming are close.

639
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,580
I'll have a grandson

640
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,980
sooner or later.

641
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,740
Unlike Danling, so desperate for a child...

642
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,980
She even resorted to unseemly methods.

643
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,820
What happened?

644
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,860
You didn't know?

645
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,980
Danling exploited prayers for your health

646
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,060
to conduct secret fertility rituals.

647
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,060
Really?

648
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,580
This is beyond reckless.

649
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,780
Xiulan, mind your tongue.

650
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,300
Those were servants acting alone.

651
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,500
The culprits...

652
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,140
took their own lives in remorse.

653
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,660
Danling knew nothing.

654
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,150
Besides,

655
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:03,260
Danling is a nobleman's legitimate daughter.

656
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:06,420
She'd never act so shamelessly.

657
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,500
Speaking of Qingqing,

658
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:13,340
it's her age to be married.

659
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,980
Should we...

660
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,780
consider potential matches?

661
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:20,260
My daughter is your concern.

662
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,260
Xiulan,

663
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,680
I meant no offense.

664
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,780
You misunderstand.

665
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,500
It's just my distant nephew,

666
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,340
Su Rui'an,

667
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,500
visited me recently.

668
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,780
He's around Qingqing's age,

669
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,940
so the thought occurred to me.

670
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,860
Su Rui'an, the intellectual elite?

671
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,940
I've heard of

672
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,380
Su Rui'an.

673
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,380
Why not let them meet?

674
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,260
If Qingqing favors him,

675
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,740
my Qingqing's status,

676
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,020
talents, and virtue

677
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,100
outshine any candidate.

678
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,260
True.

679
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,740
Since he's cultured

680
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,220
and your relative...

681
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,060
Well...

682
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,180
let him try.

683
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,740
Good.

684
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,580
Since Qinian and you agree,

685
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,340
I'll tell that young man

686
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,820
to arrange a meeting with Qingqing.

687
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,580
Good.

688
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,980
- Qinian.
- Qinian.

689
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,340
This...

690
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,100
Actually, I want some soup.

691
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,580
I'll have some soup.

692
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,530
(Su Rui'an)
I'm Su Rui'an. Greetings, Your Grace.

693
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,530
(Lu Qingqing, the princess of Dongzhou)
Greetings.

694
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,540
After you.

695
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:48,460
(Qinxin Pavilion)

696
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,700
Liuyan,

697
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,420
take Nanny Dai

698
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,620
to the rear courtyard for tea.

699
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,900
How do you know my maid's name?

700
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,700
Where there's a will,

701
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,340
nothing is difficult.

702
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,740
Your Grace, try this tea.

703
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,710
Snow Bud.

704
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,180
I heard you adore Snow Bud tea.

705
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,540
I traveled to Shuzhong two years ago,

706
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,500
and the tea left me enchanted.

707
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,540
But it's hard to preserve.

708
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,100
Since leaving Shuzhong,

709
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,860
I've rarely had it again.

710
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,460
How did you acquire it?

711
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,100
As I said,

712
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:44,790
where there's will.

713
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,220
Your makeup fascinates me.

714
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,420
Most ladies adorn their brows

715
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,820
with forehead decals.

716
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,380
But using fresh blossoms?

717
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,850
Exquisitely rare.

718
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,900
You know women's cosmetics well.

719
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,820
Do you...

720
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,580
judge by appearances?

721
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:15,020
All men cherish beauty.
It's human nature.

722
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,580
(Prefect's Mansion)

723
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,500
Qingqing.

724
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,020
Qingqing.

725
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,820
Danling, you're here!

726
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:28,180
You used to call me "Sister Ling".

727
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,300
Father scolds me for lacking manners.

728
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,580
Never mind. I'm the one at fault.

729
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,140
You've been back for days,

730
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,420
and I'm only visiting now.

731
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,820
I know you've been busy.

732
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,100
Nanny, prepare some tea and pastries.

733
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,220
Yes.

734
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,540
I'm on it.

735
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,300
Your face glows like peach blossoms.

736
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,620
You're in a good mood.

737
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,700
Sister Ling, must you tease me?

738
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,500
Then...

739
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,020
let me divine.

740
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,140
Qingqing,

741
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,620
your stars align for romance.

742
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,380
Sister Ling, you...

743
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,060
I'm angry now.

744
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,060
Alright, my mistake.

745
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,180
Don't be cross with me.

746
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,100
In fact,

747
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,060
I heard Lady Wang

748
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,170
intends to match you with that Su Rui'an.

749
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,420
Seems you two

750
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,780
get along well.

751
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,050
He's...

752
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,790
not bad.

753
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,100
But...

754
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,150
Are you worried

755
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,260
he might mind it?

756
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,300
It's all Shen Jiangli's fault.

757
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,140
Oh,

758
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,220
has someone told you yet?

759
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,220
Sister Ling,

760
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,300
speak freely.

761
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,900
Shen Jiangli has returned

762
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,740
from the ancestral tomb.

763
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,460
How could she leave?

764
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,620
She's not the same as before.

765
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,180
Who knows what bewitching arts she used

766
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,700
to make Jingming dote on her?

767
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,470
Not only was her confinement lifted,

768
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,300
but she regained her status

769
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,400
and now manages the family.

770
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,060
Has my brother lost his mind to lust?

771
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,100
Has he forgotten

772
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,580
what that woman did to me?

773
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,340
This time, Shen Jiangli seemed

774
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,420
beyond recognition,

775
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,060
radiant and assured.

776
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,780
No wonder Jingming is smitten.

777
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,340
How strange indeed.

778
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,940
She used to be so timid,

779
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,260
like a dull block of wood.

780
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,860
Now she's mastered medicine

781
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,220
and bewitched Jingming.

782
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,420
Has some foul thing possessed her?

783
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,340
I'll see for myself

784
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,660
what kind of monster
this Shen Jiangli really is!

785
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,540
Qingqing!

786
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,580
Qingqing, calm down.

787
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,280
Please, calm down.

788
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,420
Shen Jiangli... let's see.

789
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,420
Will Lu Jingming choose you

790
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,620
