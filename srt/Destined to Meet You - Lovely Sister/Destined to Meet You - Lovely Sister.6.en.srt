00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,679
Bei, are you still at home?

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,959
Yes, what's wrong?

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,220
Help me check if my wedding ring is on the table.

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,899
- It's in the bedroom.
- That's great. I'm coming back to get it.

6
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:25,999
- Wait for me.
- Okay.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,580
Come back then.

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,820
Did you follow me here to sneak photos of me?

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,180
This is what you wanted to treat me to?

10

[I'll pay you back for the ice cream]
This is my handwriting.

11
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,620
How is this...

12
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,060
Bei!

13
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,520
Bei?

14
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,080
What's wrong?

15
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,440
Nothing, here's your ring.

16
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,719
This ring is a little big.

17
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,779
I was afraid it would fall off when I was showering, so I took it off.

18
00:01:21,779 --> 00:01:23,800
You're not angry, right?

19
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,040
Not at all.

20
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,240
Rongrong, do you remember who took this photo for you?

21
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,039
A little boy from many years ago.

22
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,179
He sent the photo to the company and I saw it wasn't bad, so I kept it there.

23
00:01:37,179 --> 00:01:38,840
What is it?

24
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,320
Do you remember what he looked like, or what his name is?

25
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,800
I think...

26
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,580
he looked similar to you...

27
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,920
I'm teasing you.

28
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,479
He was a high school student, I think.

29
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,560
So many years have passed, I can't remember.

30
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,499
Do you like the photo? You can have it.

31
00:02:07,499 --> 00:02:09,480
I'll go to the office now.

32
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,780
Be careful.

33
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,080

What do I do about my case?

37
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,140
Liang Jingjing.

38
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,620
Mr. Jin?

39
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,119
What are you doing here?

40
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,660
I was looking for a quiet place to eat.

41
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,340
May I sit here?

42
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,020
Yes.

43
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,200
You sit here, and I'll find somewhere else.

44
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,040
You... dislike me?

45
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,159
No, no.

46
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,220
How is that possible?

47
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,280
There's no way that I dislike you.

48
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,719
Actually, it's because Ms. Jin married my cousin

49
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,559
and you and her are siblings,

50
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,000
so we're sort of related now. Right?

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,159
I'm afraid...

52

Afraid of what?

53
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,519
I'm afraid I won't be recognized for my capability.

54
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,939
If everyone finds out about our relationship, they'll avoid me even more.

55

Why are you laughing? I'm serious.

56

Please eat.

57
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,160
Actually, Ms. Jin and I...

58
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,740
are not real siblings.

59
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,760
Not real siblings?

60
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,239
But your family name is Jin as well.

61
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,780
Yes, I have the same family name as hers.

62
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,479
We went to the same university.

63
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,560
Five years ago, on 30th November, I received a call.

64

Mom, you know I like Rongrong.

65
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,599
Why are you marrying her father?!

66
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,039
Xichen, you know Rongrong rejected you.

67
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,519
You always say you just need one opportunity.

68
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,079
I'm thinking about your future right now.

69
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,879
What would Rongrong think of me now?

70
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,319
She will never accept me entering the Jin family in this way!

71
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,360
You can't marry him!

72
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,020
Actually, it wasn't just an opportunity that I was missing.

73
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,100
It was my whole life.

74
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,640
I got to know such a huge piece of news again.

75
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,140
Then are you... still in love with Ms. Jin?

76
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,920
What a relief.

77
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,319
That's good.

78
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,260
Otherwise, it'll be too dramatic.

79
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,519
But you have to see each other in the same company every day.

80
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,740
It must be exhausting.

81
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,840
Actually, when I first started here, it was indeed exhausting.

82
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,560
Not about how I should face Ms. Jin.

83
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:45,040
I worried every day about how everyone would see me

84
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,120
if they knew I'm Mr. Jin's stepson.

85
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,839
Initially, I planned to show my capabilities when I started,

86
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,800
but in the end, it felt like my hands and legs were tied.

87
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,420
Whatever I did, I felt awkward.

88
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,279
Mr. Jin, stop worrying about what other people think of you.

89
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,820
I think you're very outstanding.

90
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,860
Yes.

91
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,040
Don't worry about what others think.

92
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,500
You're very outstanding, too.

93

Me?

94
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,140
Maybe someone who knows about your real situation still envies you.

95
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,420
After all, some think that a privileged birth is also a form of capability.

96
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,440
I got it.

97

I still think...

99
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,660
not taking any shortcuts and depending on your own efforts is a good thing.

100

Mr. Jin...

101

I still have some urgent work to do.

102

If this photo wasn't taken by me,

110
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,160
why would my handwriting be on the back?

111
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,360
But why can't I remember when I took this photo?

112
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,180
Could it be that we already met five years ago?

113
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,079
- Ms. Liang, you're here.
- Don't call me that.

114

why are you looking for me so urgently?

116

Do you remember what happened when I left the Gu family five years ago?

Five years ago?

118
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,839
The Gu family's business was sold that day.

119

You had a big fight with your two brothers and then you left.

120

After that, you made a trip to school.

- I went to school?
- Yeah.

Are you okay?

138
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,279
Five years ago, you were only a high school student.

How would you take a photo of her?

I only remember that five years ago,

I woke up in the hospital and Auntie brought me back to your place,

but I don't remember what happened after I left the Gu family.

what date it was when I left the Gu family and went to school?

145
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,559
So... you brought me all the way here just for this?

146
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,759
You could have asked me this over the phone.

You... You're so sure?

152
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,480
Of course.

153
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,819
It was the day I finally got the courage to tell the Class Rep about my feelings after one year.

154
00:10:25,819 --> 00:10:29,659
But not only did he reject me, but he also did this with four cruel reasons!

155

Look at the date. 30th November.

160
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:46,239
It's the day I left the Gu family.

161

Yeah.

00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,020
Is Rongrong at the office?

167
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,520
Yes.

168
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,300
Thank you!

169
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,020
Thank you!

170
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:20,579
♫ How wonderful the smile from your lip corners is ♫

171
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:24,619
♫ I don't need to think because my heart is racing ♫

172
00:11:24,619 --> 00:11:29,819
♫ The love between us is obvious to everyone ♫

173
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:32,619
♫ The exclusive love that you gave me ♫

174
00:11:32,619 --> 00:11:36,639
♫ You are cute like a kitten ♫

175
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:38,559
♫ Making me agree with you unconditionally ♫

176
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,119
Make an appointment with Old Jin.

177
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,719
- I'll go back with Bei in the next few days.
- Okay, understood.

178
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,079
But there's something else I need to tell you.

179
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,239
Gu went to see me a few days ago and asked me about what happened to you five years ago.

180
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,840
Why is he still...

181
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,239
Rongrong!

182
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,220
Why are you suddenly...

183
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,379
♫ You like your every single second with me ♫

184
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:14,060
♫ Afraid that I won't hug you anymore ♫

185
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:17,919
♫ But you never know ♫

186
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:24,820
♫ That I want to be by your side forever ♫

187
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,619
♫ How wonderful the smile from your lip corners is ♫

188
00:12:28,619 --> 00:12:32,660
♫ I don't need to think because my heart is racing ♫

189
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:36,599
♫ The love between us is obvious to everyone ♫

190
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,839
What's with you?

191
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,639
I wanted to tell you immediately.

192
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,759
We met five years ago.

193
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,920
At that time, I had already fallen in love with you at first sight.

194
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,120
Ms. Jin,

195
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,700
the project requirement meeting is about to start.

196
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,860
Give me ten minutes, please?

197
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,700
- Five minutes is fine too.
- Ms. Jin.

198
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,640
The whole business department is waiting for you.

199
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,639
Bei, this meeting is really important.

200
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,580
Wait for me, okay?

201
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,940
I'll wait for you at Jingjing's cafe then.

202
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,700
I'll be there soon.

203
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,620
Let's go.

204
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,240
Isn't there a meeting?

205
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,880
Sorry.

206
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,300
I delayed the meeting by half an hour.

207
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,220
I have something more important to show you.

208
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,860
I can't tell you the source of these photos,

209
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:04,140
but what I'm sure of is that Gu Congbei approached you on purpose.

210
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,700
He found out that you would be there

211
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,499
and stayed there under the pretense of singing to try to get close to you.

212
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,039
I know better than you how I met Gu Congbei.

213
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,600
He has already told me what you're telling me right now.

214
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,340
No matter what, these photos were taken pretty well.

215
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,719
I can keep them.

216
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,000
I knew you wouldn't believe me just with this,

217
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,080
but has it ever occurred to you that if Gu Congbei started to plan ways of getting close to you from five years ago...

218
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,840
Jin Xichen.

219
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,920
Enough is enough.

220
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,239
Five years ago, he was a high school student.

221
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,479
How would he get close to me?

222
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,040
Do you remember...

223
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,600
the day you came to school to see me and saw me arguing with a student?

224
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,160
That student was Gu Congbei.

225
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,339
Since you were born, you're already more privileged than others.

226
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,599
Why do you need special treatment for this as well?

227
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,039
Mr. Jin, I have never asked anyone for a favor or pulled strings.

228
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:05,139
Neither have I ever gotten any special treatment because of my family.

229
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:07,480
Please do not be biased against me.

230
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,240
Sorry.

231
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,840
It's fine.

232
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,320
Jin Xichen.

233
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,400
Rongrong.

234
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,959
Why are you here?

235
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,679
You promised me that you'd stop your mother from marrying into my family,

236
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,599
and now even the date is set.

237
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,859
What? You want to be siblings with me?

238
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,540
If there is any possibility of you accepting me,

239
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,199
I would have the courage to stop this from happening.

240
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,599
Jin Xichen.

241
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,919
Why should I choose between being your sister or dating you?

242
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,059
I'm telling you this again very clearly that we are just classmates.

243
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,100
Yes.

244
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,260
We're just classmates.

245
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:07,600
You're the precious daughter of a company's owner and the vice president of the company.

246
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,800
I'm just a trainee teacher.

247
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:15,160
No matter what our relationship is, you'll look down on me all the same.

248
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,260
Then just give me a reason to respect you.

249
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,839
Stop pretending.

250
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,400
You understand yourself better than I do.

251
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,740
That year, you just entered the company.

252
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:34,200
If my memory serves me right, your first project was to buy the Gu family's business.

253
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,419
It was on that day that Gu Congbei came back to school and met you when you came to see me.

254
00:16:38,419 --> 00:16:41,980
After knowing your identity, he followed you out of the school.

255
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,940
Thinking about it now, whether it was five years ago or now,

256
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,919
he's capable of getting close to you to protect his mother's business.

257
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:52,519
Ji Xichen.

258
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,580
Are you done?

259
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:03,220
If you are willing to check, everything I said can be proven.

260
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,660
Why isn't she here yet?

261
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,300
Rongrong.

262
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,199
You finally finished work.

263
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,840
Come and sit.

264
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,860
Sit.

265
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,599
Look at this photo.

266
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,919
This is a photo from five years ago.

267
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,119
Bei.

268
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,300
I took this photo for you.

269
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,599
Look at this handwriting.

270
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,720
This is my handwriting.

271
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,300
Bei, I'm a little hungry.

272
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,039
Let's go and have dinner somewhere else. Okay?

273
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,060
Let me finish.

274
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,919
This character here.

275
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,759
[I'll pay you back for the ice cream]
This is a writing habit I've had since I was a kid.

276
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:15,579
Although I don't know what kind of fate led me to take this photo for you,

277
00:18:15,579 --> 00:18:18,020
but I've checked with Jingjing.

278
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:22,760
That day was the date on this photo, 30th November.

279
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,519
So that boy was really him that day.

280
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,959
Did you buy me an ice cream that day?

281
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,460
That's why I wrote this down for you.

282
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,360
I think so.

283
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,760
Then, do you remember how we met that day?

284
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,639
Why did you buy ice cream for me?

285
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,060
And after that?

286
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:46,020
Why can't I remember that?

287
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,079
It's been five years.

288
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,599
I don't remember either.

289
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,360
It was just a day that happened by chance.

290
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,579
Think about it again. That day was really special.

291
00:18:56,579 --> 00:18:59,119
To me, that was a very normal day.

292
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,679
There's nothing to think about.

293
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:06,379
- Rongrong, that day was really important to me.
- Bei, can we not talk about that day anymore?

294
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,300
Bei,

295
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,920
can we not talk about that day anymore?

296
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,460
I thought you would be as happy as me when you heard this.

297
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,700
Sorry.

298
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,220
I had a whole day of meetings, and I'm a little tired.

299
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,000
I still have some work to do.

300
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,880
Go home first.

301
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,680
Since you took...

302
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,380
this photo for me,

303
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,540
you should give it back to me.

304
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,839
Why is it you?

305
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,719
This is what you wanted to treat me to?

306
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,019
Yes. Ice cream. It's very nice.

307
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:54,180
What flavor do you want? I'll buy it for you.

308
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,079
Forget it. You're still a student.

309
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,480
I'm an adult. I'll buy it for you.

310
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,650
- Two, please.
- That won't do.

311
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,999
I said I would treat you, so I have to.

312
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,040
Besides, how can I let a girl pay?

313
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,239
Madam, how much is it?

314
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,540
16 yuan.

315
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,940
Hold on.

316
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,780
So kids shouldn't compete with adults over the bill.

317
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,639
Kids?

318
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,000
I'll be an adult next year.

319
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,259
How about this? Take it that I borrowed the money from you.

320
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:29,580
- I'll definitely pay you back.
- Whatever.

321
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,580
Here.

322
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,260
I mean it.

323
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,759
When I said I'd pay you back, I'll definitely keep my word.

324
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,359
I'm a man. A man always keeps his word.

325
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,939
All right, a man and a high school student who's having ice cream.

326
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,240
Should I look into what happened that day?

00:36:01,479 --> 00:36:03,959
♫ Please don't rain ♫

489
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,119
♫ I can't make it to the shelter ♫

490
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:10,800
I can't prove anything. I can't prove anything.

491
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,040
♫ Still no reply to the message, and I can't miss anything ♫

492
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,140
Look at me.

493
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,280
Gu Congbei, look at me!

494
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,460
You must not listen to what anyone says to you,

495
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:31,500
and you must not doubt yourself anymore.

496
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,359
Come home with me.

497
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:37,479
I know better than anyone what really happened that day!

498
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,659
♫ Curling up on the sofa, staring at the phone ♫

499
00:36:39,659 --> 00:36:43,839
♫ Still no reply to the message, and I can't miss anything ♫

500
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:47,099
♫ If this isn't love ♫

501
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:51,819
♫ Why are there traces of it pacing up and down in my heart ♫

502
00:36:51,819 --> 00:36:58,880
♫ The cruelty with a little pain is piling up in the corner ♫

503
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,540
[Don't leave, there's an Easter egg!]

504
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,720
Class Rep, I like you!

505
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,160
I don't like you.

506
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,559
I don't like you for three reasons.

507
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:28,959
Firstly, your birthday is in June while mine is in September.

508
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:30,559
I don't like girls older than me.

509
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,399
Secondly, you're very tall.

510
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,959
I don't like girls taller than me.

511
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,620
Thirdly, I will never have puppy love.

512
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,879
Fourthly...

513
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,519
There's a fourth reason?

514
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,199
I just thought of it. Your family is very rich.

515
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:44,140
I don't like being gossiped about.

516
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,560
And my family isn't that rich.

517
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,280
Student.

518
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:18,399
[Stay tuned for the next episode]

519
00:38:18,399 --> 00:38:20,660
[It's said that everyone will only fall in love once.]

520
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:24,060
[Every romance after that is simply us seeking his or her shadow.]

521
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:18,120
[Maybe once is enough]
