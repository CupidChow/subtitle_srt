Proposing to you.

28
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,719
Miss Jin, cut it out.

29
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,060
Hurry and leave, I'm begging you.

30
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,559
Student Gu, I haven't finished.

31
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:37,219
Student Gu! Ring! Ring!

32
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,679
What are you doing dressing like this?

33
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,519
Look how old you are. You're not from our uni.

34
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:46,700
That's rude.

35
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,840
What are you doing here?

36
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,500
I'm here to for Student Gu over there. To propose.

37
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,440
Propose?

38
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,060
Understood.

39
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,279
There's an unknown outsider over here at Area C who says she's here to propose.

40
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:02,599
Unknown identity?

41
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,199
Bring her to the security office now.

42

Let's go to the security office. Come on.

Once I finish my proposal, I'll go to you.

If I wait for you to finish it, I won't have a job anymore. Let's go!

My flowers! Don't pull me!

46
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,079

47
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,040
- What?
- Sir, sir!

48
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,559
I'm sorry. We're rehearsing for a play.

49
00:02:19,559 --> 00:02:21,379
She's the external help that I invited.

50
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:23,020
Play?

51
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,619
- Live-action play.
- Live-action play?

52
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,479
Sir, we are indeed rehearsing for a play.

53
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,820
"The President and Her Little Husband."

54
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,920
I'll take her away now.

55
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,560
Sorry.

- Thank you.

You'll find a boyfriend if you don't have one.

- Thank you.

00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,599
Thank you for joining today.

61
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,140
Wish you pass every exam.

62
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,319
Stop!

63
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,800
- Stop there!
- Let me through!

64
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,859
Wish you pass every exam! Wish you pass every exam!

65
00:03:08,859 --> 00:03:10,439
Stop right there! Don't run!

66
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,860
Student Gu.

67
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,359
Slow down, Student Gu.

68
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,379
Slow down! My... My leg hurts.

69
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,559
Miss Jin, I made it very clear to you. I have no reason to marry you.

70
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,639
If this is to complete the plans for your family, stop here.

71
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,540
I can't help you.

72
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:35,139
If you think those three reasons are not convincing enough, we can think of something else.

73
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:37,080
Unreasonable.

74
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,879
I'll help you over there to rest.

75
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,640
I can't walk anymore. It really hurts.

76
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,639
All right, give me your foot.

77
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,760
The floor is too cold.

78
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,060
What do you want, then?

79
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,840
Please.

80
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,020
Your heart's beating very fast.

81
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,480
It's not.

82
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,960
Really.

83
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,799
Thump, thump.

84
00:04:55,799 --> 00:04:57,600
My heart isn't there.

85
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,640
Rest here first and ask Qiu Bi to pick you up.

86
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,439
I still have classes to attend, so I'll go now.

87
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,060
Stop doing things to hurt yourself.

88
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,660
Wait.

89
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:21,060
Other than those three reasons, I have another reason why I have to marry you.

90
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,360
I need to get married now,

91
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,660
and I hope that person is you.

92
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,560
Tell me honestly.

93
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,860
Why does that person have to be me?

94
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:47,020
If I tell you that I fell for you at first sight at the bar,

95
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,420
would you believe me?

96
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,420
No one believes in love at first sight now.

97
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,040
If I were Student Gu, I wouldn't either.

98
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,080
All right, don't wander off and wait for me here.

99
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,500
I'll go get the car.

100
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,040
We'll go home.

that we had been in love with each other and living together.

167
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,239
That's not what I meant.

168
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,799
Is it because you have not graduated?

169
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,679
If I am not wrong, a student can get married even if they haven't graduated yet.

170
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:41,320
Stop worrying.

171
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,040
I...

172
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,860
I am not old enough to get married.

173
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,799
Before you become an adult...

174
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,419
I mean... You shall stay in this room before you are old enough to get married.

175
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:00,799
Don't you dare to step into my room!

176
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,740
Actually, I'll be old enough in a week.

177
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,999
That's not the problem now, Gu!

178
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,919
I've been an adult for almost ten years.

179
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,599
But I have been keeping myself busy for a kid like you,

180
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,399
who isn't even old enough to get married. I...

181
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,879
I am only five years younger than you.

182
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,279
That is not the problem.

183
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,639
Five years ago, I had already graduated and secured a job.

184
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,199
But you were not even an adult.

185
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,159
You hadn't even completed your college entrance exam.

186
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,999
No way! This is too scary.

187
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,780
Unbelievable!

188
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,300
Miss Jin!

189
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,400
I am not a minor.

190
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,920
Rongrong's husband-to-be is still a student?

191
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,079
Not only that.

192
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,440
He's an undergraduate who hasn't even graduated from the university.

193
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,300
I think... there must be more to it.

194
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,060
Don't be suspicious.

195
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,919
Considering her personality, this must be a lie she told to deal with Mr. Jin.

196
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:08,540
Jin Rongrong's getting married... Could it be an arranged marriage?

197
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,720
This concerns your status in the Jin family.

198
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,119
Wu Youyong, you stole my idea and made me take the blame for you.

199
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:19,800
Don't let me see you again!

200
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,000
Liang Jingjing, you...

201
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,600
I am sorry! I am sorry!

202
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,360
Stop there!

203
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,039
- Who is she?
- I'm doomed!

204
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,359
An intern of our company.

205
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,120
Liang Jingjing! Why are you here?

206
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,920
I am talking to you!

207
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,100
Mr. Jin and Mr. Wu, you got the wrong person.

208
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,340
You...

209
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,140
When did she come in?

210
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,480
Since when did she eavesdrop on our conversation?

211
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,400
Shall we make her...?

212
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,920
Did we say anything just now?

213
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,660
I... I think we said... What did we say?

214
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:10,520
Qiu Bi, you should know what to say when Old Jin asks you. Right?

215
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,979
I know. I shall never let Mr. Jin know that Student Gu has not turned 22 years old

216
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,479
and that he is ineligible to get married.

217
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,060
I shall tell Mr. Jin that you

218
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,710
and him are quite intimate

219
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,639
and are spending a good time together. Right?

220
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,220
That's right!

221
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,760
Don't move!

222
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,340
She...

223
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,799
What did she want you to tell me?

224
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,739
Ms. Jin is worried that you might send her for another blind date,

225
00:14:40,739 --> 00:14:42,560
so she asked me to let you know

226
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,120
that she and Student Gu are spending a good time together.

227
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,619
As a boy, you should protect yourself when you stay at someone else's place.

228
00:14:55,619 --> 00:14:59,479
Ms. Jin's first love doesn't seem to be normal.

229
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,200
It's more like one-sided love.

230
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,760
Let go!

231
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,999
One-sided love? I don't think so.

232
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,440
Let me show you this.

233
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,519
Mr. Jin, did you capture this?

234
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,559
How is it? They look sweet together. Right?

235
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,080
Yes!

236
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,100
Sweet?

237
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,919
I have liked Gu since he was young.

238
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,199
In the past, I always felt awkward.

239
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,980
After all, Rongrong is five years older than him.

240
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,039
But look at them now.

241
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,959
They look good together.

242
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,640
Mr. Jin,

243
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,680
If I tell you a secret about Ms. Jin and Student Gu,

244
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,200
will you give me a pay rise?

245
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,020
20%.

246
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,359
Ms. Jin and Student Gu met each other before the blind date.

247
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,240
They went home and...

248
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,420
Qiu Bi, do you want more year-end bonuses?

He should be old enough to get married. Right?

253
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:32,400
Is he lying to me because he regrets it now?

254
00:17:13,879 --> 00:17:16,420
He's even a straight-A student.

255
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,740
He's handsome and his handwriting is pretty good, too.

Just this?

257

♫ And the trace of our love ♫

327
00:23:02,899 --> 00:23:06,260
♫ Everything is just right ♫

328
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,079
Okay! This is good!

329
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,940
Closer.

330
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,660
Qiu Bi.

331
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,959
Seriously?

332
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,199
Give me 40 minutes.

333
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,799
I am only out for half an hour. Why can't you solve it yourselves?

334
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,960
Wait for me!

335
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,700
I am sorry. I need to go back to the office for an urgent matter.

336
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,559
- Shall I send you to the university first?
- It's fine. Go ahead.

337
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,560
Are you sure?

338
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,159
I'm not a primary school student.

339
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,240
All right. University student, I'm leaving.

340
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,940
- Do you think... it is better to keep our marriage a secret at this stage?
- Miss Jin.

341
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,500
After all, you are still a student.

342
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,080
Up to you.

343
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,800
Okay, I shall return to my office then.

344
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,159
Submit your proposal to me by next week, then.

345
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,720
- Let's call it a day.
- Okay.

346
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,220
How's your marriage?

347
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,579
Student Gu is so calm and quiet. I got the right guy.

348
00:24:54,579 --> 00:24:56,520
Great choice!

349
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,279
Oh, right! Mr. Jin is waiting for you in your office.

350
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,159
He wants to talk to you about the development plan.

351
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,239
Just keep him waiting. I need to buy something first.

352
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,439
What are you buying? Trust it with me.

353
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,119
- Why do you have to do it personally?
- I need to choose it personally.

354
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,020
I got it!

355
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,820
This is strange.

356
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,380
Why doesn't she have a fridge in her house?

357
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,960
Let's have dinner together at home after I get off work.

358
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,200
Okay! I'll wait for you.

359
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,639
Mr. Jin, you have waited for me for a day?

360
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,200
Rongrong,

361
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,599
I heard that you sprained your ankle.

362
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,119
I brought you some ointments so that you can keep them in your office.

363
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,640
You heard about it?

364
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,279
I sprained my ankle a week ago. You even know that?

365
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:23,359
Right...

366
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,719
Before your mother married into the Jin family,

367
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,879
she would always visit us even when Old Jin only had a slight cough.

368
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,519
Rongrong, I don't mean anything else.

369
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:36,739
I have something to add regarding the New City Area Development Plan.

370
00:26:36,739 --> 00:26:38,159
Mr. Jin,

371
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,379
we don't need to discuss business outside of working hours. Right?

372
00:26:41,379 --> 00:26:43,799
I just want to do my best in this matter with you.

373
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,719
I know Old Jin's plan very well.

374
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,239
He's just trying to give me some pressure.

375
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,279
I understand.

376
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,039
Considering how stingy I am,

377
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:56,579
I'm not willing to share my family's money with my ex-classmate. That's sure.

378
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,380
Qiu Bi, let's have a meeting five minutes from now.

379
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,300
I just want to do my best in this plan with you.

380
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,879
I've always been professional at work.

381
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,499
Since Old Jin has given you this opportunity, let's see who has the last laugh.

382
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,440
I am still working. Let's talk later.

383
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,440
When will you...?

384
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,720
Are you awake?

385
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,239
You're back.

386
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,359
I'm sorry. Something came up at the last minute.

387
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,000
Were you waiting for me?

388
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,039
No.

389
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,800
I was doing my homework.

390
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,700
Did you cook all these?

391
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,999
I don't even have a kitchen at home, but you managed to cook all these.

392
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,279
Heat them up if you are hungry.

393
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,920
I'm going back to my room.

394
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,399
Wait a minute.

395
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,280
I have something to show you.

396
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,400
Come on.

397
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,999
I am used to living alone.

398
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,019
I don't know what to prepare if two people are to live together,

399
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:25,299
so let's first change our toothbrushes, cups, and toothpaste into matching pairs.

400
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:27,000
I spent a long time choosing them.

401
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,520
Also...

402
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,880
I bought matching towels too.

403
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,599
This color is for me.

404
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,780
The blue one is for you.

405
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:44,160
If you like this color, you can take it too.

406
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,720
Did you...

407
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,559
- choose all of them personally?
- Yes.

408
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:52,020
Of course, I have to choose our things personally.

409
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,740
Do you like them?

410
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,120
There are more.

411
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,620
You bought me this mug last time.

412
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,280
I bought you another one, too.

413
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,020
They are a pair.

414
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,559
Today is an important day.

415
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,820
I want to do one more thing.

416
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,440
Come here.

417
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,200
Sit here.

418
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,680
Wait for me.

419
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,540
Today is not only the day of us getting married.

420
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,560
It is also your birthday.

421
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:02,840
I hope that you can stay happy every day after getting married.
