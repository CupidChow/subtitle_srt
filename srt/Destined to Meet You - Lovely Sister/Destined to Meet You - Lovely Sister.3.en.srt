[Episode 3]

2
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,160
I am sorry.

3
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,400
- Just now, I...
- It's fine.

4
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,039
You're still young.

5
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,900
Understandably, you can't hold yourself back.

6
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,240
- I did that because...
- Wait a minute.

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,120
Let me prepare myself.

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,979
Oh my god! Did I blush?

9
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:53,520
What a kid! He just kissed me.

10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,140
Is my makeup still on? He didn't notice, right?

11
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,719
I did that because...

12
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,079
I'm ready.

13
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,240
Let us discuss our marriage.

14
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,539
You promised to marry me because I asked you to,

15
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:33,679
so in order to protect your legitimate rights in our marriage,

16
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:35,559
I drafted this agreement.

17
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,079
Let's go through the terms one by one.

18
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,519
If everything is okay, I will send it to my legal team tomorrow.

19
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:42,380
Go through them one by one?

20
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,119
First... the first term.

21
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,959
Party A, Jin Rongrong, and party B, Gu Congbei, marry each other

22
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:52,380
and sign this agreement voluntarily.

23
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,500
This should be fine, right?

24
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,180
Then, the second one.

25
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:06,039
The second term is drafted regarding the situation that just occurred.

26
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:11,399
Since we are a legal couple, intimate actions

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,039
like holding hands, hugging, and kissing are unavoidable.

28
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,199
As long as you don't mind, I'm fine with them too.

29
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,420
As for the next stage when we get even more intimate,

30
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,799
we can set a frequency for that.

31
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,720
Set a frequency?

32
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,660
Then, maybe once a week for now.

33
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,020
Or three times?

34
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,439
Still not enough?

35
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,200
What about five times a week then?

36
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,559
- Miss Jin, this is not what I meant.
- What do you mean?

37
00:02:49,559 --> 00:02:51,840
This is the maximum.

38
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,579
Indeed, young men are different.

39
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:55,400
[7 times in a week]

40
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,479
Let's move on to the next term.

41
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,119
It is regarding our matrimonial property.

42
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,679
If party A and B divorce,

43
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,899
party A agrees to compensate party B with 50 million yuan unconditionally.

44
00:03:12,899 --> 00:03:14,540
Stop it.

45
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,660
Do you really want to sign this agreement?

46
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,170
Yeah.

47
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,160
Up to you.

48
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,320
[Gu Congbei]

49
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,860
Thank you for the birthday cake.

50
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,100
Thank you for celebrating my birthday.

51
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,140
What's wrong with the agreement?

52
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,980
We can negotiate the compensation!

53
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,900
We can discuss the frequency as well!

54
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,160
[Destined to Meet You]

55
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,359
Look how Mr. Jin has treated you.

56
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,620
You'll whither sooner or later.

57
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,980
Little bamboos like you should stay under the sun longer and drink more water.

58
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:29,159
I accidentally and slightly knocked on your master's head.

59
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,600
I shall redeem myself by saving you.

60
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,800
Xichen.

61
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,580
I have something to tell you.

62
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,420
- Mr. Jin.
- Hi.

63
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,440
Oh, no!

64
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,520
What should I do?

65
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,799
Xichen, please bring me back to the office.

66
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,060
It is so tiring at the construction site.

67
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,079
It is so windy and sandy at the construction site.

68
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,799
Youyong, yow many times have I told you?

69
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,959
I won't challenge any of Rongrong's decisions.

70
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,480
Stop coming to me for this matter.

71
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,219
Xichen, you are being too careful.

72
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:12,940
You saved her five years ago.

73
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,919
Did someone come into my office?

74
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,180
I...

75
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,380
I don't... I don't know.

76
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,920
You...

77
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,279
She's the one! The one who knocked you.

78
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,959
- She's even hiding in your office now.
- I'm doomed. I'm doomed.

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,960
Will you believe me if I say that I am here to save the little bamboos?

80
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,559
I asked you to look for something that young men are recently into.

81
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:09,079
What are all these?

82
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,559
Look how old I am.

83
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,160
I don't know what young boys like now.

84
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,120
Oh right!

85
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,379
I saved some photos on my phone. Have a look at them.

86
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,679
- Give it to me!
- I'm afraid this may not be a good idea.

87
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,319
- One month.
- What do you mean?

88
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,139
- Two months.
- Are you reducing my salary?

89
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:27,999
- Three months.
- Men have privacy, too.

90
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,519
- Four months.
- It might affect your relationship... with your father if you see it.

91
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,820
Five months!

92
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:40,420
Mr. Jin forced me to take some daily photos of you and Student Gu.

93
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,980
Three months.

94
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,959
Slowly.

95
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,840
Be careful. You...

96
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,660
Watch out for the staircase.

97
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,479
Old Jin,

98
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,679
why did you plant a spy by my side?

99
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,559
- Spy? I am not a...
- Shut up!

100
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,720
Come! Have a seat and play chess with me.

101
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,380
- I'm busy.
- Not you. Qiu Bi.

102
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,560
Stand up!

103
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,799
I am married.

104
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,280
It's time for you to do your part in our agreement, right?

105
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,500
No problem.

106
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,979
You should start preparing for the extension of the agreement, right?

107
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:33,920
What extension?

108
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,479
Since when did we have this?

109
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,519
The extension of the agreement.

110
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,119
Did you sign it without confirming the terms?

111
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,699
That's your fault. It is written clearly there.

112
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:56,719
Make sure you give birth to a chubby baby next year.

113
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,339
Once he completes his mission, I'll do my part and you may leave with the money.

114
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,479
Who do you think my husband is?

115
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,999
Will he do as you say?

116
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,559
Will the baby adopt your surname?

117
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,159
It doesn't matter even if the baby adopts your surname.

118
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,679
The baby will be a Jin family grandchild after all.

119
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,340
Maternal grandchild.

120
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,300
Rongrong, think carefully.

121
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:22,179
If Xichen marries after you but has a child before you, Jin's family assets will...

122
00:08:22,179 --> 00:08:23,640
Don't worry.

123
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,400
I will definitely bear a child before him.

124
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,580
Sir, we shall leave first.

125
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,879
Within the term of the agreement,

126
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,479
Party A and B shall do their best in playing their parts in their marriage,

127
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:41,699
including but not limited to living... together.
[living together]

128
00:08:41,699 --> 00:08:47,750
How good would it be if I could change "living together" to "having a child"?
[having a child]

129
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,119
He even kissed me.

130
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,200
Why didn't I carry on?

131
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,540
Why are you here?

132
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,380
Miss Jin,

133
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,580
I need to talk to you.

134
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,620
About what?

135
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,580
I hope that we can get closer.

136
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,340
How close?

137
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,360
To you,

138
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,540
am I just a kid you married?

139
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:52,239
We can start over again.

140
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,860
How slow is that?

141
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,260
Why don't we...?

142
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,920
I am really having...

143
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,760
an unnecessary desire.

[Da]

145
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,719
Gu Congbei, don't you forget your promise.

146
00:10:24,719 --> 00:10:29,200
Just get what I want ready, and you'll have yours.

147
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,080
What are you doing?

148
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,359
Sir,

149
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,699
what would happen if Ms. Jin chose the other two sons of the Gu family?

150
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:32,720
How ugly would their children be?

151
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,079
She even makes sure that the tangerine that she eats looks nice.

152
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,680
Do you think she would just marry someone?

153
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,140
This one looks all right.

154
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,580
Indeed, a father knows his daughter the best.

155
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,019
Gu Congbei, what about the tender?

156
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:27,319
Don't forget our deal.

157
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,520
Just get what I want ready, and you'll have yours.

158
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,080
What are you doing?

159
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,079

I was urged to submit my paper first thing tomorrow,

00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,119
so I'd like to borrow your laptop.

163

My husband is busy with his homework.

How are we going to have a baby, then?

166

332
00:25:30,819 --> 00:25:33,839
You're welcome to see me if you run into any problems at work.

333
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:36,779
Thank you, Ms. Jin. I will work hard!

334

I thought his cousin was my love rival.

How can we have a baby after such an embarrassing misunderstanding?

336
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,600
Let me feel out his attitude.

337
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,599
Have a seat. I'm going to buy something for you.

338

Wait here.

339
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,340
Cotton candy, try it.

340
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,579
He gave me candy all of a sudden.

341
00:26:48,579 --> 00:26:51,759
I got it. Just a man's intentions.

342

00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,540

344
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,039
There's nothing on your lips.

345
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,039
I didn't ask you to check on my lips.

346
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,480
Hurry.

347
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,159
Hurry what? Tell me.

348
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,799
My lips are sweet now.

349
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,080
You can kiss me now and we can go home to make a baby.

350

What are you saying in public?

351
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:23,399
I'm asking you to help me bear a baby.

352
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,740
No matter how talented I am, I can't do that on my own.

353
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,100
I help you?

354
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,140
So this morning, you wanted to...

355
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,759
Jin Rongrong, did you marry me just to have a baby?

356
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,279
We're already married.

357
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,679
Having a child is legal.

358
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,399
I really need you to help me with this.

359
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,700
So you don't actually need me, just my abilities.

360
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,000
Big Brother and Sister, would you like to buy some flowers?

361
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,279
No, thank you.

362
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,559
Please give us some space. We're talking about private things.

363
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:08,999
I heard it.

364
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,800
You're talking about having a baby.

365
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,499
Please buy some flowers.

366
00:28:14,499 --> 00:28:17,500
These flowers will help.

367
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,679
Okay! I'll have all your flowers.

368
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,339
Here. Let me scan your code.

369
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,320
- Go ahead.
- Thank you, Big Sister!

370
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,440
Mom, I've sold all the flowers!

371
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,799
Now, about having a baby...

372
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,880
Can you accept the flowers first?

373
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,519
Are you okay?

374
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,419
Bei? Bei?

375
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:05,039
Bei, don't scare me.

376
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,400
Bei!

377
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,599
You're telling me getting a nail in his head is a small accident?

378
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,879
There weren't any cameras in the area.

379
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,559
Our relatives all thought that Bei was being rebellious

380
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,879
and caused trouble by fighting with bullies outside of school.

381
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,979
When Bei was seventeen, lots of things happened in the Gu family.

382
00:29:24,979 --> 00:29:27,399
Both of his elder brothers came with his stepfather.

383
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,919
After that, his mother passed away

384
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,599
and his stock share from the Gu family was taken by his brothers.

385
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,060
People cared even less about who hurt him.

386
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,240
No wonder he had to sing at a bar.

387
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:50,200
Ms. Jin, did you really not ask me to work on the New City Area Development Plan

388
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,760
because I am Bei's cousin?

389
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,959
Of course not.

390
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,240
I've always been professional at work.

391

Yes, Ms. Jin.

393

- Yes!
- Oh, right.

394
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,000
Don't let Bei know that I talked to you.

395
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,959
I forced him to marry me when he had such a sad past

396
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,540
and treated him as a tool to have a baby.

397
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,700
I'm such a terrible person.

She joined the New City Area Development Plan right after officially becoming an employee.

- She joined the Development Plan?
- That's right.
