I told you to look into Liang Jingjing,

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,269
but why did you sneak photos at Rongrong's office?

4
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:14,990
Liang Jingjing can participate in the New City Area Development Plan,

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,729
so she must have some connections.

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,729
Her real information is definitely inside Ms. Jin's office.

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,030
And?

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,749
Liang Jingjing's information in Ms. Jin's office is the same as that in HR.

9
00:00:26,749 --> 00:00:29,710
So, she isn't a spy.

when I was hiding in the wardrobe,

19
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:04,320
I saw that Gu guy secretly using Ms. Jin's computer.

I was dragged in by them.

23

And then, someone let out a very smelly fart,

24
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,479
and then you came.

25
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,999
No, why did you look at me when you talked about fart?

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,800
Wu Youyong was the one who farted. Can I let out a fart that smelly?

I... I just came in to take some photos.

32
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,959
Then I entered the wardrobe and saw Wu Youyong!

33
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,660
He was also taking photos. And he farted...

34
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:47,160
- Speak. What did Old Jin ask you to do?
- Old Jin...

35
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,639
- How did you know Mr. Jin asked me to come?
- Of course!

36
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:51,860
Is he your father or mine?

37

Mr. Jin asked me to take some photos of... you and Gu's... daily office romance.

Rongrong, I want to talk to you about something.

44
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,359
Mr. Jin, you entered my office without knocking.

45
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,719
You must be in a rush.

46
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,560
How can I help?

47
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,220
Wu Youyong saw that Gu fellow using your computer in your office.

48
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,639
Every time he appears, the timing is so coincidental.

49
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,839
Aren't you the least bit suspicious?

50
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,399
Firstly, he isn't "that Gu fellow."

51
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,280
He's my husband.

52
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,759
Is there a problem with my husband using my computer in my office?

53
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:23,080
Next, why did you, Mr. Jin,ask Wu Youyong to secretly come to my office?

54
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,620
This is a misunderstanding.

I wasn't trying to pick on him.

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,180
Now you understand.

164
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,740
Giving up the bid was the best choice.

165
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,620
You're looking for me?

166
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,560
I heard it'll rain tonight.

167
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,159
I have a car even if it rains.

168
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,679
And I have an umbrella in the car.

169
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,359
Even if there isn't, Qiu Bi will deliver one to me.

170
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,160
Gu Congbei, if you're still trying to hide the truth from me,

171
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,700
please refrain from appearing before me for the time being.

172
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:26,300
♫ But I can only wait for a sunny day ♫

173
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:34,939
♫ You took away my weakness and complicated feelings ♫

174
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:41,340
♫ And I couldn't stop my heart from fluttering ♫

175
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,060
Ms. Jin, why are you still here?

176
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,739
Something urgent cropped up. I need to handle this first.

177
00:13:48,739 --> 00:13:56,000
♫ You willfully gave up everything significant ♫

178
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,559
♫ You ran away after only writing half a story
or you worried too much ♫

179
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,240
Bei is still waiting for you.

180
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,159
♫ I want to see you, hold you ♫

181
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,839
♫ I want to love you, hug you, I can't help it ♫

182
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,700
Let him wait.

183
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,420
♫ I can't make it to the shelter ♫

184
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,979
Excuse me.

185
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,199
The rain is so heavy!

186
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,399
Let's go.

187
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,720
Come.

188
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,099
♫ If this isn't love ♫

189
00:14:28,099 --> 00:14:32,639
♫ Why are there traces of it pacing up and down in my heart ♫

190
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:39,079
♫ The cruelty with a little pain is piling up in the corner ♫

191
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,659
♫ Please don't rain ♫

192
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:46,179
♫ I can't make it to the shelter ♫

193
00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:49,359
♫ Curling up on the sofa, staring at the phone ♫

194
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,620
♫ Still no reply to the message, and I can't miss anything ♫

195
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,919
♫ If this isn't love ♫

196
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:01,519
♫ Why are there traces of it pacing up and down in my heart ♫

197
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,759
♫ The cruelty with a little pain is piling up in the corner ♫

198
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,320
Miss Jin.

199
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,759
It's barely raining now.

200
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,680
No need for an umbrella.

201
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,640
It's still drizzling.

202
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,640
Let's go home first.

203
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,140
Wait.

204
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:30,840
Hear me out before you decide whether to let me go home with you.

205
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,160
Here, have some water.

206
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,280
Jingjing, do you mind getting her a warm one?

207
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,759
You've made a good observation of me.

208
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,200
You must have done your homework trying to get close to me.

209
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,959
This is one of your habits I discovered after we got married.

210
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,859
I know you're sensitive to low temperatures, hence we don't have a fridge at home.

211
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:07,380
The air-conditioner needs to be maintained at 26°C.

212
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:11,160
All your drinks must not contain ice.

213
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,780
What would happen if I didn't quit and just handed the documents over?

214
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,120
So you expected it all along. I was worried that...

215
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,079
That I'd be deceived by you?

216
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,899
Or were you worried that I wouldn't notice what was wrong with this plan?

217
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:51,079
I...

218
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,360
Ms. Jin, Bei has his reasons.

219
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,380
Explain!

220
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,359
Jingjing, you're still young and gullible.

221
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,279
Be it a man or a boy, all of them share the same problem.

222
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,160
They will never be able to treat you with honesty.

223
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,140
Before the entire thing is set in stone, I wasn't sure if you'd believe me.

224
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:21,139
However, only by making the two brothers of the Gu family completely believe the reason I got close to you,

225
00:17:21,139 --> 00:17:23,719
would they bid with everything they have.

226
00:17:23,719 --> 00:17:25,638
Now, they're debt-ridden.

227
00:17:25,639 --> 00:17:28,399
After some time, when the land begins to give them troubles,

228
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,160
they will come to me and sell their shares.

229
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,599
Then, I can recover all of my mother's assets.

230
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,999
I'll be able to protect my mother's lifetime of hard work.

231
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,600
I'm sorry for not telling you about this sooner.

232
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,719
Tell me the truth, then.

233
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,480
Since when did you plan to get close to me?

234
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,839
From the day I showed up at the Gu family's place?

235
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,400
Or that chance meeting outside the pub in the alley?

236
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,299
I've been trying to approach you since you appeared in the pub.

237
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:02,960
Gu Congbei, you sure planned for everything.

238
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,519
Do you believe in love at first sight?

239
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,399
- Even without this, I will also...
- What "love at first sight"?

240
00:18:07,399 --> 00:18:09,359
Do I look like a 17-year-old to you?

241
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,600
Why would I believe something as ridiculous as "love at first sight"?

242
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,800
Ridiculous?

243
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,819
When you asked for us to get married, you said you fell for me at first sight!

244
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,480
Don't tell me...

245
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:28,039
you simply made that up to dupe me into marrying you?

246
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,759
What do you mean by "duping you"?

247
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,599
I proposed to you fair and square!

248
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,759
You said yes yourself!

249
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,279
Since we're on the topic, didn't you lie to me as well?

250
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,319
The reason why I hid a part of the truth

251
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,499
is that I believed this entire thing would not compromise your interests in any way!

252
00:18:43,499 --> 00:18:45,760
Jingjing, come here.

253
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,599
Look at him and remember what an arrogant man looks like.

254
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,179
Also, if in the future, a man tells you anything about "love at first sight,"

255
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:55,820
you must never believe him.

256
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,879
Yes.

257
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,519
In the future, if any woman tells me about "love at first sight," I'll never fall for that again!

258
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:02,160
You're married to me!

259
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,799
Who else do you wish to hear "love at first sight" from?!

260
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,800
Wait a minute!

261
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,139
Shouldn't you guys be untangling the misunderstanding over the development plan?

262
00:19:10,139 --> 00:19:12,239
What's that got to do with "love at first sight"?

263
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,479
Is that important?

264
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,160
- It is!
- It is!

265
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,559
Ms. Jin.

266
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,980
Ms. Jin, calm down! Ms. Jin.

267
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,660
Ms. Jin, calm...

268
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,199
What's wrong with you?

269
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,399
If I were Ms. Jin, I'd be fuming mad too!

270
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,680
I didn't want to pick up a fight.

271
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,719
She's doing this for you.

272
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,879
To lure those two dummies from the Gu family into the trap, she pushed the plan forward on purpose.

273
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,360
Be more mindful!

274
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,060
[Divorce Agreement]

275
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,839
Miss Jin, I will not sign the divorce agreement.

276
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,679
I didn't get married to divorce!

277
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,159
Not for divorce, but for the assets.

278
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,119
- What kind of melodrama is this?
- Open up, Miss Jin.

279
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,819
We need to talk this over. I admit this entire thing...

280
00:20:24,819 --> 00:20:26,380
Miss Jin! Miss Jin!

281
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:29,399
Am I your roommate? Don't I have a name?

282
00:20:29,399 --> 00:20:32,599
I called you Miss Jin because you're the one who kept calling me Gu.

283
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:35,439
- As a form of respect, I could only call you "Miss Jin."
- Respect?

284
00:20:35,439 --> 00:20:38,919
If you truly respect me, why would you stay the night at my place on the first day we met?

285
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:41,919
I stayed the night because you complained it was cold.

286
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,519
You were crying and making a fuss.

287
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,159
In that situation, how could I leave you alone?

288
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,200
Did you forget how I took care of you all night?

289
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,400
Something like that happened?

290
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,719
What about before?

291
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,039
Why did you follow me home?

292
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,940
You were just horny!

293
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,359
I'm horny?

294
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,999
I'm horny?! Did you forget what you did to me?

295
00:21:24,999 --> 00:21:26,640
What did I do?

296
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,220
This!

297
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,240
Then...

298
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,480
Then...

299
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,379
♫ The setting sun dashed past the sky without a sound ♫

300
00:21:47,379 --> 00:21:51,079
♫ Like how I chased after you over endless miles ♫

301
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,719
I see it now, Gu Congbei.

302
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,119
You were the one who swapped my Long Island iced tea for alcohol.

303
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,599
- Swapped for alcohol?
- I was surprised!

304
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,659
I ordered tea. Why did it become alcohol?

305
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:08,760
I can't believe you'd stoop so low to use me!

306
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,679
While I certainly did try to get close to you,

307
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,240
Long Island iced tea isn't tea but a cocktail.

308
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,880
I don't believe you.

309
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,600
Take a look yourself, here.

310
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,599
So?

311
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,639
So it's not tea but a cocktail!

312
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,159
So you're pissing me off over a glass of Long Island iced tea?

313
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,760
I...

314
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,580
Long Island iced tea really is tea and not a cocktail!

315
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,379
Is that important?

316
00:22:45,379 --> 00:22:48,660
[It doesn't matter whether Long Island iced tea is a cocktail or not.]

317
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,740
Long Island iced tea is really a cocktail?

318
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,319
How did I not know about that?

319
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,120

Why did you suddenly lay down in my room?

If I sleep in your room, you can just go sleep in mine.

Set the AC to 26 degrees.

345
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,540

How is it? Did you fix it?

00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,699
The program's not working, it's probably broken.

This house is too cold.

358

If it's too cold, add another duvet.

359
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,919
I'm going to freeze to death.

360
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,759

Rongrong.

400
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,940
Why didn't you call me Miss Jin?

401
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,159
You don't like it when I call you Miss Jin.

402
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,360
So starting today, I'll call you Rongrong.

403
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,480
Is that okay?

404
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:39,159
That works. It's just a name.

405
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,279
Marrying you wasn't originally part of my plan.

406
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,260
I did take advantage of you.

407
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,780
I'm sorry.

408
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:55,280
But from the moment I agreed to marry you,

409
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,000
I treated this seriously.

410
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,380
Also, I said to you in the beginning

411
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,860
that once I get married, I won't get divorced.

412
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,280
Rongrong, I want to live happily with you...

You need to think about it?

417
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,820
Rongrong, stop thinking about it.

Gu Congbei plotted all this to get closer to Rongrong.

445
00:34:23,999 --> 00:34:29,020
Xichen, if you put your attention on your projects,

I trust that you will have found the problem with that land long ago.

Sir.

448
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:38,319
Bei did approach Rongrong with ulterior motives.

449
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,559
But he's never done anything to hurt the Jin family.

450
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,879
You know they are still young.

451
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:47,860
A few words and pictures don't mean anything.

452
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:52,579
Since they are already married, let them solve their problems on their own.

453
00:34:52,579 --> 00:34:57,759
You are their senior, so you should be more forgiving toward Bei.

No matter how much I care about the company,

455

Ms. Liang, you're here.

457
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,480
Didn't I say to not call me Ms. Liang?

458
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,920
Mr. Jin?

459
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:34,520
Mr. Jin, why did you drink so much?

460
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,900
Every time I see you,

461
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,220
I get very unlucky.

462
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,960
Then I'll disappear.

464
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,920
Mr. Jin?

465
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,900
Ms. Liang, are you leaving?

466
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,720
I told you not to call me Ms. Liang!

467
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,599
You mean Rongrong was locked up in a reefer truck five years ago?

468
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,079
One that transported ice cream, actually.

469
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,800
That's why she's so sensitive to the temperature.

470
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:39,160
Did someone plan the incident?

471
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,679
Ms. Jin doesn't like talking about this.

472
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:49,060
Student Gu, you need to first promise me that you won't tell her I told you this.

473
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:52,039
Ms. Jin said that it was a pure accident.

474
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:56,999
She was trying to save a cat so she went into the reefer truck and unexpectedly got locked in.

475
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,759
The truck's freezing system was suddenly turned on.

476
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,299
If Mr. Jin didn't find her in time, the result might have been horrible.

477
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,939
Ms. Jin doesn't want to remember this incident, so she just let it pass.

482
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:41,539
♫ Like how I chased after you over endless miles ♫

483
00:37:41,539 --> 00:37:44,699
♫ Could it be the secret of the galaxy ♫

484
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:48,820
♫ Leaving no trace even as they chase after the starry sky ♫

485
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:52,959
♫ Imagining the distance between us,
I can't stop thinking about you ♫

486
00:37:52,959 --> 00:37:56,719
♫ Like there is now something more between us ♫

487
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:00,500
♫ I'll take you to the Milky Way,
becoming smitten by your gentle look ♫

488
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:04,359
♫ A journey to the stars, no matter how far ♫

489
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:07,439
♫ The clouds stole a sip of the wine I hid on the rooftop ♫

490
00:38:07,439 --> 00:38:10,679
♫ Led away by the night wind while slightly tipsy ♫

491
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:14,919
♫ Accidentally bumping into your chest ♫

492
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:18,260
♫ Quietly hiding behind the stars ♫
