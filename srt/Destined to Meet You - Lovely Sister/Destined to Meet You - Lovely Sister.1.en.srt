00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,410
He's probably going to attend lectures.

166
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,929
Ms. Jin, are you okay?

167
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:38,929
What did I do to a child?

168
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,389
He's not a child.

169
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:42,230
He's a college student who is about to graduate.

170
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:45,140
You've made sure he's not a high school student, so there's no problem.

171
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:49,069
- It's not illegal to take an undergrad home for the night, right?
- Correct.

172
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:51,129
My actions didn't damage the company's name, did they?

173
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,730
It wasn't that serious.

174
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,009
Quickly call the company's legal team here to confirm it.

175
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,729
What exactly should I do?

176
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,949
Be accountable to him? Marry him?

177
00:13:59,949 --> 00:14:02,529
Ms. Jin, calm down.

178
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:04,010
Okay?

179
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:11,910
Ms. Jin, you've been single since birth for 28 years.

180
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,649
You knew you would lose control after drinking.

181
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:19,369
Who gave you the courage to take him home last night after getting drunk?

182
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:26,310
I was a little blinded by his looks.

183
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,490
Are you okay, Miss Jin?

184
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,489
"Big head, big head, no worries about the rain.

185
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,769
Others have umbrellas.

186
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:46,130
You have a big head."

187
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:52,030
Do you know what is being crazy after getting drunk?

188
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,050
Being crazy after getting drunk?

189
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:11,010
Since you're already here, might as well.

190
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:17,129
Go and find out if that bar drugged my tea.

191
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:20,529
How else could I have become this crazy?

192
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:23,009
Ms. Jin, it's really all right.

193
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:24,769
This matter is a consensual one.

194
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,390
It's still consensual?

195
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:30,609
Even if it was not consensual, it has already passed.

196
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,930
It's not important anymore, okay?

197
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,049
There is a more important matter for you to handle today.

198
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:37,630
Your marriage concerning the Gu family. Have you forgotten?

199
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,929
This Old Jin has nothing to do all day.

200
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,630
He's remarried and he's forcing me to get married.

201
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,969
You can't say that about Mr. Jin.

202
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,669
Mr. Jin means well after all. You should understand.

203
00:15:47,669 --> 00:15:49,930
Fine, I got it.

204
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,450
Oh, right.

205
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:56,090
Let HR send out Wu Youyong's transfer notice today.

206
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:01,369
I think this Wu Youyong is Mr. Jin's man after all.

207
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,729
If you demote Wu Youyong in such a disguised way,

208
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:07,010
it will be awkward if you meet Mr. Jin in the future.

209
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,549
He, Jin Xichen, still came to be the Jin family's son as a grownup!

210
00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:13,269
He's not even awkward. Why should I feel awkward?

211
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,789
You asked me to compete fairly with Jin Xichen for the New City Area Development Plan.

212
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:34,329
I can accept that. But now you're urging me to get married.

213
00:16:34,329 --> 00:16:35,729
Why are you doing this?

214
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,009
I'm getting old.

215
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:40,370
Someone has to inherit the Jin family's properties. Right?

216
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,549
Who do you want to inherit them?

217
00:16:41,549 --> 00:16:44,670
I'll let whoever gets married first inherit the properties.

218
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,630
So? You want me to go on a blind date with someone from the Gu family?

219
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:51,470
With the matrimonial alliance between the Gu family and JC. Group,

220
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,329
you will get a good share of the family fortune in the future.

221
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,389
I don't care who I marry.

222
00:16:56,389 --> 00:17:00,210
I just want to know how much I'll get after I get married.

223
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,689
Pick one of the three boys from the Gu family.

224
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,829
- After you are married, you will receive 70% of the Jin family's properties.
- 90%.

225
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:08,929
- 75%.
- 80%.

226
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,550
It's a deal.

227
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,648
It's settled then.

228
00:17:11,649 --> 00:17:14,988
I'll have the legal team draw up the contract and send it to you.

229
00:17:15,649 --> 00:17:17,910
Don't drink so much strong tea.

230
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:20,890
I'll ask Qiu Bi to get you a new batch tomorrow.

231
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:33,309
To be honest, I won a dance championship at the school dance competition before.
[Gu Da]

232
00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:39,489
For future banquets, I think I'll be your best dance partner,

233
00:17:39,489 --> 00:17:41,130
Miss Jin.

234
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,550
So impressive.

235
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:47,389
I heard that Miss Jin likes traditional culture.
[Gu Er]

236
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,769
What do you say, Miss Jin?

237
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,589
Shall we attend the cultural exchange conference together next month?

238
00:17:55,589 --> 00:17:56,969
Okay.

239
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:00,570
Miss Jin, I have more shares than him.

240
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,089
I have a higher education than him.

241
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,129
My shape is better than his!

242
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,130
I have more hair than him!

243
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,029
What's the big deal with hair?

244
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:09,429
- What have you got?
- Miss Jin definitely likes me!

245
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:11,970
She's going on a date with me!

246
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,890
- Don't think you're my bro...
- You're like a pig!

247
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,489
I heard that the Gu family has three brothers.

248
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:25,689
Why not let the other one come out and meet us, too?

249
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:26,989
He is not here.

250
00:18:26,989 --> 00:18:29,289
Not here? Where did he go?

251
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:30,949
- The school.
- The hospital.

252
00:18:30,949 --> 00:18:33,050
- The hospital.
- The school.

253
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:36,969
Where exactly did he go? The school or the hospital?

254
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:42,330
- On his way to school...
- He went to the hospital.

255
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,890
Big Brother! Second Brother!

256
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:51,250
There's something I'd like to discuss with you.

257
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,969
How come it's you?

258
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,529
Big Brother? Second Brother?

259
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,569
Gu Congbei, who asked you to come back?

260
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,530
Why are you back?

261
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:13,010
I remembered what happened last night.

262
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:17,130
Student Gu, do you have a girlfriend?

263
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,189
No.

264
00:19:18,189 --> 00:19:20,250
Have you been secretly engaged?

265
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,490
What nonsense are you talking about?

266
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:29,889
I regret what I did this morning.

267
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,129
You regret it?

268
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,530
Let's get married.

269
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,569
What?

270
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,209
- What?
- I disapprove of it!

271
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,489
I disapprove of it, too!

272
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,350
Sorry to both of you.

273
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:42,930
I fell in love with him at first sight.

274
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,309
I heard the coffee is good here.

275
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:39,510
Try it.

276
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,400
You don't like the iced one?

277
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,120
I will switch with you.

278
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,740
Miss Jin, what do you mean by getting married?

279
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,039
It's literal meaning!

280
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:57,579
Since I'm going to choose one of the sons of the Gu family as my husband, you will be the one.

281
00:20:57,579 --> 00:20:59,099
This is just the second time we met.

282
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:00,840
It doesn't matter.

283
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,620
What matters is that:

284
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:07,039
First, getting married to me will guarantee you an affluent life.

285
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,439
Even if we are divorced in the future, you will get a high percentage split of my property.

286
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:12,799
Second, you have a high degree of autonomy.

287
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,959
You can hide your identity as a married man,

288
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,239
live your life, and make friends as you wish, including female friends.

289
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,460
Third, and the most important one.

290
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,519
What's that?

291
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,539
I said I would take responsibility for what happened last night.

292
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:32,440
Now everything is right.

293
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,599
Anyway, you won't lose anything in this marriage.

294
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,120
Deal?

295
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,840
I won't marry you.

296
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,919
Why not?

297
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:48,520
First, I'm not ready to get married yet.

298
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,719
Second, if I get married, I'm not planning to get a divorce.

299
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:59,159
Third, and the most important one, I'm clearer than you about what happened last night.

300
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:01,060
You don't need to take responsibility for me.

301
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:06,080
So if you are trying to get married to me because of that, you can forget about it.

302
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,200
If you don't like cold drinks, don't force yourself.

303
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,299
I've paid for the coffee. I'll leave first.

304
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,240
Student Gu.

305
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,279
You are turning me down now.

306
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,280
Then, why did you go home with me last night?

307
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,560
[Vice General Manager]

308
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,320
Xichen!

309
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,219
Xichen! Why aren't you worried at all?

310
00:22:47,219 --> 00:22:51,239
The Gu family is asking their son to marry into the Jin family.

311
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:58,579
Have you ever imagined that once Jin Rongrong is married, what will your position be in JC?

312
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,780
So which son of the Gu family did Rongrong pick?

313
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,060
I asked around.

314
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,519
She didn't choose their eldest son or their second son.

315
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,079
Of course, Rongrong wouldn't be interested in them.

316
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:13,639
She wasn't interested in them, but she is interested in the third son of the Gu family.

317
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,579
The eldest and the second eldest son are in charge of most of the Gu family's business,

318
00:23:18,579 --> 00:23:23,199
but the third son of the Gu family is the family's biological son.

319
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,559
Bei, don't you major in architecture?

320
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,980
How come you know everything?

321
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,799
The hard disk is fine.

322
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,940
The data should be able to be recovered.

323
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:40,079
But try not to spill coffee on your laptop next time. It can lead to trouble.

324
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:41,279
It wasn't me!

325
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,620
It was Wu Youyong and he blamed it on me.

326
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,779
Mr. Jin is such a nice person.

327
00:23:47,779 --> 00:23:50,240
Why is there someone like Wu around him?

328
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,999
How about Ms. Jin?

329
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:58,440
Ms. Jin? Jin Rongrong?

330
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,020
Well...

331
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:08,639
An intern like me can never have anything to do with a higher-up like her.

332
00:24:08,639 --> 00:24:10,559
She is impressive in work, though.

333
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,320
Resolute and smart.

334
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,860
She is resolute and smart?

335
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,699
But I heard Ms. Jin has a deep secret.

336
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:28,420
What's that?

337
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,799
She is weird.

338
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,679
She has to set the temperature of the air conditioner to 26 degrees.

339
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,619
Rumor has it that the reason is that she has hairy legs.

340
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:41,200
The more she shaves, the thicker it gets.

341
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,660
Liang Jingjing, you'd better spend more time on your work.

342
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,159
- Where are you going?
- To the uni.

343
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,320
Ms. Jin, do your feet hurt?

344
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,480
Drink some water.

345
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,299
How could other CEOs get married so easily, while I got rejected for three reasons?

346
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:08,879
Was my offer not attractive enough?

347
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,859
Of course not. Let me tell you.

348
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:12,640
Where did you get this mug?

349
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,239
Where's the glass I normally use?

350
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,500
I couldn't find it.

351
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,440
I thought you changed it.

352
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,199
Why would I change it for no reason?

353
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,639
Well, I didn't change it either.

354
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,500
Who could it be?

355
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,519
Could it be... him?

356
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,820
Where did you get it?

357
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,379
I found it on your bedside table.

358
00:25:37,379 --> 00:25:39,659
What's the matter? Any problem?

359
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,299
[Glass is fragile and you can easily hurt yourself.]

360
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:51,440
[Use a more solid mug to drink.]

361
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,220
I knew it was him.

362
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,720
That's sweet.

363
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,240
You said that what is necessary for a proposal?

364
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,949
A proposal requires a sense of ritual.

365
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:10,670
First of all, you need to let Gu feel your sincerity and your love.

366
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:14,850
My sincerity and my love?

367
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,630
Got it?

368
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,250
[Not single anymore]

369
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,551
- Oh my god.
- Water!

370
00:26:24,551 --> 00:26:26,909
I did it in public, on the bed, and in the car.

371
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:29,289
He wouldn't see me as a pervert, would he?

372
00:26:29,289 --> 00:26:31,390
You did it in the car as well?

373
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,490
I got it.

374
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:41,309
I will test the water first and then offer him a proper proposal

375
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:45,550
so that he can feel my surging love.

376
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:52,469
Tiantian, hurry up and finish it.

377
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,229
Let's go to the movies later.

378
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:56,729
Dear, if you are bored, go and eat something first.

379
00:26:56,729 --> 00:27:00,309
I can't eat by myself. I want to wait for you.

380
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:02,909
Okay.

381
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:06,450
Could you please stop being lovey-dovey in the library?

382
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:11,069
Student Gu, you're wrong.

383
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,869
A library exists for people to be lovey-dovey.

384
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:16,960
- Why are you here?
- I'm here to talk about...

385
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,069
our marriage.

386
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,110
Bei, you are getting married?

387
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,629
He is, my friends.

388
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,949
Please come to our wedding.

389
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:29,389
I will invite all of Bei's classmates.

390
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:32,290
Bei, don't forget to give the list...

391
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,090
[Quiet]

392
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:45,470
Rebellious.

393
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,450
You are...?

394
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,990
Mrs. Gu.

395
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:54,250
Qiu Bi, go ahead as planned.

396
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,310
Bei, congratulations!

397
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,730
Bei, wish you a lifetime of love.

398
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:08,690
Congratulations.

399
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:12,090
Bei, good for you.

400
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,130
Your girlfriend asked you to read it.

401
