Impossible. He definitely likes girls.

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,479
Here, have a taste.

334
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,900
It's hot.

335
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,840
Very good.

336
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,580
Rongrong.

337
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,880
I suddenly thought of a brain teaser.

338
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:28,200
One little white, plus one little white, what does it equal to?

339
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,200
What little white?

340
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,320
White color. Look at me.

341
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:39,039
One little white, plus one little white, what does it equal to?

342
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,280
Two little whites.

343
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,700
Little white rabbit!
("rabbit" sounds the same as "two")

344
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,759
You told me such a lame joke.

345
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,839
How is it lame? Look at me.

346
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,660
Two little whites.

347
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,440
Bei.

348
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,359
- Did we know each other before from...
- Little white rabbit! Look, little white rabbit!

349
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,580
What is this? Wedding ring?

350
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,719
Yes.

351
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,780
Do I have one, too?

352
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,639
If you don't, then who does?

353
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,960
I put it in the bedroom, where you can find it easily.

354
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,280
When did you prepare this?

355
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,119
The day I agreed to marry you.

356
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,440
But I didn't give it to you and lost the chance.

357
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,980
It's pretty.

358
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:41,959
Now I believe you fell in love with me at first sight.

359
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,060
I'm so charming.

360
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,460
Yes, you're the most charming.

361
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,240
Soup!

362
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,360
You're writing your thesis again?

363
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,860
Rongrong, let's...

364
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,140
buy a refrigerator.

365
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,820
But we don't eat every meal at home.

366
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,820
There's no need.

367
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,560
I know.

368
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:31,619
Because you were locked in a freezer truck five years ago, you became like this.

369
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:34,060
- I hope you can...
- Qiu Bi told you this. Right?

370
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,820
That was an accident.

371
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,620
But after that, you're hypersensitive to temperature.

372
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,140
You can't even accept a refrigerator.

373
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,519
I don't want you to be like this.

374
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,940
You mean...

375
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:48,360
I'm abnormal.

376
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,999
I don't mean that.

377
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,160
I'm just afraid that one day

378
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:59,379
if it happens again and I'm not by your side, what will you do?

379
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:13,080
Then in the future, you should always be by my side.

380
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,600
Okay?

381
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,740
You said Rongrong came to our school the day of the incident?

382
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:31,479
Your school? Are you... also from Xiangyang High School?

383
00:28:31,479 --> 00:28:32,920
Yes.

384
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:37,299
Although I barely went to school in my senior year, I was a student at Xiangyang High School.

385
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,260
What a coincidence.

386
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:43,379
Mr. Jin also worked as a teacher for half a year at that school.

387
00:28:43,379 --> 00:28:44,559
Mr. Jin?

388
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,919
Yes. Jin Xichen, Mr. Jin.

389
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:51,539
Let me tell you. Jin Xichen, Mr. Jin, and Ms. Jin were classmates.

390
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:52,999
They've known each other since young.

391
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,860
Afterward, Mr. Jin's mother married into the Jin family.

392
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,979
Our Ms. Jin's temper... You know it.

393
00:28:57,979 --> 00:28:59,039
She couldn't tolerate it.

394
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,240
She went to the school to find Jin Xichen.

395
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,700
But coincidentally, it was that day the incident occurred.

396
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,940
Do you remember the date?

397
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,400
I think it was...

398
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,640
The last day of November.

399
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,379
A short while after Ms. Jin left the school, the incident happened.

400
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,080
Student Gu, are you sure you want to investigate this?

401
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,200
I must get to the bottom of this.

402
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,300
I've seen how she is when she's afraid.

403
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,620
She must have been desperate at the moment.

404
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,340
If that's so, I'll tell you more.

405
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,660
Xichen, I'm not exaggerating this time.

406
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:02,139
Gu Congbei really wants to investigate Ms. Jin's kidnapping.

407
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,960
Let him investigate.

408
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,960
Why are you panicking?

409
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,399
I'm just...

410
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:13,519
That year, I gave the idea to make Ms. Jin accept you as a member of the Jin family.

411
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,020
You're spouting nonsense again.

412
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,260
Yes, yes.

413
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,939
I'm spouting nonsense.

414
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,220
But if Gu Congbei really wants to investigate

415
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,840
and finds something, what do we do?

416
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:47,420
Well, if the Jin family finds out...

417
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,120
that Gu Congbei not only got close to Rongrong on purpose,

418
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,080
but is also the one who kidnapped Rongrong five years ago,

419
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,820
what will Mr. Jin do?

420
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,540
I got it.

421
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,599
Mr. Jin, you're preparing for lessons?

422
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,020
Yes.

423
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,479
Out of our teaching trainees, you're the most outstanding one.

424
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:19,559
Work hard.

425
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,780
You'll definitely be able to stay and keep teaching.

426
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,040
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

427
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,439
Urban design competition.

428
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,520
You're in charge of it, right?

429
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,879
We have a student called Gu Congbei.

430
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,919
His mother is the general manager of Gu Construction.

431
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,239
She's also our alumni.

432
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,679
She helped our school a lot throughout the years.

433
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,999
Although Gu Congbei is often absent from school,

434
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,799
he is quite talented in design.

435
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,800
For the urban design competition, please take note.

436
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,740
Mr. Jin.

437
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,199
Why did you reject my design draft?

438
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,140
Look, you submitted your draft late.

439
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:03,340
For fairness, I can only reject it.

440
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:07,580
Yes, the submission deadline is 12:00 p.m.

441
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,199
I am indeed late by half an hour.

442
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,079
But I had some issues at home. Can't you give me another chance?

443
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:15,359
Even if you were late by a minute, you would still have lost the chance to compete.

444
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:17,000
That's called fairness.

445
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,279
For students like you who do not even come for lessons,

446
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:23,580
depend on connections, get scholarships, study abroad.

447
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:27,599
Students like you are already privileged since birth.

448
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,999
Why do you still want special treatment for this?

449
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,560
Mr. Jin.

450
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,740
It's fine that I've lost my chance to participate.

451
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,919
But I need to correct something.

452
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,399
I've never depended on connections.

453
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,520
I've never received any special treatment because of my family.

454
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,779
Please do not be biased against me.

455
