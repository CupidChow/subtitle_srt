[Episode 7]

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,920
The day when I went to your school to find Jin Xichen,

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,920
I saw you were quarreling with him.

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,540
You bumped into me on your way out.

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,700
That was our first encounter that day.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,000
First encounter?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,660
Did we run into each other many times that day?

8
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,559
You heard my conversation with Jin Xichen and wanted to give me a heads-up,

9
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:34,860
so you followed me out of school.

10
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,120
Hey! Kid.

11
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,840
How come it's you?

12
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,420
Yeah.

13
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,839
How come it's you?

14
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,880
You weren't stalking me and sneaking pictures of me, were you?

15
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,100
Me sneaking pictures of you?

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,640
I wasn't.

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,960
I just wanted to give you a heads-up.

18
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,100
I don't think he's a good brother

19
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,120
or a good husband.

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,940
He?

21
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,960
You thought Jin Xichen and I...

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,119
Never mind, kid.

23
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,359
Students are not supposed to skip classes.

24
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,580
Go back to school now.

25
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,239
Hey, Miss.

26
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,239
I don't believe that you have never skipped class before.

27
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,639
I never skipped school before, not even being late.

28
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,560
This is the first time I've ever been absent from work.

29
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,040
Same here.

30
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,100
Bye.

31
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,340
Student.

32
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,600
Here you go. Take it.

33
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,840
It was for my father but I'm so mad at him today.

34
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,560
Now it's yours.

35

[Destined to Meet You]

36
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,160
No wonder when I got the flowers from you,

37
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,679
I felt a sense of deja vu.

38
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,559
I did not expect that all the flowers that I sent

39
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,800
fell into your hands eventually.

40
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,840
So...

41
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,959
that's when the picture was taken?

42
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,440
No.

43
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,620
I saw you with some rogues on my way to work.

44
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,179
The Gu family is so rich but you don't have a penny in your backpack?

45
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,279
This looks like it's worth something.

46
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,919
- I can name a good price, can't I?
- Get lost!

47

Get off him.

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,460
Who the heck are you?

50
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,360
Your queen!

51
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,320
Oops, too far.

52
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,760
Kid, just give me a moment.

53
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,239
Qiu Bi, bring ten brothers of Heifengtang here.

54
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,680
Heifengtang?

55
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,600
What is it?

56
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,399
Ms. Jin, are you kidnapped?

57
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,180
Blink if you are.

58
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,080
What the heck is Heifengtang?

59
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,340
You don't even know that?

60
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,220
Go!

61
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,540
Stop! Stop right there!

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,999
- Stop!
- Get in the car.

63
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:16,440
Stop!

64

Stop! Hurry up!

65
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,680
Don't let me see you again!

66
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,119
But you don't have a tattoo on your hand.

67
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,199
Of course, I don't.

68
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,039
In that case, I had to look tough.

69
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,839
It was a sticker I bought from a grocery store.

70
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,740
Five yuan a piece.

71
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,659
Well... What happened then?

72
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:49,660
Then, you bought me ice cream.

73
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,300
That's when the picture was taken.

74
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,120
I mean it.

75
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,599
When I said I'd pay you back, I'll definitely keep my word.

76
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,499
I'm a man. A man always keeps his word.

77
00:05:07,499 --> 00:05:12,319
All right, that person and a high school student who's having ice cream.

78
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,720
Don't you think having ice cream can make you feel better?

79
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,520
Perhaps.

80
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,380
And you said you weren't sneaking pictures of me.

81
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,380
But I'm doing it openly.

82
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,460
I'll send you the pictures later.

83
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,440
I'm going to work.

84
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,000
What's your name?

85
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,880
My family name is Jin.

86
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,279
All right. Miss Jin, my family name is Gu.

87
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:58,719
Got it. Student Gu.

88

- How can I send the pictures to you?
- Floor 47, Nantian Building.

89

Have the ginger tea first.

90
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,920
I thought I had a nail in the back of my head,

91
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:25,320
so I forgot what happened five years ago.

92
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,639
Do you really have no doubt at all

93
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,460
that I might be the culprit of your accident that day?

94
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:39,139
It's probable that I found out whom you were at the time, so I planned it carefully...

95
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:41,599
It doesn't matter what happened in the past.

96
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,380
What really matters...

97
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,680
is that I know you wouldn't do anything to hurt me.

98
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,500
It doesn't matter what my past is.

99
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,840
What matters is that I met you in the past.

100
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,780
I'm sorry.

101
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,880
I forgot the day we met when I was 17.

102
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,980
If I could go back to that time,

103
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,820
I would tell you right away...

104
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,380
that I like you.

105
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,680
I want to fill in the blank...

106
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,400
of the last five years without you.

107
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,879
What are we going to do, Xichen?

108

Jin Rongrong still has no doubt about Gu Congbei.

110
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,100
The news has been kept hidden by her and Mr. Jin hasn't heard about it at all.

111
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,039
What if she keeps digging and finds out about us?

112
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,939
Leave me alone. I'm working on a proposal.

00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,479
Isn't this Liang Jingjing's work?

116
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,580
What does it have to do with you?

117
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,360
I have to help her make this plan work.

118
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,839
If it fails again, she'll have to go home and take over the family business.

119
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,399
What is wrong with you, man?

120
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,159
You're still concerned about Liang Jingjing!

121
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,179
If Liang Jingjing fails this time, she can go home and take over the family business.

122
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,780
If you fail this time, you'll lose everything.

123
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,620
Please leave.

124
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,800
Since you won't do it,

125
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,420

Really?

But I didn't hand in the plan you made for me.

That's not mine, no matter how good it is.

133

As you told me before, no shortcuts.

134
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,700
It's good to count on my own.

135
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,280
Therefore, I'm sorry.

136

No. I came for you.

I'm having dinner with my colleagues today so I can't have dinner with you.

00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,519
Recently, Old Jin has assigned me a very important task.

331
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,739
- I think I have to make him pleased.
- What?

332
00:26:43,739 --> 00:26:47,560
♫ How wonderful the smile from your lip corners is ♫

333
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,980
Wait a minute. I haven't finished the orange yet.

334
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,880
You can't finish it today then.

335
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,979
♫ The exclusive love that you gave me ♫

[Destined to Meet You]

337
00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:07,559
♫ Making me agree with you unconditionally ♫

338
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:12,860
[Don't leave, there's an Easter egg!]

339
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,650
♫ And the trace of our love ♫

340
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:18,510
♫ Everything is just right ♫

341
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,540
Wait for me for 5 years and I will marry you.

342
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,139
[It's said that everyone will only fall in love once.]

343
00:27:36,139 --> 00:27:37,359
[Every romance after that is simply us seeking his or her shadow.]

344
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,079
♫ Afraid that I won't hug you anymore ♫

345
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,799
♫ But you never know ♫

346
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:51,960
♫ That I want to be by your side forever ♫

347
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,619
♫ How wonderful the smile from your lip corners is ♫

348
00:27:55,619 --> 00:27:59,599
♫ I don't need to think because my heart is racing ♫
