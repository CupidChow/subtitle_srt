ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:50,175
SEPTEMBER 30, 1987

3
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:02,479
SCHOOL MAGAZINE CLUB ROOM

4
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,523
We got so many letters.

5
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,567
They piled up over the summer.

6
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:11,029
There's also a package.

7
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:13,490
Are some of the letters
not from our school students?

8
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,034
That's what I heard.
We got letters from other schools.

9
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:19,579
This is really something.
Our magazine is pretty good.

10
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,458
Hey, Yong-tak.

11
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,877
Come and help sort this out.

12
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,588
Jung-hyun,
why did you bring him with you?

13
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,924
I give him points
for not missing a club meeting.

14
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:39,516
We have three letters
about a red mask sighting.

15
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,476
Don't they all describe the same thing?

16
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,186
They saw some guy on a side street.

17
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,231
How will we approach it?

18
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,858
Will he appear if we do a stakeout there?

19
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,694
Yes. I heard he attacks
pretty girls or ugly guys.

20
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,405
Then we should go.

21
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,366
What are you talking about? Idiot.

22
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,371
The second most mentioned topic was
a haunted house in Hyegang-dong.

23
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,707
I like that one.
We'll be able to get nice pictures.

24
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,128
Let's think a bit more about that

25
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,171
since Chuseok is coming up next week.

26
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,966
Let's pick one for
our special report later.

27
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:18,638
I don't think we can top
the Seven Secret Spots story we did.

28
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,598
What is this?

29
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,145
This came in a package too?

30
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,856
Oh, I forgot. That came too.

31
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:32,152
But we can't watch it
since we don't have a VCR player.

32
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,280
Mixtape… What does that mean?

33
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,159
I think it's a recorded tape.

34
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,578
-What kind of recording?
-How would I know?

35
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,747
Is there a way we can watch this?

36
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,834
Maybe I can ask the broadcasting club.

37
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,462
Oh, I know how we can watch it.

38
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,009
Wake up, Yong-tak.

39
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,138
It smells.

40
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,472
What is this stink?

41
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,141
It's assaulting my nose.

42
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,769
Lock the door
after you finish watching it.

43
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,479
-Sure.
-Oh, I almost forgot.

44
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,773
-Did you hear what the coach said?
-About what?

45
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,192
He said he'll hold practice
even during Chuseok.

46
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,360
Really? Damn it.

47
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,154
-That sucks.
-Sucks.

48
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:18,197
Anyway, make sure you lock the door.

49
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,158
Bye.

50
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,172
What is this? It's so noisy.

51
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,548
Turn down the volume.

52
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,062
-Did you listen to it?
-What?

53
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,442
The cassette tape, you mean?

54
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,112
Sir, I think…

55
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,154
Stop.

56
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,949
Don't say anything yet.

57
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,660
I Just wanted to know
if you listened to it.

58
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:49,163
We have to think now. Whatever that is,

59
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,125
we need to think.

60
00:04:58,506 --> 00:04:59,507
Oh gosh.

61
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:03,177
Why are you sitting like that
when there are customers around?

62
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,387
Geez.

63
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,807
Scoop the rice by yourself.

64
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,934
-Okay.
-Don't eat too much though.

65
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:10,935
Come on!

66
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,357
And

67
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,444
give this to Jae-young's mom.

68
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:23,823
I heard she closed her shop. She's busy
searching for Jae-young everywhere.

69
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,200
Pickled radish is good
when you need a quick meal.

70
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:27,952
It'll be awkward.

71
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,412
Why would it be awkward?

72
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,165
Because Jae-young isn't there.

73
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,249
Oh gosh.

74
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,626
You're so immature.
Aren't you worried about her?

75
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:37,879
You need to grow up.

76
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,673
-Could I have some water?
-Coming.

77
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:44,218
There have been a string of homicides
in Saju, Gyeongsangnam-do.

78
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:47,388
Lee Kyung-jin,
who went missing on July 13,

79
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,140
has been found dead.

80
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:52,643
Meanwhile, Jo Jae-young,
who went missing on July 15,

81
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:56,064
is actually the daughter of Jo Kyung-ho,

82
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,441
the terrorist
behind the nerve gas attack in 1987.

83
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,318
-What did he just say?
-According to reports,

84
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:03,154
Ms. Jo and her family
hid the fact from their neighbors.

85
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,490
-What did he say?
-The family left Saju

86
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,785
-after the attack and lived in Incheon…
-Did you know that?

87
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,371
Did you know
she was the daughter of that bastard?

88
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,706
I'm done eating.

89
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,958
Where do you think you're going?
Come back here.

90
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,295
The police are looking for Kim
who is the kidnapping suspect.

91
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,881
DECEASED JUNG YOUNG-SEOB

92
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,612
Thank you for coming.

93
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:49,534
Thank you.

94
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,792
I don't see anyone I know.

95
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,711
It's been a while since we last saw him.

96
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:01,671
Min-jae.

97
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:03,297
Yes?

98
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,425
-How about we leave now?
-Already?

99
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,468
Sorry.

100
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,304
I'm worried about so much stuff right now.

101
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,228
There was a symbol I saw
in the school magazine,

102
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:20,022
and I recall
it was from that mysterious place.

103
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,484
It's the same symbol I saw in the home
of the guy who kidnapped Jae-young.

104
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,486
To be honest,

105
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,407
I was looking for
our high school friends here.

106
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,743
I wanted to ask them
if they knew anything about it

107
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,997
or ever saw it.

108
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,250
Oh gosh.

109
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,919
I don't know what I'm doing.

110
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,215
Anyway,

111
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,051
I don't think it's the right thing to do.

112
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,139
It's disrespectful to Young-seob too.

113
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:56,309
Sure. I'm not judging you.
So don't worry about me.

114
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,644
If you want to leave,
then we can leave now.

115
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:02,648
Excuse me.

116
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:06,444
Thank you for coming.
I'm Young-seob's cousin.

117
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,946
Oh, you are? It must be hard for you.

118
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,949
We went to the same high school as him.
He was a friend.

119
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,494
I see. Aunt told me you were his friends.

120
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,704
Would you like me to bring you some food?

121
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,498
Oh, we're fine. Don't mind us.

122
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,584
I'm sorry. We should be helping
with the funeral.

123
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,253
Oh, that's okay. We have enough help.

124
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,298
Were you close with Young-seob?

125
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,677
You could say that.

126
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,514
We were in the same club in high school.

127
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,559
In that case, could you
stay here a little longer?

128
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,187
I have a favor to ask from you.

129
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,616
I could just bring it to you.

130
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:54,700
I know, right?

131
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,744
Are you sure about this?

132
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,580
No, I've always wanted to see his place.

133
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:03,125
After we get there,
I'll give you a ride home afterward.

134
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,419
That would be great.

135
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,227
That's his room.

136
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:32,363
I was going to go through his photos

137
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,740
and hold a posthumous photo exhibit
in his memory.

138
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:38,244
So that's what I'm trying to organize.
But I don't know much about photos,

139
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,706
so I was hoping
you could pick out the best ones.

140
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,959
We're not experts in photography.

141
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,837
Even if you're not, you were close to him.

142
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,715
So you probably have a better idea
of what photos

143
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,633
he would have wanted to show people.

144
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,094
Let me see.

145
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,971
There are more photos in this box.

146
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,728
-Jung-hyun.
-What?

147
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,062
Take a look at this.

148
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:11,193
Amazing. He didn't throw anything out.
He kept these old photos.

149
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,821
I know.

150
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,991
I totally forgot
that we took these photos.

151
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,330
What is this?

152
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:24,999
It's a VCR tape.

153
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,294
Jung-hyun, don't you remember
seeing this tape before?

154
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:33,341
Is there a VCR player in the house?

155
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,551
I'm not sure. I don't think so.

156
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:39,347
Young-seob's family hardly watch any TV.

157
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,726
Then could we borrow this?

158
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:44,977
What?

159
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,356
Well…

160
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:51,984
I'm not the person you should be asking.

161
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,986
Why do you need it?

162
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,363
What's gotten into you?

163
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,198
Please let me borrow it.

164
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,760
Yes, Master Jung.

165
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,222
Nobody is here yet.

166
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,350
Oh, is that so?

167
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,310
Right.

168
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,561
It's okay.

169
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,399
Well,

170
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,401
it's just that

171
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,154
I feel a bit disappointed, okay?

172
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,699
I'm not asking a lot in return.

173
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,786
I made what you could call
a noble sacrifice

174
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:47,289
for our brothers, you know.

175
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,793
But the way I'm being treated is
a bit disappointing.

176
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:56,257
Who takes a ferry to travel to Japan?

177
00:11:56,757 --> 00:12:00,761
It's raining a lot here.
I'm not even sure if the ferry can depart.

178
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,856
No, sir.

179
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:16,610
You're the representative.
I'm not complaining about your decisions.

180
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:19,780
Okay.

181
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,118
Hello.

182
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,662
Hello.

183
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,957
I'm…

184
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,668
the Successor.

185
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,336
I'm the Successor.

186
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,238
Mr. Lee.

187
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,783
Oh, great to see you.

188
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,619
We arrived late.

189
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,997
I knew you wouldn't be a no-show,
but I was getting worried.

190
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,708
I was starting to feel a bit lonely.

191
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,376
Oh, I'm so sorry.

192
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,004
We had something to give you

193
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,798
to take with you on your trip.

194
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,425
Is that so? What is it?

195
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,260
Let's have a look at it.

196
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,642
There's no need to. It won't take long.

197
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,165
Master,

198
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,794
I sincerely wish you'll attain nirvana.

199
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,354
Mom, I'm home.

200
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,695
Mom.

201
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,739
Mom.

202
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,297
Are you okay?

203
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,262
What was that sound?

204
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,556
I don't know. Someone threw a rock.

205
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,855
Mom, go to your room.

206
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,442
-What is going on?
-Hurry.

207
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,073
Mom.

208
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,327
Mom. What will we do?

209
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,205
Mom.

210
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,266
I had a relatively normal childhood

211
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,853
while growing up.

212
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:48,859
My mother raised me
and my sister by herself.

213
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,489
Not much stands out in my memory.

214
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,868
I had an ordinary life, I guess.

215
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,790
Could you tell me why you went to Japan?

216
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,335
There was someone I had to meet.

217
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,130
Could you tell us who that person was?

218
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,635
I don't know.

219
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:17,763
Why are you smiling?

220
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,515
Oh, sorry.

221
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,391
It's just that

222
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:25,354
this conversation we're having
is very amusing.

223
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,231
It's amusing to you?

224
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,566
Which part of it?

225
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,194
I went to Japan
to meet the mother of my child.

226
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:35,781
Is Jae-young's mother Japanese?

227
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,118
No, she's not.

228
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,745
Is that what you thought?

229
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,376
I guess you could.

230
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,604
-Sir.
-You're here.

231
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,273
What are you doing?

232
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,899
Looking at the seagulls.

233
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,693
Seagulls?

234
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,862
I don't see any. It's raining.

235
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:18,365
I was thinking about them.
They're gone because it's raining.

236
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,117
It's nice when it doesn't rain.

237
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,536
They fly right at me to eat this
from my hand.

238
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,875
How's work? Are you holding up well?

239
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,753
It's been over ten years
since I've been stationed here.

240
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:33,672
It's been that long?

241
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,593
Back when I was in Seoul,

242
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,054
I would wonder whether
you were doing your job well down here.

243
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,723
You always say that.

244
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:45,934
It was great when we worked together
at headquarters in Namsan.

245
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,227
Don't you think so?

246
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,147
You probably don't remember.

247
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,067
-Is everything the same?
-What?

248
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,696
You don't think about it?

249
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,033
Sir.

250
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,493
I already told you about how I feel.

251
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,997
I'm just asking. Don't get upset.

252
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,376
Let's go, sir.

253
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,420
They cleared the area of the murder scene.

254
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,380
-Let's go.
-Okay.

255
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:24,973
-Is this the person you were looking for?
-It is.

256
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,810
Did you find anything?

257
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:32,522
No, no belongings and no wallet.

258
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,191
Somebody took everything.

259
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,692
How did you identify him then?

260
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:39,529
His business card was lying there.
I think the killers didn't see that.

261
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:44,493
He was carrying yen. So I think
he was planning to go to Japan.

262
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,786
You're right.

263
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,372
And it's very sloppy.

264
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,177
Was this inside his bag?

265
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:03,720
Yes, it was.

266
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,556
He liked sweets a lot.

267
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:08,725
Sweets?

268
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:10,978
Where did I see this before?

269
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,272
You've seen that before?

270
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,108
Isn't that a Japanese candy?

271
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,454
Lee Kyung-jin.

272
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,915
I think I saw it in Kyung-jin's room.

273
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,131
Oh, sir. Why did you put it in your mouth?

274
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,974
-Go and check the ingredients of it.
-Why?

275
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:52,060
He was acting like a drug dealer.
Remember?

276
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,938
Oh, I think he was.

277
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,899
This wasn't a simple homicide case
from the beginning.

278
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,652
We made a mistake from there.

279
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,911
Could you tell me about
the circumstances at the time?

280
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,460
We discovered Japanese candy
next to his body.

281
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,130
It was among his belongings.

282
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:25,093
And it was the same candy I found
in the first victim, Kyung-jin's room.

283
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,971
We had the candy tested.

284
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,515
It was LSD-laced candy.

285
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,103
It was a hugely popular candy
in the 1990s.

286
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,523
It's a hallucinogenic drug.

287
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,737
Afterward, we found
large amounts of LSD-laced

288
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,947
candy in Lee Young-deok's home.

289
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:50,160
LSD is smuggled into Korea from Japan.

290
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:54,372
There are only a few crime syndicates
that can smuggle that much LSD.

291
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,667
So it wasn't hard to track down the gang.

292
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,880
Lee Young-deok was involved

293
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,465
-with the Skull Gang?
-Yes.

294
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,759
There has to be a connection

295
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:09,179
between Kyung-jin
and the missing girl, Jae-young.

296
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:14,392
Also, Lee Young-deok and Kyung-jin
probably knew each other, right?

297
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,812
-Yes, Chief.
-So give me your take on this.

298
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,397
Why would the Skull Gang
kidnap Jae-young, then?

299
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,442
We're not completely sure about that.

300
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,487
We're just looking at every clue we find.

301
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,530
No.

302
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:29,032
You can't make assumptions
based on one clue.

303
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,033
There is

304
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,577
-something else.
-Something?

305
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:34,871
There's something we're not seeing here.

306
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:38,583
And whatever it is,
it's the reason behind all these incidents

307
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,211
that are happening in our city.

308
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:42,379
Give it to me straight.

309
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,881
What is it?
Are you telling me there's a ringleader?

310
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,092
That could be the case.

311
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,720
Or a crime syndicate could be involved.

312
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:00,814
You've heard
that a special investigation unit

313
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,441
may take over these cases, right?

314
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,071
-Yes, I've heard the rumor.
-If that were to happen,

315
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,073
you have to switch loyalties
and toe the line.

316
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,534
Geez, you keep saying that.

317
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,327
You don't get it.

318
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,204
You haven't had any breakthroughs yet.

319
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,206
Even if Lee Young-deok is a drug dealer

320
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,376
and he's involved with the Skull Gang,

321
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,003
what are you getting yourselves into now?

322
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:27,132
If you can't connect the drugs
to the disappearance of Jae-young,

323
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:30,177
then you'll have a serious career setback.
Understand?

324
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,764
Chief, that's exactly why

325
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:37,809
we're asking you for a favor.

326
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,686
I'll ask you one last time.

327
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:43,148
Do you really need this to crack the case?

328
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:46,693
Yes, we do.

329
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:50,405
Let's work the case
with Busan anti-narcotics division.

330
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,241
That's a good cover.

331
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:56,536
Let the anti-narcotics division
handle the Skull Gang.

332
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,413
You two just do your job and come back.

333
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:02,542
Bring back a single hair belonging
to Jae-young if you can, okay?

334
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,594
Mr. Kang.

335
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,222
I borrowed three million won,

336
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:00,642
but why is the principal five million won?

337
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,143
That's not right.

338
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,146
No, you're mistaken, ma'am.

339
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,190
Let's look at the numbers.

340
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,568
Before we gave you the loan,

341
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,989
we thoroughly explained
the interest rate to you.

342
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,490
You know that, right?

343
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:18,034
The pre-interest is 1.5 million won
and our loan fee is 500,000 won.

344
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,870
The interest you pay is 50 percent
for 10 days. That's 150,000 won.

345
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,580
All of that is written down
in the promissory note.

346
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:25,667
The interest I'm paying is ridiculous.

347
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,461
The deal you put your money in

348
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:31,506
is the Jungang Market deal, right?
The Busan Gang set that up.

349
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,258
How did you know?

350
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,719
A lot of my customers
have put their money in it.

351
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,972
And a lot of dumb investors
have piled in too.

352
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:41,599
-I heard the deal had some hiccups.
-That's what I'm saying.

353
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,227
The timing is perfect.

354
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,396
But I don't have money
to get into the action.

355
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,732
I haven't gotten the rebound I need.

356
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,403
So you're saying
the timing is great, right?

357
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:57,073
If you time it well, will you be able to
pay back the loan?

358
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,701
Of course, Mr. Kang.
No problem whatsoever.

359
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,495
YONGMA FAST CASH
CEO KANG YONG-TAK

360
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,955
How about we do this?

361
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,418
I'll lower the interest rate
to 30 percent.

362
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,253
If you pay back the loan
in full a day later,

363
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,797
I'll offer you our special
loan product No. 13.

364
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,759
Could you really do that?

365
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:19,387
I would never offer this to anyone
unless we had strong trust.

366
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,016
Come on. If you ride a wave well,

367
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:25,935
it can even sink a ship. It's unstoppable.

368
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,062
Sure.

369
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:30,648
-You need to make some profits.
-Sure.

370
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:33,193
If you sign that,
I'll give you the loan right now.

371
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,529
I've never offered this
financial product before,

372
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,114
so I'll lend you
up to three million won for now.

373
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,577
I took out 900,000 won as pre-interest.

374
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,580
It's 2.1 million won then.

375
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:50,710
Thank you, Mr. Kang.

376
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,254
I'll see you tomorrow.

377
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,632
Have this refreshment.

378
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:56,674
Thank you.

379
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,515
Boss.

380
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,810
-Will she be all right?
-What do you mean?

381
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:09,312
-I think the deal is fizzling already.
-Right?

382
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,980
It's not going to rebound, right?

383
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,315
No.

384
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,192
But…

385
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,028
even though she's been losing money,

386
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:21,699
she still owns an apartment. She shares
the title to it with her husband.

387
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,495
What about her husband though?
He won't take it well.

388
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:28,998
He'll have to cover his wife's debts
or we'll threaten to tell his employer.

389
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,459
She won't be able to repay it all anyway.

390
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,753
She owes us 300 million won.

391
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,505
She'll keep borrowing more from us

392
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:38,425
and then we'll take their apartment.
That'll be a big blow.

393
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,635
When you take them to the cleaners,

394
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,138
you take them for
every dime they're worth.

395
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,140
-Understand?
-Yes.

396
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:46,891
Call in the next customer.

397
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,438
Come in, Ma'am.

398
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:01,197
You're Yong-tak, right?

399
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,325
Do you remember me?

400
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,556
SOOK CHINESE RESTAURANT

401
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,027
What a mess.

402
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,112
Well…

403
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:46,117
Some people threw rocks
and broke the windows last night.

404
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,745
-Who did?
-She doesn't know.

405
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:55,585
But I don't know what's going on.
Ask Jung-hyun.

406
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:04,260
Gosh, this is pretty bad.

407
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,595
Are they crazy or what?

408
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,515
Jung-hyun, are you inside?

409
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:24,656
She said she would be home.
Where did she go?

410
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,411
Hey, where were you?

411
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:33,581
I went out to buy something to drink.

412
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,878
It's been a while. Hi Yong-tak.

413
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,339
So it is.

414
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:43,591
Long time no see, Jung-hyun.

415
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,931
Tell me when you're done.

416
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:58,773
Are you ready?

417
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:04,112
Let me ask you something first.

418
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:06,865
Okay.

419
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,702
Why do I have to watch this?
I haven't seen you for ten years.

420
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,204
I'm sorry for asking you.

421
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:14,873
I'm pretty desperate.

422
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,167
I'm not upset or anything.

423
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,547
I'm just wondering
why I have to watch the tape.

424
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,511
We've already watched
this videotape before.

425
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,388
-And?
-That's the reason.

426
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,663
-What did you feel?
-Well…

427
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,749
I remember watching it together.

428
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,709
But

429
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,463
I totally forgot
that it contained that stuff.

430
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,133
Just as I expected.

431
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,385
What did you feel?

432
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:52,512
Did you remember it?

433
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,098
No.

434
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:58,142
I couldn't remember a thing.
Neither could Min-jae.

435
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:00,895
How is it possible?

436
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,439
Even if we saw it ten years ago,

437
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,608
how could we forget

438
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:08,277
what we saw in the video?

439
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,863
What do you really want to know?

440
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:15,201
-What?
-Why is this so important to you?

441
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:20,873
Is it related to
your niece's disappearance?

442
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,921
I don't know. It's just…

443
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:30,758
I don't believe her disappearance
is some random crime.

444
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,220
There's something I'm not remembering

445
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:36,597
and I think…

446
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:40,143
that is connected to something

447
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,979
that happened to us a long time ago.

448
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:46,649
I envy you.

449
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,694
You go on with life without caring.

450
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:55,908
When you moved away
ten years ago without telling anyone,

451
00:33:56,784 --> 00:34:00,329
I thought I had done something
wrong that had upset you.

452
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:04,250
Otherwise, why would you not call
me for all those years?

453
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,755
But now I understand.

454
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:10,798
That's

455
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,009
your personality.

456
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,430
You only care about
what's important to you.

457
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:18,514
So

458
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,850
I became to hate you

459
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:23,686
more than your terrorist brother
who killed all those people.

460
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,606
How could you not say a word to me

461
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:28,775
just because you wanted to start
a new life somewhere else?

462
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,276
Damn it.

463
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:35,323
How could you not even call me once?

464
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,742
Even though the whole town
knows you're back now.

465
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:42,705
Yong-tak.

466
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,628
Jung-hyun.

467
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:54,675
I'm kidding with you.

468
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:05,019
Everybody looks out for themselves.
It's how people are. We're selfish.

469
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:10,108
Well, I'm really busy
because of our seasonal business.

470
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,734
I can't stay any longer.

471
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,447
Yong-tak.

472
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:19,325
I had fun. Not bad for a reunion

473
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,160
in ten years.

474
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:50,481
SUNGSHIN MUSIC ACADEMY

475
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:08,207
Your eyes meet mine

476
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,961
What could it mean?

477
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,796
I don't know yet

478
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,048
I really don’t know

479
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:19,135
My heart just beats fast…

480
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,181
Who is she?

481
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,182
Oh, she's…

482
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:28,144
Hey, you're leaving smudges on the glass.

483
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,026
Hey.

484
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:38,654
Who drinks medicinal tonic like you?
You're drinking it as if it's beef soup.

485
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:39,822
Isn't it bitter?

486
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,744
Why are you learning
to sing country songs?

487
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:45,995
I like ballad songs.

488
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,540
We're becoming an aging society,
don't you know?

489
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,709
-And so?
-You don't know?

490
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:55,421
In a capitalist country,
you have to follow the money.

491
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,840
Where is the money flowing?

492
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,886
-To banks?
-The elderly will have all the money.

493
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,095
Really?

494
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,932
My grandma doesn't have any money.

495
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,809
I'll give your grandma
an allowance when I earn money.

496
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,520
Never mind that. Why did you come here?

497
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,316
Are you done drinking that?

498
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,237
I'll drink the rest later.

499
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,947
-Why?
-Because it's too hot.

500
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,910
Well, the thing is…

501
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:29,163
I haven't been telling the truth.

502
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:30,873
What is it?

503
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,459
-Will you get mad after I tell you?
-Let me hear it first.

504
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,296
Well, actually…

505
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,841
I have that cassette tape.

506
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,343
What tape?

507
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:46,055
The tape someone delivered
to the broadcasting room that day.

508
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:48,975
The broadcasting room?

509
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,437
What? Have you gone mad?

510
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,731
Lower your voice.

511
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,317
Did you lie to the police?

512
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,861
-You said you wouldn't get mad.
-I didn't say that.

513
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,905
-You did, too.
-No, I didn't.

514
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,535
If you're going to stay mad,
I'm going to go home.

515
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,580
-Hey.
-Jae-young gave the tape to me.

516
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,417
Is something going on?

517
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,877
Why were you shouting?
That'll hurt your vocal cords.

518
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,630
Oh, no…

519
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,924
She kept asking me
to go to the Crocodile snack shop.

520
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,428
Let's change the subject, okay?

521
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:26,345
Okay.

522
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,933
Mom, can I go to the tteokbokki shop?
I need 1,000 won.

523
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,311
Don't eat anything spicy.

524
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,146
-It could hurt your vocal cords.
-Okay.

525
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:41,944
CROCODILE SNACK SHOP

526
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,656
I'm full.

527
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,367
I'm sweating after eating the spicy dish.

528
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:49,994
My tummy hurts.

529
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,788
-Now start talking.
-Talk about what?

530
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,790
About what's going on.

531
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:58,127
I told you everything earlier. That's it.

532
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,506
Jae-young gave me the tape.

533
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,467
-When?
-Well…

534
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,011
Wednesday night.

535
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,805
On Wednesday?

536
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,141
That's one day before she went missing.

537
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,143
Right.

538
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,687
That night…

539
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:35,790
Oh, Jae-young…

540
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:41,670
Hey, Jae-young.

541
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:46,258
What are you doing?
You're going to crack my window.

542
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:49,887
-What are you doing?
-Just call me instead.

543
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,972
This is more romantic, isn't it?

544
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,020
You're crazy.

545
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:01,899
Come in.

546
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,528
-No, I just came to give you something.
-Give me what?

547
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:09,740
Should I give it to you?

548
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:12,993
Let me have it.

549
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,752
Moon-sook.

550
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,214
Among your friends, where do I fit it?

551
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,927
What do you mean?
That's an awkward question.

552
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,096
It's important to me.

553
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:36,308
-Where do I come in?
-Well, right now…

554
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,186
You're my best friend.

555
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,106
-For real?
-Yes, for real.

556
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,652
Okay.

557
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,529
Thanks.

558
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,077
And she told me

559
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,496
not tell anyone about that

560
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,124
until she called me.

561
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,420
But I've told you.

562
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,506
I'm really

563
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,134
worried about her.

564
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,596
She doesn't have a phone with her.

565
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,806
Do you think

566
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,100
she memorized my number?

567
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:20,853
Are you crying?

568
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:23,230
It's this tteokbokki.
It's really spicy, you know.

569
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,524
Damn chili peppers.

570
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:34,074
I won't tell anyone
so don't worry about that.

571
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:37,620
No, let's tell Seung-hyun.

572
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,749
I didn't want to tell her
because she has a big mouth.

573
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,960
But if don't tell her,
then it would be a betrayal.

574
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,170
Do what you want.

575
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,216
I miss Jae-young.

576
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,092
Me too.

577
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,515
Where is she?

578
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,558
I miss you, Jae-young.

579
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,935
SOOK CHINESE RESTAURANT

580
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:08,752
Who is it?

581
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,007
Hello.

582
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,550
Oh, I'm sorry.

583
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:16,552
I didn't think you'd be here at this hour.

584
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:24,810
Thank you.

585
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,771
I didn't mean to bother you like this.

586
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:29,857
Thank you for coming.

587
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,067
I know you're busy working
on Jae-young's case.

588
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:38,365
Detective Kim told me
what's been happening.

589
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:40,993
I heard it's tough

590
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,454
to find the people
who smashed your windows.

591
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,917
Whoever did it is among my neighbors.

592
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:51,128
So finding them doesn't serve any purpose.

593
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:55,591
I'm used to this. It happens all the time.

594
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,343
We're scorned

595
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,137
wherever we go.

596
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,435
I'm sorry I can't help much.

597
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,397
I'm sorry too.
I didn't need to mention this to you.

598
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:14,735
I should be showing my gratitude
that you're searching for my niece.

599
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:15,778
It's all right.

600
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:20,032
I should be showing some progress but…

601
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:32,294
Detective Choi,
this is your hometown too, right?

602
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,004
No.

603
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,590
Incheon is my hometown.

604
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:40,969
You use the local dialect,
so I assumed you were from here.

605
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:44,890
I've lived here for many years.

606
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:46,850
I can't blend in

607
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,895
if I speak with a different accent.

608
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,483
Then how did you settle down here?

609
00:44:58,695 --> 00:45:00,155
My wife is from here.

610
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,825
She wanted to move back to her hometown.

611
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:04,868
So we came.

612
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,622
That's a nice story.

613
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,459
Jung-hyun,
is this your family's hometown?

614
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:16,213
Yes, you could say that.

615
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:19,341
Both of my parents
lived here all their lives.

616
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,012
Actually,

617
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:28,809
I don't know
where that bastard and I were born.

618
00:45:31,728 --> 00:45:33,355
I don't remember,

619
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:37,526
but I was told that
we lived at an orphanage.

620
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:42,072
Our foster parents
adopted us both at the same time.

621
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,283
I see.

622
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:48,036
-I didn't know.
-Only a few people know.

623
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:53,292
The newspapers and news show
never mentioned that

624
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:57,045
about that crazy bastard.

625
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:00,174
That's peculiar.

626
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,136
It's a fact that people would latch on.

627
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:09,600
I'm surprised that
it hasn't been reported anywhere.

628
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:12,519
I see.

629
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:17,858
Now that I think of it,
I haven't met your dad yet.

630
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:19,943
He passed away.

631
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:23,280
He died in 1985.

632
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:27,075
-So that's 15 years ago.
-I see.

633
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:29,620
I'm sorry for mentioning that.

634
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:32,956
Oh, no. I was the one
who mentioned him first.

635
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:37,836
I think…

636
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,008
I'm very stressed.

637
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:48,055
I usually don't bring this up.

638
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,147
Detective Choi, talking to you

639
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,275
makes me think this.

640
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:07,908
People involved with me or that bastard

641
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:12,871
always meet an unfortunate end.

642
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:17,000
Regardless of whether they're innocent…

643
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:19,962
No.

644
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,173
It's not just those who haven't sinned.

645
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:27,469
Even really nice people, like Jae-young…

646
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:30,556
This happens

647
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,183
not only to evil guys,

648
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,062
but also to someone like Jae-young

649
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:41,483
who is much nicer than I am.

650
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:47,239
That just occurred to me

651
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:51,368
while talking to you, Detective Choi.

652
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:32,409
Good morning.

653
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:37,039
-Who are you?
-Oh, Detective Lee is my husband.

654
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:40,083
He told me you were parked outside.
I thought I'd drop by to say hi.

655
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:41,835
Oh, I'm so sorry.

656
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:49,509
Have you gotten any sleep?

657
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:52,638
My husband got up to leave,

658
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:56,224
but I told him to take a shower first
because he stank.

659
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:57,517
Oh, I see.

660
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,102
He'll be coming down soon.

661
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:02,939
So I came to tell you that
and also introduce myself.

662
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,858
I'm sorry for coming so early.

663
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:08,195
Have this for breakfast.

664
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,321
Oh gosh.

665
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:12,949
You don't have to share it
with my husband even if he asks.

666
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,327
-He already had breakfast.
-I see.

667
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:19,289
Thanks for the food every day.
I should've come to thank you sooner.

668
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,457
It's fine.

669
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:22,793
I try to make it tasty.

670
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:24,419
I hope it suits your tastes.

671
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:34,096
I'm sorry for asking this,

672
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:36,640
but is something happening today?

673
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,142
What? I don't understand.

674
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:40,727
Well, you see…

675
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,355
My husband seemed to be more nervous

676
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:46,900
that he usually is this morning.

677
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:50,737
I was wondering if he's handling
a dangerous case today.

678
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:51,905
I'm kind of worried.

679
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,787
You don’t have to worry.
There's nothing happening. He'll be okay.

680
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:01,832
I'm sorry for bringing that up
in the morning.

681
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:05,460
I feel much better now.

682
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:16,680
Do you have a cigarette?

683
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,181
Sure.

684
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:24,688
Oh, I'm so forgetful.

685
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:28,191
I didn't bring my cigarette with me.
Let's buy some on the way.

686
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:30,610
Are you feeling okay?

687
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,322
I get nervous sometimes, don't I?

688
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:37,451
But my nerves will calm down in a minute.

689
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:43,540
Your wife came down to talk to me
in the morning.

690
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:44,750
What?

691
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:49,045
Oh, she told me
she was throwing out the garbage.

692
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:51,631
She cares a lot about you.

693
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:54,926
Yes, that's true.

694
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:58,597
-So today…
-Go ahead, sir.

695
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:02,267
We're not going there to fight gangsters.

696
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,395
We're just going to
focus on doing our job.

697
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:08,565
So try to relax

698
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:11,443
for the sake of your wife, okay?

699
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,403
Okay.

700
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:36,635
SAJU GENERAL HOSPITAL

701
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:16,675
Who are you?

702
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:22,430
Jung-hyun.

703
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,855
It's me. Don't you remember?

704
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:34,442
Are you…

705
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:37,696
Kyung-joo?

706
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:48,957
If Min-jae hadn't told me,

707
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,543
I wouldn't have known
that your mother was staying here.

708
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:54,462
Oh, so much has been happening lately.

709
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:56,464
Min-ja is helping a lot.

710
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:03,513
I heard about what happened
to Jae-young on the news.

711
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,476
I thought about reaching out,
but I didn't want to bother you.

712
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,939
That's okay. Thanks.

713
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:17,611
Actually,

714
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:21,573
my husband is assigned to
Jae-young's kidnapping case.

715
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:25,577
I didn't know that.

716
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,454
That's why I couldn't call you.

717
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:30,123
I believe in my husband,

718
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:34,169
but there hasn't been a breakthrough
in the case yet, so…

719
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:46,348
Jung-hyun.

720
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:51,311
I don't know if this will
make you feel better,

721
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:55,106
but a lot of people are worried about her.

722
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:58,193
So you have …

723
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:02,322
stay strong, okay?

724
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,076
Stay strong.

725
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:07,994
Understand?

726
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:12,726
Thanks.

727
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,823
Thank you for coming.

728
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:27,907
Don't mention it.

729
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:31,244
It's been a while
since I've cried like that.

730
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:36,166
I'll call you if my husband
mentions anything about the case.

731
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:37,792
Okay. Thanks.

732
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,461
-See you.
-Bye.

733
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:41,880
Oh, I almost forgot.

734
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:45,759
Min-jae said you had something to ask.
But you didn't bring it up.

735
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:48,762
Oh, never mind.

736
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:50,930
It's not that important.

737
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,475
I just had a hunch about something.

738
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:54,893
About what?

739
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:57,937
It's about the videotape
we watched together once.

740
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:02,400
Remember when someone delivered
a tape to our club room?

741
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:06,529
I remember that.

742
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:08,031
Yes.

743
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:11,242
But nobody remembers
the images they saw in the video.

744
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,411
It's confusing.

745
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:16,206
I don't think it matters much right now.

746
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:18,041
No, I do.

747
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:20,210
What?

748
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,420
I remember the video.

749
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:27,592
You do?

750
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,094
I remember it.

751
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:31,805
The bell sound

752
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:34,307
and strange murmurings.

753
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:39,312
A girl with her arms covering her face…

754
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:50,657
The Skull Gang was working with

755
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:55,453
the Yamayoshi Kai, yakuza syndicate
that is based in Osaka.

756
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:57,539
Even the anti-narcotics division

757
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:01,417
was taking a risk
in attacking their hideout.

758
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:04,671
Could you explain that a bit more?

759
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:07,465
Since they're connected to the Yakuza,

760
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:11,469
the Skull Gang is armed
with a lot of firepowers.

761
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,429
I see.

762
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:17,016
We had two SWAT teams fully armed
including our mobile investigative unit.

763
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:20,437
It's not easy to pull off
such a large operation.

764
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,690
A lot of preparation went into it.

765
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,276
I heard that the operation was a success.

766
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:29,654
Is that so?

767
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:31,322
You don't agree with that assessment?

768
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,454
Our unit had a separate purpose that day.

769
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,457
So it's hard

770
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,919
for me to say it was a success.

771
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:52,010
So Detective Lee Shi-jung

772
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:54,888
was there…

773
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,860
On the day we watched that videotape,

774
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,198
I got sick from catching the flu.

775
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,910
You probably don't remember this,

776
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:19,621
but I missed school
for a week because I was sick.

777
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:22,957
Oh, really?

778
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,710
I don't remember. Sorry.

779
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:27,837
And the Chuseok holiday was approaching.

780
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,298
People were busy ahead of it.

781
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,550
And then that happened.

782
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:35,803
Right.

783
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,431
It happened a few days after

784
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:40,475
we watched the video.

785
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:45,021
Jung-hyun…

786
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:49,400
This might sound crazy,

787
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:56,908
but ever since I watched the videotape,
I've been having the same recurring dream.

788
00:58:58,284 --> 00:59:00,203
-A dream?
-Yes. A Dream.

789
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:02,747
The same one.

790
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,126
How is that possible?

791
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,503
I don't know.

792
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:12,340
The doctor tells me
it's trauma from a terrifying event.

793
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:15,760
But what I know for certain is that

794
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:18,513
I'm

795
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:21,140
suffering from it.

796
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:28,982
Can I ask you what kind of dream it is?

797
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:36,906
If you don't want to talk about it,
you don't have to.

798
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:45,456
It's an upside-down dream.

799
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:49,544
An upside-down dream?

800
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:54,882
There is a woman

801
00:59:57,635 --> 00:59:59,137
in the upside-down place.

802
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:01,180
A woman?

803
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:03,349
The woman in the videotape.

804
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:06,269
She's standing across the room.
Upside-down.

805
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:09,480
And her arms are covering her face.

806
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:13,234
She's staring at me all night.

807
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:53,941
Did you kill Jo Jae-young?

808
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:57,236
You're the most important person
in this plan.

809
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,530
But you're removing yourself from it.

810
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:01,699
What have you done?

811
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:05,953
Searching for Jo Kyung-ho's daughter
feels like a form of punishment.

812
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:11,084
You'll find it
in the 1987 school magazine.

813
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:13,586
It felt like
I was thrashing around in a trap

814
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:15,797
that someone had laid out.

815
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,799
Don't you think you came too late?

816
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:25,014
