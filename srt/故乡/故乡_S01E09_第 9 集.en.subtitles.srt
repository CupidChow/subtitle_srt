ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,108
YEAR 1987

3
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,294
What is that?

4
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:27,796
Do you remember

5
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,466
the videotape that you and your friends

6
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,718
watched a few days ago?

7
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:35,887
Yes.

8
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,307
Then go and play this tape to them.

9
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,899
All right. It's time to go to school.

10
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,526
What will happen?

11
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,908
What will happen to

12
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,870
the magazine club members

13
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,331
after they listen to this?

14
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,499
I can't open the door.

15
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,959
What now? Break it open.

16
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:48,918
Hey, Jung-hyun.

17
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,045
Jung-hyun.

18
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,756
Why won't it open?

19
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:55,758
Hey Jung-hyun.

20
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,068
Hi Yong-tak.

21
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,447
Oh, hi.

22
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,699
-Where are the others?
-I think they're not here yet.

23
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:28,041
Is your hand okay?

24
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:30,835
Yes.

25
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,128
It's just a scratch.

26
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,547
Really?

27
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,344
Yong-tak.

28
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,057
You know…

29
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:49,270
I don't know why

30
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,814
I acted like that today.

31
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,734
I had brain fog the entire day.

32
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,028
When I came to my senses,

33
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:59,322
I found myself
sitting in the broadcasting room.

34
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,242
Jung-hyun. It's all right.

35
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,702
You don't have to explain it.

36
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,958
I couldn't focus either the whole day.

37
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,794
I don't remember what I did at school.

38
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:18,091
We have some kind of
telepathic connection, don't you think?

39
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,431
We came on time.

40
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,735
Too bad Kyung-joo couldn't come
because she's sick.

41
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,113
I know. Wish she could see this with us.

42
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,031
See what?

43
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,409
You'll find out when we get there.

44
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:49,122
Min-jae and I met this amazing person
a few days ago.

45
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,959
He said that
he'd show us something really cool

46
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,836
if we came here tonight.

47
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,796
Right, Min-jae?

48
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,048
This is it.

49
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,218
We can hide here.

50
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,262
Hide?

51
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,431
What for?

52
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,183
-You'll see.
-You want to die?

53
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,518
Don't touch me!

54
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,687
I was annoyed all day today.

55
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,023
Don't play games with me. Okay?

56
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,483
Yong-tak, don't be like that.

57
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,111
Be quiet. It's coming out.

58
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,413
I don't see anything.

59
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,250
Over there. You don't see it?

60
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,777
I'm not seeing anything.

61
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,493
Yong-tak.

62
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,374
It's real.

63
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,214
He wasn't lying.

64
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,592
-Jung-hyun.
-Yong-tak, do you see something?

65
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,427
What's out there?

66
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,362
Run.

67
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,239
Yong-tak.

68
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,347
Hey. Send it to me after you check it!

69
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,736
YEAR 1987

70
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,956
It can't be true. It's not real.

71
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,886
I have to stay still.

72
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:35,431
Whatever happens, I have to stay still.

73
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,381
You were able to see the woman.

74
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,677
Then you're ready.

75
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,709
Mom.

76
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:30,254
It's going to be all over soon.

77
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,146
Moon-sook! Oh my gosh.

78
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,522
What on earth has happened?

79
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,900
Are you okay?

80
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,319
Yes, I'm all right.

81
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,906
But Aunt is probably in shock.

82
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,532
Oh my goodness.

83
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,742
Where is she?

84
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,619
Where is Jung-hyun?

85
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,537
She's sitting over there.

86
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,123
Where? Moon-sook.

87
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,919
She was sitting right there a minute ago.

88
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,462
That's weird.

89
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:13,839
Jung-hyun.

90
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:17,927
Jung-hyun.

91
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,054
Where are you?

92
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,273
YOUNGJIN BRAIN STUDY SCIENCE VIDEO

93
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,195
Damn it. What the?

94
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,280
Hey.

95
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,326
-Hey!
-Hey, stop.

96
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,329
October 6,
Cheonyang Water Purification Plant.

97
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,882
Could you put out your hand?

98
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,320
Will I die?

99
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,157
Not yet.

100
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,037
You'll be helping me tomorrow.

101
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,583
It won't just be you.

102
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:39,169
All of the magazine club members
who saw the video will help me.

103
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,589
What

104
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,008
are we supposed to do?

105
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,011
I'm going to give you a briefcase.

106
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,930
You'll go to Saju Station
with that briefcase.

107
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,559
Then you'll open the briefcase.

108
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,187
And then release the gas.

109
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,065
Is that…

110
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,192
Is that it?

111
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,028
No.

112
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,740
It's the beginning.

113
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,148
Stay still, okay?

114
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,652
I'll untie you after I'm done talking.

115
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,239
There was no need to resort to violence.

116
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,908
We could talk it out.

117
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,078
You're just making things complicated.

118
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,163
You're the friend.

119
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,584
Jung Min-jae.
Jung-hyun's old high school friend.

120
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,044
So you are a cop.

121
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:04,463
You were able to recognize me.

122
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:09,093
But knowing who I am doesn't matter.

123
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:16,558
I'm just a worker ant
who serves and follows him.

124
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,144
Him?

125
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,898
I got this job after finishing high school
because he told me to.

126
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,818
I did it to prepare for this very moment.

127
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:31,532
You could say I spent
half of my life serving him with loyalty.

128
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,201
Are you talking about Jo Kyung-ho?

129
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,958
I don't just say his name
whenever I feel like it.

130
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,712
I don't understand.

131
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,675
What do you not understand?

132
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,677
Why would someone like you

133
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,638
help a terrorist like him?

134
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,890
-What's your reason?
-Detective Choi.

135
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,435
I'm an ordinary person.

136
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,981
I have cluttered thoughts,
get jealous, and I have regrets too.

137
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,025
I'm as ordinary as anyone can be.

138
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,988
But what about him?

139
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,407
He's different.

140
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,035
He has a vision.

141
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,787
And he has the power
to realize his vision.

142
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:22,875
I'm just a mere person.
What's wrong with offering a little help

143
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:26,503
to a person who possesses such a vision?

144
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,338
Don't you agree?

145
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,471
All of you cult members
say the same thing.

146
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,098
You're airheads.

147
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,226
And because he has filled your heads
with his ideas,

148
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:45,355
you think you've stumbled upon
some great insight.

149
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,526
So you won't accept our beliefs.

150
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,410
Well, it doesn't matter.

151
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:02,956
Because you'll be enlightened soon.

152
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,757
He's ready. I'll put him on.

153
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,640
The call is for you, Detective.

154
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,854
Hello?

155
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,232
This is Jo Kyung-ho.

156
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,903
How have you been, Detective Choi?

157
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,572
How did you know

158
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,616
I would come here?

159
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,078
Did you order people to watch me?

160
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:42,746
Watch you?

161
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,999
No, I didn't.

162
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,918
I've been

163
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,255
waiting for you for a long time.

164
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:55,884
Because you and I must meet.

165
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:56,927
But

166
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:01,098
I realized something when I first saw you.

167
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:05,102
You absolutely knew nothing.

168
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:06,854
What?

169
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,939
So I thought it was impossible.

170
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,819
A foolish person like you
can never come with us

171
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:18,031
to the end of the future.

172
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,368
The end of the future?

173
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,037
What kind of nonsense is that?

174
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,248
I can't tell you about it yet.

175
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,460
If we're going to have
a real conversation,

176
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,922
you'll have to give me
the answer I want to hear.

177
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,215
You're a lunatic.

178
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,634
You think we'll ever sit down

179
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,220
together on a couch
and have a friendly conversation?

180
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,305
In fact,

181
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:45,184
I will shoot your head
before that ever happens.

182
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,312
That's interesting.

183
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,647
This "end of the future" plan of yours…

184
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,734
Do whatever you want to make it happen.

185
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,319
I'm not going to hide from you.

186
00:19:56,737 --> 00:20:00,365
I don't care if you have
people watching over me or not.

187
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,993
Everything you say is worthless crap.

188
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:10,083
Your cult has been recently handing out
strange videotapes to people, right?

189
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:14,254
In the videotape, there's footage
from the One Family Welfare Center.

190
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,299
I realized something when I saw it.

191
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,843
This Jo Kyung-ho bastard

192
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,306
wants to get revenge on the whole town.

193
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,809
You blame the people of Saju

194
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,895
for the hellish experience you had

195
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:35,400
at the welfare center
because they knew what was going on there

196
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,362
but did nothing about it.

197
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,073
So that's why you want
to kill them all, right?

198
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,492
You justify your actions

199
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,119
because you were victimized long ago.

200
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,335
Anything more to say?

201
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,507
I'm impressed, Mr. Choi Hyung-in.
Yes, indeed.

202
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,009
You did far better than I expected.
I'm surprised.

203
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:04,221
But that's not the answer
I want to hear from you.

204
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:06,974
This story begins

205
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:12,020
with the One Family Welfare Center.
You got that part right.

206
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,189
But the story ends with you.

207
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,276
What happens today

208
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,486
will merely be a symbolic gesture.

209
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:22,614
You can't change the predetermined future.

210
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,200
Just focus on that.

211
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:29,579
Everything else is meaningless.

212
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,583
Watch what is going to happen soon.

213
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,210
And

214
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:39,172
accept the fact that
you can't change anything.

215
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,259
All right. Mr. Choi Hyung-in.

216
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,179
Have a pleasant trip.

217
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,569
All right.

218
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:04,698
Now let's get started.

219
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,368
At midnight.

220
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,247
When it's exactly October 6,

221
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,751
the attack that happened

222
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,546
at Saju Station in 1987 will be recreated.

223
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:20,232
All the people who saw the video
will gather here.

224
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,611
And they will go towards
the predetermined future.

225
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,366
They're following Guru's vision.

226
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,786
I've been given an important mission
to carry out.

227
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,214
You're going to

228
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,135
kill all those people?

229
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,137
Why the hell would you do that?

230
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,430
Why would you do such a crazy act?

231
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,849
I already told you!

232
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:58,061
You still don't understand
his vision, Detective Choi.

233
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,939
So just shut up

234
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:03,358
and watch what happens before your eyes.

235
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,862
It's a new dawn in history.

236
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,509
Wow. It's really happening like you said.

237
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,846
They're coming like a plague of rats.

238
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:37,350
Of course, it's real.
You thought it was fake?

239
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:42,147
That's why I have my work cut out for me.

240
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,275
Because he wields real power.

241
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,820
It's a tragedy, you know.

242
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,950
All right. Let's get ready now.

243
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,984
OCTOBER 6, 1999
CHEONYANG WATER PURIFICATION PLANT

244
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:36,868
Why did they have to gas him like that?
They could have just brought him.

245
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,245
It's so troublesome.

246
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,500
He might die before this is over.

247
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,550
What? What did you say?

248
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,769
What are you muttering?

249
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,945
Is it cold in there?

250
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:14,698
Or is it warm?

251
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,367
What?

252
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,619
You probably know because you work here.

253
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,709
What are you trying to say?

254
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:28,837
All right.

255
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,965
I hate water.

256
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:33,883
Water?

257
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,428
Yes, water.

258
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,482
How about it?

259
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,777
I finished warming up.

260
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,843
I'm sick and tired of this.

261
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,930
The thick, heavy air.

262
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,390
The smell of the water.

263
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:04,432
Especially

264
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:08,728
the sound of the dripping water
that never ceases.

265
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,814
Seriously,

266
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:14,067
I'm just so sick and tired of it.

267
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,031
I'm going to finish this mission

268
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:21,908
no matter what.

269
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,106
You came, Jung-hyun.

270
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,402
Min-jae.

271
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:42,781
What are you doing?

272
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,534
And why are there people outside?

273
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,499
Explain yourself, Min-jae.
What the heck is going on with you?

274
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:54,667
Jung-hyun,

275
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,753
stop it.

276
00:29:57,337 --> 00:30:00,799
Young-seob and I have been members of
the Youngjin sect for a long time.

277
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,717
You knew about it, didn't you?

278
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:03,885
No, I didn't.

279
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:07,847
Yong-tak and I trusted you.

280
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:11,559
We didn't think you were one of them.

281
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,520
Yong-tak

282
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,523
believed in you till the very end.

283
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,484
But today, Yong-tak…

284
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:27,575
Did you

285
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,038
already know he was dead?

286
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:34,457
Yes.

287
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:39,337
One of my missions was to keep
a close eye on you and Yong-tak.

288
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,590
Then it was you who helped Kyung-ho

289
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,802
communicate with Jae-young?

290
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,857
Yes, that was me.

291
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,070
But you know, Jung-hyun.

292
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:09,033
In the big scheme of things,
it's not a big deal at all.

293
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,536
It's a trivial matter.

294
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,207
-A trivial matter?
-Yes. Look at the big picture.

295
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,918
All of those things are trivial matters.

296
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,378
You don't get it?

297
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,172
Jae-young's kidnapping

298
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,508
and Yong-tak's death

299
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:27,969
are trivial matters to you?

300
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,018
In 1987,

301
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,813
when we went to Cheonyang Lake,

302
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:43,735
we left you behind while we ran away.

303
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,531
Things might have turned out differently

304
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:51,701
had we not left you behind that night.

305
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,370
That's why…

306
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:58,458
I can't blame you.

307
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:04,964
No.

308
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,383
You're mistaken.

309
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,470
You didn't leave me behind.

310
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,640
I was waiting there for him.

311
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,935
I waited for Guru all by myself.

312
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:19,604
-What?
-I've never met anyone

313
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,314
like Guru in my life before.

314
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,026
When I couldn't pay
for my mom's medical treatment

315
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:28,321
when she was on the brink of death,

316
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:32,617
Guru was the only person
who cared and lent me a hand.

317
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,456
I'm different from Yong-tak
and Young-seob.

318
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:43,962
They don't remember what they did
at Saju Station that day.

319
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,507
Unlike them, I started
from a different place.

320
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,260
I thought

321
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:56,724
everything would be okay
if I could save my mom and myself

322
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:01,479
by killing those innocent people
at Saju Station.

323
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,773
That's the kind of person I am.

324
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,990
I'm done talking now, Jung-hyun.

325
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:15,326
Even though you're a friend,
I'll kill you if you try to stop me.

326
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,079
Min-jae, let's start over again. Okay?

327
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:18,997
Min-jae.

328
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,207
I've been waiting for this day
for so long.

329
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,793
To finally get to this point,

330
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:27,296
I endured years of boredom
and joyless existence.

331
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:33,219
-Stop it!
-Let go of it!

332
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,726
Do you really want to die?

333
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,191
I said let go!

334
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,288
Min-jae.

335
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,751
No. Min-jae!

336
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,008
Min-jae!

337
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:16,095
Min-jae, listen to me. Min-jae!

338
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,306
No, Min-jae!

339
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,808
Min-jae, open the door!

340
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,062
Min-jae!

341
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,315
Min-jae!

342
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,691
Disciple Choi,

343
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,693
it's me.

344
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:35,448
Yes, everything is in place.

345
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:41,412
Is my mom sleeping soundly?

346
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:45,333
I'm a little worried because
I left her bedside at the hospital.

347
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,459
Yes.

348
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,629
She's sleeping soundly.

349
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:50,713
Okay.

350
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,132
That's a relief to hear.

351
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,300
Master,

352
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,053
we don't have time.

353
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:01,724
I'm just waiting for you
to give me the order.

354
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:10,566
Min-jae.

355
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,860
Min-jae, open the door.

356
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,071
All right.

357
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:17,907
Disciple.

358
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,410
Help my mother…

359
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,290
reach the new future.

360
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,584
Please…

361
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,717
Min-jae!

362
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,886
Min-jae!

363
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,180
Min-jae, listen to me.

364
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,515
Min-jae.

365
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:43,683
Jung-hyun.

366
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,645
I'm so exhausted.

367
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,784
No, Min-jae.

368
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,161
I'm sorry.

369
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,329
Mom…

370
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,039
Min-jae…

371
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,647
Min-jae.

372
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,233
Don't…

373
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,908
ever forgive me.

374
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:28,597
We have to turn that sound off quickly.

375
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:54,623
No matter what I do, I can't make it stop.

376
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,254
Please stop.

377
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:04,050
Please!

378
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,653
Hold on a minute.

379
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,531
I'll go up.

380
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:46,884
We got played

381
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,595
by that bastard again.

382
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,723
That bastard, Jo Kyung-ho knew

383
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,726
how this would unfold all along.

384
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:10,574
Stop!

385
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,048
Let's go.

386
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,676
Will you, sir?

387
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,679
Won't you wait for the call
to hear the result?

388
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,640
It's unnecessary.
I already know how it'll end.

389
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,644
By the way,

390
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:44,608
I hope you won't say a word
about what you saw and heard today.

391
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,277
Of course, Guru.

392
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:49,989
I wasn't going to tell anyone
even if you hadn't told me not to.

393
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,199
Okay.

394
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:58,038
Everyone is an obedient worker ant.

395
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:21,604
Jung-hyun, move out of the way.

396
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,529
It's useless, Detective.

397
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,168
Stop it.

398
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,549
You might collapse, Detective Choi.

399
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:55,137
I know

400
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:59,350
what that creepy sound is.

401
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,688
Whoever watched the videotape

402
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,566
won't survive

403
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,195
after they hear that sound.

404
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,074
I'll sacrifice my life.

405
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,826
I'll be the last and only person

406
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,412
Jo Kyung-ho

407
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,541
ends up killing in this town.

408
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:25,543
Let go of me.

409
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,461
Get out of my way.

410
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,253
Watch out!

411
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:31,251
-Move it!
-What's going on?

412
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:34,380
-What am I doing here?
-What the hell?

413
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:36,799
-Where am I?
-What is this place?

414
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,425
-Get rid of that!
-Yes, sir!

415
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:22,761
How…

416
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,305
How could you be here?

417
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,601
What is this?

418
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,649
I can't breathe…

419
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:12,227
What's your question?

420
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,104
Who am I?

421
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:17,524
Or am I Guru?

422
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:19,902
Who are you?

423
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:23,030
Who are you?

424
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,698
I…

425
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,911
came to save you.

426
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:39,379
Who are you?

427
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,468
It's time to sleep.

428
00:46:58,357 --> 00:46:59,858
Your time isn't over yet.

429
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:02,402
I need

430
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:05,864
both of you.

431
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,518
Hello.

432
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,147
Who are you?

433
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:41,483
I'm Kim Moon-sook.

434
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:44,194
-Kim Moon-sook?
-Yes.

435
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,406
Okay.

436
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:50,659
I don't know what's going on.

437
00:47:58,875 --> 00:47:59,960
Yes? Aunt.

438
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,671
I had some snacks.

439
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:04,965
I also drank some juice.

440
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:08,385
Don't worry. I brought
a lot of comic books to read.

441
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:13,181
And you know, Aunt.

442
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:16,310
The man…

443
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:19,104
Yes, the detective.

444
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,481
He's awake now.

445
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,359
What?

446
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:26,695
Okay.

447
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:29,448
Okay, Aunt.

448
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:38,248
That was Jae-young's aunt.
She's coming right now.

449
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:41,335
She told me to call a nurse for you.

450
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:43,086
She sounded very surprised.

451
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,380
Surprised? Why?

452
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:47,716
Well…

453
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,761
You were in a coma for over a week.

454
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:55,349
Seung-hyun thought you were dead
and cried all day the other day.

455
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:04,066
Do you want some chewing gum?

456
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,535
After special investigators analyzed

457
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:19,498
the evidence found at the scene
and in the homes of the deceased,

458
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:21,291
they have concluded

459
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:24,628
that the 200 dead people and more
were followers of the Youngjin sect.

460
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:27,130
They also announced that
after the cult members carried out

461
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:29,132
a religious rite
inside the water purification plant,

462
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:32,052
they tried to commit mass suicide
by inhaling nerve gas.

463
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:36,348
A plant worker called Jung Min-jae

464
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:40,143
who was found dead in her office

465
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:43,689
is said to have overseen the operation.

466
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:47,067
Special investigators
are conducting a manhunt

467
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,778
to find the cult leader of Youngjin sect,
Jung Young-seob,

468
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:52,864
who is the alleged mastermind
behind the mass suicide.

469
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:56,868
At the same time, high-ranking
cult members are also being sought…

470
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,668
I don't think we could have
stopped this from happening

471
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,421
if the people who received the videotape

472
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:12,467
were all cult members
of the Youngjin sect.

473
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,012
This is so funny.

474
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:18,807
Whatever.

475
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,476
They're Jae-young's friends.

476
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:23,645
When I couldn't be here,

477
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:26,398
they stayed by your bedside.

478
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,275
I see.

479
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:29,985
That's funny.

480
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:32,112
Thank you for being so kind.

481
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,448
Don't mention it.
It's the least I could do.

482
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:35,532
Did

483
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:37,659
Jae-young return home

484
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:39,953
by any chance?

485
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:43,331
-It's not funny.
-You don't understand the joke.

486
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,542
No, not yet.

487
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:48,545
What you just said…

488
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:52,215
That's an insult.

489
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,996
-You're not going to eat anything?
-No.

490
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,540
I don't like the food here.

491
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:28,001
It's hard to digest.

492
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:31,630
This album is terrific.

493
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,467
I can leave the compound this month.

494
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:38,553
So I'll try to buy another record
at Saju Record Store.

495
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:40,764
I saved up some money.

496
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:44,142
I asked around

497
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:46,937
and I heard that
Toy's newest album is good.

498
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:04,329
I think I can get you some
comic books to read too.

499
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,581
The masters are very busy

500
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,959
because of the Cheonyang Water
Purification Plant matter.

501
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,878
-If there's anything else you…
-Shi-young.

502
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:18,426
I have something to tell you.

503
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:22,889
The thing is…

504
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,309
I want to leave this place.

505
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:37,279
We cannot force you to stay longer
if you wish to be discharged.

506
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:40,490
But you have to avoid any strenuous work.

507
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:43,451
Even light exercise should be avoided.

508
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:45,662
Okay, I'll do as you say.

509
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:53,169
You have different visitors today.

510
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,922
I'll see you next time, Detective Choi.

511
00:52:57,132 --> 00:53:00,010
You must rest. Please don't forget that.

512
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,761
Okay.

513
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,182
Hello, Detective Choi.

514
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,979
It seems like
you're in law enforcement too.

515
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,149
-Which department are you from?
-Pardon?

516
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,485
We're from the Busan District
Prosecutors' Office.

517
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:24,159
BUSAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE
KIM SUNG-HEE, INVESTIGATOR

518
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:32,083
BUSAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

519
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:40,342
Thank you for making the trip here.
Please come this way.

520
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:28,098
I'm sorry

521
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:31,559
but could you open the door for a minute?

522
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:45,073
No. 5164.

523
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:47,367
We'll start the procedure to transfer you.

524
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:49,452
Stand next to the sink.

525
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:51,121
Put both of your hands on the wall.
Commence.

526
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:13,184
Don't leave any leftover food.

527
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:15,729
It'll weigh more.

528
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:19,274
Thanks.

529
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:23,653
Thanks so much. I mean it!

530
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:01,524
I'm ready.

531
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,675
Who did you think was Guru?

532
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,434
Let me rephrase that question.

533
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:39,062
Have you met a person called Guru?

534
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,067
Yes.

535
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:46,653
You actually met Guru?

536
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:50,949
Yes,

537
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:53,409
I did.

538
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,981
I'll be frank with you.

539
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:26,443
We've tracked down
the identity of an individual

540
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:28,236
called Guru.

541
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:31,322
Inside our team, we're divided on whether

542
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:33,867
Jung Young-seob is Guru or not.

543
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:36,953
And if Jung Young-seob isn't Guru,

544
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:42,041
then that only leaves one other person.

545
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,752
But if it turns out to be that person,

546
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,380
then it gets complicated.

547
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:50,842
Complicated? Why?

548
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:54,554
I want to hear your thoughts as someone
who worked on his case.

549
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:57,015
I think it's necessary for us to know

550
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:59,100
who you think Guru is

551
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,060
and how dangerous he is.

552
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:02,562
You said

553
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:05,106
you would be frank with me, right?

554
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,151
Tell me the point of this interview.

555
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:19,996
He killed

556
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:23,875
three nurses, one janitor

557
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,711
and one prison guard.

558
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:31,049
He just escaped
from the Institute of Forensic Psychiatry.

559
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:35,053
He did?

560
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:37,597
Yes.

561
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:46,523
Jo Kyung-ho is missing.

562
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,720
We don't have time.

563
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:01,681
We have to track him down
as soon as possible.

564
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:04,142
Well, I'm afraid of dying.

565
01:00:04,225 --> 01:00:05,643
Are you afraid of me?

566
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:08,104
That woman. You can see her, right?

567
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:10,481
It'll be the beginning
of the Day of Purification.

568
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:11,566
Which means you could get killed.

569
01:00:11,649 --> 01:00:12,734
I'm not going to change

570
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:15,320
this plan.

571
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:18,906
This is the only way.

572
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:22,493
Your sin has come to bite back.

573
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:31,586
