5
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:48,525
Where will you be on New Year's Day
as we celebrate the coming of 2000?

6
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,652
A throng of people are heading
to Jeongdongjin

7
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,612
to see the first sunrise of the new year.

8
00:01:56,658 --> 00:02:01,121
For dinner, we're having
tasty roast chicken!

9
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:04,374
That's enough already.
Just call your family, please.

10
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,627
I think there's someone in my house.

11
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:11,214
-There's someone in the bathroom.
-What?

12
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,799
Where again?

13
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,971
For the last few days,
someone has been in the bathtub--

14
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,557
-I ordered it!
-Hey, deal with him.

15
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:26,271
-For the hardworking police…
-Please just leave already.

16
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,647
We can just eat it here.

17
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,816
Can you fill out this form first?

18
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,322
Are your parents home?

19
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,242
No.

20
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,953
But my mom will get off work soon.

21
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:44,038
Then bring your mom with you.

22
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,166
But…

23
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,626
Mom says there's no one there.

24
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,586
What?

25
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,254
Mom says

26
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,423
the woman isn't in there.

27
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,176
What are you saying?

28
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,429
You said there was someone in your house.

29
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:03,016
-It was a woman?
-Mom says there's no one there.

30
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,728
That's why I came to you.

31
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,607
I was hoping you would come
check it out with me.

32
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,191
What do you mean?

33
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,068
Are you all right?

34
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,988
What? You already left?

35
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,616
I can't believe it. It's pouring outside.

36
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,912
Who would deliver roast chicken
to a precinct?

37
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,997
It doesn't make any sense.

38
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,999
Hey, fill out the form, okay?

39
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,835
Hello?

40
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:32,879
Where is your location?

41
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,716
Near Yeongwon Tollgate? Okay.

42
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,594
Oh, we can provide support.

43
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:43,514
SERVICE AND ORDER

44
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,742
Mom.

45
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:06,996
Mom.

46
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,676
Are you home?
Where did you go in the rain?

47
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,763
Mom, did you fill the bathtub with water?

48
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,181
Yes, I did. Why?

49
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,643
Why did you fill it?
I told you not to do that.

50
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,979
What are you saying? I'm tired.

51
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,480
I'm going to take a bath.

52
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,399
What if that woman is there again?

53
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,485
Silly girl, there's no woman there.
Stay out of the bathroom then.

54
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,404
Don't turn off the faucet
like you did last time.

55
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,038
Kyung-jin, where are you?

56
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:19,378
What are you doing? Are you washing up?

57
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,465
Open the door. Are you sick?

58
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,012
What did you say?

59
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,474
What are you saying?

60
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,267
Open the door! Now!

61
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,470
I'm sorry,

62
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,224
but could you open the door for a minute?

63
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,070
Could you open
a little more than that, please?

64
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,201
If it's all right with you,
could you open it all the way?

65
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,544
While I was hospitalized…

66
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,966
my symptoms have worsened.

67
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,886
I get uneasy in closed spaces.

68
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,054
Have you recovered

69
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,057
from your injuries a little?

70
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,643
I have a cast on my arm,

71
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,521
but I'm doing a lot better.

72
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,858
We're sorry for asking you to come

73
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:07,320
to answer a few questions
when you're still recovering.

74
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:09,822
It's fine.

75
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,286
Except for my insomnia,

76
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,747
my condition isn't that bad.

77
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,832
Do you have any aftereffects

78
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,920
stemming from
the Cheonyang Water Treatment accident?

79
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,928
Well, not exactly.

80
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,389
But I've quit drinking

81
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,643
after being a heavy drinker my whole life.

82
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,523
Sort of like a withdrawal symptom.

83
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,585
So…

84
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,380
Should I get right into it?

85
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,801
You'd like to know the events leading up
to the Cheonyang accident, right?

86
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,678
Yes, sir.

87
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,100
Then where should I begin?

88
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,144
Should I try to tell you

89
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,564
what I remember about the incident
in chronological order?

90
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,482
Sure. We would appreciate that.

91
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,946
The first incident began

92
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,908
in July, I think. Is that correct?

93
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,995

SAJU SERIAL MURDERS

95
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,915
HONGAN-DONG MOTHER-DAUGHTER
MURDER CASE, JULY 12, 1999

96
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,376
That's right. It happened on July 12th.

97
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,587
As you probably know,

98
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:52,300
I'm a detective with the Gyeongsangnam-do
regional police agency.

99
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,219
Last year,

100
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,431
I was assigned a new partner.

101
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,684
So I was busy getting him up to speed

102
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,021
with our work.

103
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,524
This might be an insignificant detail,

104
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,402
but it rained a lot on the day

105
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,863
the first victim was found.

106
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,031
As you probably know,

107
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,617
the monsoon lasted
longer than usual this year.

108
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,286
It was raining so hard that.

109
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,830
Lee Shi-jung.

110
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,707
He's my new partner I mentioned.

111
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,668
He was new.

112
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,463
His name is Lee Shi-jung.

113
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,425
Well, on days when it rained a lot,

114
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,427
he would come and pick me up at my house

115
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,931
because rush hour would be worse.

116
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,810
We both lived in downtown Saju,

117
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,313
and my house wasn't that far from his.
So I didn't think much of it.

118
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,648
I later found out

119
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:54,570
he moved to the downtown area
with his wife because of me.

120
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,951
I assumed he was really passionate
about his job.

121
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,705
He also probably
wanted to ask me questions

122
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,792
during our morning commute.

123
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,545
I see.

124
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,467
It's peculiar.

125
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,263
I can still remember those little details

126
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,392
so vividly.

127
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,732
I think…

128
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,321
this summer changed my life completely.

129
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,438
Sir, can I ask you something?

130
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:14,692
What did you do
whenever a New Year comes, sir?

131
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,862
What exactly do you mean?

132
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:22,241
I mean, on every New Year's Eve,
they ring the bell and countdown.

133
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:24,952
I don't know.

134
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,705
I don't really care much
for New Year's Day.

135
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,373
Oh, is that so, sir?

136
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:33,919
Sir, then perhaps have you heard of Y2K?

137
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,004
What?

138
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,716
It's been on the news lately.
You haven't heard about it?

139
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,218
Next year, a lot of computers

140
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,930
will mistake the year 2000 for 1000
and create complete chaos.

141
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:45,931
And so?

142
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,143
They say it's going to be a huge problem.

143
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,896
It could launch nuclear missiles
and shut down power plants.

144
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,023
Money in your bank account could vanish.

145
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,566
It'll be total chaos.

146
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,652
They say it'll be the end of the world.

147
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,947
But people seem to be wishing
that it'll happen.

148
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,742
They want to see the world end.

149
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,036
-Detective Lee.
-Yes?

150
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,913
Is there anything going on?

151
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,334
Sir, actually…

152
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:16,420
I need to tell you beforehand
in case I commit a blunder.

153
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,547
-In fact, this is my first case.
-First what?

154
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,007
First murder case.

155
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,470
So I'm really nervous.
I think that's why I talked about Y2K.

156
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,765
Is that so?

157
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,517
Yes, sir.

158
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,227
So is there anything

159
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,730
you can tell me
before we survey the scene?

160
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:36,232
Any precautions to take?

161
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,611
There is one precaution.

162
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:41,987
What is it?

163
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,907
Before you arrive at the scene,

164
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,118
stay silent while driving there.

165
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,375
Okay, sir.

166
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:10,516
SEOGYEONG-DONG DISTRICT OFFICE

167
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,419
Come in.

168
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,132
Do you know the whereabouts
of the victim's husband?

169
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,801
Yes, he's on an overseas
business trip in Japan.

170
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,094
We were able to reach him.

171
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,430
But due to heavy rains,

172
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,223
Gimpo Airport has been shut down.

173
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,225
He said he could make it here tomorrow.

174
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:01,025
But how did the detective mobile unit
get assigned to this case?

175
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:04,570
-It usually takes a while for that.
-We're the mobile investigation unit now.

176
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,405
-There was a name change.
-Oh, really?

177
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:09,366
I'm certain it was called
the DMU a few months ago.

178
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:14,330
Oh, it was changed less than a month ago.
So the chief has made this a top priority.

179
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,665
He wants to make a good impression
to the commissioner.

180
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,542
That's why we came here directly.

181
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,045
Why do you always change
your unit's name? It's confusing.

182
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,338
I totally agree.

183
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,423
-But Detective Lee.
-Yes?

184
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,800
Is it hot in here? You're sweating.

185
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:31,513
Oh, really? Am I sweating?
Oh, it's raindrops.

186
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,432
-Why aren't you coming?
-Coming.

187
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,393
Well… After you, sir.

188
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,813
What? I'm about to return to the precinct.

189
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,190
-I'm very busy.
-Really?

190
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,232
Yes.

191
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,277
Gosh.

192
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,289
Do we know
where her daughter, Kyung-jin is?

193
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,916
No, not yet.

194
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,753
Is the cause of death

195
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:05,881
these stab wounds on the neck
that caused blood loss?

196
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,342
Yes, the victim has eight stab wounds

197
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:11,470
on her face and neck.

198
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,889
Show me the murder weapon.

199
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,308
We haven't found it yet.

200
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,648
Looking at the size of the wounds,

201
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:26,235
it seems that the weapon had
a short, sharp blade.

202
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,698
The purple spots on her thigh and calf

203
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,617
indicate she was dragged here
after suffering lethal injuries.

204
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:53,595
So you think the murder
was a vengeful act?

205
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,265
Yes. The killing was extremely brutal.

206
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,768
So I think that could be very likely.

207
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,187
Once her husband returns,

208
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,565
we'll be able to find out
who had a grudge against them.

209
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,774
Okay.

210
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,111
Once he arrives in the country,
I'll find out where he'll be staying.

211
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,197
But there's a more urgent matter.

212
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,159
We don't know
where the victim's daughter is.

213
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,535
What?

214
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,246
That means the daughter is in danger too.

215
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,372
I presume she is.

216
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,000
Geez.

217
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,588
I think we have to move swiftly.

218
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:30,424
The reporters are
already calling me constantly.

219
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,261
How did they find out so soon?

220
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,890
I've told you many times
that if we don't catch the killer quickly,

221
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,350
then we get pressured a lot.

222
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,984
What are you guys doing here?

223
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,320
We're sorry.

224
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,699
We were trying to boil this water.

225
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:48,001
Sir. You talk to Kyung-jin a lot, right?

226
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,628
Yes, she comes by often.

227
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,296
Which class are you in?

228
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,298
Are you in the same class with her?

229
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,717
Not me, but she is.

230
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,886
Really? Are you friends with her?

231
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,263
She's really nice.

232
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:02,516
She brings me snacks to eat.

233
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:06,436
And she also gives me
mixtapes to listen to.

234
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,900
I thought Kyung-jin was rude and mean.

235
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,279
We heard that she gives
snacks to the security guard.

236
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,572
She's really nice.

237
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,282
Hey, don't say that.

238
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,868
She says bad things about you
behind your back.

239
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:24,413
She used to get the top grades

240
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,791
but she probably hates you now
after you came out on top.

241
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:28,917
What a lunatic.

242
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,920
I heard she signed up for classes
at Lee Young-deok's Academy.

243
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,630
Do you know the story about them?

244
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,175
The reason why
Lee's Genius Academy is so popular?

245
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,510
I heard they're fully booked
for the next six months.

246
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,720
Really?

247
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,472
That academy actually

248
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,976
records all the questions
from our school exams

249
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,854
one day before the exams
and gives it to the students.

250
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,981
That's nonsense.

251
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:54,526
Lee Young-deok used to be a teacher
at our school.

252
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,112
And the teachers he worked with
are still at our school.

253
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,115
So I've been thinking.
How about we run an article

254
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,619
about Lee's Genius Academy
in next month's student broadcast?

255
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,580
How long are we going to make mixtapes?

256
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:09,416
If we run an article about that,

257
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,960
Kyung-jin might put cyanide
in our school lunch.

258
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,504
Look at you.

259
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,299
You're laughing about cyanide.

260
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:29,353
BROADCASTING ROOM

261
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,126
How are you all doing?

262
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,671
The short summer vacation is over

263
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,131
and now we have to take
the much-hated extra classes.

264
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,760
Is there a hole in the earth's atmosphere?
Why isn't this monsoon over already?

265
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,222
We might not get a chance
to dip our feet in the river

266
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:08,183
before starting extra classes like
steer heading to the market.

267
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,771
We, the Team Mix Number Five,

268
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:15,774
created mixtape No. 13 for you all

269
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:18,777
to comfort your crushed souls
through music.

270
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:23,615
We'll read a letter from a listener first

271
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,701
and then play more music.

272
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,621
"Hello. I'm in the 7th grade
in Class No. 2."

273
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,873
"My ID is 'You Scared.'"

274
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:32,874
"You Scared."

275
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,168
-"You Scared" is a funny ID.
-Hey.

276
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,254
Put in a little more effort
in writing the letters.

277
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,881
Nobody listens to the letters anyway.

278
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,592
Why do you always include them?

279
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:48,765
Gosh.

280
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,517
Who could it be?

281
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,893
Is it the security guard?

282
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,312
Who is it?

283
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,507
DO NOT DISTURB
STREAMING IN PROGRESS

284
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,790
I like mixtape No. 8.

285
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,166
Me too.

286
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,296
My niece's friends are amazing,
aren't they?

287
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:03,298
Didn't she get the top score in her grade?

288
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,011
You can come this way.

289
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:09,805
Just a minute.

290
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,352
Did you finish making tangsuyuk?

291
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:16,728
Yes. I'm almost done.

292
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,606
Then have Hwan-gyu finish it
and come out for a second.

293
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:22,275
-What is it? Let me finish this first.
-Just come quickly.

294
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,696
-Hwan-gyu.
-Okay.

295
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,830
This is my daughter.
She works at the restaurant with me.

296
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,373
Say hello.

297
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,709
This is Pastor Woo Sung-min
from Hansung Light Church.

298
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:43,130
This is Deaconess Yang,
Deacon Jo and Deacon Kim.

299
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,341
They came to our restaurant to have lunch.

300
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,343
Nice to meet you.

301
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,262
The work must be hard.

302
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,347
It's not that tough. Thank you for coming.

303
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,640
Of course, we had to come.

304
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:58,103
Deaconess Jung is devoted
to the church and volunteers a lot.

305
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:01,148
Thank you, Pastor Woo.

306
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,733
-Oh, please sit down.
-Sure.

307
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,822
We were

308
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:11,074
worried at first.

309
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,035
Our congregation was worried too.

310
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,039
There are still

311
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,792
quite a lot of people in this neighborhood

312
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,795
who have bad memories of that incident.

313
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:29,509
To be honest, how could they forget it?

314
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:33,013
I was very concerned
when you decided to continue

315
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:34,681
coming to our church.

316
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,226
But I was told that

317
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:42,355
you and your daughter have volunteered

318
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,899
a lot in the community

319
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:45,901
for the last few months.

320
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,361
Keep up the good work.

321
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:52,324
I think it's a good thing
that you two have returned to our church.

322
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,783
Oh my gosh.

323
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:57,204
Thank you for saying such kind words.

324
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:03,627
As the deaconess' daughter,
I urge you to keep volunteering.

325
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,965
And every Sunday, don't miss church.

326
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,092
You must

327
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,012
ask the Lord for forgiveness.

328
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,851
That's all you need to do.

329
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,979
You just need to start all over.

330
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,357
That is the right path.

331
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:35,951
SOOK CHINESE RESTAURANT

332
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,876
Why are you smoking again?

333
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,003
Just one cigarette.

334
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,422
It was hard, wasn't it?

335
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:52,259
Not really. It wasn't hard at all.

336
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:56,304
There are members of the church
whose children died in that incident.

337
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,309
But they're going to leave us alone

338
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,104
after we decided to settle down here.

339
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:06,398
That's a big relief.

340
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,817
We should be thankful.

341
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,447
Right.

342
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:17,200
SOOK CHINESE RESTAURANT

343
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,869
Where are you going? To pick up Jae-young?

344
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:22,914
I'll be back.

345
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,681
Whoever gave us that cassette tape

346
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,683
really spooked me.

347
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:43,601
Why?

348
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:44,811
Think about it.

349
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,023
We don't know who gave it,
but that person came to school

350
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,191
during summer vacation to deliver it.

351
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,068
This has to be a tip.

352
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,279
I'm not so sure.

353
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,323
Look.

354
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:59,868
If this tape contains recordings
of all the questions on the exam,

355
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:03,204
then we can use this
to uncover the wrongdoings.

356
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:06,708
Why are you laughing?

357
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,376
You look so excited.

358
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,005
Were you able to tell?

359
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,967
I thought the broadcasting club
would be interesting.

360
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,929
But all we do
is play classical music or Mozart

361
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,599
during lunchtime
when everyone else is eating or napping.

362
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,436
You know, I thought Mozart
was the name of a type of cheese.

363
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,021
I didn't know it was a person.

364
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:34,986
I'm forced to write fake letters
with fake stories for our broadcast.

365
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:40,575
You had no idea this is what we're doing
when I asked you to join the club, right?

366
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,411
No, I didn't.

367
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,122
You totally lied to me.

368
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,630
Bye. Let's talk later.

369
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,341
Take care.

370
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,427
-How was your day? Tough?
-No.

371
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,429
All right.

372
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:03,890
Give me your backpack.

373
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:22,367
SOOK CHINESE RESTAURANT

374
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:59,112
Is it Tuesday already?

375
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:02,031
That's right. Fried dumplings for dinner.

376
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,372
-How's the club doing?
-What?

377
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:12,625
Are you having fun with your friends
in the broadcasting club?

378
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:23,094
Unfortunately, it was an uneventful day.

379
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,220
Oh, gosh.

380
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:28,600
I have to confess something to you.

381
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,060
After much persuasion, I finally did it.

382
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,438
Ta-da.

383
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:39,486
What? You said
you wouldn't stick anything on it.

384
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:42,614
Do you know how sad you looked
when I said no to that?

385
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:45,533
Like a poor dog
that was abandoned by its owner.

386
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,410
You swayed me.

387
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:52,081
Do you like it?

388
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,836
No, I don't like it at all.

389
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,381
-Oh, really? I'll take it off then.
-No.

390
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,677
-Let me have it.
-No.

391
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:05,804
-Show it to me.
-I guess you don't like it.

392
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,264
No, I do like it.

393
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,823
LEE'S GENIUS ACADEMY

394
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,171
Why did you go alone there
at that early hour?

395
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:26,009
-What do you mean?
-The chief told me.

396
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:29,220
That you went to the murder scene
early in the morning.

397
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,389
I should have gone with you.

398
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:33,391
Why didn't you tell me?

399
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,519
I had this strange thought.

400
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:39,147
What do you mean?

401
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:43,568
On the night of the murder,
someone called the police

402
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,528
about noise coming from their house.

403
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:50,033
This was before the husband
called the police?

404
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,701
Yes.

405
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,454
But something doesn't sound right.

406
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:55,788
What?

407
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,666
I think the caller was

408
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,378
the victim's daughter who is now missing.

409
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,463
What?

410
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:07,759
Why did you think the caller could be her?

411
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:12,889
There are no signs of forced entry anyway.

412
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,849
Most murder cases are like this.

413
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,778
GYEONGCHEON GIRLS' MIDDLE SCHOOL

414
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:41,751
I'm sorry.

415
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:45,004
I'm just hearing about this incident.

416
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,006
So it's given me a sudden headache.

417
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:51,219
News about the murder
will probably be reported tomorrow.

418
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:55,014
Oh my gosh. How could this happen?

419
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:59,560
Do you know anything about Lee Kyung-jin?

420
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:03,106
Oh, she's in Class No. 3.

421
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:06,317
And she came in second place
in the last school exam.

422
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,820
We're not asking about her grades.

423
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:11,322
Do you memorize
everyone's rank in the exam?

424
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,949
Yes, up to the top five students.

425
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,785
We pay careful attention to students

426
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:18,329
who rank in the top five
from Grade 7 through Grade 9.

427
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,666
Anyway, is there
a way to keep this under wraps?

428
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:25,628
Reports of this will have an effect
on the students.

429
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,338
The scores of our students
will be impacted

430
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,174
by news reports of the murder
in their next school exam.

431
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,594
My goodness.

432
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,806
There doesn't seem to be any reason
for her to run away from home.

433
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:38,224
She had good grades too.

434
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:40,268
She never got in any trouble at school.

435
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,728
You never know.

436
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,772
What a jerk, don't you think?

437
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,649
The principal only remembers the names
of the top five.

438
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,694
Does he forget the names of students
who fall below the top five?

439
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,197
I hated taking tests.

440
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,617
I still have nightmares
of taking tests at school.

441
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,703
And in my nightmare,
I forgot which books I had to study.

442
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:01,414
So I can't answer even one question
while sweating like a pig.

443
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:04,083
It's a recurring nightmare.

444
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,794
Did something happen?

445
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:10,757
Oh, we're not able to tell you yet.

446
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,883
Oh, I see.

447
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:12,884
I'm sorry.

448
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,928
I don't what's going on,
but feel free to ask if you need my help.

449
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,347
I know everything
that goes on in the school.

450
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:21,934
Oh, sure.

451
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,062
Okay.

452
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,525
We're not like other academies.

453
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:32,987
We nurture future leaders.

454
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,114
We don't accept losers.

455
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,241
Losers can't even step through the door.

456
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:40,036
Either the parents have to be
rich enough to pay our fees

457
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,371
or the students need to be very smart.

458
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:45,792
Otherwise, we don't accept students

459
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:49,337
who don't pass either one of them.

460
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:53,758
Could you tell us about Lee Kyung-jin?

461
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:56,886
Oh, Lee Kyung-jin?

462
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:00,431
Well, she didn't have brains
or rich parents.

463
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:05,228
But she was very determined
to enroll at our academy.

464
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,647
So she's very goal-oriented.

465
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,483
She has grit and determination.

466
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,402
Who was she close with?

467
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,822
Was she friends with
the other students here?

468
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:16,739
Friends?

469
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,366
Well…

470
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,576
I'm sorry to say
but nobody makes friends here.

471
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,079
Every student is someone
you have to surpass.

472
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:26,165
We don't inquire

473
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,292
about their personal lives.

474
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,718
Hello. Are you Ms. Jo Jung-hyun?

475
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:39,887
Yes. Who are you?

476
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,848
You can't come into the kitchen.

477
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,101
I'm from Youngsung Life Insurance.

478
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,440
YOUNGSUNG LIFE INSURANCE
YOO JUNG-GIL

479
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,860
I came here to ask a few questions.

480
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:57,071
Do you know Jung Young-seob, by chance?

481
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,615
Yes, we went to high school together.

482
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,826
Have you been in contact
with him recently?

483
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,329
Well, I don't think we ever talked

484
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,540
after we graduated from high school.

485
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,501
So the reason I'm here

486
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:14,463
is because Jung Young-seop
was involved in a tragic incident.

487
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:16,591
Are you aware of it?

488
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,428
No. What kind of incident was he in?

489
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:25,016
He was discovered in an empty lot

490
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:27,560
near his home with first-degree burns.

491
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,270
According to a witness,

492
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,898
he poured paint thinner on himself

493
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,733
and attempted suicide.

494
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:42,116
This is all so sudden. I'm very confused.

495
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,785
So Young-seob was severely injured, right?

496
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:48,623
Yes, we have learned
that he is in critical condition.

497
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,334
Oh my goodness.

498
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:56,547
I came here to see you

499
00:36:56,631 --> 00:37:00,218
because a week before
he made his suicide attempt,

500
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,553
he contacted
all of his high school friends.

501
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:06,182
And he said something to all of them.

502
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,559
Do you know about that?

503
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,896
No. This is the first time
I'm hearing this.

504
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,565
What did he say?

505
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:18,569
I don't know the meaning
of his words either.

506
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:19,737
Just a second.

507
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:22,531
Here.

508
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:26,452
Young-seob mentioned your name

509
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,872
and said these exact words.

510
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,083
The family of "guru" has returned.

511
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:34,627
Guru?

512
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,379
What does that mean?

513
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,089
Until the promised hour,

514
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:41,467
the daughter of Guru
will take Guru's place.

515
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,357
Hello. I'm Jo Jae-young,
8th Grade, Class No. 3.

516
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:09,996
Don't you smell it?

517
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:12,748
What smell?

518
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,669
A very putrid smell.

519
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:17,795
Putrid?

520
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:22,174
Quit talking nonsense.
Let's get to today's agenda.

521
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:27,680
Now, sisters. Do you agree
to uncover the dirty secrets

522
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:31,183
of Lee's Genius Academy
through this tape, which was given to us

523
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,435
by an anonymous person?

524
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,689
All right.

525
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:44,405
Are you ready?

526
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,954
Hello, students.

527
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:56,208
This is Lee Young-deok
of the Genius Academy.

528
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,130
Are you paying attention

529
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:05,468
to the sound you're hearing?

530
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:11,432
This brain enhancing program
provided by our cram school

531
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:17,188
requires your full participation.

532
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:22,860
Now, try to focus on
only listening to the sound.

533
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:28,574
And focus on the image
that appears in your head.

534
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,284
What is this?

535
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,327
What do you see?

536
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,287
I thought it contained exam questions.

537
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,706
I think I know what this is.

538
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:39,377
It's those brain function
enhancing techniques they sell.

539
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,797
Gosh. What a letdown.

540
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,092
It's a relief to know it doesn't contain
any exam questions.

541
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,426
What do you mean?

542
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,804
Students are paying the academy
for these tapes.

543
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,811
That's a different matter.

544
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,647
These sounds

545
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,650
are so scary.

546
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,028
I agree.

547
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,156
It's making me feel strange.

548
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,575
It's…

549
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,453
quite frightening.

550
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,886
-Who could it be?
-Turn it off.

551
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,808
What are you kids doing here?

552
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,478
We're studying.

553
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,314
Is this place your study room?

554
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,651
I told you not to use
the broadcasting room for that purpose.

555
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:50,406
We were preparing material
for the show before school begins.

556
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,950
I don't want to hear it.
Pack your bags and go home.

557
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:55,661
Hurry!

558
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:09,800
Sir.

559
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:13,596
Mr. Lee Cheon-seok,
the father of the missing girl is coming

560
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:14,805
to cooperate with our investigation.

561
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,348
-Okay.
-Got it.

562
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,064
Are you feeling all right?

563
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,566
I don't know

564
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,194
what is going on.

565
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,362
It's like I'm in a nightmare.

566
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,031
If I had…

567
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,825
If I had only come home a minute sooner…

568
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,746
Now you need to be strong.

569
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,956
We need your cooperation

570
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,083
to help us find your daughter.

571
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,628
Okay, sir.

572
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:49,381
I heard that
you brought something with you.

573
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,050
Oh, yes.

574
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:54,345
I thought you should listen to this.

575
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,389
I don't know if it'll help,

576
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,517
but it might be relevant though.

577
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:03,771
What is on it?

578
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,024
Since I got on business trips frequently,

579
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:10,736
my daughter made this mixtape
for me to listen to.

580
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:12,488
-A mixtape?
-Yes.

581
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:13,739
What is on this?

582
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:19,245
She chooses songs
and records them onto an empty cassette.

583
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:22,039
Making mixtapes is popular at school.

584
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:23,624
That's what my daughter told me.

585
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,211
Classmates give them to
each other like giving letters.

586
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:29,964
-It's what they do for fun.
-Oh, really?

587
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:34,468
But why did you bring this to us?

588
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,136
Well, the thing is,

589
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:39,807
my daughter used to record a voice message

590
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,684
at the beginning of the tape.

591
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,770
Since I go on business trips so often,

592
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:49,817
she recorded what is going on
in her life in those messages.

593
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:51,652
But

594
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:55,739
the message she left
on the last mixtape she gave me

595
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,200
was a bit strange.

596
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:00,786
So it was bothering me a little.

597
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:02,121
That's why…

598
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:03,789
It was strange?

599
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,000
Yes.

600
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:10,170
I think you should listen to it first.

601
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,679
Aunt.

602
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:21,932
-What?
-I have something to say.

603
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,434
Oh, sorry.

604
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:32,318
Actually,

605
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,988
there's something I didn’t tell you.

606
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:38,991
What is it?

607
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:45,539
Well…

608
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:53,380
Could you

609
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:55,549
just wait for a day?

610
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:01,764
It's important to you
that I wait for a day, right?

611
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:03,349
Yes.

612
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:08,020
What about telling me something today
that you were going to tell me tomorrow?

613
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:12,524
I don't like keeping secrets

614
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:14,526
from you, Aunt.

615
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:21,283
It's okay. Everyone has secrets.

616
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:24,620
Really?

617
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:27,581
Do you have a lot of secrets
you're not telling me?

618
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:32,961
Yea, I have a lot.

619
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,297
You didn't know?

620
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:41,887
Why do you have so many secrets?

621
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,065
Hi Dad.

622
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:55,984
It's already my eighth mixtape.

623
00:44:56,068 --> 00:45:00,781
I like it that I'm able to tell you
my stories like this.

624
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,242
You can listen to my music

625
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:05,702
and I can tell you some secrets I have.

626
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,329
I do have a few.

627
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,747
Speaking of which,

628
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,250
let me tell you a secret.

629
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:14,086
You know Jo Jae-young, right?
I mentioned her once.

630
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,921
Her family runs a Chinese restaurant.

631
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:18,382
She transferred to our school last month.

632
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,259
But

633
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:24,471
I heard a shocking story about her.

634
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,682
Don't be shocked when I tell you this.

635
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:29,351
You know, Dad.

636
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,562
She's…

637
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:34,356
the daughter of Jo Kyung-ho.

638
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:38,485
You know, the man
behind the Saju station gas attack.

639
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:41,113
Isn't that shocking?

640
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:43,574
It's crazy, isn't it?

641
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,410
I go to a school

642
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:49,413
with the daughter of a mass murderer, Dad.

643
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:53,333
How is this even possible?

644
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:03,135
SAJU STATION TERRORIST ATTACK SUSPECT
JO KYUNG-HO ARRESTED

645
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:05,596
OVER 200 CASUALTIES
IN SAJU STATION GAS ATTACK

646
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:16,231
In 1987,

647
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,318
one day before the Chuseok Holiday…

648
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,363
a crazy man called Jo Kyung-ho

649
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:28,577
released nerve gas at Saju Train Station
in a terrorist attack.

650
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:33,790
He concealed
nerve gas canisters in four briefcases

651
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:38,420
and set them around the restroom
and the waiting room.

652
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,923
It was a chemical attack

653
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:43,509
using nerve gas

654
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:46,803
that was simultaneously released.

655
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,515
The train station was always crowded,

656
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:53,018
but it was compounded by the holiday.
It was the worst terrorist act

657
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:55,270
in the country

658
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,232
with over 200 casualties.

659
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:02,819
When the nerve gas
was released into the air,

660
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:05,364
there were a few people
who ran out wearing gas masks

661
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:07,032
according to witnesses.

662
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:09,993
Since there were
no security cameras back then,

663
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,830
the police didn't have
any leads on the case.

664
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:16,625
They couldn't even

665
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:19,545
compile any suspects
who could have pulled it off.

666
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:22,297
If…

667
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:25,926
Jo Kyung-ho had not turned himself in,

668
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:29,846
the case would have
arguably remained unresolved.

669
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:33,308
The investigators had no clues
whatsoever to work with.

670
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,488
It's in the report, right?

671
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,993
A week after the gas attack,

672
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,788
he walked into a police station
and confessed to the crime.

673
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:57,958
He had finished his studies in Japan

674
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,002
and about two months

675
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:03,630
upon returning to his hometown,
he committed the attack.

676
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,675
He did it against people
in his own hometown.

677
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:09,428
And you were a detective

678
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:13,849
in the violent crime division
at the time, weren't you?

679
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:15,434
Yes, that's correct.

680
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:17,436
Then you must have been
involved in the case.

681
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,813
No, I wasn't.

682
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:21,398
I had a personal matter.

683
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:23,483
I see.

684
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,613
Do you mind telling us
what the personal matter was?

685
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:37,789
My wife…

686
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,794
was one of the casualties
in the gas attack.

687
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,047
Pardon?

688
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:57,809
I'm sorry.
It happened such a long time ago

689
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,354
that it wasn't included in this report.

690
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,900
I apologize for asking you that question.

691
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,568
It's all right.

692
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,280
You're a prosecutor.
You don't have to apologize.

693
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:56,368
Oh gosh.

694
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,915
It's raining hard.

695
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:04,710
My shoes got all wet.

696
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:13,176
Thank you.

697
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,847
Did your dog sleep well last night?

698
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,641
I don't know. I didn't check.

699
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:22,644
Oh gosh. He didn't eat
his food last night.

700
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,938
So I brought some steaks for him.

701
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:27,190
By the way,

702
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,693
aren't you going to say bye to him?

703
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:33,989
You don't have to update me
when he gets sick.

704
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:36,116
Oh, okay.

705
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,493
But if he happens to die,

706
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:40,871
then give me a call.

707
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:50,672
Oh gosh.

708
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:54,676
Aly.

709
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:59,055
Did you sleep well?

710
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:00,640
Oh gosh.

711
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,934
Oh, sweetie.

712
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:14,654
Aunt.

713
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:23,538
I have to go somewhere today.
So I can't give you a ride to school.

714
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:26,082
It's because you didn't tell me
your secret yesterday.

715
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:29,002
But I'll pick you up after school.

716
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:43,058
PATIENT'S NAME: JUNG YOUNG-SEOB

717
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:55,362
Hello.

718
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:57,197
Who are you?

719
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,658
I'm a friend of Young-seob.

720
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:02,202
Oh, I see.

721
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,496
I thought you were a friend.

722
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:08,041
It must be a shock to see him like this.

723
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:12,087
Hey, so many of your friends have come.

724
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:16,091
Please open your eyes.

725
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:21,221
Please open your eyes.

726
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:42,367
Young-seob had a fiancee a few years back.

727
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,579
-It didn't work out?
-No.

728
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:47,873
She died in a car accident.

729
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:52,377
Young-seob went abroad after that.

730
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,754
He returned to Korea just a few years ago.

731
00:52:58,091 --> 00:52:59,801
I didn't know.

732
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,636
He's had a rough time.

733
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:08,768
But he called me out of the blue
a few weeks ago.

734
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:11,605
He asked if I had the school magazine
we published together.

735
00:53:12,188 --> 00:53:13,940
-School magazine?
-Yes.

736
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,525
I told him I still had it.

737
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:18,778
Then he asked me
if I could give my copy to him.

738
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:22,365
So I was supposed to meet him.

739
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:24,910
But then a few days later,
he did that to himself.

740
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,665
Did Young-seob mention anything else?

741
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:32,834
Something about "Guru?"

742
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:33,919
No.

743
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,671
Guru? What does that word mean?

744
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:39,591
Nothing.

745
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:42,093
I'd like to see the school magazine too.

746
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:43,595
You lost yours?

747
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:46,598
I don't know where I put it.

748
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:49,809
We worked so hard to publish it together.

749
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,561
And you lost it like that?

750
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:58,318
Anyway, it's nice to see you again.
Life must have been hard for you.

751
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:00,904
No.

752
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,823
You must have had a harder time.

753
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:07,369
I didn't know your mom was sick.

754
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,998
My mom is also staying at this hospital.

755
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:14,376
I come here every day.

756
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,882
I hope she'll get better soon.

757
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:22,968
Yes.

758
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:28,473
I think she'll wake up
from her coma one day.

759
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:32,227
That's what I've been hoping for
these last few years.

760
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,064
I have to try whatever I can.

761
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:38,775
Of course.

762
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:42,862
Oh, there you are.

763
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:45,323
We've been looking for you two everywhere.

764
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:46,366
What is going on?

765
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:49,911
Jung Young-seob went into shock.
He's in critical condition.

766
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,332
Bring the AED right now.

767
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:56,960
Please move aside.

768
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:04,801
-Prepare for it.
-Oh, my son…

769
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:09,222
Please save my son…

770
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:26,281
Hey, did Lee Kyung-jin miss school today?

771
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:27,365
How did you know that?

772
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:30,243
She didn't come, right? What should we do?

773
00:55:30,326 --> 00:55:32,078
I think that's true.

774
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,455
What's true?

775
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:35,832
They say she went missing.

776
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:36,916
What did you say?

777
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,461
What's scary is that…

778
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:41,713
Well,

779
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,841
I don't know if I should say this.

780
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,426
Why not? Is it something scary?

781
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,470
I'm not certain about it.

782
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:49,929
Then I don't want to hear it.

783
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:52,474
Listen to it. Just listen.

784
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:57,187
A few days ago, her mother died.

785
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:00,356
She was killed in her home.

786
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:04,069
And Kyung-jin went missing after that.

787
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:06,446
-So she could…
-Hey. Don't say anything.

788
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:07,906
It's impossible.

789
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:10,909
My uncle's friend is a police officer.

790
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:14,079
He says the police are busy
working on the case.

791
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:17,957
It might be reported on the news tomorrow.

792
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:24,089
Are you okay, Jae-young?

793
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,133
Yes.

794
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,969
I have a stomachache.

795
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,930
You do? How does it hurt?

796
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,015
I'll take you to the nurse.

797
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,350
No, I'm okay.

798
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:38,978
I need to use the restroom.

799
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,647
Go on eating your lunch.

800
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:53,701
Do you think Jae-young got shocked
by what I said?

801
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:55,662
It's not just her.

802
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:57,997
I'm scared too after hearing your story.

803
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,500
Nothing is for certain.

804
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,127
You've got a big mouth.

805
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:04,963
Why are you blaming me?
I'm just telling you what I heard.

806
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,925
Even though Kyung-jin is a mean girl,

807
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:11,845
I'm worried about her.

808
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:28,278
Are you Ms. Jo Jung-hyun?

809
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:33,116
-Yes.
-When the patient was awake,

810
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:35,160
he asked to see you.

811
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:37,078
-Me?
-Yes.

812
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:39,622
He asked about today's date.

813
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:42,709
And said the same thing over
while mentioning your name.

814
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:48,381
What did he say?

815
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:50,967
He said

816
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:52,927
you couldn't be here.

817
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:55,138
Pardon?

818
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:58,600
He said if you were here,

819
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:01,394
you'd put another person in danger.

820
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,813
That name was…

821
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:05,023
It was Cho something.

822
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:08,151
Oh, I remember now.

823
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:09,486
Jo Jae-young.

824
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:13,323
He said if you stay here,

825
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:16,451
Jo Jae-young would be in danger.

826
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:44,312
Which classroom is she in?

827
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:47,607
I don't know that.
Her name is Jo Jae-young.

828
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:49,734
Hi Hwan-gyu.

829
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:51,361
Hi Jae-young.

830
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:54,447
Do you know him?

831
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:56,449
Yes.

832
00:58:57,075 --> 00:59:00,078
Is it okay for you to be here
during class?

833
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:04,624
I'm sorry. I think there's an emergency.

834
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:05,875
Isn't that so, Hwan-gyu?

835
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,335
Yes, it is.

836
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,129
Let's go. Can you come now?

837
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:14,676
Did something happen to Aunt or Grandma?

838
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,637
Get on. I'll tell you on the way.

839
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:28,982
Aunt.

840
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:32,527
-Hello.
-Hi Moon-sook. Did you see Jae-young?

841
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:33,987
She went home early.

842
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:36,030
She didn't call you?

843
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,866
She left early? Do you know when she left?

844
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:44,747
She didn't come to class after lunch.

845
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:46,332
That's strange.

846
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,293
I heard that she got a ride
on a motorcycle.

847
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:50,920
A motorcycle? What kind of motorcycle?

848
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:54,632
She went to see the school nurse
because she had a stomachache.

849
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:58,094
Someone riding a Sook Chinese restaurant
delivery bike came to pick her up.

850
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:01,806
So I thought that was you.

851
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,229
After the first victim was found,

852
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:12,358
the victim's daughter,
Lee Kyung-jin went missing.

853
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:16,112
Exactly three days later,

854
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:19,949
Jo Jae-young went missing too.

855
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:23,494
In retrospect,

856
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,832
I think I should have thought

857
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:31,461
more about
what Lee Kyung-jin's disappearance meant

858
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:34,505
and even Jo Jae-young's missing case.

859
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:40,428
I regret that.

860
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:43,514
What do you mean?

861
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:04,202
You can be frank.

862
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:06,788
Jo Kyung-ho.

863
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,123
You and I

864
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:13,086
are sitting here talking
because of Jo Kyung-ho.

865
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:21,678
Sir, I think we should shut the door.

866
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:34,440
Can you handle this?

867
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:40,571
What I tell you next

868
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:45,993
is classified information.

869
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:03,594
Shall I begin?

870
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:07,515
You can begin anytime you want.

871
01:02:12,186 --> 01:02:13,730
Where should I start?

872
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:21,195
You can talk about what you remember
from the beginning.

873
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:22,947
The beginning?

874
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:26,868
So I guess

875
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:30,955
that would mean the day I was born?

876
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:40,631
I think we should begin talking
about Jo Jae-young.

877
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:46,262
Oh, that's what you think?
I should begin with her, Jae-young?

878
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,687
I haven't done this before.

879
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:58,608
So it could take a while
to get to the heart of the matter.

880
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:00,067
Is that okay?

881
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:04,739
You don't have to worry about anything.

882
01:03:04,822 --> 01:03:06,365
I remember every detail,

883
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,953
so you won't find it boring.

884
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,170
You can't extract anything

885
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:22,799
if you don't believe what he's saying.

886
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:25,968
But if you believe everything he says,

887
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:30,264
you'll lose your balance
at the most critical moment.

888
01:03:33,768 --> 01:03:35,353
Like I did back then.

889
01:03:38,689 --> 01:03:40,358
I heard about Jae-young

890
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:45,404
from one of the prison guards
that I talk to sometimes.

891
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:49,617
So it happened

892
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:52,537
about a week after
the news report about her was aired.

893
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:57,333
After I learned of her disappearance,

894
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,127
I waited for a week to hear
any news about her.

895
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,506
And I was given a few newspaper articles.

896
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:06,717
They were about
the ongoing search for her.

897
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:10,805
Most of it was worthless reading.

898
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,517
But I read it over and over.

899
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:19,272
I read the Saju Daily article
about her case

900
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:22,608
so many times

901
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:26,279
that it felt like

902
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:30,032
I was at the scene of the crime.

903
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:37,498
Rain falling on a forest…

904
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:42,336
Big raindrops hitting the leaves…

905
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:45,756
The wet soil…

906
01:04:47,508 --> 01:04:49,844
The sound of water hitting the stream…

907
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:59,854
But then I hear a piercing sound
that breaks the silence.

908
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,524
It's a familiar sound

909
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:06,027
but not a sound from nature.

910
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:09,071
A phone ringtone.

911
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:13,701
I imagined the discarded phone
laying on the black soil.

912
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:19,415
The police barely found the phone

913
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,627
half a day after she went missing.

914
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:27,048
I could see Jae-young's phone
getting wet in the rain.

915
01:05:32,386 --> 01:05:34,388
That's all I could think about every day.

916
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:05,753
Jae-young…

917
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:08,965
I'll give my life if I have to
in order to find her.

918
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:12,551
Could it be a serial killer
that we're dealing with?

919
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:17,473
Actually,
she said her dad still contacts her.

920
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:18,975
You have no idea.

921
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:22,144
I'm conducting a very complex experiment.

922
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:24,981
If it's okay with you,
let me listen to that tape too.

923
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:29,735
The thing I completely forgot about…

924
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:32,446
was this.

925
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:39,453
