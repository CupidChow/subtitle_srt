1
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:47,380
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:52,927
Oh, sir.

3
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,972
I didn't know
you had such a sentimental side.

4
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:57,932
Actually,

5
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:01,311
I happened to come here since it's near
the restaurant you recommended.

6
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,520
Oh, gosh.

7
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,232
I can't remember when I last came here.

8
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,401
Well, you were busy
with your career in politics.

9
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,153
That's also true.

10
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,697
It's strange

11
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,575
how I feel depressed whenever I come here.

12
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:19,287
So I hardly come near this place.

13
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,330
I'm surprised.

14
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:24,209
You're a powerful senator,
but you've also got a soft side.

15
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,461
-You think so?
-Yes, sir.

16
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:30,298
Well, thanks to you, I got to come here.

17
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:35,303
You can't deny that some people
just form an instant connection.

18
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,430
-Don't you agree with that?
-Yes, I do.

19
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,308
Speaking of which…

20
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:43,269
Well, I don't have anything
particular to discuss.

21
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,482
But you did hear about it, right?
Jo Kyung-ho escaped the institute.

22
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:52,946
Well, I thought we should talk
about that matter today.

23
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,531
I see.

24
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,829
There's a favor I'd like to ask.

25
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,248
I'll do whatever I can, sir.

26
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:05,583
It's a simple favor.

27
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:10,046
You just have to rope in Choi Hyung-in.

28
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,105
Mr. Jo Kyung-ho, did you sleep well?

29
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,733
Hope it wasn't too warm
for you last night.

30
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:34,070
I find this room to be too hot.

31
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,156
It was fine.

32
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,908
It was? You'll be moved to
a regular hospital room

33
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,412
in two days at the most
once you finish all the medical tests.

34
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,206
But you'll undergo
a battery of tests today.

35
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,624
Is that fine with you?

36
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,959
It doesn't bother me.

37
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,921
All right.
You should start having breakfast first.

38
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,592
I think the menu is quite good today.

39
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,435
Jo Kyung-ho is missing.

40
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,689
Even though he was under surveillance
for 24 hours,

41
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,275
he somehow managed to escape

42
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,235
the Institute of Forensic Psychiatry
in just three days.

43
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,460
May I ask you something?

44
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,337
Go ahead.

45
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,634
Mr. Sohn,

46
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,972
why are you asking me
about who Guru could be

47
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:27,141
after telling me that Jo Kyung-ho
has escaped from prison?

48
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,018
It doesn't make any sense.

49
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,228
I thought

50
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,855
the prosecutors have concluded

51
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:37,443
that the incidents in Saju were committed
by the Youngjin Sect.

52
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,862
In that case, naming Jung Young-seob as

53
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,490
the cult leader, Guru,
would make things so much easier.

54
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,242
As I told you before,

55
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:47,078
there are some discrepancies
that indicate Jung Young-seob

56
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,789
might not be the actual cult leader.

57
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,876
So you'd like to know the truth?

58
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,045
Is that it?

59
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,633
Of course.

60
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,101
How did Jo Kyung-ho escape?

61
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,020
What?

62
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,607
He killed three nurses.

63
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,527
One janitor,

64
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,987
and a prison guard.

65
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,197
He slashed five people.

66
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:26,576
No. There's a fourth nurse
who is in critical condition.

67
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,910
So that makes it six.

68
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,497
After committing these acts,
he simply walked out of the facility?

69
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,544
Now I have a question for you.

70
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,463
In your entire career,

71
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,924
how many criminals have you seen
who could pull this off?

72
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,384
I'm telling you again.

73
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:45,636
I met with Guru.

74
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,182
If he wasn't actually Guru,

75
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:53,770
then Guru might not be a person,
but a symbolic figure.

76
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,979
Some people

77
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,774
can exist

78
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,194
even though they don't have a name.

79
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,532
In some cases,

80
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,578
they can exist on a higher plane
than a human.

81
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,797
You're feeling very relaxed, right?

82
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:24,342
When you take it for the first time,
the symptoms can be intense.

83
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:25,968
Drink this.

84
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,013
What is it?

85
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,184
Why do you ask?
You think I put something in it?

86
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,811
It's a sports drink.

87
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,604
You'll feel much better
if you drink it now.

88
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,453
You won't feel thirsty after a while.

89
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,956
So you should drink when you can.

90
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,264
Do you have a scissor I can borrow?

91
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,767
-A scissor?
-Yes.

92
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,274
Here you are.

93
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,827
You didn't hear anything?

94
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,705
What are you talking about?

95
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,374
Anything about me.

96
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:40,793
I don't know.

97
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,921
Is there anything I'm supposed to know?

98
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,089
Tell me.

99
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:46,799
Did you?

100
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,011
Yeah, I did.

101
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,930
I heard a few things before you got here.

102
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,057
It was like a warning.

103
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,643
They told me not to get too close to you.

104
00:07:58,895 --> 00:07:59,937
And don't speak to you.

105
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,939
Then why are you behaving like this?

106
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,942
Aren't you afraid of dying?

107
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,488
I don't know.
I don't think about dying that much.

108
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,408
But I'm not afraid of you.

109
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:17,038
You're not death incarnate, you know.

110
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,332
Is that so?

111
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,793
I take that back.

112
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:27,381
Even if you're death incarnate,

113
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,217
I'd still act the same.

114
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:35,097
I would treat you just the same as
any other inmate.

115
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,684
That's the purpose of my work here.

116
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,693
Why are you smirking?

117
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,572
Just because.

118
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,575
You remind me of someone.

119
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,540
Can I ask you who that person is?

120
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,708
She's a woman who died long ago.

121
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,711
That's all.

122
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,881
She said

123
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,885
something similar to what you said.

124
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:24,146
The reason you're not afraid of death is

125
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:29,151
because you can't see it coming.

126
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:35,074
But how would you react
if the situation were to change?

127
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,372
If death were to be at your door,
waiting to strike?

128
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,129
If you…

129
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,592
were to see death…

130
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,688
right before your eyes.

131
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,322
Choi Hyung-in.

132
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,200
The first time I heard that name,

133
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,745
I saw the end of the future.

134
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,833
I saw a vision where
I was pointing the gun at my head.

135
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,251
Ever since then,

136
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,714
I see that in my mind every day.

137
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:35,885
Let me ask you again.

138
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,267
Are you afraid of death right now?

139
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,438
Are you afraid of me?

140
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:22,098
BUSAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

141
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,461
Damn it.

142
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:41,844
Jo Kyung-ho

143
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,054
is missing.

144
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:48,225
Even the prosecutors don't know
where he is.

145
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,105
-I see.
-He was last staying

146
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,441
at the Institute of Forensic Psychiatry.

147
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,236
The Institute of Forensic Psychiatry?

148
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,696
Inmates who suffer

149
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,241
a mental breakdown
are sent there sometimes.

150
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,453
Only in special cases, of course.

151
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,748
I see.

152
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,837
I don't know how he ended up there,

153
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:20,633
but I think we can find some clues
if we check out the place.

154
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,142
Are you feeling okay?

155
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:34,271
You're still recovering. I'm afraid
you're pushing yourself too hard.

156
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:52,915
No.

157
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,252
We don't have time.
Jo Kyung-ho is very dangerous.

158
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,673
We have to track him down
as soon as possible.

159
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,051
Okay.

160
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,990
Is it okay? Is nobody around?

161
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,909
Yes, I think you can come out.

162
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,923
Wow.

163
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,218
I've never been here before. It's new.

164
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,686
Shi-young.

165
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,688
What's the matter?

166
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,648
What? I'm sorry.

167
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,652
Let's head to the food storage room
in the kitchen.

168
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,905
There's a backdoor.

169
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,920
You can go through here.

170
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,429
It's too dark, isn't it?

171
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,308
Yes. Be careful.

172
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,399
It's so dark.

173
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,445
I'm sorry, Jae-young.

174
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,283
Shi-young.

175
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,578
What are you doing? Don't play games.

176
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,468
This videotape was the beginning
that led me to this place.

177
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,720
And all my life,

178
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,308
I've hung on to every word he uttered.

179
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,357
I'm the only one left

180
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,777
among my group that saw the video.

181
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,868
Do you believe, Successor?

182
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,958
Guru is coming.

183
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,962
The Day of Purification is near.

184
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:46,880
But…

185
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,384
what are you trying to do
during this important time?

186
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:55,764
Did you really think you could
slip out of this place like a mouse?

187
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,310
You broke your promise to us.

188
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,398
You are the one
who broke your promise first.

189
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,527
You told me that my aunt
would be safe if I stayed here.

190
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,654
I kept my promise.

191
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:14,992
Your aunt kept snooping around
and acted recklessly.

192
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,661
That's an excuse.

193
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,082
I can't believe anything you say anymore.

194
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:27,838
You won't believe me?

195
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,843
Why can't you believe me?

196
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,143
If you don't believe me,
then what will you do?

197
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,936
What can you do?

198
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:46,982
If it weren't for me,
you would already be dead!

199
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,736
Despite being Guru's daughter,
you're not capable of doing anything.

200
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,911
What are you planning to do with that?

201
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:02,122
I can't do anything?

202
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,584
Is that what you really think?

203
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:09,046
If something were to happen to me

204
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,590
and Guru would hear about it…

205
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,136
Who would be in trouble then?

206
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,138
Answer me.

207
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,183
Put down the knife.

208
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,310
No, I won't.

209
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,354
Until you keep your promise,
I'm not doing that.

210
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,772
What promise are you talking about?

211
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:30,651
If you ever try to hurt my aunt again
and something happens to her,

212
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,987
I'm going to leave this place.

213
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,198
If I have to,

214
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,451
I'll escape this place
by slashing my neck to kill myself.

215
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,832
Please put down the knife.

216
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,459
All right.

217
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,920
I understand, Successor.

218
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,174
I'll do as you say.

219
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,386
So please…

220
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,014
put down the knife.

221
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,331
I pity…

222
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,960
all of you.

223
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:39,511
SAJU GENERAL HOSPITAL

224
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,444
Please make it as short as possible.

225
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,572
The well-being of the patient
is most important.

226
00:19:58,655 --> 00:19:59,656
Okay.

227
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,417
Hello, Mr. Kim Hee-yeon.

228
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,837
I'm from the mobile investigation unit.

229
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,465
I have a few questions
I'd like to ask you.

230
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,008
I know it'll be hard to answer,

231
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:21,261
but if you can provide some answers,
it will be of great help.

232
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,851
We were told

233
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,521
that you were in charge of Jo Kyung-ho.

234
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:32,981
And your coworkers told me

235
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,109
you interacted with him several times.

236
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,906
If you talked with Jo Kyung-ho,

237
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,368
is there anything
you'd like to share with us?

238
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,662
Even a minor detail would be helpful.

239
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,292
Did he do anything out of the ordinary?

240
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,003
-Did he flash a light in front of you--
-Is your name

241
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,840
Choi Hyung-in?

242
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:06,598
-How did you know my name?
-He said he'd let me live

243
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:11,395
under the condition that
I send you this message.

244
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:19,444
Everything is how I said it would be.

245
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,531
I will be waiting now.

246
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,451
In the place where my daughter was born.

247
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:07,492
Detective Choi, do you have time
to talk for a minute?

248
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,537
Sure.

249
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,875
The hot chocolate here is pretty good.

250
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,668
Sure.

251
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,306
Don't let what Jo Kyung-ho said

252
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,225
bother you too much.

253
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:36,188
We just need to stick to the plan
and continue searching for your niece.

254
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,567
Right.

255
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:46,156
What could be the end of the future
that the Youngjin Sect

256
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,409
keeps talking about?

257
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,870
What on earth is it?

258
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,123
Why are they trying to draw us there?

259
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,418
To be honest,

260
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:02,714
I'd like to see what that future
will be at this point.

261
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,970
I'm sorry for saying such stupid things.

262
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,847
Not at all.

263
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,392
All right.

264
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:17,104
I'll see you here tomorrow in the morning.

265
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,730
Sorry for all this trouble.

266
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:22,192
I'll have this cast removed in a few days,
so please help me until then.

267
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:26,738
Don't mention it. I'm thankful that you
came along even though it was a day off.

268
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:29,157
I'd like to help out and drive you around.

269
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,118
Thank you.

270
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,306
Excuse me.

271
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,016
Can you send

272
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,812
a message to Shi-young?

273
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,232
He used to bring me my meals before.

274
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,486
It's not anything complicated.

275
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,865
You just have to tell him this.

276
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,120
Shi-young.

277
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,374
I'm not angry at you.

278
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:25,046
So don't feel guilty or anything
because of me.

279
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,593
I don't regret what I did.

280
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,641
And thank you so much

281
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,144
for being my friend.

282
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,912
The number you have dialed cannot be…

283
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:25,065
Do you know what the end of the future

284
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,359
means to the Youngjin Sect?

285
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,570
Do you know now?

286
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:34,074
The Day of Purification is a day

287
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:36,826
when everyone holds each other hands

288
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:40,413
and accepts an honorable death together.

289
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:44,334
Is this related to the incident
at the water purification plant?

290
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:47,796
That was just the beginning.

291
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,467
The cult representative and senior leaders

292
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,594
all want one thing.

293
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,766
They want true salvation
by participating in his future.

294
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,143
Jeez. It's…

295
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,480
It's such an outdated notion.

296
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:08,149
We're living in the 21st century.

297
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,652
But they stick to
such old-fashioned ideas.

298
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,237
So what I mean is,

299
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,865
having you come here to see me right now

300
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,743
is brilliant timing.

301
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,537
That's how I see it.

302
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,958
Since he is no longer in prison,
it'll be the beginning of

303
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,003
the Day of Purification
once he returns here.

304
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:32,507
That means your niece,
whom the cult call the "Successor,"

305
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,634
will likely die too.

306
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,599
-I'm surprised.
-About what?

307
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,604
The public doesn't know that
Jo Kyung-ho has escaped from prison,

308
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,356
but you say it so openly.

309
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,699
I found it strange.

310
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,910
I couldn't understand
why you approached me.

311
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,579
You deny it,

312
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:06,166
but you're part of the Youngjin Sect.

313
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,169
Now I think I know why.

314
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:14,424
You want to get rid of
the cult representative by using me.

315
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,427
Oh my gosh.

316
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,096
If someone were to hear that,
they'd think it's true.

317
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,932
I already told you.

318
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:26,186
I only care about what I can gain.

319
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:29,689
That's why I wanted to work together
so we could both get what we wanted.

320
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:32,025
If your heart
is not into this partnership,

321
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:34,903
then you can walk out that door anytime.

322
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:38,990
I do understand why this weighs
more heavily on you.

323
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:42,243
Who would voluntarily walk into danger?

324
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,788
If you decide to back out,

325
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,124
nobody will hold it against you.

326
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,755
I don't trust you.

327
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,177
But I'm well aware that
I don't have a choice at this point.

328
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:08,686
I'm not going to change the plan.

329
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,481
Oh really?

330
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,734
Well, that's good too.

331
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:18,405
By the way,

332
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,408
it's just out of curiosity.

333
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:23,159
What's your reason?

334
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:27,956
The situation has changed.
So once I get you inside,

335
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:31,167
I can't guarantee your safety after that.

336
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,676
Are you afraid of dying?

337
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:43,263
What kind of question is that?

338
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:45,473
Well, I'm afraid of dying.

339
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,269
It makes me sad to think about the people

340
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:53,606
I'll leave behind and how they'll mourn me

341
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,360
if I were to die.

342
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,823
That's the only reason

343
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:05,243
I'm afraid of dying.

344
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,503
You wouldn't understand.

345
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,798
You've never loved anybody

346
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,301
except yourself

347
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,555
in your entire life.

348
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,571
-Yes, Senator.
-Get my car ready.

349
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,156
I have somewhere to go with a guest.

350
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,451
Let's hurry before it rains harder.

351
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,254
Wait, Mom!

352
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:55,520
Mister, are you all right?

353
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,397
Where are you going?

354
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,816
We're heading into town.

355
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:06,739
There won't be much to look at
since it's raining.

356
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:11,411
If you change your mind, tell me.

357
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:13,997
I can drop you off at the bus terminal.

358
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,915
No, it's fine.

359
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,210
Please drop me off
at that place I told you earlier.

360
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,546
You can dry yourself with this.

361
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,686
Mister, you're a security guard, right?

362
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,689
I could tell because of your hat.

363
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,317
I'm good at guessing someone's job.

364
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:46,738
Seok-hyun, sit properly.
Don't bother him with questions.

365
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,867
Mister, where do you live?

366
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,827
I don't know.

367
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,120
Where is your home?

368
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:55,622
My home?

369
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,919
I don't have a home.

370
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,420
You don't have a home?

371
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,715
-Why not?
-Seok-hyun, that's enough.

372
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,675
I told you not to bother him.

373
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,887
Oh, it's fine.

374
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,514
He likes asking questions to people.

375
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,350
You don't have to answer each of them.

376
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,561
I never had a home.

377
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,271
What about your family?

378
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,190
My family?

379
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:27,111
So family and a home
are very important to you it seems.

380
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,280
Yes. Isn't it important to you, too?

381
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,950
I don't know.

382
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:35,662
All the people I knew have disappeared.

383
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:36,871
Disappeared?

384
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:38,915
Where did they go?

385
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:40,792
Well, it's always like that.

386
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,169
Once I know someone, they disappear.

387
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,505
You said that you wanted to get off

388
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:48,299
before we took a turn
to the market, right?

389
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,385
Yes.

390
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:53,096
I think we'll arrive there soon.

391
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,890
Seok-hyun, now that's enough. Listen.

392
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:57,475
Okay.

393
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:06,359
-Do you know how to whistle?
-Whistle?

394
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:08,277
I could whistle if you want to hear it.

395
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:10,029
Yes. Please whistle for me.

396
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,448
Mister.

397
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:18,371
You're actually looking
for your family, aren't you?

398
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,331
Right?

399
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:25,378
I really hope you'll find your family.

400
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:31,676
I won't ask you any more questions
so please whistle.

401
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,143
-No.
-What?

402
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:41,894
Why not?

403
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,857
You won't whistle because I kept
bothering you with questions?

404
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,900
I changed my mind.

405
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:50,778
Here.

406
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,259
Bye mister.

407
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,182
Did Professor Jang

408
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,559
send it, by any chance?

409
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,270
Yes. Are you Mr. Lee?

410
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:25,521
Yes.

411
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,608
You're new. There was another person
who usually came.

412
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:31,319
The professor sent this.

413
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:32,862
Oh, I see.

414
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,520
Help!

415
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,605
Help! Is anyone out there?

416
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:50,982
Help!

417
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:53,776
Open the door! Help!

418
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,986
Help!

419
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,973
Help!

420
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:27,059
There's a person in here! Open this door!

421
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,145
Help!

422
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,606
Help! Is anyone there?

423
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,400
There's a person in here.
Please open the door!

424
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,527
Help!

425
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,870
Who are you?

426
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,915
Oh, you're the detective, right?

427
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,754
But she wouldn't forget
something like that.

428
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,757
I wonder why she didn't call you first?

429
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,136
Hey Jung-hyun.

430
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,639
Are you still sleeping?

431
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,737
TO MOM AND DETECTIVE CHOI

432
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:08,869
Mom.

433
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:10,579
I'm sorry.

434
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,874
There's not a lot of time left

435
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,294
and this is the only way I can think of
that can stop this.

436
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:19,588
I've always been proud of you.

437
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,301
You're my hero.

438
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,637
Forgive me for not being
more honest with you.

439
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:28,931
Mom.

440
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:31,892
I have one favor to ask.

441
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:37,398
Please give this letter
to Detective Choi Hyung-in.

442
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,445
You have to give him the address
I wrote down here.

443
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,407
I'm sorry and I appreciate
all you've done.

444
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:50,745
Please tell the detective
that I'll leave the rest to him.

445
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,873
And tell him to

446
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:57,209
take good care of Jae-young.

447
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,816
You're not going to jump, are you?

448
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:25,654
This place has been my secret spot
for ten years.

449
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,740
Don't do anything crazy.

450
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,037
If you're going to commit suicide,
do it somewhere else.

451
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,124
You're a funny-looking guy.

452
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:41,128
Would you like some coffee?

453
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,419
Who is it?

454
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:27,299
-What?
-Mr. Lee.

455
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:28,759
What are you doing here?

456
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:32,263
Come inside first. It's raining.

457
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:46,735
My place is a mess.

458
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:50,531
This is how old people live.

459
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,909
Did you come here
after talking to Professor Jang?

460
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,327
Have a seat.

461
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:58,539
Have some tea while you're here.

462
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:04,795
I was making some

463
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,465
for myself.

464
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,147
Oh, did you come

465
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,650
to talk about Kim Hwan-gyu?

466
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:28,694
Then get straight to the point.

467
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,405
I don't have

468
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,617
much to say about it.

469
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:41,624
I was about to call my grandson
and ask him to visit me.

470
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:45,836
I didn't come to talk about him.

471
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:47,755
Really?

472
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,548
Then why are you here?

473
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,092
How did you know my address?

474
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,929
You mentioned someone
called Professor Jang.

475
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,556
Is he the person
who belongs to the Skull Gang?

476
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,493
You know…

477
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:21,330
what people call me, don't you?

478
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,457
The Human Butcher.

479
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:27,753
I dedicated myself to my country
as a civil servant.

480
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:30,839
And that's the kind of treatment I get.

481
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:31,757
But one day,

482
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:35,719
he appeared before me.

483
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:40,266
And he said he would erase my past.

484
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:41,892
He let me resume

485
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:45,104
a normal life.

486
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,315
I've never seen him in person.

487
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:52,945
Through Professor Jang,
he would speak to me.

488
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:56,740
Guru.

489
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:00,035
Do you call him by that name too?

490
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:03,914
Tell me now.

491
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,584
Why did you come here?

492
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:12,256
Where are you from?

493
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:15,759
You don't seem to be from this area.

494
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,974
Well, that's not important.

495
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:27,229
I used to be a workaholic
when I was young.

496
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,190
But now that I'm older, I've lost my way.

497
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:33,402
After my wife died, life became so empty.

498
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:36,405
I regret working so hard before.
What was it all for?

499
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:40,284
Do you have any children?

500
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,455
Yes, I have a son.

501
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,292
He's sleeping over there.

502
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,587
It's no fun here.

503
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:54,089
But he always tags along
and keeps me company.

504
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:55,841
I appreciate it.

505
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,719
This spot is really nice, you see.

506
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:02,640
You can't catch much fish here.
So nobody comes here.

507
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:07,144
It's the perfect place

508
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:09,188
to just talk with my son.

509
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,568
No.

510
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,112
You had two more kids.

511
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:23,118
What? What are you talking about?

512
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:29,124
A son and a daughter.

513
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:34,922
You sold your kids
to the One Family Welfare Center.

514
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,849
I was told that the person I'm looking for

515
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,560
would be here.

516
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:51,021
They didn't say
anyone would be visiting me today.

517
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:52,356
Really?

518
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,401
That could mean you or Professor Jang

519
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:57,736
is hiding something.

520
00:44:58,445 --> 00:44:59,488
Pardon?

521
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:02,366
What are you trying to say?

522
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,543
Is there any chance that

523
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:15,045
the videotape is inside your VCR player?

524
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:18,590
A white wall. Red circle.

525
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:20,676
And a woman walking upside down.

526
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:27,141
Did you watch it right before I came?

527
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,476
What if I did?

528
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,104
Is it important?

529
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:45,492
Now listen carefully.

530
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:49,121
This Professor Jang no longer has
any use for you.

531
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:51,123
That's why he sent you a video to watch.

532
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:54,793
Now that you've watched that video,

533
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,838
you will not be of sane mind
if my hunch is correct.

534
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,590
I'm telling you that you could die.

535
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:12,269
This is the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard in my life.

536
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:16,273
Do you expect me to believe
what you just said?

537
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:17,524
I don't care if you believe me or not.

538
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:21,695
Whether you die or not is not my concern.

539
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:25,324
But if you cooperate with me,
I can help you.

540
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:26,575
I can prevent

541
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:28,744
the worst from happening.

542
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:34,666
There's no time.

543
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,335
You have to decide now.

544
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,463
Either answer my questions truthfully
and save your life

545
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:42,674
or die a dog's death according
to Guru's grand vision.

546
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,473
Are you hiding something behind the shelf?

547
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:53,936
You're a book lover.
So you wouldn't use a book like that.

548
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:56,438
You would've stacked
more books there instead.

549
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:57,940
But if you were to do that,

550
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:01,527
it would be a hassle to remove them
to access what's behind it.

551
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:02,945
Are you holding Jo Jae-young

552
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:06,240
captive behind that wall?

553
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:11,161
Damn it.

554
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:15,666
I should've burned down this house
when I had the chance.

555
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:16,750
Answer my question!

556
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:19,962
I'm an artist, you know.

557
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:24,132
I can extract the truth out of people.

558
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:26,510
You think it's easy to kill me?

559
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:27,469
Wait.

560
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:29,846
So you can see her now.

561
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,557
-What?
-That woman.

562
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,773
You can see her, right?

563
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:49,658
What did you do to me?

564
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:52,119
Answer me! Are you holding
Jo Jae-young captive?

565
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:54,204
That's a lie. It's all a lie.

566
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:56,081
-Answer me!
-He would never do that.

567
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:59,793
He would never get rid of me. Because…

568
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:01,878
I've been chosen!

569
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:05,465
Damn it.

570
00:48:58,393 --> 00:48:59,728
Detective.

571
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,398
Could you tell me your name?

572
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:28,590
Did you know this?

573
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:33,261
Even in that hellish
One Family Welfare Center,

574
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:35,931
we were the only ones there

575
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:42,312
who were sold by their own parents.

576
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,358
You're a really pathetic human.

577
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,153
You made such a foolish decision.

578
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:54,241
I'm sorry.

579
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,870
I had lost my mind back then.

580
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,040
I had gone crazy.

581
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:08,880
How could I have done that to you?

582
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,886
No, you're wrong.

583
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:18,390
That's not my point, stupid.

584
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,730
Why did you sell us?
You should've killed us instead.

585
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,859
First, me. And then my sister.

586
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,572
After killing us by strangulation,

587
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:36,533
you should have buried us
in a remote area.

588
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,121
Your pathetic decision…

589
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,292
brought you to this place.

590
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:58,722
From now on,
you can't die even if you want to.

591
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,668
I'll ask you one last question.

592
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,004
Human Butcher.

593
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,257
Did you ever regret what you did?

594
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:40,764
If… If I had any regrets,

595
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:44,267
would that change anything?

596
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:48,605
Would that bring back to life
the people I killed?

597
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:52,692
You think you're any different from me?

598
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:56,279
Just because you can't remember
what you did

599
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:59,950
doesn't make you different from me.

600
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:27,853
This is the only way.

601
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,355
At least

602
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:35,318
you won't be able to kill your grandson
with your own hands if I cripple you.

603
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:38,864
Don't close your eyes!

604
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:41,366
Your sin

605
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,286
has come to bite back.

606
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,435
Oh, look at how savage they are.

607
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,228
Look at what they're doing.

608
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:12,355
Should I pull over?

609
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:14,691
Of course. What did we do wrong?

610
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:15,942
I'm sorry.

611
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:19,529
Did you hand the tape to Mr. Lee?

612
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,531
Yes, I delivered it to him.

613
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:23,617
All right.

614
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:42,385
Why are you making such a commotion?

615
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:45,513
This won't change
what's already been decided.

616
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:53,146
How dare you go against his decision!

617
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:57,067
Have you forgotten who is Guru? Have you?

618
00:53:58,276 --> 00:53:59,486
Escort her now!

619
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:03,823
You're heretics!

620
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,158
She's a fake.

621
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,914
-No!
-She's a fake! Don't let them in.

622
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:14,292
-Don't let them in!
-Who do you think you are?

623
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:17,337
-She's not real!
-Don't let her in!

624
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,678
-What is this?
-What?

625
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:33,436
They couldn't even carry out the plan
at the water purification plant properly.

626
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,106
How could they be so arrogant?
Those worthless bastards.

627
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,649
-Please enter now.
-Okay.

628
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:24,612
-Don't be afraid. I'm…
-I know you.

629
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:29,492
-What?
-I know who you are.

630
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:53,183
Let's get out of here fast.

631
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,770
-Stop it!
-You can't enter!

632
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,480
-What are you doing?
-No way!

633
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:01,066
Oh gosh!

634
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,611
Open the door!

635
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:09,657
What the hell? Did you not hear me?

636
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,367
Where is the key?

637
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:13,912
Please calm down, Master.
You must not do this.

638
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:16,539
-Let go off my collar.
-You've gone crazy.

639
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:21,461
Why those…

640
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:25,757
-Stop it already!
-No, she's not the real one!

641
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:28,426
That's…

642
00:56:55,411 --> 00:56:56,746
Thank you.

643
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,624
Thank you.

644
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:07,257
Grandma.

645
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:12,637
Don't cry.

646
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:19,644
I'm so sorry.

647
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:22,689
I wanted to protect Aunt Jung-hyun.

648
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:25,316
But I couldn't.

649
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:35,201
SOOK CHINESE RESTAURANT

650
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:02,145
It's quite amazing, right?

651
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:06,232
Maybe it's because you were wearing that.

652
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:09,402
The followers were cowering in fear.

653
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:12,739
So does it feel real now?

654
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,574
You're the new Successor.

655
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:17,285
So this is

656
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,038
where Jae-young was kept.

657
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:22,540
She was trapped here

658
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,169
the whole time.

659
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:33,426
Maybe things have finally returned to

660
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:36,804
how they should be now.

661
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:42,894
Even if I try to forget it.

662
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:48,816
It started…

663
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:52,153
with us.

664
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:02,455
You think you're any different from me?

665
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,541
Just because you can't remember
what you did

666
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:07,961
doesn't make you different from me.

667
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:13,091
We have to cover up the incidents
that were revealed by the escapees

668
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:15,593
from the welfare center
by blaming it on the manager, Jo Kyung-ho.

669
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:16,761
Understand?

670
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,494
Gosh.

671
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,464
Hey.

672
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:57,302
Do you feel anything?

673
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:01,014
When you're upside down,
does your perspective change?

674
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:04,892
Like a philosophical enlightenment
or something?

675
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:08,271
We've got mountains of evidence

676
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:10,815
regarding the despicable things
you did to the orphans

677
01:00:10,898 --> 01:00:12,650
at the One Family Welfare Center.

678
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,864
Abduction, illegal confinement, abuse…

679
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:22,410
You even buried kids
who were beaten to death in the hills.

680
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:25,288
What kind of person does that?

681
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:32,754
-Hey Kiddo, close the door.
-Okay.

682
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:35,506
All the staff said
you were the supervisor.

683
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:37,759
We have witness testimonies.

684
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:39,010
Mr. Jo Kyung-ho.

685
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:41,012
Answer the question!

686
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,097
Manager Jo Kyung-ho!

687
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:48,436
Oh boy. Let's get this interrogation done.

688
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:50,313
Okay?

689
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:28,411
-Why did you want to come here?
-Jo Kyung-ho.

690
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:30,955
We finished all the preparations.

691
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:33,249
He said he would tell me about my mom.

692
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:36,794
It's time to return home.

693
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:41,424
It could help me find out
where my aunt could be right now.

694
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,426
Do you really believe

695
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:46,179
that this is worth
sacrificing your life for?

696
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,930
So Jo Kyung-ho

697
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:50,099
has always wanted me to realize it.

698
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:52,727
I keep seeing your demise.

699
01:02:55,104 --> 01:03:00,109
