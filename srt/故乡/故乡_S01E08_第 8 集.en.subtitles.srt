1
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,921
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:47,839
YEAR 1985

3
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,257
Hey, are you heading home?

4
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,009
Yes, sir. See you tomorrow.

5
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:53,595
Hey, take this with you.

6
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:54,846
What is it, sir?

7
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:57,849
It's tree sap water from a painted maple.
My wife brought it.

8
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:01,478
You moved here with your wife
while she's pregnant.

9
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,897
So that must have been tough.
Especially during her first trimester.

10
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,066
Thank you.

11
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:10,695
The chief has been telling me
to make sure you're settling in well.

12
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,656
Hey, do you have connections
with the CIA or something?

13
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,410
Hey, I'm just joking.

14
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,412
Here. Gosh. This is heavy.

15
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,414
It's heavy. Oh boy.

16
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:35,595
You're home.

17
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,890
-What are you doing in the dark?
-Hi.

18
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,935
What's the matter? Did something happen?

19
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:46,314
-By the way, the captain…
-Honey. Could you sit down for a minute?

20
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:55,490
What's going on?

21
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,495
Someone came to visit us.

22
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:03,414
Who? We just moved here.

23
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:04,874
He's someone

24
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,877
I knew from the One Family Welfare Center.

25
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,088
I was close to him and his sister.

26
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,298
He came over.

27
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,925
Oh, really?

28
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,554
You probably haven't seen him
in years, then.

29
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,098
-Right.
-So why did he come by?

30
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,521
He said he always wondered
how I was doing.

31
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,857
And he knew that I've been living in Seoul

32
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,900
after getting married. Also, he knows that

33
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,028
I had just moved back here.

34
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,116
He then said…

35
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,620
he knew

36
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:45,373
how much

37
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,585
I despised

38
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,213
my dad.

39
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,718
He knew what my dad had done
at the welfare center

40
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:59,345
and how I was trying to get as far away

41
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,182
as I could from my dad.

42
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,230
Really?

43
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,152
I don't know what to say.

44
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,448
Why is he bringing that up now?

45
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,075
No.

46
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,119
He mentioned it before.

47
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,080
So you know, Honey.

48
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,460
Can I ask you something?

49
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,545
Promise me

50
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,466
that you'll tell me the truth.

51
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,678
I will.

52
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,805
What's the question?

53
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,810
You really don't remember anything…

54
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,274
after the car accident, right?

55
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,442
What?

56
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,070
What kind of question is that?

57
00:03:57,153 --> 00:04:00,698
You said you can't remember at all
what you did in Seoul.

58
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,704
Can I trust you when you say that?

59
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,054
So her death

60
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,557
wasn't in vain.

61
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,396
She had a baby before she died.

62
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,524
To start

63
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,818
a new life with me

64
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,404
and to usher in a new beginning.

65
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:43,992
Understand?

66
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,619
It wasn't you.

67
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,206
I was the one she loved in the end.

68
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,077
What the hell is this?

69
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,282
I fell asleep on the couch.

70
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,370
You're not going to bed? It's late.

71
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,704
Go ahead.

72
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,582
All right. I'm going to sleep.

73
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:02,130
Turn on the lights when you watch TV.
It's bad for your eyes.

74
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,300
Who is that woman?

75
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,699
Geez!

76
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,381
Honey, get inside!

77
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,143
5 MINUTES A DAY, MOTHER'S VOICE

78
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,931
Yes, Captain.

79
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,518
Go ahead. I was already awake.

80
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:46,604
What?

81
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,190
What do you mean?

82
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:53,736
Hold on a minute.

83
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,554
This is the house!

84
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,558
-Move!
-I came first!

85
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,227
Can you come out?

86
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,902
Kim Hwan-gyu went straight to the press
and told them you tortured him.

87
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,279
These photos are doctored.

88
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:39,782
We didn't inflict the injuries
in this photo.

89
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,868
The press isn't putting
pressure on us yet.

90
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,288
But we can't just sweep
this under the rug.

91
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,915
It's not a light matter.

92
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,086
I knew this could happen
when I did what I did.

93
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,090
I could have delayed the article
if I had known about it beforehand.

94
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,967
Seeing how they released it stealthily,

95
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,053
I'm sure Kim Hwan-gyu
couldn't have pulled this off by himself.

96
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,055
Someone has his back.

97
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:07,351
So take a break for two weeks.
Clear your head.

98
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,812
That's the best course of action.

99
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:15,067
Can you give me a few more days?
I just met Jo Kyung-ho yesterday.

100
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,235
I can't.

101
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,113
Don't make me fire you.
It can come to that.

102
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,615
You know how serious this is.

103
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,743
He won't stop. There'll be more victims.

104
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,371
You're not making any sense, damn it.

105
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,457
Look at you. You're doing police work.

106
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:33,127
Why are you taking this so personally?
Why are you going off the rails?

107
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,930
You know what you have to do, right?
I'm going to get a cup of coffee.

108
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,349
So leave your badge and gun on my desk.

109
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,009
HYUNG-IN. SAJU APT., UNIT 103,
SUITE 704. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

110
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:28,349
HYUNG-IN. SAJU APT., UNIT 103,
SUITE 704. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

111
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,520
Sir.

112
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,522
You have a guest.

113
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,401
Oh my.

114
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,238
Did you have any trouble
finding my office?

115
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,494
We took that photo
during your farewell ceremony.

116
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,120
You don't remember it, do you?

117
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,668
All the staff members cried that day.

118
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,670
They were sad to see you go.

119
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,215
-That's a lie.
-What?

120
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,635
Everybody knows about
the rampant abuse that went on

121
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,637
at the One Family Welfare Center.

122
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,098
That's a gross misrepresentation.

123
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,684
For political reasons,

124
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:14,728
a lot of the facts about
the welfare center were misconstrued.

125
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,314
So how were we able to leave the center?

126
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,149
That bastard and me.

127
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,736
Kids weren't allowed to leave
that facility even if they wanted to.

128
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,658
There was a nice married couple
who worked in the cafeteria

129
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,578
at the welfare center.

130
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,831
Unfortunately, they weren't
able to have kids.

131
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:37,835
They were very fond of you,
Ms. Jo Jung-hyun.

132
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:42,172
So they said they wanted to adopt you.

133
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:45,259
That's Ms. Jung Kyung-sook
and her husband.

134
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,679
Thanks to the welfare center,

135
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,932
you were able to meet them,

136
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:55,561
and have a family of your own.

137
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,937
Not that story.

138
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,775
I'm asking you about the real reason

139
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,111
we were able to escape from the facility.

140
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,089
Oh gosh. This is so sudden.

141
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,468
How did this conversation
take a sudden turn?

142
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,554
I'm the one who invited you here.

143
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,724
How come you're asking
more questions than me, Ms. Jo?

144
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:34,850
That's odd.

145
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,561
That's not right.

146
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,730
It's completely unfair.

147
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:44,318
Let's stop wasting time
since we're both busy people.

148
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,738
I'll get straight to the point.
I have a straightforward demand.

149
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:50,866
Ms. Jo, stop snooping around.

150
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,663
You're tracing past events
after discovering the 1987 magazine issue.

151
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,289
I want you to stop that.

152
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:00,960
Until I find Jae-young, I won't stop.

153
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,002
You won't?

154
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,759
I knew you would say no.

155
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,263
Speaking of which…

156
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,058
How about this?

157
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:19,436
I'm willing to
help you find your niece, Ms. Jo.

158
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,567
What are you talking about?

159
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:27,945
You're…

160
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,531
part of the cult too.

161
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,160
Oh my gosh.

162
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,497
Life isn't so simple, is it?

163
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:42,209
That's why you're here talking to me.

164
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,503
I'm talking about opening
new opportunities for both of us.

165
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,757
What's going on?

166
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,051
Old lady. Come here.

167
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,430
What happened?

168
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,099
Who are you?

169
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,560
Which department are you from?

170
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,561
Well…

171
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,772
Hello Detective Choi.

172
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,860
The MIU said they were on their way.
You got here fast.

173
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,737
I was in the area,
so I came straight here.

174
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,947
-Can I go in?
-Sure. Go ahead.

175
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,158
-This way.
-How could this happen?

176
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,880
-Did a team sweep the place already?
-No, we're the first to come.

177
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,174
The crime scene is untouched.

178
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,924
Oh my goodness. How terrible.

179
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,428
Oh my goodness.

180
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,645
FORENSIC INVESTIGATION

181
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,489
All hell will break loose soon.

182
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,451
These cult members are lunatics.

183
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,579
They're going to commit extreme acts.

184
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,997
What kind of acts?

185
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,793
You understand that
I can't tell you the specifics, right?

186
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,547
But I can tell you this.

187
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,133
The end of the future.

188
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,635
That day is coming.

189
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,472
They'll commit another attack
like the one in 1987.

190
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,350
Only those who are purified

191
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,644
can see that day together.

192
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,402
It's completely crazy.

193
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,864
I can't give you the details about it.

194
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:20,826
But it's a total waste of time
and energy. Worthless.

195
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,371
So what are you trying to tell me?

196
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,668
So… You need to…

197
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:34,840
keep your distance
from them and just observe.

198
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:49,104
I'm upset over the senseless things
they're doing.

199
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,649
I'm sure he would not approve of

200
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,652
what is going on right now in the cult.

201
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,740
So…

202
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,535
I'm planning to flip the script.

203
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:08,332
And I need your help to do that, Ms. Jo.

204
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,668
I'll keep my promise.

205
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,046
If you agree to cooperate with me,

206
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,883
I'll make sure that
Jae-young is returned to her home.

207
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,885
Do you understand?

208
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,264
How can I trust you?

209
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,610
What is

210
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,864
most important to you right now,
Ms. Jo? Think about that.

211
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,617
Besides that,

212
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,870
nothing else matters to you, right?

213
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:50,958
Sail that doesn't bend…

214
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,087
break in the storm, you know.

215
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,014
I'm not here to talk about anything else.

216
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,309
You need to know what really happened to
to Associate Professor Kim, don't you?

217
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,561
Please leave.
I don't want to hear it right now.

218
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,022
Professor!

219
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,899
Why are you suddenly being like this?

220
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,776
Do you really have to ask?

221
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:20,153
I read the article about you
in the morning paper.

222
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,782
How can I continue working with
someone like you?

223
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:27,369
I'll send the interview files
separately to the precinct.

224
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,787
So please leave.

225
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,937
Why is that car honking?
It's hurting my ears.

226
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,148
I'm getting a massive headache.

227
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,859
And why is General Affairs telling me
to get rid of it?

228
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:02,279
They don't even know what it is.

229
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,510
Yes? This is Koo Byung-min.

230
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,929
Oh, Dr. Ahn. You're here?

231
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:31,224
I'll meet you at the parking lot
right away.

232
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,741
-Yes!
-Why didn't you go easy on me?

233
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,451
You lost so no complaining.

234
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,161
Next.

235
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,456
Oh, it's your first day, isn't it?

236
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,459
I like your spirit. Get ready.

237
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,048
Oh, hi. Just a minute.

238
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,222
You're so mean.

239
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,807
Tough luck. You lost.

240
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,142
You're all doing poorly.

241
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,856
The kids sure have a good appetite.

242
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:24,444
Only a few of them are taking judo classes
because they like it.

243
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:29,241
Their parents are forcing them
to learn judo. So they're unhappy.

244
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,868
On the day
I'm their substitute instructor,

245
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,620
we always have pizza.

246
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,330
Let's eat fast and get going.

247
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:37,499
Pig will be here soon too.

248
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,877
-Yong-tak.
-Yes?

249
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,546
How about we don't go there today?

250
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,715
What? Why not?

251
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:50,011
I'm starting to see things clearer now.

252
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:52,931
This is my personal matter.

253
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,601
And I need to solve it myself.

254
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,021
I keep having such thoughts.

255
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,482
No way. That's not true.

256
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,527
You only think about yourself, right?

257
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,113
I'm also curious.

258
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,866
I want to see with my own two eyes

259
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,909
what really happened to us.

260
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,037
You think so?

261
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,040
I lost my appetite.

262
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:20,750
Darn it.

263
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,629
Didn't you say so yourself?

264
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,715
Being completely honest is the best way.

265
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,259
So it's okay to be a nuisance
and stir up some trouble.

266
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:33,263
You think you're going to get a medal
for going alone?

267
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,348
Darn it.

268
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:39,936
Eat your pizza, okay?

269
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,340
Let me shake your hand.
It's been a long time.

270
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:10,842
There's no need for that.

271
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,013
Hey, my arm is starting to hurt.

272
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,605
Do you drink less now?

273
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,234
You're in bad shape.

274
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,778
Have you started to drink again?

275
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:32,864
No alcohol

276
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:35,283
has touched my lips lately.

277
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,244
I don't have time to drink either.

278
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:38,787
That's good to hear.

279
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,957
Ten years have already passed
since those days.

280
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,834
You would come to our church while drunk.

281
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,503
And you told us to open the door.

282
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:49,130
Once you were inside,
you wouldn't pray though.

283
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:52,968
You'd just sit in a pew and then leave.

284
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,219
I'm sorry.

285
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,179
It was

286
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,057
so rude of me to act like that.

287
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:00,809
No.

288
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:04,312
It wasn't only you. Others acted the same.

289
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,898
I later found out they were the people

290
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,901
who had lost loved ones
in the 1987 attack.

291
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,363
You're going to stay for the night, right?

292
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:17,659
We still have the room
you used to sleep in.

293
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,911
Oh, I forgot.

294
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,414
We also provide an electric blanket.

295
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:26,418
And there are more blankets to go around.
It's as cozy as any hotel room.

296
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,964
No, I really can't. I just dropped by.

297
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,090
Don't refuse.

298
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:33,925
Stay for the night.

299
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:37,095
It's all right, Hyung-in.

300
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,639
It's okay.

301
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,518
You're here.

302
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:04,372
This is Dr. Ahn Min-chul.

303
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:07,876
He works in the psychiatric
department at Saju Hospital.

304
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,545
Nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

305
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,505
Okay. Let's begin.

306
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:18,219
Could you please answer
this questionnaire?

307
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,682
Dr. Ahn, you can begin.

308
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,436
While you answer the questionnaire,

309
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,938
you can answer the doctor's questions.

310
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,744
Oh gosh. The new prison warden

311
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,288
seems to be very interested
in our sessions.

312
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,584
This will be over very quickly
if you follow the procedure.

313
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,419
Mr. Jo Kyung-ho,

314
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,757
I shall start asking you a few questions.

315
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,969
Are you taking any medication?

316
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:04,516
Were you administered any antidepressants

317
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,727
or tranquilizers
during your incarceration…

318
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:13,274
Tomorrow is the anniversary
of your wife's death, isn't it?

319
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,735
Will you be having
a memorial service tomorrow?

320
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,237
Yes, I have to.

321
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:21,408
It's a gathering of the victims' families
and they look forward to it.

322
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:24,202
I think it's become
the most important church event we hold.

323
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,995
Well, that's not the case for me

324
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,206
anymore.

325
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:33,128
I completely forgot that tomorrow
was the day my wife died years ago.

326
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:36,673
I've been frantically searching
for clues everywhere.

327
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:39,175
But I screwed it up each time.

328
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:42,846
There's a person I know

329
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,390
who's been doing that too.

330
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,728
You know Jo Jung-hyun, right?

331
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,398
She recently came to our church.

332
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:58,903
She asked my congregation to be
merciful and gracious to her family.

333
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:02,532
But I told Jung-hyun

334
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,911
to please leave this town.

335
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,123
It would be the best for everyone
if she did.

336
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,960
I don't regret saying that to her.

337
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:18,214
But I can't forget the look on her face

338
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,050
when she looked back at me.

339
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,178
Is that what you meant?

340
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,055
That you’re similar to me?

341
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:27,640
Oh, come on.

342
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,269
I'm a slightly better person
than you, aren't I?

343
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,523
Hi.

344
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,442
All right.

345
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,069
That's your roommate.

346
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:43,072
You'll be sharing the room with him.

347
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,285
His parents were members
of my congregation.

348
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,204
They were good people.

349
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,957
According to him,

350
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,669
his parents suddenly began acting weird
after watching some videotape.

351
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:01,758
His parents are hardly home nowadays.

352
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:06,095
So he's boarding at our church.

353
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,557
A videotape?

354
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:20,026
Hey kid. Which drink is the best one?

355
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,570
They all taste bad except
for the chocolate one.

356
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,406
-Pardon?
-Only the chocolate drink is good.

357
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,991
Oh, is that so?

358
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,332
That's a tennis ball.

359
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,334
Did you know that?

360
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:38,545
It's all right.

361
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,421
Throwing a baseball makes my hand hurt.

362
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,051
How long have you been
using this glove? It's so worn.

363
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,094
No wonder your hands were hurting.

364
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,349
I should've gotten
Job's tears tea instead.

365
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,855
Pastor Woo told me about your parents.

366
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,357
Something happened recently, right?

367
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,863
Could you show me that videotape?

368
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,409
-You said you're a detective.
-Yes, I still am.

369
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,703
If you promise me one thing,
I'll show it to you.

370
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,539
What kind of promise?

371
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,920
That you won't arrest my mom and dad.

372
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:23,673
They didn't do anything wrong.

373
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,260
Okay. I promise.

374
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,554
Youngjin Brain Study Science.

375
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:33,474
-What is that?
-That’s what it said on the van.

376
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,352
These people in a van handed the video

377
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,605
to my parents.

378
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,450
When will we visit her?

379
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:52,660
-Who?
-Min-jae.

380
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,165
I don't know when.

381
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,585
She's the only person
who doesn't share a common denominator.

382
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:01,753
A common denominator?

383
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,671
What kind?

384
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:07,634
All of the places we've visited so far
are connected to one person.

385
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,803
Lim In-gwan. I told you about him before.

386
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,724
Right.

387
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:17,936
That's why he showed up
at that vacation home.

388
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,772
I'm certain that he's deeply
involved with the Youngjin sect.

389
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,399
It's obvious that the sect is bankrolling

390
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,235
his campaign for the local election.

391
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,739
Then shouldn't we be
going after him first?

392
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:32,241
I'm sure we can find dirt on him.

393
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,705
After what he did to us,
he deserves some payback.

394
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:40,875
Speaking of which,

395
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,045
I've got something to tell you.

396
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,047
So after we look around the school--

397
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,258
Excuse me. I'm sorry for interrupting.

398
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:51,260
But what is in the back?

399
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,512
The back?

400
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,847
What do you mean?
I keep some clothes there.

401
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,476
There seems to be something
moving underneath the clothes.

402
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,854
What are you talking about? Darn.

403
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:06,526
Oh, Boss. I heard something
moving in the back.

404
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:16,035
Oh shoot! You scared me.

405
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,746
Oh gosh. I was about to throw a punch.

406
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,747
Moon-sook.

407
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:24,127
I won't bother you or anything.

408
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,504
Don't be like this.

409
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:29,298
Aunt, tell him to let me go.

410
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,717
Aunt, please.

411
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,010
Hey, Pig.

412
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,303
Hold onto the kid and stand guard, okay?

413
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:36,639
Please let me go, Mister.

414
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,559
You're pinching my neck.

415
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:42,103
-I'll be more careful today.
-My neck!

416
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,480
-I won't even let a mouse get through.
-Okay.

417
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,941
Go and catch mice instead.
Why are you grabbing me?

418
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,319
Did you have to prevent her
from coming along?

419
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,031
She really wants to tag along.

420
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,949
I can't let her get involved.

421
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:58,119
I think it's best that
only the two of us check it out.

422
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,793
-What?
-I like hearing that.

423
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,129
The two of us.

424
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:16,012
What were you saying earlier
about having something to tell me?

425
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:18,890
It's not important.

426
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,517
I'll tell you on our way back.

427
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,204
Mr. Jo.

428
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:44,624
Were you abused
by your parents while growing up?

429
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:49,420
Then let's talk about a different period.

430
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:54,133
How was your time
in the One Family Welfare Center?

431
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:58,179
Did you experience
abuse or violence there?

432
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,938
This is a very important question.

433
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:10,274
If it's not too much trouble,
we'd like you to answer that.

434
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,278
You two…

435
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,326
Let me tell you an interesting story.

436
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,410
What?

437
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:25,331
I've never told anyone this before.

438
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,959
Where I went

439
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:31,671
on the morning of that day…

440
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,966
What?

441
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,387
That day? Which day is that?

442
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,266
October 6, 1987.

443
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,937
I was wearing a gas mask
inside Saju train station.

444
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:53,401
People around me were falling down
after inhaling the nerve gas.

445
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,320
Some were vomiting.

446
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,991
I stood there aimlessly

447
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,077
and just watched them.

448
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,290
But all of a sudden,

449
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,918
I started to get mad.

450
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:17,800
I got so mad that it gave me a headache.

451
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,720
It was hard to contain my anger.

452
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,848
So guess where I went next?

453
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:24,932
I don't know.

454
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,269
I went to Choi Hyung-in's house.

455
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,647
I went to his house.

456
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:36,777
I was curious to know
what would happen if I killed him.

457
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,280
I thought it would make my anger subside.

458
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,086
Anyone home?

459
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,756
I don't think my parents are home.

460
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,383
There's nobody home during the day.

461
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,519
This is the room.

462
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,167
My parents thought I wouldn't be able
to find it if they hid it here.

463
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,670
They think I'm a little kid.

464
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,510
Let's take this outside.

465
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,846
-Your parents might come in at any minute.
-No.

466
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:49,016
They watch it every day
after they come home.

467
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,226
If they find out it's missing,

468
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:52,728
they'll probably come looking
for me at church and create a scene.

469
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,399
Oh, wait a minute.

470
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,278
Our VCR player is pretty old.

471
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,370
You have to blow on it first.

472
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,418
When I arrived at Choi Hyung-in's house,

473
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:20,006
his place felt like one, big coffin.

474
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:24,260
It was dark and cold.

475
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,429
And it was a lonely house.

476
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:31,475
Still wearing my gas mask,
I went inside slowly

477
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,228
without taking off my shoes.

478
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,233
There were a couple of small bedrooms.

479
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,402
In one room,

480
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:44,697
I could hear a dog scratching the door.

481
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:49,285
I had seen his dog before.

482
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,081
I went straight to the master bedroom.

483
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:57,043
The door was open

484
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,795
and I could see him sleeping in bed.

485
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,965
He reeked of alcohol.

486
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,801
He hadn't changed his clothes.

487
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,387
It seemed like he had fallen asleep
after getting home.

488
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:11,849
I hovered over him

489
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,019
and looked down at his face.

490
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,300
I don't think you should watch it.

491
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,677
Why not? Can't I see it too?

492
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:50,763
Oh gosh.

493
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:55,684
Can I stay in the room then?
I won't watch it.

494
00:39:58,312 --> 00:39:59,855
I'll stay under the blanket.

495
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,357
Please.

496
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:05,528
All right.

497
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:10,408
You have to promise never to watch it.

498
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,618
Okay.

499
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:14,286
Go over there.

500
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:16,265
Hey. Who are you?

501
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:19,602
What the hell are you doing in my house?

502
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:20,644
You bastard.

503
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:21,896
You piece of shit.

504
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:29,111
Dad. Don't.

505
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,738
I brought him here.

506
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,450
Dad, stop it. Don't hurt him.

507
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,286
-Don't.
-Let go of me, boy!

508
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,354
I'm Jo Kyung-ho.

509
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:06,398
That's my name. Jo Kyung-ho.

510
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,207
Mister, stop it.

511
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,584
You're going to kill my dad. Please stop.

512
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,841
Let's leave this place.

513
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:43,310
You're all
going to be dead tomorrow, anyway.

514
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:47,815
Han-gyu! And you too, Mister.

515
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:51,360
You're all going to die tomorrow.

516
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:53,112
Understand, fools!

517
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,701
Don't worry.

518
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:00,494
Nothing like that is going to happen.

519
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,704
Trust me.

520
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:03,789
You have to trust me.

521
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:10,588
Then it crossed my mind.

522
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:16,010
Maybe I shouldn't kill Choi Hyung-in.

523
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,595
Why?

524
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:22,725
Just because.

525
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:27,271
When I saw him,
he suddenly looked so pathetic.

526
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:33,902
Could you close the window?

527
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:38,115
What?

528
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:39,992
I'm asking you…

529
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,287
to close the window.

530
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:45,164
Hey, Mr. Jo.

531
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:58,052
When I decided not to kill Choi Hyung-in,

532
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,430
I was able to see

533
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:03,474
the beginning

534
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,145
as well as the end of everything.

535
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,274
Do you know what that means?

536
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,529
While you people

537
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:21,367
follow a straight line
in your stream of consciousness,

538
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,535
I'm different.

539
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,413
My consciousness

540
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:31,710
is in a loop that spreads everywhere.

541
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:33,337
So…

542
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,049
while you keep going forward,

543
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:41,261
I'm stuck in a loop

544
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,598
where I can see everything.

545
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:49,019
That allows me to see the beginning

546
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:54,483
and the end and everything in between.

547
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:13,210
But it's being ruined by people
who don't know anything.

548
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:16,588
Foolishly believing
they can make a difference.

549
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,970
They're acting however they like.

550
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:32,563
Was it 1987 when we came here

551
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:35,357
-with all the magazine club members?
-Yes.

552
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:40,696
That means this place
has been abandoned for over ten years.

553
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:42,239
How is that possible?

554
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,284
I think they wanted to keep it around.

555
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,787
Keep it around? Who?

556
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:51,957
The people who wanted
the secret spots to be kept intact.

557
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:56,044
So this place is also connected
to that Lim In-gwan guy?

558
00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:00,466
Yes. His daughter went to this school.
Her name was Lim Se-yoon.

559
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:28,494
It'll be all right. You can trust me.

560
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,079
Okay.

561
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,650
These guys do such creepy stuff.

562
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:28,845
What is this?

563
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:31,306
Yong-tak.

564
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:32,849
Look at this.

565
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:40,816
What is it?

566
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:47,239
Why is a photo of us hanging there?

567
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:54,496
Why do our faces look like that?

568
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:15,017
Yong-tak. There's a candle.
That was lit not too long ago.

569
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,852
There could be someone else here.

570
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:29,281
Let's get out of here right now.

571
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,248
Pig.

572
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:40,626
Hey Pig. Can't you hear me?

573
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,838
-Oh damn it. He's outside.
-I don't have any reception.

574
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,259
This is maddening. Damn it.

575
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:51,011
Let's find another way out.

576
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:03,482
I guess these bastards
aren't showing up today.

577
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:07,194
I wanted to get revenge
for what they did to us last time.

578
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:13,367
I think we can climb out
through that window.

579
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:50,487
Yong-tak!

580
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,415
We have to get out of here fast.

581
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:04,668
Go first.

582
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,837
No. You go first.

583
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:20,726
Yong-tak.

584
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:22,519
Climb out now. Hurry!

585
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:30,152
Yong-tak.

586
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:35,449
What are you doing?

587
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:38,994
Over there…

588
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:41,830
Do you see…

589
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:45,375
over there?

590
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:49,045
Do you see that woman standing there?

591
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:52,507
What?

592
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:01,099
She's been staring at us this whole time.

593
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,852
What are you talking about?
There's nobody there.

594
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:06,563
You don't see her?

595
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:12,652
Come out first. Okay?
Let's talk about it after you get out.

596
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:16,281
Something…

597
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,326
has come over me.

598
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:22,245
You're starting to look like

599
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:25,123
that woman over there.

600
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,334
What?

601
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:33,089
If I climb out of here,

602
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,133
I think I might kill you.

603
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,678
What are you talking about?

604
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,765
Give me your hand, Yong-tak.

605
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,937
Get away from me!

606
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,021
Get away!

607
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:57,197
Don't even think about it!
Stay right there!

608
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,033
The minute you come down here,
I'll kill you!

609
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:02,577
I'm not joking.

610
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,621
I'll really kill you.

611
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:06,706
Yong-tak.

612
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,543
Why are you being like this?

613
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:17,217
Jung-hyun.

614
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,386
Jung-hyun.

615
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:47,581
I was lying to you.

616
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:51,251
I've resented you for so long.

617
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,546
When I heard that

618
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:57,382
you had moved back to our town,

619
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:02,345
I thought…

620
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:07,475
I'd be able to bump into you
in the street someday.

621
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:10,228
That gave me such hope.

622
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:13,315
Like how I felt
during our high school days.

623
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:20,780
So I'm so sad, Jung-hyun.

624
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:25,160
Damn it.
Why didn't I tell you this sooner?

625
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:29,664
Don't do this to me, Yong-tak.

626
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,585
Please don't…

627
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:36,963
It's all right.

628
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:39,257
I have no regrets.

629
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:42,928
You…

630
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:46,932
You know, right?

631
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:15,877
Aunt!

632
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:17,963
No! Aunt!

633
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,798
You'll die if you go in there.

634
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,049
Let go of me!

635
00:54:22,258 --> 00:54:24,386
-Yong-tak!
-Aunt!

636
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:55,226
I couldn't understand it at first
when I saw his power.

637
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,979
I later realized how foolish I was.

638
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:00,982
You just need to believe.

639
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:05,945
He's entered our minds and bodies.

640
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:09,657
Professor Koo…

641
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:11,493
I feel like

642
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:14,662
I've been reborn.

643
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:16,748
I know, right?

644
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:19,000
It's a good thing.

645
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:21,169
Very nice.

646
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:22,962
Thank you.

647
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,882
Thank you so much.

648
00:56:36,392 --> 00:56:38,728
I heard what happened. Are you okay?

649
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,522
Yes, I'm all right.

650
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,565
Please look after the boy.

651
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:45,568
Are you leaving?

652
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:48,321
I have to go and find something.

653
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,118
You'll be back, won't you?

654
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:59,040
Yes. I promise.

655
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:23,481
Yes, Captain.

656
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,650
Go to the driving range
next to Cheonyang Lake.

657
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:27,110
-They're there.
-Okay.

658
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:45,837
Oh, okay.

659
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,423
Is it all ready?

660
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,301
Okay.

661
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,554
Guru will talk to you directly.

662
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:58,725
Don't forget that
your role is very important.

663
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:00,935
And did you take care of them?

664
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,645
Jo Jung-hyun and Kang Yong-tak.

665
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:06,608
I see. So that's how it went down.

666
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,787
Repeat what you told me.
What happened to them?

667
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:23,082
Yong-tak died at the scene.

668
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:26,211
Jung-hyun was able to escape.

669
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:29,631
I got it.

670
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,846
We're the only ones left now.

671
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,016
Min-jae.

672
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:44,729
Yes.

673
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,273
It's just us.

674
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:54,447
I'll try to take care of this
without making any mistakes.

675
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:56,991
Yes.

676
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:59,077
In a little while,

677
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:01,704
Detective Choi will be here.

678
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:04,040
And we'll have to begin that
when he gets here.

679
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:15,176
YOUNGJIN BRAIN STUDY SCIENCE VIDEO

680
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:29,274
October 6, 1987.

681
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:31,234
A day of purification.

682
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:34,821
Now we'll usher in a new dawn.

683
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:36,781
A new millennium.

684
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,631
We got played again by that bastard.

685
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:37,759
If we're going to have
a real conversation,

686
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:40,178
you'll have to give me
the answer I want to hear.

687
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:44,349
Watch what is going to happen soon.

688
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:47,644
We have to turn that sound off quickly.

689
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:49,145
I'm ready.

690
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:50,938
Please stop.

691
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:55,777
I'll be the last and only person

692
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,320
No!

693
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,447
Jo Kyung-ho ends up killing.
