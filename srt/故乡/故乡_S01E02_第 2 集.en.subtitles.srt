AUGUST 13, 1987

3
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,828
NO TRESPASSING

4
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,553
Is it okay to be here?

5
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,181
It's okay. I come here all the time.

6
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,811
Where are you taking us?

7
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,318
It's down here.

8
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,153
I'd rather not go down there.

9
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,114
Then why did you come all the way here?

10
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,586
Do you come here often?

11
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,130
Yes.

12
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,298
My friends hang out at this hideout.

13
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,050
This place?

14
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,178
-What do you do here?
-What else?

15
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:19,681
We drink.

16
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,852
-Is that it?
-Yes.

17
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,232
31906MA

18
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,651
I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN IT YET. HAVE YOU?

19
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,070
I think we should take pictures.

20
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,614
What? Okay.

21
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,161
When did that appear there?

22
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:45,540
I don't know when, but we saw it
for the first time yesterday.

23
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,167
It wasn't here last week.

24
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,128
Someone probably wrote it
since our last visit.

25
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,423
How many times have you come here?

26
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:55,466
Seven times.

27
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,344
And we're the first to come here, right?

28
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,556
Yes. Nobody comes here except my friends.

29
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,935
But something is off about it.

30
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,313
It's creepy.

31
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,151
Tak, I'm scared.

32
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,154
What's there to be scared of?

33
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,781
What is that?

34
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,450
What?

35
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:24,370
What do you call that kind of drawing?

36
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,498
Is it a symbol?

37
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,393
Three, one, nine, zero, six…

38
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,355
"I haven't

39
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,607
forgotten it yet."

40
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,787
Mom, I'm home.

41
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,840
You're home?

42
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:18,967
Whose baby is that?

43
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:23,846
Jung-hyun.

44
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,266
Don't raise your voice.
You'll frighten the baby.

45
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,269
Actually,

46
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,815
your brother is in that room.

47
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,901
-What?
-He showed up all of a sudden

48
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,569
after not calling us for years.

49
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,285
-What did he say?
-Say what?

50
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,120
Where had he been?

51
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,204
Well…

52
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,291
I don't know.

53
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,418
He won't tell me.

54
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,617
Who are you?

55
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,579
Who is your dad?

56
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,127
I'm not sure, but…

57
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,719
I think I'm your aunt.

58
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,346
Aunt.

59
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:00,860
JULY 16, 1999

60
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:01,903
Jae-young!

61
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,363
Jae-young!

62
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,759
I found it!

63
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,476
What did you find?

64
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,311
A phone. I found a phone.

65
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:36,437
A phone?

66
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,315
Anything else? Did you find anything else?

67
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:41,359
No. Just the phone.

68
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:12,181
SOOK CHINESE RESTAURANT

69
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,699
The body has been identified.

70
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,035
Her daughter has also gone missing
after she was

71
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:17,330
last seen at a local precinct
on the day of the murder.

72
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:21,501
The killer committed the crime
in the bathroom on the 12th.

73
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,128
The manner in which the attack
unfolded was quite brutal.

74
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,673
Unlike other murder cases,
the victim sustained multiple

75
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,967
stab wounds on the face.

76
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,136
The killer showed such excessive cruelty,

77
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,555
-even the police
-Stop watching TV and get some rest.

78
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,349
are currently investigating.

79
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:39,435
Three days after this murder,

80
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,939
a middle school student,
Cho, has gone missing.

81
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,691
The police say the two missing girls
went to the same…

82
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,447
Mom.

83
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,000
Jae-young…

84
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,713
I'll give my life if I have to
in order to find her.

85
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,385
So please don't watch the news.

86
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,807
Please just listen to me.

87
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,811
Oh, sorry. Did I wake you?

88
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,815
-What time is it?
-It's 8 a.m.

89
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,775
You only got two hours of sleep.

90
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,446
Damn it. I have to go to work.

91
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,616
Have some breakfast before you go. Okay?

92
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,207
It's your first murder case
after being assigned here.

93
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:26,709
I know.

94
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,420
I was watching the news in the morning
and I felt a little weird.

95
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,506
Since you're handling that case,

96
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,843
everything they were reporting
on the news sounded so tragic.

97
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,137
The media is having a field day.

98
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,097
It puts more pressure on us.

99
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:47,605
The missing girl is
Jo Kyung-ho's daughter, right?

100
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,612
Now that I think of it,
I guess you might know her family.

101
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,989
Have you called them?

102
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,866
Not yet.

103
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,536
What about your partner?
Did he say anything?

104
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,497
No, not much.

105
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,167
Jo Kyung-ho is a separate matter
from the missing victim.

106
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,296
It won't be easy for him either.

107
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,122
Were you also called
to the principal's office?

108
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,311
So you last saw her at lunchtime
on the day she went missing?

109
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,649
-Yes.
-Did Jae-young

110
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:16,485
talk to anyone on the phone or get a call?

111
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,071
No, she didn't talk to anyone.

112
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,033
Just tell us whatever you remember.

113
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,703
It doesn't matter
even if it's a small detail.

114
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,458
-Well…
-Go on.

115
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,126
Do you remember something?

116
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,045
The thing is, a few days ago,

117
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,090
Jae-young was with us
in the broadcasting room.

118
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,719
But someone suddenly knocked on the door.

119
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,929
We went to the door

120
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:48,058
and someone had left
something strange by the door.

121
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,019
Why are you telling them that?

122
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,021
He told us to share anything we remember.

123
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,899
It's okay. Keep going.
What did that person leave there?

124
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,026
-A cassette tape.
-A cassette tape?

125
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,112
What kind of tape?

126
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,990
It was a brain-enhancing tape.

127
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,825
Lee's Genius Academy sells it to students.

128
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,076
Brain enhancement?

129
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,120
What kind of tape is that?

130
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,706
At first, we thought the tape contained

131
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:13,250
leaked questions from the upcoming exam.

132
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,752
But it wasn't.

133
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,505
It was like
a brain-enhancing technique tape.

134
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,548
Supposedly, it improves
your concentration.

135
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,426
What are you talking about?

136
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,221
Who is leaking exam questions?

137
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,514
There's a rumor that

138
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:29,892
Lee's Genius Academy sells
exam questions to students.

139
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,394
Since Kyung-jin
was going to that academy,

140
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,271
I don't think it's entirely irrelevant.

141
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,898
Oh my goodness.

142
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,946
Where is that cassette tape right now?

143
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,085
BROADCASTING ROOM

144
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,963
What? You can't find it?

145
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,966
I put it right here.

146
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,343
Did Jae-young take it?

147
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:05,844
Why would she take it?

148
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,846
How would I know?

149
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,310
Are you playing games with us?

150
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,814
-Pardon?
-Don't enter the broadcasting room

151
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,108
except in the morning
to air the broadcast. Got that?

152
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,444
How could you tell such blatant lies
in front of the detectives?

153
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,696
We're not lying.

154
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:27,533
You never reported the cassette tape
to the school when you had it.

155
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,035
You broke the school rules, you know.

156
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,329
School rules?
Which one are you talking about?

157
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,957
How do the school rules apply to this?

158
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,250
Hey.

159
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,502
-That's enough.
-I'm not making a fuss.

160
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,212
And why aren't you saying anything?

161
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,505
You were with us too.

162
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,633
How dare you talk back like that? I'll--

163
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,844
Let's not argue.

164
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,181
Sir, how about we take a break
and have a smoke?

165
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,517
Okay.

166
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,020
I think they need to
sort things out there.

167
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,899
Remember that security guard?

168
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,029
Of course. They sometimes asked me
for bottled water to cook noodles with it.

169
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,697
I remember that day.

170
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,741
There were no exams that day,

171
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,827
so only a few students involved in clubs
came to school.

172
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,329
The school was quiet that day.

173
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:17,082
I have entry logs of those
who entered the school. Take a look.

174
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:20,419
What is this?

175
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,587
What?

176
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,050
That?

177
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,802
What is it? You erased something.

178
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,429
Well, you see…

179
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,890
Nobody checks the entry logbook anyway.

180
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,851
So sometimes I jot down reminders on it.

181
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,853
But you know…

182
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,606
I was wondering

183
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:44,109
whether or not to tell you this…

184
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,904
It kept bothering me.

185
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,113
What was bothering you?

186
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,658
When I saw the news about the girl,
I was so shocked.

187
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,451
It made me sad.

188
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:55,245
It was that girl.
The one that was reported missing

189
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,665
on the news.

190
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,044
-You're talking about Lee Kyung-jin?
-Yes.

191
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:06,590
She came to school that day.

192
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,885
What?
You're telling us you saw her that day?

193
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:15,432
So the name you erased here.
It's Lee Kyung-jin, right?

194
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,517
Yes.

195
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,560
That's right.

196
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,354
I wrote down her name

197
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,315
but I erased it.

198
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,442
Why did you erase it?

199
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,611
Well, you see,

200
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,113
she was acting weird that day.

201
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:33,200
She hardly ever talked to me before.

202
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:37,496
But that day, she said she had to see
her classroom and it wouldn't take long.

203
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,581
And when she came back,

204
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:43,085
she asked me
if I wrote down her name in the records.

205
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,045
I told her I did.

206
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,964
She then asked me to erase it.

207
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,967
So I asked her why.

208
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,762
After I said that,
she started to plead with me.

209
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,723
She said

210
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,559
her name couldn't be in the entry logs.

211
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,697
I don't want people to know I came.

212
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:17,786
And where I was today.

213
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,288
All right.

214
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,540
I won't ask you anything.

215
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,625
I'll make an exception
and erase your name.

216
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:26,962
See.

217
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,008
Satisfied?

218
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,301
Mister.

219
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,846
My mom told me

220
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,141
that my dad

221
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,436
wasn't on a business trip to Japan.

222
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,189
He was in Japan to be with his mistress.

223
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,567
But whenever

224
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,779
I got the top score on the exam,

225
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,241
my dad would come to Korea
and treat me to pork ribs.

226
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,409
Oh really?

227
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,745
My mom told me

228
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,956
that I had to get the top score
no matter what

229
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,502
to have Dad come home often.

230
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,841
I don't like

231
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,221
pork ribs anymore.

232
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,140
It's too sweet.

233
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,937
All right. I see.

234
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,523
Why don't you step inside
and have some green tea?

235
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,941
It's warm inside.

236
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,026
You'll catch a cold.

237
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,583
Dry yourself.

238
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,129
Mister.

239
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,798
But you know what?

240
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,009
That woman won't disappear.

241
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:57,970
I can still see her.

242
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,013
What? Woman?

243
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:01,473
Who?

244
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,811
I can see her out there.

245
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,063
In the field.

246
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,654
There's no one there.

247
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,577
Mister, I didn't do it.

248
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,121
It's…

249
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,374
It's…

250
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,130
It's her. She did it.

251
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:49,813
What are your thoughts?

252
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,192
About what?

253
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,487
When Kyung-jin said

254
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,365
it was the woman who did it,

255
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,452
that must mean
she knows who the killer is.

256
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,957
Yes, if what the guard said was all true.

257
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,834
It also means that

258
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:14,421
Kyung-jin could be an accomplice
in the murder of her mom.

259
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:24,389
Sir, I'm not trying to argue or anything…

260
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:30,020
But the killer stabbed her mom
eight times in the neck and face.

261
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,189
We're talking about her mother.

262
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,275
I don't think it's possible
for her to do that.

263
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,487
Why is that important?

264
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,155
What?

265
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,158
Why is it important
whether or not it's possible?

266
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,495
I'm not sure. Well…

267
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:51,041
I don't want to believe that
the daughter was involved in the murder.

268
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,170
-Really?
-Yes.

269
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,508
What if

270
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:04,012
there was a murder where a daughter
stabbed her mom in the neck eight times?

271
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:08,058
If a murder you believed
could not happen were to happen,

272
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,644
then does that solve your dilemma?

273
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,190
Well, it's not like that.

274
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:16,984
I mean,

275
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,320
I don't want to imagine

276
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:24,533
that such a normal girl could
murder her own mom like that.

277
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,702
-For real?
-Yes.

278
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,622
I think otherwise.

279
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:36,420
There are murders like this
where the evidence speaks for itself.

280
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,382
Gruesome scenes
that make you avert your eyes.

281
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,345
But it's not our job to question
whether someone is capable

282
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,972
of committing a brutal murder.

283
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:52,602
What we do is like hovering over
a crime scene that already took place.

284
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:55,105
What I'm telling you is that

285
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:58,525
we don't need to analyze
the inner psyche of each suspect

286
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,694
by peering into the deepest recesses

287
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,239
of their mind.

288
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,372
Even though we differ in our opinions,

289
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,041
I think you and I

290
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,002
still think along the same lines.

291
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:18,837
You think so?

292
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,339
Yes.

293
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,633
Sure. You're right.

294
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,345
Aren't I?

295
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,807
-Or you could be wrong.
-What?

296
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,062
What?

297
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,664
This is the tense you have to follow.

298
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,958
So the rest has to be past perfect.

299
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,376
The answer is "had finished."

300
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,045
What goes here then?

301
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,546
The answer is "already."

302
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,298
Sir, well…

303
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:08,303
Could you ask them to wait in my office?

304
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:10,472
-I'll be finished in five minutes.
-Okay, sir.

305
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,209
Do you want me to watch the door?

306
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:07,737
Whoa. He sure likes sweets.

307
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,950
Would you like some candy?

308
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:24,796
Hwan-gyu.

309
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:26,631
Kim Hwan-gyu.

310
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:35,056
My mom says you stopped going to
nightclubs every weekend.

311
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,766
-Yes.
-Then what do you do?

312
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,895
I'm going to church lately.

313
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,939
Church? Really? Why, all of a sudden?

314
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,983
Well, you know…

315
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,403
The world doesn't seem real to me.

316
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:51,114
So I feel like my existence is fake.

317
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,408
I don't think life is real.

318
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,286
You're talking nonsense again.

319
00:24:57,078 --> 00:25:00,081
Maybe it's because
I sniffed glue too much as a kid.

320
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,500
Ever since then, I've had brain fog.

321
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,002
So I do crazy things.

322
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,754
You know about that.

323
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:06,880
Because

324
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,799
there's no real meaning in life.

325
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,093
But there's something strange.

326
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,554
The church…

327
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,682
Well, it's not exactly a church.

328
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,435
Anyway, ever since I started going there,
I've been feeling better.

329
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:21,603
I see.

330
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,897
It's a relief to hear that.

331
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,858
Yes. It's thanks to you and your mom.

332
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,110
No. You're walking down
the straight path now.

333
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:31,655
Here.

334
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,115
I have to go now.

335
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,951
You give me homemade cooking.

336
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:37,994
Would you like to come in?

337
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,830
You came all the way here
to bring me this food.

338
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:44,334
What's there to eat at your place?
You live by yourself.

339
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,253
I have instant coffee packets.

340
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:47,545
That's fine.

341
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:50,340
Remember to thank my mom
after you eat it all.

342
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:52,425
She likes it
when people compliment her food.

343
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,177
Okay. Bye.

344
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:55,887
Bye.

345
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:35,719
MAY 8
KIMCHI

346
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:00,720
What is that?

347
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,605
I've seen it before.

348
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,620
How strange. It's changed.

349
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,415
How strange indeed. What…

350
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,208
Where is he going? Why is he running?

351
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,254
What is going on?

352
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,924
Damn it. Miss, isn't that Lee Young-deok?

353
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:41,553
-Yes, I told him you're waiting.
-Damn it.

354
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,641
Lee Young-deok!

355
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:50,729
Watch out.

356
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:58,278
Are you okay? Are you?

357
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,612
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

358
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:10,957
Darn it!

359
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,959
You crazy bastard!

360
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,043
Mr. Lee!

361
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,171
Open the door!

362
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,382
I said open the door!

363
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,512
Aren't you pushing it too far?

364
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,640
The prosecutors will yell at us
for bringing him in that condition.

365
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,350
We'll tell them we needed to question him.

366
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,436
What did the doctor say?

367
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,606
They're minor injuries. He'll be fine.

368
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,400
Why did he back his car like that?

369
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,653
He's hiding something.

370
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:42,906
I don't know what it is yet.

371
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:46,075
Look at that. Why is he eating so much?
Isn't that his seventh burger already?

372
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,660
Will he be all right?

373
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:48,870
Let's keep watching.

374
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,623
We have a reason
for taking him into custody.

375
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:54,501
-I don't want to release him right away.
-Do you have something on him?

376
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:10,183
-Is it comfortable here?
-No.

377
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,519
What do you mean it's not?

378
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,479
What is this?

379
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,940
Are you trying to break
a burger-eating record?

380
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:19,067
I was getting nervous so…

381
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,778
Why are you so nervous?

382
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:24,781
We didn't cuff you
nor did we put you in jail.

383
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:27,826
This place isn't jail.
That door is open, as you can see.

384
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:32,288
You can leave whenever you please.
We just want to ask you a few questions.

385
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,751
I made a big mistake earlier.

386
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,212
Why did you do that?
Let's talk about it, okay?

387
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:45,510
Detective Choi almost got
crushed to death by your car.

388
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,011
Why did you do it?

389
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,181
Well, you see…

390
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,518
I suddenly got scared.

391
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:57,063
I put my foot to the pedal
but I didn't know I was in reverse.

392
00:30:57,146 --> 00:31:00,400
-I'm so sorry.
-What were you scared of?

393
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:01,568
Well…

394
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,279
When you mentioned Lee Kyung-jin,

395
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,865
I thought I was being framed
for her disappearance.

396
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,284
Why would we frame you
if you didn't do anything?

397
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,120
Well…

398
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:15,248
There are people in prison
for crimes they didn't commit, you know.

399
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:16,499
What did you just say?

400
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:21,421
You've been running your academy
for over 14 years in that neighborhood.

401
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,882
Yes, that's correct.

402
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,593
You're very famous here
for sending 90 percent of the kids

403
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,011
to top universities.

404
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:30,930
Well, that's because

405
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,016
I only accept high-achieving kids.

406
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,809
But we heard another story.

407
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,519
You sell a peculiar cassette tape.

408
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:41,190
And you charge a lot for it.

409
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,609
Is that true?

410
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,444
How much do you sell it for?

411
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,281
If it's okay with you,
let me listen to that tape too.

412
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,499
Can I leave right now?

413
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,920
-What?
-Without answering the question?

414
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,339
Yes. I don't have anything to say.

415
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,507
You said I had the right
to remain silent, right?

416
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,843
-Fine then.
-What?

417
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,721
-We can question you some other time.
-No.

418
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,973
I don't have anything further to say.

419
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,059
What is the meaning of this?
You brought me here.

420
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:19,228
I wanted to give you my full cooperation

421
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:22,106
because a student
in my academy committed suicide.

422
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,275
But you keep talking about
stuff from the past.

423
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,110
Wait a minute. What did you just say?

424
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,656
-I wanted to give my full cooperation--
-No, before that.

425
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,619
Suicide?

426
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:37,455
Kyung-jin committed suicide?

427
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:40,959
Yes.

428
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,044
What I'm saying is,

429
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,505
you all read the news, right?

430
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,465
-So you must know about it.
-What are you talking about?

431
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:50,885
No media outlet reported
that she committed suicide.

432
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,390
That's…

433
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,934
Mr. Lee Young-deok,
we never released a statement

434
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:00,561
saying that Lee Kyung-jin
committed suicide.

435
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,281
What the hell? What is this?

436
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:15,201
Taek-jin, bring me a mop!

437
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:19,372
Oh, that's disgusting.

438
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:33,219
HANSUNG LIGHT CHURCH

439
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:57,952
Excuse me.

440
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,621
I came to see Pastor Woo.

441
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:04,167
-Why would you like to see him?
-I talked to him over the phone.

442
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,585
It's about Kim Hwan-gyu.

443
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:07,920
Oh, Pastor Woo is giving a sermon.

444
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,547
Could you wait there?

445
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:15,344
To the brothers and sisters
who are here today.

446
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,472
And your children

447
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,558
are enrolled in a top high school.

448
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,435
They're studying hard

449
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,438
late into the night to reach their goals.

450
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,149
But do you know this?

451
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:32,653
Have you thought about which high schools

452
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,074
stay open the longest every night?

453
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:39,160
Do the students have the willpower

454
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,913
to study ten more minutes
than the next student?

455
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:46,417
Brother Joseph Choi,
who got into dental school

456
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:50,338
at Hankuk University last year,

457
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,256
said this to me.

458
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:53,925
He said

459
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:57,011
he studied until he nearly died.

460
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,516
He even put a chamber pot in his room
to save time from using the bathroom.

461
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:06,813
He coughed up blood due to his asthma,
but he said he kept studying despite it.

462
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:11,359
He came to church regularly
and was a devout Christian.

463
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,820
He was always read the bible

464
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,406
and listened to the Lord's teachings.

465
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:22,453
-When did Hwan-gyu stop coming to church?
-I'm not sure.

466
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,456
He couldn't come to church
after the incident.

467
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,626
What incident?

468
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,254
You really don't know about the incident?

469
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:33,965
No.

470
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:37,093
We don't talk about our personal matters.

471
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,887
It was on the day of the special prayer

472
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,807
in memory of
the Saju station gas attack victims.

473
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,810
You probably know that
our church holds a prayer

474
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:48,146
in memory of the victims every year.

475
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,233
Yes.

476
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,318
In the middle of my sermon,

477
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,155
Hwan-gyu suddenly stood up

478
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,907
-We shouldn't forget!
-and began yelling.

479
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,994
No. It's all fake! You're a con artist!

480
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,371
He called me a con artist,
saying it was all fake.

481
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:09,876
I knew he had a violent side
but it was the first time I witnessed it.

482
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:14,881
Before I knew it,
Hwan-gyu had stabbed himself.

483
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,049
It was a deep knife wound.

484
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,719
The floor was covered in blood.

485
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,012
When did this happen?

486
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,639
More than a year ago.
Before you opened your restaurant.

487
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:27,310
Do you remember anything that might
have made him do that?

488
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,563
I don't remember every detail,

489
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,566
but I was giving the same sermon

490
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,860
I usually give for the memorial service.

491
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:39,071
What kind of sermon?

492
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:40,531
That we…

493
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:45,328
shouldn't forget the innocent victims
from that attack.

494
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:48,664
Neither should we forget

495
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,960
the families of the victims, the attack,

496
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,463
nor the perpetrator.

497
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:36,087
SOOK CHINESE RESTAURANT

498
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,055
Did you learn anything?

499
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,307
No.

500
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:49,934
Did anyone call?

501
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,227
No.

502
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:55,690
But I did get a call from the police.
They asked me if Jae-young called.

503
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,359
They're not doing their jobs.

504
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,820
This is killing me.

505
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,864
Let's wait.

506
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:07,076
Jae-young's friend came. She's inside.

507
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,746
She's been waiting for you
for more than an hour.

508
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,012
After you're done, you can go.

509
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,599
-Get some rest.
-Okay.

510
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,103
Ta-da.

511
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,572
Thanks for coming here.

512
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,826
Are you all right, Aunt?

513
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:49,869
Me?

514
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,496
I don't know if I am.

515
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:54,874
I'm not sure.

516
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:56,625
It's been a blur.

517
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:00,755
But I need to stay strong.

518
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,260
Did Jae-young call you or anything?

519
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:08,346
No, she hasn't.

520
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:12,850
-Did you have lunch?
-I'm not hungry. I'm okay.

521
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,560
No, have lunch. I'll cook you something.

522
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:16,145
Oh, I'm really not hungry.

523
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:22,860
Aunt, the reason I came today

524
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,197
is to tell you something.

525
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:28,824
What is it?

526
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:30,993
Well…

527
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:35,915
Do you have anyone in mind
who might have done it?

528
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,418
It's obvious.

529
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:43,798
You know who gave
Jae-young a ride that day.

530
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,592
Yes, I know that.

531
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:51,138
But I don't think he acted alone.

532
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:54,934
What do you mean?

533
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,229
Moon-sook.

534
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:01,190
Do you know something?

535
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,401
Oh, I'm so conflicted.

536
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,237
Jae-young said I shouldn't tell you.

537
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,033
I won't tell anyone.
I'll keep it a secret.

538
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:14,203
I don't know what it's about,
but hurry up and tell me.

539
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,331
Well…

540
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,710
When Jae-young and I started hanging out,

541
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:25,506
she said I needed to know
something about her

542
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:27,299
if we were going to become friends.

543
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,805
She told me that

544
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,685
her dad was Jo Kyung-ho.

545
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:46,861
So I told her to shut up and stop lying.

546
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:50,322
But she said it was true, and she was only

547
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,908
telling me.

548
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:57,830
And what else did she say?

549
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,880
Moon-sook.

550
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,634
Actually,

551
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,597
she said her dad still contacts her.

552
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,684
I'd like to ask you something personal.

553
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,479
Why did you pick Saju?

554
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,356
It's your hometown, after all.

555
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,818
I don't understand your question.

556
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,029
It's the place where your family lives.

557
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,865
Didn't you have other choices?

558
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,409
Is there a difference?

559
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,664
He contacts her?

560
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,125
From who again?

561
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,295
Her dad

562
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,923
still contacts her.

563
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,847
But Moon-sook, that's impossible.

564
00:41:58,265 --> 00:41:59,642
You know that he's in prison.

565
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,269
Jae-young's dad, I mean.

566
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,438
Yes, I do.

567
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:07,942
I didn't believe it, either.

568
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:11,737
But I suddenly remembered
what she said yesterday.

569
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:20,162
Actually, one of
your old high school friends

570
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:23,749
gives her letters from her dad.

571
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,588
A friend of mine?

572
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,882
Which friend? For real?

573
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,342
She really said that?

574
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,219
Yes.

575
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:37,763
She clearly said that.

576
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,897
So there's no difference

577
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,441
between committing a terrorist attack
in your hometown

578
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,819
and another city?

579
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:56,490
Is there another reason
which you're not telling us?

580
00:42:57,449 --> 00:43:00,202
Any experiences you had
in your childhood or…

581
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:03,122
It's simply easier to conduct
an experiment there.

582
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,500
An experiment?

583
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,628
What kind of experiment?

584
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:18,596
Nerve gas has already been used

585
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,931
as a lethal weapon in many wars.

586
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:24,935
So why on earth would you need to
carry out a gas experiment?

587
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:27,771
You have no idea

588
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:30,774
what I'm saying.

589
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:36,530
I'm conducting a very complex experiment.

590
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,993
It'll also take an unimaginable long time

591
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,246
to conduct.

592
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:31,960
Ms. Jung.

593
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,838
You have a visitor.

594
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:33,313
I made you a cocktail similar to
a traditional Tibetan drink.

595
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,066
It tastes totally different from it,

596
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,277
but it's not that bad. Drink it.

597
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,987
You'll sleep well tonight.

598
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:50,956
Do you work late a lot?

599
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,459
I'm not the only one who works late.

600
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:54,710
Everybody takes turns.

601
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:57,671
This water treatment plant
supplies tap water.

602
00:45:57,754 --> 00:45:59,715
So we can't let any accidents happen here.

603
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:03,135
-It must be tough.
-Not really.

604
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:08,640
You look really tired.

605
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:13,979
Do you need a favor or anything?

606
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,651
Jung-hyun. Did something happen?

607
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:21,862
No, I just came.

608
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,073
Min-jae,

609
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:28,410
what do you think about that bastard?

610
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:29,786
Who are we talking about?

611
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,044
Jo Kyung-ho.

612
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,049
You mean, your brother?

613
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,302
That bastard…

614
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,180
He's dead to me.

615
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:52,518
Ever since that day,
I don't consider him to be my brother.

616
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,021
Other people

617
00:46:56,897 --> 00:47:00,067
probably don't know how much we hate him.

618
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:03,362
Probably not.

619
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:05,030
Even if they knew,

620
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,492
they would think of him

621
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,162
when they were to see us.

622
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,251
Not all of them.

623
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:20,879
Min-jae…

624
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:26,552
Jae-young has been kidnapped
not long after we returned here.

625
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,680
Do you think it's a coincidence?

626
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:31,848
Jae-young's kidnapping, I mean.

627
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,308
Jung-hyun…

628
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:38,730
Maybe…

629
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,652
we shouldn't have returned.

630
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:37,849
That's the end of
this brain enhancement session.

631
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:43,897
Replay this during the remaining time

632
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:47,275
to keep improving your concentration.

633
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:49,861
Thank you.

634
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:36,950
Mr. Jo Kyung-ho,
I'll repeat the question.

635
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:39,411
What kind of experiment is it?

636
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:44,875
You're not going to answer that?

637
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:01,600
Mr. Jo Kyung-ho.

638
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:03,894
This is a good lighter.

639
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:09,900
Don't you think so?

640
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:32,714
So what do you think?

641
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:36,092
-About what?
-Could it be a serial killer

642
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:38,345
that we're dealing with?

643
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:40,972
It could be.

644
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:48,563
Are you feeling all right, sir?

645
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,366
Have I told you about my late wife?

646
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:03,078
No, you haven't.

647
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:06,081
In 1987,

648
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:09,042
during the gas attack at Saju Station,

649
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:12,212
my wife was

650
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,091
also there.

651
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,887
We were separated at the time.

652
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:26,768
But that happened
around a month after she came back home.

653
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:35,944
The day before my wife died,

654
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:40,282
I went to a bar for a drink.

655
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,660
I don't even remember why I went, though.

656
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:45,704
But somehow that's where I was.

657
00:52:47,163 --> 00:52:49,040
I left my wife at home alone.

658
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:53,211
I was drinking that day.

659
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:56,006
Every day…

660
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,718
Every day, I tried to find
an excuse for why I did that.

661
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:04,180
So I came home after drinking.
I was very drunk.

662
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:29,873
And nobody was home.

663
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:32,417
It was just me.

664
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:38,465
-Shi-jung.
-Yes?

665
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:41,426
I still think about that day.

666
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,178
If only

667
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:47,265
had I not gone drinking

668
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:49,059
and had gone straight home,

669
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,520
that might have changed things.

670
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:55,398
Like,

671
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:59,152
my wife might have not died.

672
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:06,910
I got a phone call
at 10 a.m. the next morning.

673
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:10,080
My instincts told me it was bad news.

674
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,458
Even though I was still half-drunk,

675
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:18,046
I felt like I shouldn't pick up the phone.
I had a bad feeling.

676
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:22,092
When that phone kept ringing,

677
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:25,345
each ring sent a shiver down my spine.

678
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:31,267
I stared at the phone for a while
and then answered it at the last minute.

679
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:34,980
Who was calling?

680
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,315
The hospital.

681
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:42,195
They called me right after
they were able to identify her.

682
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:46,491
The nurse said my wife was
in critical condition due to a gas attack.

683
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:51,162
I still don't understand.

684
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:54,624
Why was my wife at the station?

685
00:54:57,877 --> 00:54:59,671
Where was she going?

686
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:06,678
Anyway, that brief hospital call
changed my life.

687
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:08,054
Ever since that day,

688
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:12,559
my nerves get rattled
whenever I hear my phone ring.

689
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:18,815
And when I got a call this morning,

690
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,236
the ringtone sounded so ominous

691
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:26,698
as if it were going to swallow me

692
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:31,953
into a dark void. Just like that day.

693
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,292
I have a feeling

694
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,253
that we're involved

695
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:45,550
in a case that won't

696
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:49,345
be easy to crack.

697
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:00,356
Where are you from?

698
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:04,611
I'm Lee Shi-jung and he's Choi Hyung-in.
We're from the Gyeongnam Precinct's MIU.

699
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,362
You can't go any farther
by car from this point.

700
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:07,864
You'll have to walk.

701
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:09,365
The road is too narrow.

702
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:11,826
There was heavy rain last night.

703
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,703
Sir, I think you'll have to walk.

704
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:14,829
Okay.

705
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,585
Listen to the part
where the director starts talking.

706
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:22,295
Don't forget to turn up the volume.

707
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:01,709
Oh, sorry. Did I wake you up?

708
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:03,962
No, I need to go anyway.

709
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:05,463
What time is it?

710
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,590
I haven't slept well like this in days.

711
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,843
You didn't sleep for that long, actually.

712
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:12,971
I fixed some breakfast for us
in the break room. Let's go.

713
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,015
What were you watching?

714
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:20,145
You were asking me to show you
this photo album. Remember?

715
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:22,772
So I kept it in my office
so that I could give it to you.

716
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:26,901
Look at these pictures. We look

717
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,236
so ugly.

718
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:40,415
Not only do I look ugly,
but I also look so serious.

719
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:48,047
Young-seob…

720
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:52,177
Do you remember how he took this picture?

721
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,473
He took it with the camera
he always had on him.

722
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:59,517
He bragged about how expensive it was.

723
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,269
Oh, that camera?

724
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:03,146
He showed it off a lot
that it was made in Japan.

725
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:06,357
-He would always mention the price.
-"It costs 100,000 yen."

726
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,693
That's right. 100,000 yen.

727
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:10,945
So that's one million won
if you convert it.

728
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:13,239
I still remember that because
he constantly reminded everyone.

729
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:16,201
All of those photos
were taken using his camera.

730
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:17,869
Which photos?

731
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,455
You don't remember?

732
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:23,082
It was a game that was
hugely popular among the kids.

733
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:27,295
We wrote an article about it
and it became a sensation.

734
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:29,881
Kids from other schools bought
our school magazine to read that article.

735
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:31,216
You don't remember?

736
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:33,176
It was huge.

737
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,470
What article?

738
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,062

Replay this during the remaining time

743

to keep improving your concentration.

744
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:03,831
Thank you.

745
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:51,796
No, please.

746
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:55,008
No!

747
00:59:56,467 --> 00:59:57,969
I need to save my daughter!

748
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:02,181
No, please. I need to save my daughter!

749
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:06,996
It was this symbol.

750
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:09,082
What?

751
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:11,918
The thing I completely forgot about…

752
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:16,130
was this.

753
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:06,616
This wasn't a simple homicide case
from the beginning.

754
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:08,701
We made a mistake from there.

755
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:11,037
What do you really want to know?

756
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,747
Even if we saw it ten years ago,

757
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:15,583
how could we forget
what we saw in the video?

758
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:17,794
There is something you forgot.

759
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,086
There is a woman

760
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:21,714
in the upside-down place.

761
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:27,553
Is he the one behind all of this?

762
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,514
But you should have still told me!

763
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:31,891
You'll never be able to
go back to a normal life.
