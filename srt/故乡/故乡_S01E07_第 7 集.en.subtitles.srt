00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:47,380
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,507
YEAR 1978

3
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:53,887
That place was much more terrible
than you think it was.

4
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,891
It wasn't

5
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,769
our decision to go live there.

6
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,607
That's why

7
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,943
those people were not going to stop.

8
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:15,658
They starved us, abused us,
and locked us in a cold room.

9
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:19,579
They were probably waiting
for us to die from the cold.

10
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:23,666
I knew that.

11
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,587
That’s why I had no choice but to do that.

12
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,007
I knew

13
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,345
it was going to end like that.

14
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,724
So you just have to do as I say.

15
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,353
Just follow what I tell you.

16
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,832
YEAR 1999

17
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,010
Who are you?

18
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,268
Hey, don't you think
your cult is going too far?

19
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,019
This is a residential neighborhood.

20
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,856
I don't want to create a scene,
so beat it.

21
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,441
Excuse me.

22
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,909
Hello, Detective Choi.

23
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:53,006
Sorry for coming
without calling you first.

24
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,385
That's all right. No worries.

25
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,095
Thank you.

26
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,351
How have you been lately?

27
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,938
I don't know. It's hard to answer that.

28
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:12,734
I don't know
how I've been holding up these days.

29
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,304
Actually…

30
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,934
I went to see him.

31
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:48,353
Jo Kyung-ho.

32
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,274
I'm certain he's involved
with the kidnapping of Jae-young.

33
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,443
It became clear after I met him.

34
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,655
So I've been searching for Jae-young.

35
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,407
I'm going to follow
every possible lead to find her.

36
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,159
Detective Choi,

37
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,996
do you believe that Jae-young is dead?

38
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,873
I don't have

39
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,460
anything to say about that.

40
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,590
I don't think she's dead, Detective Choi.

41
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,426
I met her.

42
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,596
Her face was covered in a veil,
but I could tell it was her.

43
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,390
She was standing a few feet away from me.

44
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,058
You met Jae-young?

45
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:28,935
You did?

46
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,021
Is that a fact?

47
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,566
It was a remote building
hidden in the mountains.

48
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,360
When I went back to the place,

49
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,779
-A building in the mountains…
-it was shuttered.

50
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,864
And Jae-young was nowhere to be found.

51
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,032
When was this?

52
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,244
Do you remember the location?

53
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,500
So you don't want to tell me.

54
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,544
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,504
I'm determined

56
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,007
to find her by myself.

57
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,842
Do you think

58
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:05,221
getting the police involved
will pose a threat to Jae-young's safety?

59
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,473
When I met Jae-young there,

60
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,351
I felt like

61
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:14,272
she had chosen to be with them.

62
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,608
If that's the case, I want to know why.

63
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,027
I'm going to find the truth

64
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,321
while I search for her.

65
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,573
I'm not quite following.

66
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:28,453
Why are you even telling me these things?

67
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,458
I feel like my life could be in danger

68
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,045
while I search for Jae-young.

69
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,173
If something bad were to happen,

70
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,633
I would like you to at least know

71
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,928
that Jae-young is alive.

72
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:48,848
That's the reason…

73
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,601
why I came.

74
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,901
You don't have to see me out.

75
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,819
I'll give you a ride home.

76
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,362
I'm really fine.

77
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,531
I'm sorry for showing up like this.

78
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,078
Well…

79
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,332
If you need to see him

80
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,002
because of the ongoing
police investigation,

81
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:21,380
I strongly urge you not to meet him.

82
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:25,301
He's much more dangerous
than you think he is.

83
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:31,974
You mean, Jo Kyung-ho?

84
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:36,354
Yes. I hate saying that name.

85
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,314
That's not his real name.

86
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,817
After our dad passed,

87
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,945
he said he'd take the same name.

88
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,905
So he had his name changed.

89
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,532
I always hated

90
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,993
calling him by that name.

91
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,746
He changed his name to his father's?

92
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,997
Yes.

93
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,167
Jo Kyung-ho

94
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,087
is my late dad's name.

95
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,674
I didn't know that.

96
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:10,430
It's not something that people
are interested in knowing about.

97
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,433
I'll get going now. Bye.

98
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,017
I presume I'll see you

99
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,979
at the memorial ceremony
for Shi-jung and his wife.

100
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,981
I'll see you then.

101
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,401
-What memorial ceremony?
-Well…

102
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,572
You said Shi-jung's wife, Choi Kyung-joo,
was a high school friend of yours.

103
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,083
I see you didn't know

104
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,795
what happened to them.

105
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,629
Hey, hold up.

106
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,756
I think she fell because of us.

107
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,635
Excuse me. Are you okay?

108
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,970
-Why did you bump into her?
-Aunt!

109
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,061
MISSING PERSON: JO JAE-YOUNG

110
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,234
We're sorry.

111
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,778
We've been posting these posters
and we heard that

112
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,030
someone's been after us because of this.

113
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,366
That's why we were running
after posting one.

114
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,867
See, I told you so.

115
00:08:55,409 --> 00:09:00,289
The poster we put up here fell off
after it got soaked in the rain.

116
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,084
Okay, I heard you.
How many times have you said that?

117
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,879
So we coated the posters this time.

118
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:08,798
Isn't it better, Aunt?

119
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,387
MISSING PERSON: JO JAE-YOUNG

120
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:21,727
We used a different photo
instead of the one you gave us.

121
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,563
Jae-young looks

122
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,524
a whole lot better in this one.

123
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,821
Thanks. Jae-young looks so pretty.

124
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:32,947
Don't you think so?

125
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,491
You should have blurred your faces though.

126
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,076
See, I told you so.

127
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,079
We knew that would have been better.

128
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,332
But we didn't want to blur out our faces.

129
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,710
Why not?

130
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:48,629
When we blurred our faces in the photo,

131
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,299
Jae-young looked lonely in the picture.

132
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,176
That's why we didn't do it.

133
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,800
Yes, it's me.
Why weren't you answering your phone?

134
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,595
I just got home after going somewhere.

135
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,597
Is there something urgent?

136
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,057
He agreed to do the interview.

137
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,935
Hello? Are you there?

138
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,270
He said he'd do it.

139
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,064
Yes, I'm here.

140
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,775
You just have to coordinate the schedule.

141
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:55,696
You'll finally get to meet
the infamous terrorist, Jo Kyung-ho.

142
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,498
Hey, let's take a short break.
You'll catch a cold.

143
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,499
Okay, Aunt.

144
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,959
We posted a poster over there too.

145
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:14,090
Hey, do we need to post another one here?

146
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,841
-It's shielded from the rain.
-You're right.

147
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,718
Yes! We saved some.

148
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:20,805
Did you bring anything?

149
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,267
JUST DIE

150
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,644
Can you give me some more?

151
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,482
I just want the broth.

152
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,569
It's still steaming hot.

153
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:40,908
Aunt.

154
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,120
Here, have some.

155
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,585
JUST DIE

156
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,921
What is this?

157
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,300
How could someone write that?
People are horrible.

158
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:05,808
Aunt.

159
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,114
If you forgive men their trespasses,

160
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:24,869
your heavenly Father
will also forgive you.

161
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,967
Everyone, please be quiet.

162
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,678
I shall continue.

163
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:48,517
But if you don’t forgive men
their trespasses…

164
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,103
Do you know what I'm holding?

165
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,105
This is one of the rocks

166
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,150
that was thrown
through the window of my mom's restaurant.

167
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:59,987
This rock was thrown
at my mother with deadly intent.

168
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,239
She's a person who decided to lead

169
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:05,868
a quiet life running a restaurant.
She's sorry for the victims.

170
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,038
Why does she have to be treated like this?

171
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:12,124
Is it okay to do this
to the family members of a terrorist?

172
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,126
Is it fair

173
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,545
to despise and scorn

174
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,464
my niece, Jae-young?

175
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,965
Ms. Jo Jung-hyun!

176
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,300
I understand your pain.

177
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,887
But why did you come to
our congregation to say that?

178
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,848
I agree, Father.

179
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,854
This isn't the only place in town
where you can find a rock like this.

180
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,940
Such a round, black rock.

181
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,650
But I've only spotted

182
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,529
this kind of rock
in the parking lot of this church.

183
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:46,659
I truly want to believe
that it's just a coincidence.

184
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,161
So I'd like to ask you all.

185
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,331
You all believe that Jae-young,
my mother, and I

186
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,500
have not committed any sin, right?

187
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,794
And you all pray that Jae-young

188
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,005
will return home safely, don't you?

189
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:07,680
Let me speak for all of us, if I may.

190
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,432
I agree with what you said, Ms. Jo.

191
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,935
But many members of my congregation

192
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,397
have lost a loved one due to your brother.

193
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:22,152
So do not test the limits
of their patience.

194
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,362
Do not accuse them

195
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,490
of committing such an act.

196
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,617
Don't hurl fabrications at them

197
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,328
that will further deepen
their hatred towards your family.

198
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,998
I implore you.

199
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,249
Please

200
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,751
leave this town.

201
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,630
That will be the best for everyone.

202
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:49,930
No.

203
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,478
No. Father. What you said is wrong.

204
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,232
Not my entire family.

205
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:04,612
The person you should direct your hate ti
is Jo Kyung-ho and me.

206
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,488
Just the two of us.

207
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,866
So hate me if you want.

208
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:14,663
Go ahead and curse me and say vile things.

209
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,625
If you could for even a brief moment,

210
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,047
pray for Jae-young.

211
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,467
Please pray for her.

212
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,929
Pray for her safe return

213
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,308
so that she can go back to school

214
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,436
and see her friends.

215
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,522
That's all…

216
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,778
I wanted to say to you today.

217
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,272
Mom, I'm home.

218
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,383
Is it…

219
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,431
Jae-young.

220
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,600
There you go again.

221
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,520
Is that all you ever have to say?

222
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,815
Kyung-joo?

223
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:05,941
Jung-hyun.

224
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:07,943
You know what?

225
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,114
I had a good marriage.

226
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,243
Although we weren't living comfortably,

227
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,372
my husband and I were very happy together.

228
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,584
Are you Kyung-joo?

229
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,134
Why?

230
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,055
Why did it have to be us?

231
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,811
Why did it have to be me?

232
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,898
Because we were your friend?

233
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,652
Kyung-joo. I'm really…

234
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:55,449
I didn't want anything in life.

235
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,118
I just wanted to live happily

236
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,038
with my husband. That was all.

237
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,165
I didn't need anything else.

238
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,416
Kyung-joo…

239
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,710
I didn't want to die.

240
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,003
I'm sorry.

241
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:09,963
I'm sorry, Kyung-joo…

242
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,673
No.

243
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,967
It's too late.

244
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,436
What happened to us

245
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,272
shouldn't happen to other people.

246
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,532
MYSTERY MAP: VACATION HOME
AMONG THE SEVEN SECRET SPOTS

247
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,746
I'm sorry. But…

248
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,834
What? What are you sorry about?

249
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:33,088
Well, I told the boss
I would go by myself.

250
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,466
But he brought me along
because we have to collect a debt.

251
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,760
I'm sorry for bothering you two.

252
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,512
I can't take hints well sometimes.

253
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,432
Hey, why are you saying unnecessary stuff?

254
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,684
Oh, I really appreciate your help.

255
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,103
Both of you are helping me
despite being busy.

256
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,898
That's really kind of you to say that.

257
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,692
After we do the job, you can drop me off.

258
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,402
Have dinner together.

259
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:58,655
There's a terrific grilled eel restaurant
near Namgang Bridge.

260
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:02,201
The boss can grill eel
really well, you know.

261
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,285
Pig.

262
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,120
Yes, Boss.

263
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:09,082
What do you think I'll do
if you keep on talking?

264
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,877
I think you'll grab my mouth again.

265
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,046
Let's try to be quiet, okay?

266
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,297
All right. Get some rest.

267
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,553
Are you feeling all right?

268
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,014
Yes. I'm fine, Yong-tak.

269
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,328
This is it, right?

270
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,665
It's exactly how it looks in the picture.

271
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,667
I don't think anyone lives here anymore.

272
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,013
Anyone home?

273
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,521
It seems like the doorbell is broken.
I don't hear anything.

274
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,315
What is this place?

275
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,485
Beats me.

276
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:23,865
-I don't remember ever coming here before.
-It's my first time here too.

277
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,244
Boss, the door is open.

278
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,178
You know the brother
who lives in Samcheonggol?

279
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:48,140
The place where he lives
looks just like this place.

280
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,644
Is it okay for us to come inside?

281
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,605
This place looks like a battlefield.

282
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,358
It seems like
they cut off the electricity.

283
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:02,446
It looks abandoned to me. Let's leave
after we take a quick look around.

284
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,826
What are these stains?

285
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:08,910
Aren't these

286
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:10,954
bloodstains?

287
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,081
Oh, gosh.

288
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,293
I'm getting a bad feeling about this.

289
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,129
What's strange is that

290
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:22,132
this place looks different
from how it looks in the photo.

291
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:24,176
Is that so? What does it look like there?

292
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:27,220
Everything looks darker.

293
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,515
Come over here. Both of you.

294
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:38,899
Pig.

295
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,569
-We have a flashlight in the car, right?
-Yes.

296
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:54,623
Boss, if anything happens,
holler for help.

297
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:55,874
Otherwise, I might not hear you.

298
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,336
Just stand watch, man.

299
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:02,297
Okay, Boss. Be careful down there.

300
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,229
This is it.

301
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,566
What is all of this?

302
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,489
What a mess.

303
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:31,034
What the heck happened here?

304
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,087
Well, we finally found it.

305
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,047
There's not much to it.

306
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,300
No, there is.

307
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:48,969
This is impossible.

308
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:54,683
No one gave the school magazine club
tips on the location of the secret spots.

309
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,602
It was only after
the magazine article became popular

310
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,855
that people began submitting tips.

311
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:01,815
So?

312
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:04,234
This is a remote private property.

313
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:09,030
It's impossible for anyone
to find this place by themselves

314
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:10,907
without a tip.

315
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,620
-Then…
-One member of the magazine club

316
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,999
already knew about this place.

317
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,336
And they knew
who drew that symbol there and why.

318
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,343
Jung-hyun.

319
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,514
Let's get out of here. Now.

320
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,552
Yong-tak.

321
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,560
Yong-tak?

322
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,354
Yong-tak.

323
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:37,535
This is maddening.
I think I have an upset stomach.

324
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,621
I'm getting nervous because of you.

325
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,625
Why were we picked for this duty?

326
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,585
Just follow the procedure
and it'll be all right.

327
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,255
Sir,

328
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:51,508
I'm absolutely certain
he's behind the prison warden's death.

329
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:52,634
Don't you think so?

330
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,179
-It's just a baseless rumor.
-Damn it.

331
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,931
You did hear what to do.

332
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:00,684
If you just follow two rules,
you'll be fine.

333
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:03,895
If he says anything to you,
don't answer him.

334
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:07,440
And don't ever meet his eyes.

335
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,567
Understand?

336
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,194
Yes, sir.

337
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,113
Let's get going now. We'll be late.

338
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:15,782
Damn it.

339
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,916
Please escort the prisoner.

340
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:14,799
This way.

341
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,565
Stop right there.

342
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,777
Read it and then sign it.

343
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:56,007
Excuse me.

344
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,180
Can I borrow your pen? I don't have one.

345
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:07,977
That pen.

346
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:25,662
OCTOBER 4, 1999
JO KYUNG-HO

347
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,490
Oh, I forgot the cap.

348
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,626
Do I go in now?

349
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,522
Hello Jo Kyung-ho. Nice to meet you.

350
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,019
Oh, gosh.

351
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:15,480
Are you awake?

352
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,317
Who are you people?

353
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,111
You're confused, aren't you?
Sorry about that.

354
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:26,074
Your friends seem to be gangsters.

355
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,868
So we had to take some extreme measures.

356
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,245
What are you doing to them?

357
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,290
The fumes are really strong.

358
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,042
I can smell the gasoline from here.

359
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,298
What are you doing?

360
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,384
No! Stop!

361
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,346
Look.

362
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,015
I need you to make a promise.

363
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,269
If you comply,
we'll stop what we're doing.

364
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:58,106
I have a plan, you see.

365
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:01,025
And I need you for this plan to work.

366
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,027
What are you talking about?

367
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,531
You're not in a position
to negotiate, you know.

368
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:10,618
Don't try to strategize.
Just focus on the present situation.

369
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:13,246
Make a decision.

370
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,333
Ms. Jo Jung-hyun, what will it be?

371
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:20,461
Will you be a part of my plan?

372
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,089
Yes?

373
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:27,886
All right. I'll do it.

374
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:28,970
You will?

375
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:32,974
But can I trust you?

376
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,727
I'm a very busy person.

377
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:38,146
I don't want to use
such cruel methods again.

378
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,107
I'm busy.

379
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,734
I'll keep my promise.

380
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:44,861
So spare their lives.

381
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,414
I'm not sure about this.

382
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,499
I'll believe you anyway.

383
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,795
A partnership begins
by trusting each other's words, right?

384
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,505
Isn't that so?

385
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:09,093
Jung-hyun, we've got
a strong karmic connection.

386
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:11,095
Don't you agree?

387
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,723
This is all thanks to him.

388
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,351
Even how we're both here right now.

389
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,103
What are you talking about?

390
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,357
We've met before?

391
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,943
Oh my goodness. I almost forgot.

392
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,779
I see that you might not recognize me.

393
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,868
It'll be all right.

394
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,329
Because you and I

395
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:39,916
might have to go through
a life-and-death situation. Right?

396
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:47,465
Do you remember
the One Family Welfare Center?

397
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:50,969
I'm

398
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,805
Lim In-gwan.

399
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,228
All right.

400
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,356
So come to the address
on my business card.

401
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,774
Let's have tea, okay?

402
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,735
Let's go home, boys.

403
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,122
Lim In-gwan…

404
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:23,084
Could you elaborate on that
in more detail?

405
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,841
Mr. Jo Kyung-ho,
I'll repeat the question.

406
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,052
What kind of experiment is it?

407
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:39,267
You're not going to answer that?

408
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:52,864
Mr. Jo Kyung-ho.

409
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,244
This is a good lighter.

410
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,874
Don't you think so?

411
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,454
You're back? How are your friends?

412
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,748
They're getting better.

413
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:28,209
Luckily, they weren't seriously
injured or anything.

414
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,128
Gosh, that's a relief to hear.

415
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:33,464
How about you? Have you eaten?

416
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:36,634
I fixed lunch for you.
Do you have time to eat?

417
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,470
I have to return to the hospital.
I came to pick up some stuff.

418
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,680
Oh, really?

419
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:44,767
You need to hurry back then.

420
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:51,149
No, I think I'll eat lunch first.

421
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,400
You will?

422
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,901
I need to eat to have energy.

423
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,821
Wow.

424
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,907
-Thanks for the meal.
-Sure.

425
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,453
-Mom.
-Yes?

426
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,497
I met that person today.

427
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,707
Who?

428
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:08,916
Lim In-gwan.

429
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,085
Do you remember him?

430
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,753
He was the director of
the One Family Welfare Center.

431
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,423
But I had no memory of him.

432
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:17,884
So I didn't recognize his face.

433
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:19,886
I have something to ask.

434
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:23,264
Did something happen to me
when I was at the welfare center?

435
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:27,185
Can you tell me
anything you remember from that time?

436
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:32,523
Jung-hyun, this is what I think.

437
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,400
There are

438
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,403
some things in the past

439
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,697
that are better to be forgotten.

440
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,657
I've decided

441
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,410
to bury that past.

442
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,330
Don't you think you should forget things

443
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,665
that need to be forgotten?

444
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,669
Mom, I…

445
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,176
Okay.

446
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,386
I understand what you're saying.

447
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:05,806
All right.

448
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:14,732
But don't you remember that?

449
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,276
The director's daughter

450
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,612
would visit the welfare center
with her dad

451
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:23,532
and she was particularly nice to you
out of all the other kids.

452
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,245
She was?

453
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,413
I don't remember.

454
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,290
Oh, I see.

455
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,921
She was pretty and very nice.

456
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:42,593
I didn't see her much after I quit
working at the welfare center.

457
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,513
I saw her once

458
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,015
after she was all grown up.

459
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,143
You did? When was this?

460
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,437
It was…

461
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,068
in 1987.

462
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,738
A few days before the terrorist attack,

463
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,659
she came to my restaurant.

464
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:12,456
This isn't a simple interview, is it?

465
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,584
What is the question
you really want to ask?

466
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,879
Should I say it out loud for you?

467
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:23,718
Am I involved in
the kidnapping of my daughter?

468
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:28,014
Do I have anything to do with
the murders or the Youngjin sect?

469
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:32,268
What is the real purpose
behind these incidents?

470
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:33,894
Am I right?

471
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,150
Or maybe not?

472
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:44,405
What you're really curious
about is this, isn't it?

473
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,034
Who is Guru?

474
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:51,078
Could I be Guru?

475
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,205
Then please answer the question.

476
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:54,999
Mr. Jo.

477
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,418
Are you Guru?

478
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,588
I guessed it correctly.
That was it all along, right?

479
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,215
Mr. Jo.

480
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:08,220
It's amusing.

481
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:14,185
You already picked an answer,
but you keep asking the same question.

482
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,317
You're right.

483
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:24,362
I'm Guru.

484
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:34,163
Isn't that what you want to hear?

485
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,505
But there's something I have to tell you
before we get into that.

486
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:46,717
I didn't come here to tell you
what you want to hear.

487
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:47,843
What do you mean?

488
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:51,055
Let's stop wasting each other's time.

489
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,599
I don't have anything else to say to you.

490
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,017
What do you think about that?

491
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,103
Detective Choi.

492
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:01,732
You're the one
who wants to talk to me, right?

493
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,527
Now that will be more interesting.

494
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,072
Because I have a lot of stories

495
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:12,118
to tell about you
that you're not aware of.

496
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,163
Look here, Mr. Jo.

497
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,665
So are you ready to hear it?

498
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,333
What do you mean?

499
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,793
Listen to what I say.

500
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:26,757
It's about your late wife, Lim Se-yoon.

501
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,053
I didn't know

502
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,557
she was the director's daughter
when she came to our restaurant.

503
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,726
She told me when she was paying the bill.

504
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,150
Did you enjoy the food?

505
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,317
That'll be 2,000 won.

506
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,413
I was minding the restaurant
while carrying Jae-young on my back.

507
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:59,081
So it was a hectic day.

508
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,333
But she was

509
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,502
acting weird.

510
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:06,005
She came by herself at a very late hour.

511
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:10,342
So I asked a couple of questions.
How her life was and such.

512
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:14,305
She told me she got married
and lived in Seoul.

513
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,640
But she recently moved back to our town.

514
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:19,018
Her husband was a police officer.

515
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:21,729
A police officer?

516
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:24,106
What kind of nonsense

517
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,151
are you talking about?

518
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:28,319
Detective Choi.

519
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:34,825
After your wife died, you've lived
with regrets all your life, right?

520
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,244
You hated me.

521
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:40,331
You hated the world.
You're barely hanging on.

522
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,833
-Hey, Kyung-ho.
-But what's funny is…

523
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:47,296
you don't know
the source of the rage within you

524
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:51,675
that keeps growing day by day.
Why is that?

525
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,511
It's because

526
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,971
you don't know anything.

527
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,933
You don't know why your wife left you

528
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:02,561
and why she was at Saju Station
on that particular date and time

529
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,689
when the attack occurred.

530
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,692
That's enough.

531
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,319
That day, you were…

532
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,531
I mean, I'm talking
about the day your wife died.

533
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:19,161
Do you think you could have stopped it
if you were able to go back in time?

534
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:23,415
Do you think you could have saved her?

535
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:24,583
Damn it.

536
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,671
Shut up, you bastard.

537
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,214
I'll answer that for you.

538
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:34,385
You could

539
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:38,055
never have saved your wife.

540
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:39,348
You bastard.

541
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,892
Do you know why your wife left you?

542
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,811
The unborn baby you had with her…

543
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:46,897
You named it Gureum.

544
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:48,983
After your wife's miscarriage,

545
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:52,278
she wanted to start
a whole, new life with me.

546
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:55,406
She and I went to Japan together.

547
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:02,246
But later on,

548
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,750
it occurred to me.

549
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,715
I think she came to the restaurant

550
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:18,554
to see Jae-young.

551
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:21,682
I think she might have been

552
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,352
Jae-young's mother.

553
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:38,616
So her death wasn't in vain.

554
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,492
She had a baby before she died.

555
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:42,620
To start a new life with me
and to usher in a new beginning.

556
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:43,996
Understand?

557
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:46,498
It wasn't you.

558
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:49,960
I was the one she loved in the end.

559
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:55,507
-Hold him down!
-Detective Choi.

560
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:58,302
-Detective Choi, calm down.
-Let go!

561
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:01,221
-Please calm down.
-You bastard!

562
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,515
-Detective Choi, calm down.
-Let go!

563
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,142
Let go of me!

564
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:07,728
-Please calm down.
-Please!

565
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:10,314
You bastard! Let go.

566
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:12,024
Let go of me!

567
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:18,322
Master, I brought you your meal.

568
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:20,741
Okay.

569
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:46,016
I'll wait outside the door.
After you're done eating--

570
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,184
You know…

571
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,646
-I'm sorry, but…
-Pardon?

572
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:53,065
we're the same age, aren't we?

573
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,317
I think we are.

574
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,362
Yes, I also think so.

575
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:00,781
You know…

576
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:05,119
Could you just talk to me
without saying, "Master?"

577
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,413
You're always serving me food like this.

578
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:10,499
Oh, I wouldn't dare to.

579
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:14,378
Do it as a favor. Can we just be friends?

580
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:22,553
The representative gave me orders
to always address you respectfully.

581
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:25,097
How about only when
nobody is around except us?

582
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:31,228
Okay. When there's nobody around, I'll…

583
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:34,940
Thanks.

584
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:37,151
I really need someone to talk to.

585
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,446
What's your name? I'm Jo Jae-young.

586
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:43,574
I… I'm Yoon Shi-young.

587
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,869
Oh, nice to know you, Shi-young.

588
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,204
And

589
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,583
can you just talk freely

590
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:56,044
if it's not too much of a trouble?

591
00:45:58,755 --> 00:45:59,840
All right, I guess.

592
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,175
Yes!

593
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:06,805
I was nervous that you might say no.

594
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,809
-But you know what.
-Yes?

595
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:12,144
I think the representative is here.

596
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:19,985
Is the successor in?

597
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,821
I just served the master her meal.

598
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,239
Can I come in?

599
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:26,158
Yes, come in.

600
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,422
I've told you many times before.

601
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,967
You must address the successor properly.

602
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,513
I'm sorry.

603
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:51,475
And when she is eating,
you're supposed to wait outside.

604
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,312
I needed to ask him about my meals.
That's why he's here.

605
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:56,980
I see.

606
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:01,818
Raise your head.

607
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:05,697
You have a great responsibility
in serving the successor.

608
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:06,823
Please take it seriously.

609
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:08,575
Okay.

610
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,877
I have something to tell you.

611
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:31,014
I heard that

612
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,892
you failed in attaining
enlightenment again today.

613
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:37,896
Yes.

614
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,693
Yes? That's not the proper answer.

615
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:44,611
How can you say that so easily?

616
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:48,198
Do you know what position you occupy
in our religious movement?

617
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,158
He'll be very disappointed.

618
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,244
Guru will be very dismayed
when he hears this.

619
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:57,457
If this continues,
I won't be able to keep my promise.

620
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:01,336
The promise I made
to protect your family members.

621
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:05,340
I'm sorry. I'll try harder.

622
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,426
You've been saying that for months!

623
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:10,387
I'm very scared.

624
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:15,267
I don't sense it from you, Successor.
The energy that he emanates.

625
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:25,360
Please don't forget
that you're his bloodline, Successor.

626
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:27,654
Please take time

627
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,866
to reflect on yourself.

628
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:35,454
Today, I wish you'll focus on
practicing Kundalini.

629
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:37,331
Do you understand?

630
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:40,292
Yes.

631
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,593
Then please eat your meal, Successor.

632
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,563
You girls already got here.

633
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,691
I thought I would get here sooner.

634
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:47,275
Hi Aunt.

635
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:50,237
Seung-hyun's dad gave us a ride.
So it didn't take long.

636
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:54,116
How are you feeling?

637
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:55,909
Oh my. Don't worry about me.

638
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:58,912
I'm fit enough to win an Olympic
gold medal if I were competing right now.

639
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:00,789
Mister, stop eating it all.

640
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:03,291
Leave some for him.
He hasn't tried it yet.

641
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:04,668
You should stop eating it.

642
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:07,295
Hi.

643
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,506
What are you doing?

644
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:12,801
She asked me to help her with this.

645
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:15,470
Darn. It's not easy.

646
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,723
-What is it?
-Turning a tape inside-out.

647
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:21,226
-Inside-out?
-Yes.

648
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:23,395
You can listen to
the reverse side this way.

649
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:28,400
They were interviewing him and then…

650
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,987
It happened so quickly.

651
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:00,932
Let's leave this room first.

652
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:03,393
Seung-dae, go and gather our equipment.

653
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:15,697
It was still recording this whole time.

654
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:26,708
How did you find this magazine issue?

655
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,961
There was one copy left
at the school library.

656
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:32,798
Jae-young told us to check the 1987 issue.

657
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:36,802
So we read the entire magazine.

658
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:39,304
And?

659
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:40,806
At first, we thought Jae-young

660
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:44,643
was telling us to read the article
about the mysteries.

661
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:47,479
But that wasn't it.

662
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:50,816
If you look at the very back,
you'll understand.

663
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:54,528
GYEONGCHEON HIGH SCHOOL
SCHOOL MAGAZINE CLUB

664
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:55,737
What about this?

665
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:58,865
No, the last page.

666
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:02,619
There's nothing on the last page.

667
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:06,665
What is this?

668
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:08,041
THIS IS OUR SECRET.
PLAY THE CASSETTE TAPE IN REVERSE

669
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:12,045
We don’t know who wrote that.

670
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:17,175
But I think Jae-young
is talking about that.

671
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:22,389
We couldn't figure out
how to play a tape in reverse.

672
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:24,891
But a few days ago, we found the solution.

673
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,353
You have to flip the tape upside down.

674
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,231
Which tape?

675
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:36,111
The cassette tape you gave to the police?

676
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,237
Yes.

677
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:41,366
Someone left it in front of
the broadcasting room and then ran away.

678
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:46,037
Actually, I made a copy

679
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,707
when I had it.

680
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:50,876
Just in case.

681
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:54,838
Hey, I sure put my skills to work today.

682
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:57,215
I'm done.

683
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,676
Are you both ready to listen to it?

684
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,156
I remember putting it in my bag.

685
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:23,742
I knew you'd forget.

686
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:26,244
Then why didn't you bring yours?

687
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:29,623
My sister uses my cassette player
to study English.

688
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:31,833
What now?

689
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,501
We can't listen to it?

690
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:36,212
Maybe we can ask a nurse.

691
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:39,049
They must have a cassette player
somewhere in this hospital.

692
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,134
Girls.

693
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:46,264
Could I take this with me
and listen to it at home?

694
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,266
Well, that's…

695
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:51,102
Please.

696
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:55,690
Okay, Aunt. You can borrow it.

697
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,609
Aunt should be the one
to listen to it first.

698
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:58,860
See.

699
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:01,071
It worked out fine, right?

700
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:03,323
No, not really.

701
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,368
Why? You forgot to bring the player.

702
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,746
-Look, because I didn't bring it…
-It's your fault.

703
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:18,880
I'm sorry for
getting you involved in this.

704
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:22,384
It's okay. I've seen worse things happen
during interviews with inmates.

705
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:24,052
Don't let this bother you.

706
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:26,346
Let's talk again after you get some rest.

707
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,975
I'll give you the interview recordings
when I meet you next time.

708
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,769
Could you please do that? Thanks.

709
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:02,025
Hey, make sure you lock the door
when you leave.

710
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,905
-Thanks.
-Sure.

711
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:10,492
All right.

712
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:16,498
Let's see if we recorded everything.

713
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:23,797
Number three.

714
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:10,844
What's that?

715
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:33,992
-Are you heading home?
-Yes. Good night.

716
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:35,618
-Good night.
-Good night.

717
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:43,960
PROFESSOR KOO BYUNG-MIN

718
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,265
Yes, Honey.

00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:00,268
I'm going home soon.

720
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:03,021
I'll arrive sooner, I guess.

721
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:06,399
I bought all the items
in the list you texted me.

722
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,151
Is there anything else you need?

723
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,446
I'll see you later, Honey.

724
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:05,291
I keep seeing a lady.

725
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:10,547
She's crouched inside the bathtub.

726
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:15,802
She keeps following me.

727
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:19,305
If…

728
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:21,558
If I weren't you,

729
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:23,685
I would've never gone to that cram school.

730
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:25,562
Guru…

731
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:28,523
And I wouldn't have
listened to him either.

732
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:32,110
If you hadn't come to this town,

733
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:35,029
this wouldn't be happening to me.

734
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:40,243
Now the lady is

735
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:43,371
coming closer.

736
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:50,044
They're going to take you away.

737
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:55,300
I wonder if you can escape.

738
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,433
Now the lady

739
01:00:04,225 --> 01:00:05,810
is right in front of me.

740
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,860
It's because of you that I'll die.

741
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:29,417
Jo Jae-young,

742
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:31,753
you killed me.

743
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:06,245
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

744
01:01:06,954 --> 01:01:10,416
All of the places we've visited so far
are connected to one person.

745
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:13,670
He won't stop. There'll be more victims.

746
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:15,880
You're not making any sense, damn it.

747
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:19,050
-I'm willing to help you.
-You're part of the cult too.

748
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:20,468
Why did you do that?

749
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:21,761
Yong-tak.

750
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:24,931
Whoever watched the videotape
won't survive.

751
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:28,893
You can't change a predetermined future.

752
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:37,610
