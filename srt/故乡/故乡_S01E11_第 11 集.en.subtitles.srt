1
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:47,380
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,674
YEAR 1985

3
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:50,675
Let's go.

4
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,471
Kiddo.

5
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,806
-Clean it up.
-Okay.

6
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,855
Detective.

7
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,108
I'm sorry for asking this, Detective.

8
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,737
But could I have some water?

9
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,238
I'm…

10
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,324
I'm so thirsty.

11
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:20,580
-It's raining on Yeongdong Bridge
-It's raining on Yeongdong Bridge

12
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:24,042
-Trying to forget but I can't
-Trying to forget but I can't

13
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,502
Why are you standing up?

14
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,677
Hey, kiddo. Are you in a really good mood?

15
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,638
His father-in-law is Lim In-gwan,

16
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,807
who is really close
to a powerful politician.

17
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,227
So once we wrap up
the One Family Welfare Center case,

18
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,645
he'll be on the fast track for promotions.

19
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,194
Thank you.

20
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:54,322
-Did you have enough?
-Yes. Thank you.

21
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:00,703
Detective.

22
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,083
Could you tell me your name?

23
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,627
-What?
-Well,

24
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,548
I owe my life to you.

25
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,841
Don't say that.

26
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:22,851
Hyung-in.

27
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,645
The name is Choi Hyung-in.

28
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,690
Thank you for telling me.

29
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,861
Thank you, Detective Choi Hyung-in.

30
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,155
My name is…

31
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,489
You don't have to tell me. I already know.

32
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,575
My name is Jo Kyung-ho.

33
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,495
I'm Jo Kyung-ho, Detective Choi Hyung-in.

34
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:44,998
I'm Jo Kyung-ho.

35
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,209
My name is Jo Kyung-ho.

36
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,797
Detective. My name is Jo Kyung-ho.

37
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:53,715
Could you

38
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,926
bring all the dongdongju wine you have?

39
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,344
We'll order all of it.

40
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,804
Wow.

41
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:03,099
The kiddo knows how to party.
He's a real man.

42
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,018
Let's drink all night.

43
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,185
Have a drink.

44
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,145
Senior detectives.

45
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,897
I took off my pants, as you can see.

46
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:12,150
And I'll drink all night so…

47
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,610
I'd like to

48
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,072
be taken off this case. I'm sorry.

49
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:21,451
I'll do whatever you tell me
to do tonight.

50
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,828
Hey, kiddo. You're drunk. So sit down now.

51
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,955
-No, I won't sit down.
-I said sit down, you bastard!

52
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,876
Fine! Damn it!

53
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,753
Call me a bastard all you want.

54
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,048
-I'll put up with any insults.
-Why you!

55
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,300
Do whatever you want to me.
Beat me up or kill me.

56
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,552
But I can't do this anymore.
I quit this case.

57
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:40,637
I've had enough.

58
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:42,680
Okay?

59
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,475
I've had enough!

60
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,985
OVERSEAS PUBLIC SECURITY HEAD OFFICE

61
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,237
Damn it.

62
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,577
Mister…

63
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,748
Can I ask you for a little favor?

64
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,594
SOOK CHINESE RESTAURANT

65
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,390
I asked my aunt and grandma

66
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:11,561
to move back here.

67
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,065
They probably didn't want to
come back to this town.

68
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,443
I insisted that we move here.

69
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,237
Why did you want to come here?

70
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:24,949
Jo Kyung-ho.

71
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,954
He said he would tell me about my mom.

72
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,959
He said my late mom had

73
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,629
left behind traces in this town

74
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,302
which I could see for myself if I came.

75
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,434
I stubbornly insisted that
my family move back here.

76
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,315
If I hadn't been so stubborn,
do you think Lee Kyung-jin

77
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,568
would be still alive?

78
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,279
And what's happening to my aunt now…

79
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,450
Would none of this had happened?

80
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,047
Nobody will pass through
this underpass today, right?

81
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,217
Who would come here
when it's raining so hard?

82
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,259
Right.

83
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,595
Let's head home before it gets dark.

84
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:30,890
I don't like putting out the candles.

85
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,642
Don't obsess over that.

86
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,686
How can a candle burn
for 24 hours straight?

87
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,146
Leave her alone.

88
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,816
She comes here every day
at the break of dawn, you know.

89
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,275
And lights the candles
that went out overnight.

90
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,029
Moon-sook can be so determined.

91
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,281
Wonder why you don't study
with that kind of determination.

92
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,991
-I just like this.
-Like what?

93
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,536
Jae-young likes a nostalgic mood.

94
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,371
So if she were to come here

95
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:56,541
and see these candles,
it would make her feel so great.

96
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,055
Good thing we didn't leave yet.

97
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,640
Someone is coming.

98
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,007
Moon-sook.

99
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,427
I came.

100
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,907
Don't cry.

101
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,409
I missed you so much.

102
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,795
SISTER, PLEASE COME HOME BEFORE WINTER

103
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,839
HOPE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SPEND
CHRISTMAS WITH YOUR FAMILY

104
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,884
You waited for me this whole time.

105
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:33,930
Thanks so much.

106
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,057
It

107
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,768
wasn't just us who were waiting.

108
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,561
Your aunt set this up.

109
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,605
It was your aunt who moved

110
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,190
the hearts of the townspeople.

111
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,400
She never gave up.

112
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,197
I see.

113
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,202
Nobody seems to be coming.

114
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:00,206
We told all the followers that you,

115
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,166
the successor, would be here today.

116
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,677
Nobody is here. It's an empty room.

117
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,433
It's disappointing that you don't
have the trust of our followers.

118
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,311
What are you looking at?

119
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,313
Am I not welcome here?

120
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,900
I need to watch over you

121
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,736
to make sure that you are carrying on

122
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,115
Guru's visions through your teachings

123
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,450
and see how well your escape plan
is coming along.

124
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:42,248
Isn't they why you came here
on your own volition?

125
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,833
Your plan was to
let Guru's daughter escape

126
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,626
and when you got the chance,
you'd escape, too.

127
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,003
Believe whatever you want.

128
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,465
But did you know this, Jung-hyun?

129
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,179
Before your plan even gets off the ground,

130
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,015
the Day of Purification will happen.

131
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:00,891
You're already late.

132
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,977
The future cannot be altered.

133
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,021
We will reach the end
of the predetermined future

134
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,147
and reach salvation.

135
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:10,276
Why would you want to die like a dog?

136
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,777
What do you get out of it?

137
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,199
Don't question me.

138
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,161
You don't know anything.

139
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,371
You're not the successor and never were.

140
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:24,832
Do you really believe

141
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,251
that this is worth

142
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:31,505
sacrificing your life for?

143
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,258
You better shut up.

144
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,845
You'll be helping me tomorrow.

145
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,306
You just have to carry the bag
to Saju Station…

146
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:44,060
Then release the nerve gas
after you get a signal from Jung-hyun.

147
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,995
Do you remember the room you locked us in?

148
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,999
It was pitch dark inside that room.

149
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,335
I couldn't even see my own hands.

150
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,005
When I was in there,

151
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,967
I had no sense of sound or smell.

152
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:21,263
That dark room
was the definition of darkness.

153
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,057
I only spent an hour there at first.

154
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,851
Even that felt like an eternity.

155
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:29,313
But I was able to endure it.
There was no way out, anyway.

156
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:33,859
For three hours, five hours and ten hours…

157
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,406
At some point,
you locked us in there all night.

158
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:45,246
In that dark room, I had an experience
that shattered the boundaries of time.

159
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,043
The lines between the past,

160
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,505
present, and future began to fade away.

161
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,594
Suddenly, a lot of things
started to change.

162
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:07,017
I was who I was
but also without an identity.

163
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,771
I was cut off

164
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,858
but connected to everything
at the same time.

165
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:23,159
That was probably around the time
I found the ability to control ants.

166
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,829
You could say

167
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,961
all of that was a gift from you to me.

168
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,217
You remember all of it?

169
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,761
I told you that I don't remember events.

170
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:47,057
There are no lines
between the past and present.

171
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,769
What happened in that dark room

172
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,900
is occurring in this moment as well.

173
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:58,736
I'm sorry.

174
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,571
I really am.

175
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,034
What I did was unforgivable.

176
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,954
But could you please spare my life?

177
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,834
For the sake of my young son.

178
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,393
When you'd unlock the door to the room,

179
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,855
you would look at us

180
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,778
with glee while drunk as we were dying.

181
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:47,284
Do you remember
what you would always say to us?

182
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,330
I still vividly remember.

183
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,878
Why are these half-breeds
still not dead yet?

184
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,520
You're a changed person, eh?

185
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,273
Wow.

186
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,037
What's this smell?

187
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:56,664
It's dusty.

188
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:01,001
The detective said
he hasn't been home for a while.

189
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,921
Is it really all right for us
to stay here?

190
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,465
Wouldn't it be too inconvenient?

191
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,967
Oh, it's fine.

192
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:09,843
I'm hardly at home most days.

193
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,930
But you need to be home
and watch over them.

194
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:18,185
Mrs. Jo, we are keeping it a secret
that Jo Jae-young has been found.

195
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:21,355
Until we arrest
every Youngjin Sect cult member,

196
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,816
you're not safe
at your home or at the restaurant.

197
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,652
It still must be an inconvenience.

198
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:27,611
It's really okay.

199
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,697
Come to the precinct with me.

200
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,700
Mrs. Jo, will you be fine
until he comes back?

201
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,451
It won't take long.

202
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,828
Of course, it's fine.

203
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,747
I'll look after them
until they go to sleep.

204
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,541
Don't worry. Take care of your business.

205
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,879
What's that? That's embarrassing.

206
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,715
You brought a doll?

207
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:53,012
I've never slept over at someone's house.
I can't sleep without my doll.

208
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,513
I should've brought my doll, too.

209
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,390
I didn't bring it
because I thought you'd tease me.

210
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,642
I can't stand it.

211
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,067
What's this? Are you sleeping?

212
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,446
You're supposed to be a tough guy.

213
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,423
Is this true?

214
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:33,135
This is a big accusation, you know.

215
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:36,638
That Professor Jang of the Haegol Gang
is a sitting senator.

216
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,140
If it turns out you're wrong,

217
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,768
this will blow up in your face.

218
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:41,935
No.

219
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,607
I also suspected that the professor
was someone in politics.

220
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,653
You're certain it's him?

221
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,946
Detective.

222
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,949
Do you know that my boss is dead?

223
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,826
You mean, Kang Yong-tak?

224
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,996
Don't you think
they're the ones who did it?

225
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,749
LIM IN-GWAN

226
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:14,426
I don't care if the Haegol Gang,
Youngjin Sect or the senator did it.

227
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,844
All I care about

228
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,307
is avenging my boss' death.

229
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,862
Excuse me. I heard
you were close to Jae-young.

230
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,532
Was Jae-young fine while she was here?

231
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:40,119
I don't know. I hardly talked to her.

232
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,331
Oh really?

233
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,793
I guess I misheard.

234
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,130
I was told that you were close to her.

235
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:55,801
No. She didn't care at all about me.

236
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,471
She only thought about using me to escape.

237
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,768
That's the story of my life.
I never had a real friend.

238
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,812
People have always tried to use me.

239
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,023
But I know why.
Because I don't have strength.

240
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,942
I'm weak in spirit
which is why I'm like this.

241
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,111
You know…

242
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,489
Why are you lying?

243
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,868
You think I don't know?

244
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,202
About Jae-young?

245
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,041
Your name is Shi-young, right?

246
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:29,877
Can I ask you

247
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,589
how long you've been
living here, Shi-young?

248
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,592
How many years have the followers

249
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,094
been trapped here?

250
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,345
What's it to you?

251
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,307
You're going to abandon us
and leave just like Jae-young.

252
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,810
Or are you going to be with us
on the Day of Purification?

253
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,521
You're not planning to.

254
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,607
So why the heck did you come here?

255
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:37,486
You had this secret spot all to yourself?

256
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:48,580
Yeah. It would be quiet here
even during lunch recess.

257
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:52,000
Sometimes, I would come
and eat my lunch here alone.

258
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,344
I have something to tell you.

259
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,263
I

260
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,056
want to live with you

261
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,559
in a home for the two of us.

262
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,228
And I want to

263
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,939
go home every day

264
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,068
holding your hand.

265
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:22,948
Will you

266
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,159
marry me?

267
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,683
Se-yoon. Let's get out of here quickly.

268
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:52,894
Se-yoon.

269
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,583
Excuse me, Mister.

270
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,251
Oh, okay.

271
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,171
Do you need anything?

272
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:20,589
Are you all right?

273
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,307
What is this?

274
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,517
It's coke tea.

275
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,144
Coke what?

276
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,438
It's warm coke.

277
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,365
When I couldn't sleep,

278
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,743
my aunt would give me warm coke
without telling grandma.

279
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,620
It'll help you fall asleep.

280
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,095
How does it taste?
It's pretty good, isn't it?

281
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,938
Do you have nightmares often?

282
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,232
Yes, most of the time.

283
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,775
Since when?

284
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:23,068
I don't know.

285
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,195
I don't remember

286
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:27,781
when they started.

287
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,367
Did it start

288
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,870
when you lost your baby?

289
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:37,582
I was curious so we entered

290
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,793
that bedroom.

291
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,003
The baby's room.

292
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:46,550
I was going to tell you we saw the room.

293
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:49,052
But you came home late.

294
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,515
I'm sorry we didn't respect your privacy.

295
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,100
No, it's all right.

296
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,394
Don't let it bother you.

297
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,480
Did you divorce your wife

298
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,733
because you lost your baby?

299
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,695
I see.

300
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:08,947
So that's what you're curious about.

301
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,828
No, that's not the reason.

302
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:16,872
She left

303
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,666
because she didn't like me anymore.

304
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:24,713
I found out
she had a miscarriage much later.

305
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,131
She informed me about it.

306
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,135
There's no need for you to dwell on it.

307
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,764
Your aunt asked me to care for you.

308
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,476
I can see how she might have felt guilty.

309
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:42,189
My wife and Jo Kyung-ho

310
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,316
are your parents.

311
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,902
So she probably got worried

312
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,071
about how I would react to that.

313
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,118
I wanted to ask you

314
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,789
how you felt about me.

315
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:03,585
My wife

316
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,047
didn't give me an explanation
when she left.

317
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,342
Which means she couldn't
stand living with me.

318
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:15,764
So I don't think I have the right
to judge the choice she made.

319
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:17,933
I don't think

320
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,770
I should harbor any ill will
towards you either.

321
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,773
I'm not sure
if that answers your question.

322
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:28,902
It's late. So go to sleep.

323
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:30,570
But…

324
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,657
I don't think people

325
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,326
leave their families without a reason.

326
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:41,164
I think there was a deeper reason
that she couldn't tell you.

327
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,417
Because she cared a lot.

328
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,128
That's how it is with me and my aunt.

329
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:51,800
You can't

330
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,137
explain everything to your family.

331
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,791
This is the room
for ascetic training, right?

332
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:27,252
You hang people upside down
here every night.

333
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:28,962
Well…

334
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:32,257
We learned that it's important training

335
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,302
to understand the true meaning
of Guru's teachings.

336
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,222
I really don't like all of you.

337
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,600
But you shouldn't be doing this.

338
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:45,937
This isn't training.

339
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,148
It's plainly

340
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:50,692
torture.

341
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,404
There's no other way to describe it.

342
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:07,000
I find myself back here
after all those years.

343
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,213
I told you so.

344
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,675
Nothing has changed.

345
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,679
-Oh my goodness.
-What to do?

346
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,766
What is the meaning of this?
How dare you shout in this room!

347
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:35,070
What do you think you're doing?

348
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,914
You think what you did
will make a difference?

349
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:49,417
Are you trying to act like a hero?

350
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,420
We can install a new rope.

351
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,047
What you did is meaningless.

352
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,320
What are you doing?

353
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,618
Stop it. Are you crazy?

354
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:48,226
I wasn't waiting for the
rope to burn to ash.

355
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,478
I wanted to show everyone that

356
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,856
there is no such thing as a rope
that can't be cut down.

357
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,911
Thank you for coming.

358
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,627
We're done, sir.

359
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,427
Would you please excuse me?

360
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,012
I have to receive a guest.

361
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,222
-I'm so sorry.
-That's fine.

362
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,862
Now look here.

363
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:43,281
Don't you have any manners?

364
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,409
How could you come barging here

365
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:49,037
when I'm having dinner
with family and relatives?

366
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,872
And you also brought a knife with you.

367
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:54,584
We've met before, haven't we?

368
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:57,253
I think I met you
at the summer house before.

369
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:01,716
I don't think we started off
on the right foot back then.

370
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:03,885
Now I remember.

371
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:07,305
You were with Kang Yong-tak, weren't you?

372
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,431
That's right.

373
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,185
I came to avenge my boss' death.

374
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:15,438
You're not making any sense, fella.

375
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,274
I'm not the one who did that to him.

376
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,985
Why did you come to
the wrong place for vengeance?

377
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:25,532
I just do business with the Youngjin Sect.

378
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,748
Did you know

379
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:37,001
that the place where your boss died

380
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,380
is where the Youngjin Sect gather to pray?

381
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:45,301
And the representative who leads
the Youngjin Sect is a sly fox.

382
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:48,680
Objectively speaking,

383
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:50,265
it's the representative's fault

384
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,976
that your boss died like that.

385
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,562
So if you want revenge,

386
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,981
you should go after him.

387
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,528
Hey, untie his hands.

388
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,531
You tied his hands so tight

389
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,533
that they're turning purple.

390
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:15,290
If you want to accomplish a lot in life,

391
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,709
you need to be able to tell
who's friend or foe.

392
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:21,170
Seeing the spirit you have,

393
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,715
I just came up with a fantastic idea.

394
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,425
Would you like to hear it?

395
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:29,596
I'm thinking about giving you
a compass that will lead you straight

396
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:33,391
to the representative's room.

397
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,394
That's my idea.

398
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,404
Why did you come here?

399
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,282
I've always wanted to come here.

400
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,451
Where are we?

401
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,461
It's just

402
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:45,797
the school I graduated from.

403
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,899
"Just the school I graduated from."

404
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,169
Mister.

405
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,547
Take a look at this.

406
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:33,428
I asked Jae-young about it
and she said she didn't write it.

407
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:37,932
And the text messages they got
weren't sent by me.

408
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,685
Someone was pretending to be me.

409
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:44,272
Who could have done this? For what?

410
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,775
It was a ploy

411
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,986
to lure your aunt to the cult.

412
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,530
They wanted to release you

413
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:55,742
and have your aunt take your place.

414
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:58,703
I…

415
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:02,749
want to go to the seven secret spots
mentioned here.

416
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:08,337
It could help me find out
where I was held and where my aunt

417
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:09,922
could be right now.

418
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,263
I don't know what this person wants
but we have to stop him.

419
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,431
I want to stop this.

420
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,820
GYEONGCHEON HIGH SCHOOL MAGAZINE
IS SEARCHING FOR CLUES!

421
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,822
PLEASE SEND IN ANY TIPS YOU MAY HAVE

422
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,188
FIRST SECRET PLACE IS THE SAJU
DEER FARM. ITS TRUE PURPOSE?

423
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,037
I'm okay.

424
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:51,500
For real. So don't cry.

425
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,850
Can I see your hand?

426
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,624
Successor.

427
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,419
You need to stop.

428
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,756
We've already made up our minds.

429
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,301
You're too late.

430
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,762
So

431
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,682
leave us alone.

432
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:52,895
Please.

433
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,066
I won't rush anyone.

434
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:59,360
I'll just continue staying in my place.

435
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,571
So if you ever change your mind,

436
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:03,990
come to me.

437
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,658
Even if it's just once.

438
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:06,617
Give me

439
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,328
a chance.

440
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:57,418
Thank you for coming.
I was waiting for you.

441
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:01,505
Everyone. I am not the successor.

442
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:06,135
So I don't have the right
to impart any teachings.

443
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,137
I know that

444
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:12,350
what I'm saying is not what you expected.

445
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:25,905
However, I thought I could do something
even as an insignificant person.

446
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:32,661
Everyone.

447
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,206
Raise your chin. Look into my eyes.

448
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,333
Please.

449
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,959
And come to me and

450
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:40,586
tell me

451
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:42,963
your story.

452
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,299
It doesn't matter what you share with me.

453
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,260
Let me

454
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,347
hear your voices.

455
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,653
Will you

456
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,489
really listen to my story?

457
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,367
Yes,

458
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,577
go ahead.

459
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:14,578
Anything

460
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,372
you want to say.

461
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:18,457
I'm

462
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,460
an orphan.

463
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,754
My parents

464
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:28,259
died in the 1987 terrorist attack
at Saju Station.

465
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:30,678
I moved from one relative's house
to another.

466
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,847
I never went to school.

467
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,191
I think this is it.

468
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,292
Do you think it'll be safe to go in?

469
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,629
Is it?

470
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,467
Mister.

471
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,509
Oh, okay.

472
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:13,220
-You're coming too, right?
-Of course.

473
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:26,192
My fiancee was helping out
at her parent's shop in the station.

474
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:29,320
She cared more about her family

475
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:34,325
and me than herself.

476
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:40,581
When the paramedics
retrieved grandma's body,

477
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,417
they found a half-eaten taffy
in her pocket.

478
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,919
She had trouble walking

479
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,796
but she walked to the station

480
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:52,301
and waited there for me
while sucking on the taffy.

481
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:55,804
My grandma appears in my dreams a lot.

482
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:57,765
And I'll

483
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:00,851
speak to her while crying.

484
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,938
Grandma, don't

485
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,358
come to the station to pick me up.

486
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,110
Please stay home.

487
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,573
Grandma, please don't die.

488
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:18,285
My husband

489
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,704
worked at the train station.

490
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:24,083
I was told he died
while saving other people

491
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,334
in the station.

492
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,547
Why didn't he just save himself first?

493
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,884
I hate him
more than I hate the perpetrators.

494
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,846
Why are you bringing up painful memories?

495
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,310
We've already made up our minds.

496
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:47,022
All of the people here

497
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,775
have lost a loved one

498
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,404
at Saju Station on the day of the attack.

499
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:57,449
They've endured a pain
that's worse than dying.

500
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:01,120
We want salvation now.

501
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,581
We've been forgotten by society.

502
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:04,999
As time went by,

503
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:07,585
people have completely forgotten

504
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,212
the painful experience

505
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:14,675
we underwent.

506
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:18,178
That is why we've chosen this path.

507
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:20,431
Because Guru

508
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,811
has told us he'd join us.

509
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,731
He said

510
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,942
he would share our pain.

511
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:36,447
But who are you?

512
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:40,451
What the heck can you do for us?

513
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,913
You suddenly show up
and try to test our beliefs?

514
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:46,957
Damn it.

515
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:54,006
Why are you looking at us like that?

516
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:10,522
I'm sorry

517
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,985
for neglecting all of you.

518
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,405
I wanted to forget.

519
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,991
I wanted to stay as far away as possible.

520
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,328
That way, I thought

521
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:28,165
I could erase that incident.

522
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,251
But I was very wrong.

523
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,130
I should've met each of you.

524
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,591
And listened

525
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,135
to what

526
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:42,429
you had to say.

527
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:46,266
Someone should've apologized to you.

528
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,729
An apology was in order.

529
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:55,317
I'm sorry.

530
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,028
I'm sorry for

531
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,115
coming so late and forgetting.

532
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,660
I'm sorry.

533
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:08,205
I'm very sorry.

534
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:11,542
I'm sorry.

535
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,211
I'm so sorry.

536
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:16,505
I'm sorry.

537
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:24,012
Moon-sook told me

538
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:27,474
that someone died here

539
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:30,144
in a fire.

540
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:38,986
That drawing.

541
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,573
Jo Kyung-ho.

542
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:44,533
I think Jo Kyung-ho came here.

543
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,171
What's wrong, Mister?

544
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:01,258
Are you okay?

545
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:07,306
I knew it.

546
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,141
Now I know.

547
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:10,851
What?

548
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:15,439
The seven secret spots are all

549
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:17,107
related to my wife.

550
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,234
I've been to each place

551
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:22,279
with my wife before we got married.

552
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:24,865
She wanted to show me around her hometown.

553
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:30,913
Then…

554
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:35,000
"Let's return to our home" means…

555
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:50,724
This is where I proposed to my wife.

556
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,728
So Jo Kyung-ho

557
00:46:56,813 --> 00:46:58,941
has always wanted me to realize it.

558
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:00,734
Something

559
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,530
I should never forget.

560
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:07,783
But he's accusing me of forgetting.

561
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:11,954
That's why he came back here.

562
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:14,915
To tell me that.

563
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:05,716
You're home? My son.

564
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:08,385
You've returned.

565
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:12,639
I see something I don't want to see.

566
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:15,309
Your end.

567
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:18,061
Son.

568
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:24,735
Have you eaten?

569
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,487
Are you hungry, son?

570
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:56,642
My dad and I used to
come here often when I was little.

571
00:48:57,392 --> 00:49:01,104
Dad used to be
an ordinary person and very kind.

572
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:08,487
But you don't understand something.

573
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,990
You can't stop this.

574
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:13,325
Everything

575
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,452
is predetermined.

576
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:17,663
Really?

577
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:24,503
Then should I just
do nothing in that case?

578
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,963
If I can't change your mind,

579
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:29,049
I'm supposed to do nothing?

580
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,551
You expect me to turn a blind eye to

581
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,762
the awful thing that happened to your dad

582
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,347
when he was framed?

583
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:41,186
Am I

584
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:43,563
supposed to do nothing

585
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:48,735
when you're trying to kill my family
and the people of my town?

586
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:50,696
I already told you.

587
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,448
Whatever you say or do
won't change anything.

588
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:56,868
So there's no need
for you to risk your life.

589
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,001
So you can see my future?

590
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:09,923
But I'm not going to avoid what awaits me.

591
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,469
I can't do that.

592
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:28,734
I'm not afraid.

593
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,571
I'm not afraid.

594
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:00,932
Did you watch this tape?

595
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:03,852
Son.

596
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:06,730
My poor son.

597
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:09,775
Why did you do that?

598
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:12,986
Why did my son

599
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:18,158
do such a terrible thing
to the townspeople?

600
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:22,496
My heart had turned to stone.

601
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:23,622
I…

602
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:27,793
Is it my fault

603
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:32,130
that you became like that?

604
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:37,427
Let me ask you one thing.

605
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:41,765
Son.

606
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:44,768
Were you not able to forget that day?

607
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:48,104
When your dad was on his deathbed,

608
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:52,567
he said to us,

609
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:55,028
"Let's all die

610
00:51:57,113 --> 00:52:00,033
together as a family."

611
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,204
I held

612
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:08,333
your hand and Jung-hyun's tightly.

613
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:11,878
With anger in my voice I told him,

614
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:14,798
"Come to your senses, Husband.

615
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:19,386
How could you say such utter nonsense?"

616
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:23,640
And he replied.

617
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:25,767
"Because we're family and

618
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,187
because I love you,

619
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,857
I can't leave you behind."

620
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:35,485
"You crazy man.

621
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:37,237
You pathetic human.

622
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:40,824
No, never.

623
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:44,035
Don't even think about
taking them with you.

624
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,247
If you want to die.

625
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,130
Then die alone.

626
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,302
Die

627
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:06,933
alone."

628
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:10,497
Run away.

629
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,831
Son.

630
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:15,502
I'm sorry.

631
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,092
For neglecting you

632
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:24,761
for all those years.

633
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:26,972
Please run away.

634
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:33,228
My son.

635
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,398
Run away from here.

636
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,989
And prove that what I saw was wrong.

637
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:44,990
Son.

638
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:47,867
Forgive me.

639
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,036
I wished

640
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:52,998
that you could have

641
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:56,668
told me just one

642
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,507
that I was wrong.

643
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,806
What I saw didn't happen.

644
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:11,975
I'm sorry.

645
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:15,770
I'm really sorry.

646
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:18,148
What I did

647
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,067
was shameful.

648
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:25,030
I let you down.

649
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:30,869
I'm so sorry.

650
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:52,265
This will never end.

651
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:58,229
Everyone who sees this.

652
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:17,499
Whoever sees the video

653
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,381
will die no matter what.

654
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:35,266
And will kill the person

655
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:38,019
they love the most.

656
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:53,034
You've returned.

657
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:55,411
At last.

658
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,962
We're all sinners.

659
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:10,009
Sometimes, we question Guru's teachings
and don't understand the true meaning.

660
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:15,598
Until we reach the new future,
our sins will remain with us forever.

661
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,185
That is why it is absolutely necessary

662
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,729
for us to see the Day of Purification.

663
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:26,651
Everyone, I have very good news for you.

664
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,529
He has kept his promise.

665
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:34,117
He will return to us.

666
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:38,079
The promise he made to us
that he would be with us

667
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,208
in the new future has been kept.

668
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:51,551
Guru has returned to us.

669
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:57,765
Now let go of your fear.

670
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:02,854
Let go of any useless attachment
you have to your present life.

671
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:13,323
Let us all

672
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:16,409
welcome him together.

673
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:26,794
Was it you?

674
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:31,049
What do you mean?

675
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:32,300
Did you send

676
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,303
the videotape to her?

677
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:37,805
No, it's not me.

678
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:40,683
I wouldn't dare to. You didn't
give me permission either.

679
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,893
I think

680
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:46,064
Master Jung is behind it.

681
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:50,151
As the representative,
he's been making his own rules.

682
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:53,530
What

683
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,495
do you think I know and don't know?

684
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:02,872
Guru,

685
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:04,374
I…

686
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:06,084
What

687
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:13,341
do you think

688
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,263
I know and don't know?

689
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:22,934
Do you know why I've kept you alive?

690
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:28,189
I can clearly see your future.

691
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:32,193
It's a fitting future for you.

692
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:41,494
I wasn't thinking about killing you.

693
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:47,834
But you kept threatening me so…

694
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:51,963
That I should admit to
what I did at the welfare center.

695
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:54,799
And accept punishment
for my crimes by confessing.

696
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:57,218
What's the point of doing that?

697
00:59:58,219 --> 01:00:00,972
That's in the past.

698
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:05,101
If I go to prison,

699
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:07,520
will that bring back those
dead people to life?

700
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:10,273
Would it?

701
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:12,358
Raise your head.

702
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,168
It's interesting.

703
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:37,383
You're someone
who killed his own daughter.

704
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:39,719
I'll let you join her.

705
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:49,687
No.

706
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:52,523
You could be useful.

707
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:59,989
Now answer my question.

708
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:03,159
I can erase this memory.

709
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:10,041
The memory of you killing your daughter

710
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:16,005
with your own two hands.

711
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:18,299
You're

712
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,136
the one who did it,

713
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:25,098
The cursed kid.

714
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:30,728
You drowned all the people
at the welfare center in the pool.

715
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:32,063
Answer me.

716
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:37,276
Do you want your memories to be erased?

717
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:40,655
Will you become my worker ant?

718
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:51,624
Do it.

719
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:57,130
Erase my memory.

720
01:01:58,172 --> 01:02:00,633
So that I can

721
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,220
be reborn with a clean memory.

722
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:31,307
Grandma…

723
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:42,109
Please be reincarnated into

724
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:46,948
the future daughter I'll have.

725
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:57,166
Then I'll wrap you up in a bundle

726
01:03:58,751 --> 01:04:00,294
and carry you on my back.

727
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:06,717
I'm sorry.

728
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:10,763
I'm sorry.

729
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:13,975
I'm sorry, Grandma.

730
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:44,589
We finished all the preparations.

731
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,635
It's time to return home.

732
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:09,572
She'll learn who she is
when she returns home.

733
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:14,827
Who Jo Jae-young is.

734
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:20,583
Who her parents are.

735
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:37,702
-In return,
-Where is my Auntie?

736
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:39,453
promise me that it'll end with me.

737
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:44,000
My late wife wrote me a letter?

738
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:45,793
What kind of nonsense is this?

739
01:06:45,876 --> 01:06:49,630
Both sides did cruel things.

740
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:51,632
I've waited for this moment my entire life

741
01:06:51,716 --> 01:06:54,093
even though I feared it.

742
01:06:55,761 --> 01:06:56,846
I'll get you!

743
01:06:56,929 --> 01:06:59,432
You can never kill me.

744
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:02,643
I'm the only person

745
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:04,228
who can end my life.

746
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:11,277
