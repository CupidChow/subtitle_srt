1
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:47,380
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,132
There we go.

3
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:54,888
All right, Jae-young! That's nice.

4
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:58,808
Very nice.

5
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:02,187
So cold.

6
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,565
Oh, it's cold.

7
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,026
Oh, it's cold.

8
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,495
-Should I light up the wood?
-Yes.

9
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,562
-Jung-hyun.
-Yes?

10
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,689
There's something I have to tell you.

11
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,732
What is it?

12
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,028
But if you'd rather not hear it,
then that's up to you.

13
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,573
What is it?

14
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,159
You decide. Would you like to hear it?

15
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,772
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

16
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,096
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

17
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,368
-Let's check it out. Come on.
-What's going on?

18
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,044
-What happened to you?
-Go check that area.

19
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,315
Yes, sir.

20
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,567
I've seen the car.

21
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,028
I think it's him.

22
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:55,790
Who's there?

23
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,501
Is it you, Jung-hyun?

24
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,346
Oh gosh, Jung-hyun.

25
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,099
Oh my goodness.

26
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,852
Jung-hyun. Wake up.

27
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,438
-My goodness.
-Mom.

28
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,024
I'm here. Mom is here.

29
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,819
Oh my gosh. I'm right here.

30
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:30,575
I'm okay. Don't cry.

31
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,918
When you went back there,
they'd cleaned up everything, you say?

32
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,962
And all the doors were locked?

33
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:47,216
It looked like an empty building
when I got there.

34
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,969
So I don't think it's their headquarters.

35
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,555
What were they doing then?

36
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,764
Isn't it obvious?

37
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,391
They were engaged in
some kind of religious rite.

38
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,270
They seem to be moving
from place to place to do their rites.

39
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,856
You mean a pilgrimage?

40
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:05,318
The basement of the Skull Gang's compound
was also used for such rites.

41
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,696
-I saw that symbol and…
-What else?

42
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,031
that creepy bell ring.

43
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,492
I clearly heard it back then.

44
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,161
The fact that the Skull Gang
was sharing the same compound

45
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:18,289
with the Youngjin sect
means they are directly connected.

46
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:22,293
But all of the Skull Gang members
were caught and sentenced.

47
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:28,341
I know a guy who was a supplier
for gangs in Busan long ago.

48
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,760
He used to deliver gas tanks,
but he's not working for them anymore.

49
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,428
I'll go and meet with him first.

50
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,763
Who are you talking about?

51
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,765
Are you talking about him?

52
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,809
The guy who is a loan shark?

53
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,604
Wait. What was his name?

54
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:45,525
It was one of those names.
Cow or something.

55
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,651
Pig.

56
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,070
He was called Pig.

57
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,201
Pig.

58
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,702
Yes, Boss.

59
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,412
What were you like in school?

60
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,122
School?

61
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,709
I dropped out of middle school,
so I don't remember much about school.

62
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,004
It's the same with you?

63
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,465
I don't remember much either.

64
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,092
You were on the school's judo team, right?

65
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:14,387
You probably only remember
doing judo back then.

66
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,721
Well…

67
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,682
It's really weird.

68
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:21,477
I don't remember much after 1987.

69
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,396
I don't remember my graduation day

70
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,773
nor why
the school magazine club disbanded.

71
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,150
I don't recall a thing.

72
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,444
You don't?

73
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:39,120
SAJU GENERAL HOSPITAL

74
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,377
We're here.

75
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:47,795
Boss.

76
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,881
I'll take a taxi to go back to the office.

77
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,008
You don't have to.

78
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,552
It won't take long. Just wait for me.

79
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:57,013
I'm expecting a customer. So I have to go.

80
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,932
Really? Then why did you come along?

81
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,934
I thought I'd be your driver.

82
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,687
Why? Did you think I would bail?

83
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,065
Oh, gosh. No. I wouldn't interfere
in your business, Boss.

84
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,861
The last time you met her,

85
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,114
you didn't have any energy
for days afterward.

86
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,074
I noticed that.

87
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,745
So I thought about it.

88
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:23,623
I suppose you dated her
in high school or something--

89
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,499
That mouth of yours…

90
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,626
I'm sorry, Boss.

91
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,962
Hurry back to the office
and earn your keep, will you?

92
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,214
Okay.

93
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,898
Oh, don't be a slowpoke.

94
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,274
You better run. You fat pig.

95
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,902
I can still see your feet. Run faster.

96
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,216
What? What is it?

97
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,474
You were gazing out the window so hard

98
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,309
I thought there was
something scary outside.

99
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,436
Thanks for coming.

100
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,688
This is the secret
behind the success of my business.

101
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:33,943
I handle the urgent stuff first
with a Band-aid solution.

102
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:38,364
So you should handle
the urgent stuff first.

103
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,784
We can talk about the old times later.

104
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,871
Thanks, Yong-tak.

105
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,463
Hello.

106
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,090
Oh, hi.

107
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,634
Who are you?

108
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:03,013
I'm Jung-hyun's high school friend.
Nice to meet you.

109
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,141
Oh, you're a friend.

110
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,392
Thank you for coming.

111
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,103
You came during the daytime.

112
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:12,606
I'm a business owner
so I set my own hours.

113
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,483
Oh, you are?

114
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,194
-That's good.
-Oh, sure.

115
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,655
Yong-tak, how about we go outside?

116
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:23,325
Mom, can I go outside for a short while?

117
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,161
You'd like that?

118
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,248
All right. I'll organize your stuff
in the meantime.

119
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,292
Let's go.

120
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,597
Where are you going?

121
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,850
Isn't it this way?

122
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,020
Yong-tak, did you bring
the thing I asked you to get?

123
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,899
Oh, I forgot. It's in my car.

124
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:57,818
I'm sorry, but I need a favor.
Can you go somewhere with me?

125
00:12:58,861 --> 00:12:59,945
Well…

126
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,406
It's not a problem.

127
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,326
You're still recovering though.
Will you be okay?

128
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,660
I'm fine.

129
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,454
My mom made me come to the hospital.

130
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,998
I'm not comfortable about this.

131
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:16,754
I need a favor.
I'll explain everything on our way.

132
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,053
Let's go.

133
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,361
THE DREAM OF GYEONGCHEON

134
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,073
Why did you ask me to bring you that?

135
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,079
Yong-tak.

136
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,123
Actually,

137
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,252
I met Young-seob.

138
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,003
What?

139
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:00,798
Jung Young-seob?

140
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,466
Yes.

141
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,468
He died, didn't he?

142
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,136
It was all fake.

143
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,264
The people at his funeral
were all fake too.

144
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,265
They were?

145
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,476
Doesn't he have a life?
Why did he fake his death?

146
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,852
I felt that

147
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,522
Young-seob was

148
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,359
completely consumed in his own world.

149
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:23,696
He had cut off
all contact with the outside world.

150
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,322
All right.

151
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,285
So is he involved in the things
happening around you?

152
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,833
So the thing is…

153
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,043
I have something to tell you.

154
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,507
But it's difficult to bring it up
now that I decided to tell you.

155
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,304
Take your time. You don't need to hurry.

156
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,223
Well,

157
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,809
I promised myself one thing.

158
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,311
I'm not going to hide anything

159
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,062
from my friends anymore.

160
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:01,567
That's my first priority.
Everything else comes in second.

161
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,488
Yong-tak.

162
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,575
Do you remember…

163
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,705
the Saju station gas attack
that happened in 1987?

164
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:16,749
Yes.

165
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,545
They say…

166
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,718
I got you to help carry that out.

167
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,222
Carry what out?

168
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,642
What did we do?

169
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,603
We helped that bastard

170
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,648
bringing the bags containing nerve gas

171
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,444
to the train station to help that devil.

172
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:47,905
What?

173
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,990
I'm the one

174
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,869
who made you do it.

175
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,540
If that's true,

176
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,001
then Jae-young's abduction

177
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,463
also involves me in some way.

178
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,093
Even if…

179
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,973
it's something I did
that I can't remember.

180
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,596
Keep the change.

181
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,709
You can't solve it, right?

182
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,171
I haven't solved it once after buying it.

183
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,339
Really?

184
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,301
What brings you here?
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.

185
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,469
Well,

186
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,846
life is full of surprises.

187
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,139
Would you like some tea?

188
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,182
No thanks. Sit down.

189
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,400
How is Detective Lee?

190
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,944
I met him on the road once.

191
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,237
Shi-jung is dead.

192
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,866
What? Oh, come on.

193
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,868
How can you joke around like that?

194
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:58,994
I'm not.

195
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,205
He really died.

196
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:03,874
His wife killed him.

197
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,175
Pig.

198
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,011
When you were delivering
gas tanks to the Skull Gang--

199
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,889
Oh, please, Detective Choi.
Why are you bringing that up?

200
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,767
I quit doing deliveries
for them years ago.

201
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,561
-Pig.
-Yes, Detective Choi.

202
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,021
Stop interrupting me.

203
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,815
Okay.

204
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,859
There's a smuggler, Professor Jang,
the go-between for the Skull Gang

205
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,570
-and the Japanese gang, right?
-Yes, I know him.

206
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,573
Later on, I was handling
all of the smuggling.

207
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,159
Have you ever seen Professor Jang?

208
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,327
No.

209
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,080
Why do you want to know?

210
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,209
Well, the entire Skull Gang was arrested

211
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,585
except for him.

212
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,003
Of course.

213
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,798
Hardly anyone has ever seen his face.

214
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,716
He sets up the deal

215
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,343
and he never shows up himself.

216
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,846
All he does is research, you know.

217
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:02,975
Well, you know…

218
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,310
I need you to find him for me.

219
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,857
You know a few retired
Skull Gang members, don't you?

220
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,817
They're also receiving a pension.

221
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,901
I do?

222
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,657
These files will help you get up to speed.

223
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,878
HONGAN-DONG MOTHER-DAUGHTER
MURDER CASE

224
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:33,839
AUTOPSY REPORT

225
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:36,300
ANNEX: AUTOPSY RESULT PART 1

226
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,264
Look here, Detective Choi.

227
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:46,268
When I helped you infiltrate the gang,
you made a promise to me.

228
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,897
If I were to quit delivering gas tanks,
you'd never find me again.

229
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,442
Gosh. This isn't right.
You're going back on your promise.

230
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:59,114
What I'm saying is I need to know
what the heck is going on first.

231
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,991
-Sorry.
-What?

232
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,915
You're the only person
I can ask for this favor.

233
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:19,843
A favor?

234
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,970
What the?

235
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,641
He's changed a lot.

236
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,733
-Geez.
-Seriously?

237
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,944
Look at those pigs. They look surprised.

238
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,241
But why are there pigs here?

239
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,747
It's freaking hot.

240
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,377
Wasn't this place a deer farm?

241
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:57,839
I thought so too.

242
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,842
I don't see the symbol
or any writings here.

243
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:07,224
You're saying that
in one of those seven spots,

244
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,185
there could be a clue that might lead you

245
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,354
to those crazy guys
who kidnapped your niece, right?

246
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,775
I'm not 100 percent sure.

247
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,236
I just think
there could be some connection.

248
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:22,030
We've got a lot of time.
Let's look around…

249
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:32,624
So you still practice judo?

250
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,711
Your clothes are really big.

251
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,685
Why aren't you talking? Do I look weird?

252
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,688
Doesn't it smell?

253
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,398
I didn't wash it once.

254
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,066
What smell?

255
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,652
It's all right.

256
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,197
Well, the pigs are giving off
an overpowering smell.

257
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,908
Oh, these pigs stink.

258
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,577
It's crazy how bad they smell.

259
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:12,164
Hey! Who are you?

260
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,749
Hello. We're…

261
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,542
Come out first. Let's talk outside.

262
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,461
-What?
-I said come out.

263
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,880
My pigs are very sensitive
to foreign odors.

264
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:23,133
They get really stressed
when they smell a stranger.

265
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,885
So come out now.

266
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,971
Hurry up!

267
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,308
I'm sorry, Pigs.

268
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,601
We're sorry.

269
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:35,771
We're sorry.

270
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,190
YONGMA FAST CASH

271
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,817
What kind of company is this?

272
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,028
I don't have a clue about what you do.

273
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:48,200
We provide financing.

274
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,409
It's that kind of stuff.

275
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:52,287
Long-term loans, credit loans and…

276
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,206
Well…

277
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,457
Payday loans too.

278
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,376
I also dabble in real estate
like I am doing today.

279
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,296
Oh, I'm not interested in any of that.

280
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,841
There are a lot of fruit farms
near the mountain.

281
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:05,967
Why don't you go there?

282
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,637
That's hilly terrain, you know.

283
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,680
It takes money to dig
and create flat land.

284
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:15,060
My wife and I are not interested
in making more money.

285
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:17,229
Our kids have all grown up and married.

286
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,856
Raising pigs is an easy life.

287
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,276
Just have to clean up
the poop now and then.

288
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,696
I appreciate the offer, but no thanks.

289
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:28,573
I see.

290
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,493
If that's your decision, well…

291
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,204
I feel sorry for drinking
this expensive rice punch.

292
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,832
Oh, don't be. Please enjoy it.

293
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,042
But sir,

294
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,837
wasn't this place a deer farm before?

295
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,505
That's what I heard.

296
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,258
Oh, you're right.
There used to be a deer farm here.

297
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:49,928
The previous owner
raised deer and sold antlers.

298
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:56,017
Have you ever visited the place
when it was a deer farm?

299
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,479
What? What are you talking about?

300
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:03,441
Well, I was wondering
if you've ever seen this.

301
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,278
This one here.

302
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,572
Have you seen this symbol?

303
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:12,325
Have I seen this before?

304
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,785
I don't remember.

305
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:17,622
There used to be a deer farm here.

306
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,875
But it closed ten years ago.

307
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:21,501
I see.

308
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:25,380
When I first came here,
the place was a total mess.

309
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:27,841
I had to work so hard to clean it up.

310
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:32,929
When I first surveyed the place,
there was a strong rotting stench.

311
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,265
So we bulldozed it all.
Even the furniture.

312
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,684
I had the building razed too.

313
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:41,021
-A rotting stench?
-Oh gosh. Don't get me started.

314
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:45,525
The previous landowner
was going to erect a building here.

315
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,820
He didn't maintain the farm at all.
Then he went to prison.

316
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,448
All the deer starved to death

317
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,909
because he locked
all the doors with chains

318
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,453
and because of that, nobody could come in.

319
00:24:56,536 --> 00:25:00,790
The stench from the dead deer
spread throughout the village.

320
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,709
The farmer wasn't showing up.

321
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:06,254
So the villagers reported the problem
to the county.

322
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,591
So the city offered to cover
all of the cleaning costs.

323
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,218
That's why my wife and I took it over.

324
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:15,138
If the city didn't do that,
no one would have come here.

325
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,351
Do you exercise a little?

326
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,229
You have to exercise a lot.

327
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:26,483
I jog 10km a day, you know.

328
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,526
If you don't exercise,

329
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,279
your mind also deteriorates
along with your body.

330
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,322
But

331
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,993
I'm very happy to see
you agree to do the interview every month.

332
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,747
I'm truly happy to see that.

333
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:45,418
Right.

334
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,129
Not as many as we used to get,

335
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:52,509
but we get a lot of requests
from the press,

336
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,637
asking to interview you.

337
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:59,891
Like I told you before,
my stance remains the same.

338
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,977
I will not accept any media requests

339
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,896
while I am the warden of this prison.

340
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,525
You still agree with that, right?

341
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,902
It doesn't really matter.

342
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,863
You just need to stay quiet.

343
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:19,160
I've been watching you
for many years now, Mr. Jo.

344
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:23,164
And my decision is in your best interest.

345
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,293
Minimize contact with outside visitors

346
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,211
and focus on staying balanced.

347
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,463
You understand that, right?

348
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:35,510
Could you stop tapping the armrest?

349
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:37,220
It's distracting.

350
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:43,518
That's all I had to say to you today.

351
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,272
Is there anything you'd like to say?

352
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:51,943
All right, then.

353
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:55,447
Continue to cultivate your body and mind

354
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,657
-and avoid bad thoughts--
-Excuse me.

355
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:00,785
Oh, sure. Go ahead.

356
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,205
Look over there.

357
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,709
What's there?

358
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,506
What is that?

359
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,008
Where is that sound coming from?

360
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:20,138
It was nice knowing you.

361
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,641
What did you say?

362
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:33,526
Anybody out there? Help!

363
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,349
Oh gosh. Thank you, sir.

364
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:06,768
-The rice punch was delicious.
-Oh, it was?

365
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,937
Can I ask you something?

366
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,774
The land here isn't of much value,
so why are you scouting this area?

367
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:15,068
-What's your purpose?
-Well…

368
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:18,321
I'm investing in nursing homes.
That's what I'm here for.

369
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,656
Oh, is that so?

370
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,117
You won't be able
to get a permit for that.

371
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,159
I know about that.

372
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:26,454
I'm just thinking about it.
So don't tell your neighbors yet.

373
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:30,291
The previous owner was planning
to build one here before he went to jail.

374
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,919
The previous owner?
What are you talking about?

375
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:36,297
This farm could have
become a welfare center.

376
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,340
A welfare center?

377
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,342
I mentioned it to you earlier.

378
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:42,220
The landowner was going to
erect a building here.

379
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:45,306
But he couldn't get a permit,
so he left the farm neglected for years.

380
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,351
If not, a welfare center
would be standing here.

381
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:52,147
What kind of welfare center was it?

382
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:57,569
There was a big scandal ten years ago.

383
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,281
What was the name of that place again?

384
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:04,868
It was called
the Family Welfare Center, I think.

385
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,786
I'm not sure if that's right.

386
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:12,584
The owner of the deer farm was also
the director of that welfare center.

387
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:16,463
Are you talking about
the One Family Welfare Center?

388
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,799
Yes, that's it.
The One Family Welfare Center.

389
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:24,512
What? Do you know that place?

390
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,017
That bastard and I…

391
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,437
grew up there.

392
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,608
The One Family Welfare Center.

393
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,576
Okay. Did you clean it all up?

394
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:51,164
Did you clean the blood
splattered on the table legs?

395
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,666
Are you sure?

396
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:57,128
Geez. What an unlucky day.

397
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,423
Geez.

398
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,440
Why is it so dark?

399
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:33,039
I'll be back after the gathering ends.
Heat the stew on the stove for dinner.

400
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,133
What is this?

401
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,153
What is this sound? It sounds so eerie.

402
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,874
What is wrong with this? Damn it.

403
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,657
Oh gosh.

404
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,743
The closet door opened again.

405
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,956
Oh boy.

406
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,043
One day, I'll have to fix it or something.

407
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:12,472
Gosh. Why won't it close?
What a piece of garbage.

408
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,265
Come on, seriously.

409
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:19,354
Honey, are you sleeping?

410
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,564
I brought apples for us to eat together.

411
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,362
Are you in there?

412
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,198
Why aren't you answering?

413
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,326
What is that sound?

414
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,750
What are you doing, Honey?

415
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,222
You're not a kid. What is this?

416
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,309
Stop playing around.

417
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:02,772
You're frightening me now.

418
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,032
Honey.

419
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:15,868
Are you inside the closet? Is it you?

420
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,290
Should I open it?

421
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,716
Go away. Just go away.

422
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,135
Dear, what is the meaning of this?

423
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,396
It's me, Honey. It's me.

424
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,153
Is it… Is it you?

425
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,698
Yes, so cut it out.

426
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,702
You're scaring me.

427
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:03,541
Calm down first and just come out, okay?

428
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,472
-You're lying.
-What?

429
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,598
I'll kill you.

430
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,058
I'll kill you!

431
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,092
How could you still be sleeping?
We have to get there on time.

432
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,385
I'm sorry. I went to bed really late.

433
00:34:57,386 --> 00:35:00,056
Come in for a minute.
I'll get ready real quick.

434
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,599
You need to hurry.

435
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,559
They said no at first.

436
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:06,187
They barely agreed to let us come
when nobody is around.

437
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,730
We can't be late.

438
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,357
I'll be right out.

439
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,643
Aly, you poor thing.

440
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,563
Don't suffer there.

441
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,485
You should say something.

442
00:35:57,446 --> 00:36:00,324
I'm sorry, friend.

443
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:05,580
ROOM 2

444
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,168
It's sad.

445
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:13,713
I won't be able to
see you anymore, Detective Choi.

446
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,757
I would like to come by
to share some homemade food with you.

447
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,134
Will that be all right?

448
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,934
What is it? I can't accept it.

449
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,936
You already gave me so much.

450
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:30,771
Please accept it.

451
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,733
I didn't do that much for you.

452
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,570
Oh gosh.

453
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,615
I'm sad about this situation.

454
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:43,784
Ms. Jung.

455
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,037
When did we first meet?

456
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:48,873
It was after my wife had died.

457
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,001
So it's been quite a long time.

458
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,545
I know.

459
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:58,382
Karmic connections
between people is very precious--

460
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,592
Ms. Jung.

461
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,636
I have something to tell you.

462
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,263
Yes?

463
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:09,310
Please go ahead.

464
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:16,484
Who are you really?

465
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,158
I knew this day would happen.

466
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,038
How much did you find out, Detective Choi?

467
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,208
That your duty

468
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,126
is to spy on me.

469
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,504
That's my hunch.

470
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,841
I…

471
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,098
I…

472
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,476
I lost my son

473
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:55,439
in the terrorist attack that took place

474
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:00,236
at Saju Station in 1987.

475
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,948
After that,

476
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:05,950
I lived

477
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:09,412
like a crazy person for several years.

478
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:15,751
I asked myself why my son had to die.

479
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,131
What did I do to deserve that?

480
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:26,387
How could I temper the rage I felt

481
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,264
that was burning inside me?

482
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,143
And

483
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,229
a person called Guru appeared

484
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:38,733
and comforted you, right?

485
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:42,320
That is how you joined
the Youngjin sect, I presume.

486
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:46,407
When he talks to me,

487
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:51,078
he washes away
the heart-wrenching agony I feel.

488
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,289
It just goes away.

489
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:59,086
He has shown us the path
that we are taking together.

490
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:06,135
Even if your loss was caused by Guru
in the first place?

491
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,514
What happened in the past is over.

492
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,350
You have to look to the future.

493
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:26,822
Thank you for your service.

494
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:28,949
Wish you good health.

495
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,118
Detective Choi.

496
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:42,129
I was ordered to retrieve
this videotape from you.

497
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,383
But the Youngjin sect sent it,
didn't they?

498
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,009
There was a miscommunication.

499
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,887
So our representative
ordered me to retrieve this.

500
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:55,017
The Youngjin sect has had a few missteps.

501
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:58,604
But once he returns,

502
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:01,565
we'll be guided to the right path again.

503
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:07,113
What the heck do you people want?

504
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,657
We don't want anything.

505
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:13,494
We merely follow his plan.

506
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:16,872
I see.

507
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,376
Thank you for being honest
about the videotape.

508
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,545
You could have just left
without telling me.

509
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,422
Detective Choi.

510
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,259
I have

511
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,178
one last piece of advice for you.

512
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,225
If you can't escape it,

513
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,519
just embrace it.

514
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,538
Sit there for a minute.

515
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,207
And drink something.

516
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:14,221
The restaurant is a total mess.

517
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:17,600
I guess we can't reopen the restaurant.

518
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,728
Don't worry about that.

519
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,731
That's not important right now.

520
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,194
-Mom.
-Yes?

521
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:32,114
Don't you regret it?

522
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:35,951
What do you mean?

523
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:40,581
For adopting me and that bastard.

524
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:48,464
Bad things keep happening
ever since you adopted us.

525
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:53,302
If that bastard and I had never come…

526
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:54,803
Don't say such things.

527
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:58,057
How can you call your brother a bastard?

528
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:03,103
Even if everyone else calls him that word,
you shouldn't.

529
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,109
They say life is full of ups and downs.

530
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,905
But I've never regretted anything.

531
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:15,324
So don't you ever

532
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,701
say that again.

533
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,088
I'm sorry.

534
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,889
I'll go out to get some fresh air.

535
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,350
I'd like to go outside.
I haven't been out lately.

536
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:44,562
All right.

537
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,773
Be careful. Don't get hurt or anything.

538
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:58,969
Jung-hyun.

539
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:05,100
Why do people

540
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:09,188
just forget everything?

541
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:14,068
Why do they end up forgetting

542
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,446
when they can't endure something anymore?

543
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,490
What are you talking about?

544
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,451
So I gave it a lot of thought.

545
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:25,329
What could I do

546
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:28,666
that would make people
never forget something?

547
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:33,921
The terrorist attack at the train station
a few days ago…

548
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:36,507
I did that.

549
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:41,720
And you and your friends
help me pull it off.

550
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:44,431
What do you mean?

551
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,808
It's exactly what I said.

552
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:49,603
The terrorists behind
the Saju station gas attack are us.

553
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:50,687
What?

554
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:53,690
What the hell are you talking about?
Have you gone crazy?

555
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:58,195
You don't remember anything.
I wiped the memory of it.

556
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,375
That hellish place…

557
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:15,087
The same thing happened
when we left the welfare center.

558
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,549
So whatever happens, you'll be all right.

559
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,384
Because

560
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:23,804
I will erase all memories of it

561
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,015
like I did that time.

562
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,896
You're not weak.

563
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:36,108
But you're not strong either.

564
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:38,986
So it's all right.

565
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,072
Just do as I say.

566
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:49,204
No matter how I look at it,
I think you're going too far.

567
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:51,748
I need this.

568
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:54,042
That's why I'm asking you.

569
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:57,087
I know you're asking for it
because you deemed it very important.

570
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:59,131
But we can't justify such a request.

571
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:01,592
You only have suspicions.

572
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:09,141
We'll approach it differently then.

573
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:13,395
We'll tag along
with Professor Koo Byung-min.

574
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:15,856
That's how you'll gain access?

575
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:18,066
But will she allow it?

576
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,318
She will.

577
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:21,195
I'm certain of it.

578
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,738
Why are you so sure?

579
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:29,161
Hello?

580
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,288
What? Where?

581
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:35,626
Hang up. Got it.

582
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,799
We've got another murder.

583
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:54,955
Chief, you didn't have to
come all the way here.

584
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,873
We're handling the case now.

585
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,166
Is that so?

586
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:02,629
It's hard to tell if this murder falls
under the special investigative unit.

587
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,173
Even though it's unclear,

588
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:08,677
we need your cooperation
in handling these cases, Chief.

589
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,886
That would avoid confusion.

590
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:13,807
There has to be thunder
and lightning for confusion to occur.

591
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:18,562
Oh gosh. Now, let's not get carried away.

592
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:19,605
Chief.

593
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:25,235
We're willing to cooperate
with your unit, of course.

594
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:27,029
Please cooperate with us, okay?

595
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:30,449
You're treating us as if we're here
to tamper with the crime scene.

596
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,159
What?

597
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,037
Geez…

598
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:48,800
See, I told you
we're lower on the pecking order.

599
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:51,887
Did you find anything?

600
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:53,639
It's the same pattern.

601
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,600
They kill a family member
and then kill themselves.

602
00:48:57,267 --> 00:49:00,062
It's like the murder committed
by Lee Kyung-jin.

603
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:03,231
It's how Shi-jung and his wife
were killed too.

604
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:07,402
Let's proceed…

605
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:12,824
with the idea you had.

606
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,623
I wish that they will approach me.

607
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:22,459
And I wish

608
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,171
they will ask me a question.

609
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:31,385
Although I can't give an answer,

610
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,221
I can help them reach that answer.

611
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:40,727
I'm a small lake, river,

612
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:43,271
and vast ocean.

613
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:48,443
If you enter my world,

614
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:52,489
you'll be able to see
the world underneath the water.

615
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:58,203
You're the only one…

616
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,291
who knows what exists underwater.

617
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:08,547
That is the reason
why we are here right now.

618
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:26,690
PROFESSOR KOO BYUNG-MIN
DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY

619
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:43,290
PROFILE REPORT: JO KYUNG-HO

620
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:53,425
SAJU PENITENTIARY

621
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:57,554
Yes.

622
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:58,764
Yes, sir.

623
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:12,652
This is used as a break room
for our staff.

624
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:17,073
Sometimes we use it for special events.

625
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:21,411
It might look ordinary,
but we have guards standing outside.

626
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:25,290
If anything happens,
you can blow this whistle to call them.

627
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:26,416
Okay, thank you.

628
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,418
Feel free to tell me
if you need anything else.

629
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:34,800
I'm surprised. I thought
the whole process would be harder.

630
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:37,260
But the procedure is very simple.

631
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:41,890
You're okay, right?

632
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:44,434
You don't look well.

633
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:46,728
I have a headache.

634
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:12,128
You don't need to worry about it.

635
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,714
That is to announce
random inspections we do every week.

636
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:18,426
Oh, that's a relief.
I thought there was a situation.

637
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,554
I'll leave the door open for a minute.

638
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:23,348
The escort team just radioed us.
They're almost here.

639
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:01,136
Jung-hyun.

640
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:07,517
You can't change anything now.

641
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,019
We can't change what we did.

642
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:13,273
And you can't change this very moment

643
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,776
when you've learned the truth.

644
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:21,072
That's the fact which I know.

645
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:26,745
The only way to free yourself

646
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,331
is to forget, right?

647
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:58,652
I exist.

648
00:54:00,236 --> 00:54:03,073
And I have power.

649
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:09,871
So think carefully and answer me.

650
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:12,415
Jung-hyun.

651
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:18,088
Would you like me to erase this memory

652
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:20,715
for you?

653
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:53,623
Hello Jo Kyung-ho. Nice to meet you.

654
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:56,418
Hello.

655
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,753
Would it be okay if you sat there?

656
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:16,646
We'll wait outside.

657
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,065
Call us if you need anything.

658
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:20,275
Just a minute.

659
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:24,404
Mr. Jo Kyung-ho, aren't your hands
uncomfortable?

660
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,073
These cuffs?

661
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:30,452
If they're uncomfortable, I can have them
removed during this session.

662
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:32,078
It doesn't matter. I'm fine.

663
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:39,919
Let me introduce myself.

664
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,380
I'm Koo Byung-min.

665
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,841
I teach psychology at Saju University.

666
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:48,303
He's my research partner
and also an associate professor.

667
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:49,721
His name is Kim Seung-dae.

668
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:50,680
And he's…

669
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:56,853
Would you like to introduce yourself?

670
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,401
I'm Choi Hyung-in.

671
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,237
I'm part of the MIU

672
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:09,491
at the Gyeongnam Provincial Police Agency.

673
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:10,784
Yes, hello.

674
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,705
Thank you for agreeing to meet with us.

675
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:20,251
Would it be okay for us to videotape
this interview?

676
00:56:26,382 --> 00:56:27,717
Yes, it's okay.

677
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:32,138
But can I ask for something
before we start?

678
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,556
Sure. What do you need?

679
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,141
Can I have a smoke?

680
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,309
Of course.

681
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,645
Ask the guard if they have a cigarette.

682
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,230
-Okay.
-There's no need for that.

683
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:43,274
I have a pack.

684
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:56,037
Thank you.

685
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:44,919
Excuse me.

686
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:47,839
Aren't you Jung-hyun?

687
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,549
It's you, right?

688
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:53,553
Hi Min-jae.

689
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:56,055
What are you doing here?

690
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:59,350
Oh gosh. I was passing by in my car
and saw someone out in the rain.

691
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,644
You didn't have an umbrella,
so I came to check.

692
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,062
Oh my goodness.

693
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:05,940
I didn't realize it was raining.

694
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:09,194
What were you thinking?
How did you not know?

695
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,780
I was just thinking about something.

696
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:16,826
-About a decision I made a long time ago.
-But still…

697
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:18,828
Are you really okay?

698
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:22,540
I don't know.

699
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:25,001
I don't know, Min-jae.

700
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,212
To be honest,

701
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:30,006
I can't remember that day.

702
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:33,134
Which means…

703
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:38,139
I can only believe what I was told.

704
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,476
But I suddenly had a thought.

705
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,938
Now I only have one option left.

706
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:47,857
Because

707
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:50,193
I can never

708
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:53,571
go back to who I used to be.

709
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:57,367
I'm never going to

710
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,621
run away again.

711
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:16,469
On that day by the river,
you asked him to erase your memories.

712
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:21,474
You were able to forget the truth
while living your life.

713
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:25,144
So you should be grateful
for that, Jung-hyun.

714
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:36,531
You just have to play a role in his plan.

715
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:38,908
That's all you need to do.

716
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:45,999
I'll let you go just this once.

717
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:48,459
Don't ever reject him

718
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:52,338
and your reality again, okay?

719
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:53,381
No…

720
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:02,223
Speak louder and repent
so that everyone can hear you.

721
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:03,224
Jae-young…

722
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:09,897
What did you say?

723
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:12,817
Jae-young!

724
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:14,902
Jae-young!

725
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:17,655
Jae-young!

726
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:19,532
Don't worry, Jae-young!

727
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:21,451
Jae-young! Don't worry!

728
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:24,287
Jae-young, I'll save you!

729
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:26,748
Don't worry. Don't worry at all.

730
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:28,583
Hang in there, Jae-young!

731
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:30,084
Jae-young!

732
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:49,729
Shall I begin?

733
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,482
You can begin anytime you want.

734
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:55,943
Where should I start?

735
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:59,405
You can talk about what you remember
from the beginning.

736
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,658
The beginning?

737
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:06,954
So I guess

738
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:11,125
that would mean the day I was born?

739
01:01:12,877 --> 01:01:16,923
I think we should begin talking
about Jo Jae-young.

740
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:21,219
Oh, that's what you think?
I should begin with her, Jae-young?

741
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:29,477
I haven't done this before.

742
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:33,856
So it could take a while
to get to the heart of the matter.

743
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:34,982
Is that okay?

744
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:39,570
You don't have to worry about anything.

745
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:44,659
I remember every detail,

746
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:49,247
so you won't find it boring.

747
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:00,777
Jae-young.

748
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:05,448
Do you think you could have stopped it
if you were able to go back in time?

749
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,911
-Someone already knew about this place.
-Don't you think you should forget things

750
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:11,871
that need to be forgotten?

751
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:15,583
I have a plan, you see.
And I need your help.

752
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:21,088
Could you show me that videotape?

753
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:24,550
That allows me to see the beginning

754
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:26,344
What the hell is this?

755
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:28,179
and the end and everything in between.

756
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:34,352
