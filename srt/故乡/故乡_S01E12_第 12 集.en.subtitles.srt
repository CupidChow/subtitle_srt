1
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:47,380
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:03,581
I found a photo.

3
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:17,554
What's that for?

4
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,390
Let's drink this before we go.

5
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,444
Do you just have to boil it like this?

6
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,157
Yes. That's it.

7
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:41,578
Were you surprised
that I wanted to see you?

8
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,248
A little.

9
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,212
You take after her a lot.

10
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,008
Your mother.

11
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,264
The resemblance is striking.

12
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,103
Go to Saju.

13
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,648
That's all I wanted to say to you.

14
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:11,858
Saju?

15
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,359
Yeah.

16
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,863
That's your mom's hometown, after all.

17
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:23,244
And he's there, too.

18
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,212
You know,

19
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,589
your grandmother was a beauty.

20
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,758
I was going to say that, too.

21
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,567
What is that?

22
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:40,905
Paying my tab.

23
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,033
Your grandma

24
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,413
wouldn't accept my money
for the jajangmyeon I ate.

25
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,458
I was going to repay her
twice as much later

26
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,876
after I got a job.

27
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,864
When you see the representative,
you'll recognize him.

28
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,075
You can avenge your boss' death

29
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,952
by killing him, all right?

30
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,333
What the heck is this?

31
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,377
Just make your way in there
and arrest Lim In-gwan.

32
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,712
There are too many people.

33
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,631
We can't get through the door.

34
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,758
This is a big headache.
Who tipped them off?

35
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,011
What is he doing? Stop them!

36
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:34,936
Hello?

37
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,813
Hyung-in, it's me.

38
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,023
-Where are you?
-Me?

39
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:41,818
Where do you think I would be?

40
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,948
It pains me to be here.

41
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:48,741
What did you say?

42
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,786
How could there be so few people
at the funeral parlor?

43
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:54,288
Very sad.

44
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:58,251
I'm hanging up. I'm going to offer
my condolences to the family.

45
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,049
Everyone. At last,

46
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,845
Guru has returned

47
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,307
to the Land of Promise.

48
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,145
When he arrives here,

49
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,273
we will

50
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,318
all reach

51
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,404
the new future.

52
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,590
Hello.

53
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,800
-Hi, go in.
-Oh, thank you.

54
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,804
Hold on a minute.

55
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,848
-Yes?
-Let me check the schedule.

56
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,394
There's no food delivery
scheduled for today.

57
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,647
Oh, well…

58
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:01,207
What are you doing?
Aren't you getting off?

59
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,532
Once you drink that,

60
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,784
we will all join Guru

61
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,704
without any pain or fear.

62
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,483
The number you have dialed…

63
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,366
The number you have dialed…

64
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,059
Thank you for coming.

65
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,061
Jo Jae-young,

66
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,146
it's very tragic, isn't it?

67
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,734
Can I ask you

68
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,363
how you know my grandma?

69
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:01,327
We weren't able to
notify many people about the funeral.

70
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,456
Yes, I know.

71
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,460
It's sad how she died.

72
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,589
You must be in grief.

73
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:15,925
I'm just

74
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:20,930
an old friend of your aunt, Jung-hyun.

75
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,272
Take the cup, Successor.

76
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,859
What? Are you afraid?

77
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:44,662
Everyone.

78
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,832
Are you afraid?

79
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,709
Do you still feel

80
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,587
fear as we follow

81
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,257
Guru's teachings?

82
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,137
Is it because of this woman
who is called the successor?

83
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,181
I learned that she

84
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,934
put on a show before you.

85
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,146
It's very insulting.

86
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,982
The fact that she believes

87
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,861
she can sway your beliefs
with sweet words.

88
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,573
What the heck is she to us?

89
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,870
What can she do for us?

90
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:30,249
What has she done until now?

91
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,295
Open your eyes and look around.

92
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,841
Who is going to join you
in our new future?

93
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,969
Guru has no fear whatsoever.

94
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,846
He'll always be with you.

95
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,849
And Guru

96
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,352
will never

97
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,607
act cowardly in the face of death.

98
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,989
That is the only truth, everyone.

99
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,503
Mister.

100
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,462
You're here?

101
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,924
What the hell do you think you're doing?

102
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,055
That's a nice welcome.

103
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,307
How can I talk if you act so hostile?

104
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,017
-You want to talk?
-Yeah.

105
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,979
-I came to tell you something.
-You.

106
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,148
You have some nerve.

107
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:37,942
Do I?

108
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:41,278
After you hear what I have to say,
you'll understand why I came.

109
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,537
I'll get straight to the point.

110
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,496
Hyung-in.

111
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:52,706
He has returned.

112
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,877
Guru is waiting to meet you.

113
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,589
You have to come now.

114
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,924
If you don't hurry,

115
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,760
Jung-hyun will probably

116
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,139
die today.

117
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,188
Speak, Jung-hyun.

118
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,024
Go ahead and wag your tongue like a snob.

119
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,945
Talk to them, you snake.

120
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,617
I don't have anything to say.

121
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,042
All right.

122
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,963
Get lost.

123
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,466
You don't have the right
to be in this sacred place.

124
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,638
Run away from here
and live like an insect.

125
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:11,702
Look at her. That's an insect
whose soul cannot be saved.

126
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,624
How pathetic is she?
She's running away like a coward.

127
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,675
There's nothing pathetic

128
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,471
about wanting to live.

129
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,807
Yes, life can be painful.

130
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,978
Sometimes it's terribly hard to go on.

131
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,690
But losing the will to live

132
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,527
isn't the way to remember

133
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,282
your loved ones who have died.

134
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,328
We must continue living

135
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,957
no matter how lonely and tough life is

136
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,250
to remember them.

137
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,171
Even if you feel like you're paralyzed.

138
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,173
Even if

139
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,884
our lives

140
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,347
are full of more pain and anguish

141
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,934
than the moment we lost our families.

142
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:19,770
Everyone.

143
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,690
Don't give up on your lives

144
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,152
no matter the pain.

145
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,036
Let's go home.

146
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,975
Falsehoods!

147
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,150
You pretend to know our pain,
but you don't.

148
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,404
You can't save our souls with such words.

149
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,949
Fine, Jung-hyun.

150
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,202
If you want to save them,
then you must pay the consequences.

151
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,247
Prove to everyone here
what you can do for them.

152
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,582
Otherwise,

153
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,333
nobody will be allowed

154
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,627
to leave this room.

155
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:39,725
Promise me

156
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,520
that it'll end with me
if I accept the consequences.

157
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,608
And Young-seob, I owe you an apology, too.

158
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,237
For forgetting you.

159
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:54,782
I'm sorry.

160
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,166
Everyone,

161
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:08,921
let's all go home.

162
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,007
It's time to return home.

163
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,772
What do you mean by that?

164
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,443
How will my aunt die? What are you saying?

165
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,945
Jae-young, calm down.

166
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,613
You don't need to listen to him.

167
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:41,578
He said my aunt is in danger.
How can I be calm in this situation?

168
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,540
Jae-young, calm down a bit.

169
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,583
I've got a generous heart.

170
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,585
I know you're very worried.

171
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,880
And there's a way to save your aunt

172
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,050
and for me to get what I want.

173
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,135
It's simple.

174
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,761
Jae-young, go to where your aunt is.

175
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,515
And Hyung-in, go and meet Guru.

176
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,602
Right now. It's pretty simple, eh?

177
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,022
Let's go.

178
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,072
Jae-young, nothing will happen
to your aunt.

179
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,365
She's not going to die.

180
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,742
I promise. Trust me, okay?

181
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,369
-So Jae-young…
-Why?

182
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,122
Why do you believe she'll be safe?

183
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,417
Mister, you wouldn't care

184
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,045
what happens to my aunt. Isn't that so?

185
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,213
Jae-young.

186
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,008
How can you promise

187
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,720
that nothing will happen to my aunt?

188
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:44,183
How can you say such irresponsible things?
Why on earth would you say that?

189
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:51,773
Why

190
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,069
do you still

191
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,740
not see the truth?

192
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:02,868
What?

193
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,621
I can't leave my aunt alone.

194
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,583
I have to see with my own two eyes

195
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,710
if my aunt

196
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,462
is alive.

197
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,915
What did you mean by that earlier?

198
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,292
That I can't see the truth.

199
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:53,919
I'm sorry.

200
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,672
I don't want to talk about it right now.

201
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,298
Mister.

202
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,135
Yeah?

203
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,304
I

204
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,391
want to have blood sausage stew.

205
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:12,020
Our family can't go out to eat,
so I've never had it.

206
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:17,234
Will you treat me
to blood sausage stew next time?

207
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,362
Sure.

208
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,782
Jae-young.

209
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,034
Let's do that.

210
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,391
Are you okay?

211
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,184
She needs to be taken to a hospital.

212
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,813
What do you think you're doing
at this important hour?

213
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:57,983
Take her away!

214
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,360
She's going to die anyway.
Get her out of my sight!

215
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,908
Master Jung, what the heck are you doing?

216
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,618
We've decided

217
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,455
to live.

218
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,544
Oh gosh.

219
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,219
What? Brings back old memories?

220
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,306
But we don't have time for this.

221
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,855
Why on earth won't you believe me?

222
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,357
I'm the only one

223
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,819
who has followed his teachings

224
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:53,617
for my entire life.

225
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,288
Why won't you trust me?

226
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,750
You're all just like her.

227
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:03,960
You're pathetic.

228
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,965
You're mere insects.

229
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,469
Do you think his plan

230
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,097
will change because of what you're doing?

231
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:18,600
No.

232
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,437
We will

233
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,065
all find

234
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,401
salvation here together.

235
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,905
Don't disobey me!

236
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,618
He is coming so get ready!

237
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,416
What is happening?

238
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:52,717
All right.

239
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,179
There's no stopping the plan.

240
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,351
We will all become his worker ants.

241
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,874
Is everything

242
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,836
going as you wanted?

243
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,174
As I wanted?

244
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,428
I was involved in the torture
and death of your father.

245
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,596
Now you have me sitting
right across from you.

246
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,849
Isn't this what you wanted?

247
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:44,936
The incident I forgot

248
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,982
was something I shouldn't
have forgotten no matter what.

249
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,445
It's my fault that

250
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,572
all of this has happened, eh?

251
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:59,200
And as long as I'm alive,

252
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,746
your hatred will never subside.

253
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,001
So let's end this here.

254
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,546
So what is your point?

255
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:13,048
You're going back to prison.

256
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,508
You'll rot there
for the rest of your life.

257
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,719
In return, I'll give my life.

258
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:19,929
Let's end this.

259
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,891
I'll be free from this nightmarish life.

260
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:26,644
And you'll get the revenge
you've always wanted.

261
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:27,729
How about that, Kyung-ho?

262
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,026
You made up your mind before coming, huh?

263
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:37,697
Look, you don't understand
anything I've said.

264
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,699
Mr. Choi Hyung-in,

265
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,118
you are not capable of
making any decisions.

266
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,287
Your future is already

267
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,997
predetermined.

268
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,249
That day…

269
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,835
October 6, 1987.

270
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,506
After release the nerve gas
at Saju Station,

271
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:57,175
I came straight to your home.

272
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,178
I was going to kill you.

273
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,596
I thought that

274
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,892
would free myself from a future memory

275
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,685
that was bothering me.

276
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,938
A future memory?

277
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,648
My predetermined future.

278
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,651
But when I arrived at your house,

279
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:17,779
I couldn't summon the courage to kill you.

280
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,697
Because I discovered this in your kitchen.

281
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:34,838
A letter that your late wife,
Lim Se-yoon left

282
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,298
for you to read.

283
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,010
What?

284
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,179
So I accepted my fate.

285
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:48,393
I could not avoid this moment

286
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,397
where you and I confront
the truth in this room.

287
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:56,484
My wife

288
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,945
wrote me a letter?

289
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:03,408
Yes, and she mentioned something here
that you couldn't know about.

290
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,620
How dare you!

291
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:14,919
Mr. Choi Hyung-in, calm down. Sit down.

292
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:17,797
I haven't even started yet.

293
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,218
This gun is loaded.

294
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:27,140
And before you came here,
your gun was confiscated. Right?

295
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:28,808
Now,

296
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,771
I'll let you read the letter.

297
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,442
And I'll also give you

298
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:39,903
this gun.

299
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:48,453
Kyung-ho! You bastard!
What kind of nonsense is this?

300
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:52,457
I don't understand.
You have nothing to lose.

301
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,667
And I just told you earlier.

302
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,504
All my life,

303
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,382
I've feared and waited

304
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,345
for this very moment.

305
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,848
Even if I tried to ignore it,

306
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,686
the more I would want it in a weird way.

307
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:20,652
And it's also the case for her.

308
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:24,739
-Her?
-Jo Jae-young.

309
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,452
Read the letter.

310
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,164
Everything you need to know is there.

311
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:58,147
Where is my aunt?

312
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,359
This wasn't what you said. Where is she?

313
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,069
I'm thinking about

314
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:06,322
converting this whole place
into a nursing home.

315
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:09,617
It'll be a relaxing place
for rich retirees

316
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:13,496
where the air is clean
and there's a cool breeze.

317
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:18,710
What do you think? Boosting my image
as contributing to society.

318
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:26,426
In order to do that, I'll have to
completely get rid of the Youngjin Sect.

319
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,846
So what will it take to do that?

320
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,308
I'd have to kill the two people

321
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,351
who are related to Guru.

322
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,062
That would be Jo Jung-hyun

323
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,106
and you, Jo Jae-young.

324
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,026
You can't be too careful in life.

325
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,369
You can't leave any loose ends.

326
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:58,917
Now Jae-young, don't be sad.

327
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,629
If Choi Hyung-in were here,
things could be worse.

328
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:07,634
Both sides

329
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:12,347
are very cruel, don't you think?

330
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:55,181
I'm writing this brief letter to you.

331
00:32:57,183 --> 00:33:01,896
Maybe, we could have had
a lot more time together.

332
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:07,402
I think we should've cherished
the time we had.

333
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:12,198
We should have loved each other more

334
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,075
and

335
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,036
remembered the good times.

336
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:26,963
There are things in life
that cannot be undone.

337
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,758
Matters where someone must be held

338
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,552
accountable for

339
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:36,347
inexcusable acts.

340
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,808
And I've

341
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,395
decided to not shy away from it.

342
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,652
So I hope you won't be hurt

343
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,364
by what I will say next.

344
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,668
I didn't lose our baby

345
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,338
by a miscarriage.

346
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,383
I lied to you about it

347
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,845
and went to Japan to be away from you.

348
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:21,225
I did that because I thought
I'd lose our baby if I didn't get away.

349
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:25,271
But it didn't go according to my plan.

350
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,357
No matter where I went,

351
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:29,942
I couldn't escape

352
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,196
from Jo Kyung-ho.

353
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:37,116
So I chose the only way that

354
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,869
could keep our baby safe.

355
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:42,622
Despite knowing that

356
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:46,417
you would never agree to it
if I had told you.

357
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,796
Our baby

358
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:51,798
is with

359
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,842
Jo Kyung-ho.

360
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:58,137
Please look after

361
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,973
our daughter.

362
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,018
And dear.

363
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,395
Thank you.

364
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,315
I don't have any regrets.

365
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:13,986
These are the things
I've wanted to tell you.

366
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:45,309
Mr. Choi Hyung-in, wait a minute.

367
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,061
If you shoot me now,

368
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,399
you won't be able to hear
the rest of what I have to say.

369
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,654
Decide what to do
after you hear me out. It's not too late.

370
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,949
Because we're just getting started.

371
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:12,920
Do you know the trouble
I had to go through to get this far?

372
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:16,841
I had to dupe Choi Hyung-in and Jung-hyun
to finally get to you.

373
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,885
It was so much trouble.

374
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:24,098
I even texted your friends,
pretending to be you to pull this off.

375
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:27,935
It was you.

376
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:32,106
That's right. I had it all planned out.

377
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:35,443
In a few minutes,
I'm going to get a call from Guru.

378
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,778
Then everything will be over.

379
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,824
Everyone will die.

380
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,827
And I'll be the only survivor.

381
00:36:56,797 --> 00:37:00,760
Jae-young knows that you're her father.

382
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,763
But why

383
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:08,309
didn’t she tell you? Think about that.

384
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,901
When I met you for the first time,

385
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,572
I hypnotized you.

386
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:27,912
I ordered you to kill the person you love
and then commit suicide.

387
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,998
You know what happened in this town.

388
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:35,002
Try to remember the murder-suicides
that happened here.

389
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,171
My experiment was a success.

390
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,091
Do you know what that means?

391
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:44,303
You have to quickly make a decision.
You're running out of time.

392
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,266
Either go and kill your daughter
right away

393
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,978
or kill yourself here
before that can happen.

394
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,650
What will it be?

395
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,403
But

396
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,030
I came prepared.

397
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:09,120
It could be your last hope in some ways.

398
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:11,622
It's your choice to make.

399
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:18,337
I can erase your memory so that
you won't remember

400
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,842
that Jae-young is your daughter.

401
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:32,685
I think it has begun.

402
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,353
Oh, those boys.

403
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,813
I told them to only release the nerve gas.

404
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:21,984
It's supposed to look like a mass suicide.
Why the hell are they shooting?

405
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:25,196
-Someone has to clean up the mess.
-Should I go and check the situation?

406
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:27,823
Yeah. Go and help with the cleanup.

407
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,325
Getting rid of the bodies
will be a lot of work.

408
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,994
Oh gosh. How sad.

409
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:34,872
Seems like your aunt
will be waiting for you on the other side.

410
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,170
I'll get you!

411
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:42,630
I'll never forgive you!

412
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:47,134
Can you handle her alone?

413
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,303
Whoa. Jae-young.

414
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,097
She's really scary.

415
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,223
Look at her eyes.

416
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:55,309
She's got the same fire like Jung-hyun.

417
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,728
I'll be fine. Go help them out.

418
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,647
She and I have to take a phone call.

419
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:13,953
All right.

420
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:17,915
Mr. Choi Hyung-in.

421
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,543
We're running out of time.

422
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:26,006
If you get eaten by the ants,
we can't reverse it.

423
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,426
You just have to say one sentence.

424
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,429
"Erase my memory."

425
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:33,931
Just those words.

426
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,648
If you don't say it,

427
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,736
then I'll make a phone call

428
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,823
and have Jae-young brought to this house.

429
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,076
In that case,

430
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:56,495
you'll kill her

431
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,040
with your own hands,

432
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:03,627
and then you'll kill yourself. Tragically.

433
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:31,780
Hurry up and decide. There's no time.

434
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,214
Wait.

435
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,040
Did you decide?

436
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:27,628
Do you want me to erase your memory?

437
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,450
All right.

438
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,329
Say those words.

439
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:05,457
That you want me to erase them.

440
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:09,295
So that you can escape from this place.

441
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,428
You're no different
from the others, right?

442
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,474
Hurry up and end it.

443
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,020
You'll forget everything

444
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,565
and I'll reach the end of my future.

445
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,529
Hurry up and say it.

446
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,326
Jae-young.

447
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:46,540
The fact that she is my daughter.

448
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:52,796
Now that I know that fact,

449
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:58,844
I don't want to forget that.

450
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,984
What do you think you're doing?

451
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:21,950
You're quite amazing.

452
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,912
Or maybe you don't understand.

453
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,917
If you shoot me,

454
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:33,045
you'll be trapped
in that hallucination forever.

455
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,757
And you'll eventually

456
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,968
kill your daughter.

457
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:43,764
I never…

458
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,310
I never want to forget that

459
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,773
my daughter's alive.

460
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:56,610
Astounding.

461
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:04,576
You can't die until you kill her.

462
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:07,037
You'll have

463
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:10,207
to live in a living hell

464
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,043
alone all your life.

465
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,714
But there's one important detail
you're missing.

466
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:23,470
You can never kill me.

467
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,474
Because that's not the end of my future.

468
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:31,186
I'm the only person

469
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:35,023
who can end my life.

470
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:47,536
Let's end it for real now.

471
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,166
You'll forget everything
that was said here,

472
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,210
and I'll reach the end of my future.

473
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:59,882
You'll like as my worker ant
for the rest of your life.

474
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:02,885
That's how it'll end.

475
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:09,349
I…

476
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,271
appreciate what you did, Jo Kyung-ho.

477
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:19,234
For enlightening me.

478
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,154
I'll

479
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,074
choose to die every day.

480
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:16,792
Hello?

481
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:19,127
This is

482
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:24,174
Sanho-dong 36-11.

483
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,343
There's been a murder.

484
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:28,303
The murder suspect

485
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:31,390
is Lieutenant Choi Hyung-in

486
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,353
of Gyeongnam Provincial Police's
mobile investigation unit.

487
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:38,981
The suspect might flee the scene.

488
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:42,693
So please dispatch the police quickly.

489
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,173
It's him.

490
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:10,721
Now Guru has something to tell you.

491
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:12,347
Answer it.

492
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:14,391
Hello?

493
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:16,643
Hello?

494
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,315
Is it you, mister?

495
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,025
Is this Jae-young?

496
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:28,280
Yes, it's me, mister.

497
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,073
Are you okay?

498
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:33,493
Yes.

499
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:38,040
I'm okay. How about you, mister?

500
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,668
I'm okay, too.

501
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:44,254
Okay.

502
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,257
Jae-young.

503
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:49,718
Yes?

504
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:52,888
I'm sorry.

505
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:56,642
You don't have to be, mister.

506
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:03,815
Will I

507
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,111
be able to see you later?

508
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:12,991
Yeah,

509
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,661
I'll see you later.

510
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:19,915
Okay, mister.
I'll be waiting for you then.

511
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,293
I'll see you at your house.

512
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:28,965
Hello? Guru?

513
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:32,010
Hello?

514
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,097
Guru is dead.

515
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:52,864
What?

516
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,118
That's impossible.

517
00:49:56,910 --> 00:50:00,372
How can you be fine?

518
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:03,583
How could you be talking
to me over the phone?

519
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,211
You're a fool.

520
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,588
What did you say?

521
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:09,506
Did you think

522
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:12,592
you'd get your way?

523
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,471
I'll see you in hell.

524
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,979
Hello?

525
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,607
He's gone insane.

526
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:35,157
The number you have dialed cannot be…

527
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:39,494
It's okay.

528
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:43,623
Guru is dead so that's all that matters.

529
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:47,461
Nobody can stop me anymore.

530
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:50,756
Jae-young, I'm sorry.

531
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:52,048
But I have no choice.

532
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:55,385
Life is unfair, you see.

533
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,561
How can you…

534
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,788
I came to avenge my boss.

535
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:26,958
Avenge who?

536
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,252
Boss?

537
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:33,590
-What are you talking about?
-My boss went to the same school as you.

538
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:35,425
Same school?

539
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:41,765
Kang Yong-tak.

540
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:42,724
So it's you.

541
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:45,602
You killed my boss.

542
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:48,063
Don't point the gun at me. How dare you?

543
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:50,774
I'm the sole successor to Guru.

544
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:52,067
His true successor…

545
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,038
Stop it.

546
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,291
What is this?

547
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,293
I'm telling you to stop.

548
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:16,341
How could you still be alive?

549
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:24,516
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

550
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:38,238
What am I seeing?

551
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:42,576
What are these visions?

552
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:56,840
Whatever you try…

553
00:52:57,799 --> 00:53:01,261
You can't stop me.

554
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,245
Se-yoon.

555
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:12,499
No.

556
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,834
I didn't do it.

557
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:16,711
Se…

558
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:19,547
No.

559
00:54:27,263 --> 00:54:29,516
I didn't kill her.

560
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,124
Aunt.

561
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:55,959
It's over.

562
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:06,386
Aunt.

563
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:07,470
Aunt!

564
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:40,378
Whoever sees the video
will die no matter what.

565
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:44,883
And will kill the person…

566
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:47,802
The person

567
00:55:49,345 --> 00:55:50,722
they love the most.

568
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:53,558
I'm okay.

569
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,771
It's okay.

570
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,524
So please live on, son.

571
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:06,154
No matter what people say you must live.

572
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:25,752
Aunt.

573
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:28,296
Aunt.

574
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:30,256
Are you okay?

575
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:53,488
6 MONTHS LATER

576
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:31,025
I'm worried.

577
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,362
You don't look well.

578
00:59:37,615 --> 00:59:38,449
I don't?

579
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:40,827
There are people who can help you,
including me.

580
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:43,580
If you die like this,

581
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,250
a lot of people will be sad.

582
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,712
I'd like to find a way somehow.

583
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:52,797
You know…

584
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:55,633
Is Jae-young

585
00:59:57,176 --> 00:59:58,928
doing fine?

586
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:02,223
Yes.

587
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:06,352
She's back to living a normal life.

588
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:18,489
Do you see these scars?

589
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,451
I'll probably

590
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:24,829
have these scars for life.

591
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:27,457
They can't be removed.

592
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:32,629
But I can't dwell on these scars
for the rest of my life.

593
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:38,801
You need to see Jae-young.

594
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:43,097
After she graduates,

595
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:46,100
gets a job, and finds her loved one…

596
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:47,894
You need

597
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:51,189
to watch her when she

598
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:53,232
starts her own family.

599
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,110
You have to stay alive, Detective.

600
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:10,667
I agree with you.

601
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:12,710
You and Jae-young

602
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:15,546
must go on with your lives.

603
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:19,050
You both deserve that.

604
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:21,594
But my situation is different.

605
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,388
I might

606
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:25,973
die here.

607
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:32,021
Every night, I see visions
where people swarm around me.

608
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:35,733
They tear off my limbs.

609
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:38,986
And they won't stop
whispering into my ear,

610
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:40,530
telling me to kill my daughter.

611
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:46,577
Otherwise, my pain will never end.
They say it'll go on forever.

612
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:51,416
It's getting worse by the day.

613
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:54,085
The visions are getting sharper in focus.

614
01:01:54,168 --> 01:01:57,630
I think that's occurring

615
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:00,800
because my love for my daughter, Jae-young

616
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:03,761
hasn't changed.

617
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:06,305
Jung-hyun.

618
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:08,599
Have you thought about

619
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:11,352
the despicable acts I committed

620
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:14,272
against your dad in the past?

621
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:16,983
Yes, I have.

622
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:17,984
You'll have to

623
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:21,904
live with that guilt, Detective.

624
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,367
Stay alive and remember your sins.

625
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:28,244
As long as you don't forget it, it's fine.

626
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:29,203
No.

627
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:31,581
One day,

628
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,625
I'll forget my sins.

629
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:38,671
Only the victims
will never forget what happened.

630
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,256
Just like how it is today.

631
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:48,514
The ordeal they endured will torment them
every night like a never-ending nightmare.

632
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:53,102
But monsters will never keep

633
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:55,855
the memories of their sinful acts

634
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:58,649
in the recesses of their minds.

635
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:02,403
I no longer

636
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,866
want to live as a monster.

637
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:11,162
I've had enough.

638
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:14,832
I'm able to clearly see

639
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:17,460
my past

640
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,588
amidst my pain.

641
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,801
I'll endure it all.

642
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:29,430
After that,

643
01:03:31,682 --> 01:03:33,100
if I have the chance…

644
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:37,355
If I earn the right,

645
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,069
I'd like to tell my daughter this

646
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:49,700
when I reach the end of this road.

647
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:07,051
Daughter.

648
01:04:08,052 --> 01:04:09,053
If there is

649
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,515
an unlit room inside your soul,

650
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:14,392
and if

651
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,812
it's dark and cold in there…

652
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:20,815
If you've kept that room

653
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:25,152
closed your entire life,

654
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:28,155
I hope that my decision

655
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:31,492
will bring light

656
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:34,662
to that place.

657
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:39,625
I wish it'll bring warmth…

658
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,505
And shine ever so dimly…

659
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:51,596
Then one day…

660
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:00,271
So…

661
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:06,652
Is my dad

662
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:10,323
doing okay?

663
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:15,286
Yeah.

664
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:28,007
Please open the door

665
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:32,011
in your soul

666
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:35,097
that

667
01:05:36,974 --> 01:05:38,559
you've kept tightly shut.

668
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:15,054
Can't you stop?

669
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:20,559
You can stop all of this right now.

670
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:23,688
If you were to do that,

671
01:06:24,689 --> 01:06:26,482
then you could

672
01:06:27,566 --> 01:06:28,484
return home.

673
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:30,736
Don't you think so?

674
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:34,824
Home?

675
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:38,077
Yes, our home.

676
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:43,207
I wish you could do that

677
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:45,918
even though it's a bit late.

678
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:50,381
I hope you can live a normal life, mister.

679
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:53,384
You really think that's possible?

680
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:54,802
Yes.

681
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:59,432
I know It'll take a long time…

682
01:07:00,891 --> 01:07:02,059
But I don't think

683
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:04,395
it's impossible.

684
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:09,817
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING HOMETOWN

685
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:19,952
