1
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:47,380
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,257
YEAR 1985

3
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,226
OVERSEAS PUBLIC SECURITY HEAD OFFICE

4
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,742
You can't enter the operating room.

5
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,670
The patient is showing
signs of dissociative identity disorder.

6
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,006
I think he also has PTSD.

7
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,799
He's suffered memory loss.

8
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,595
We'll see how serious it is
through further observation.

9
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:06,978
The doctor says he suffered
a head trauma in the accident.

10
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:12,317
So he can't remember the last few months.

11
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,569
He can't remember?

12
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,364
He needs sufficient rest to recover.

13
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,242
Okay. We'll come back next time.

14
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,912
And please call us
if his condition improves.

15
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,878
Honey.

16
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,296
Honey.

17
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,716
-Honey.
-Are you awake?

18
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,138
Did I fall asleep again?

19
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,390
How long have I slept?

20
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,935
The doctor says
you'll be sleeping a lot for now.

21
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,854
It's natural when you're recovering.

22
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,981
You're exerting yourself too much.

23
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,983
You probably have morning sickness too.

24
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,611
No, it's not that bad today.

25
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,738
Gureum is helping me.

26
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,699
I think the baby wants you
to get better quickly.

27
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,578
I'm sorry.

28
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:09,457
There are so many things
on your plate already.

29
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,042
Honey.

30
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,295
After you recover,

31
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,590
how about we move to
my childhood hometown?

32
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,301
To Saju?

33
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,597
I'm not asking you to say yes right now.

34
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,768
Did my coworkers say anything?

35
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,520
No, not much.

36
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,982
They just wish you a speedy recovery.

37
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:39,028
They said they'll assign you to
another division after you get discharged

38
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,073
since your current division
is very demanding.

39
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,327
Have they already decided that?

40
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,579
The doctor said that if I'm careful,

41
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,374
there should be no problems
returning to work.

42
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,376
Honey.

43
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,087
It makes me feel like

44
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:59,257
I was a useless member of my division.

45
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,884
Don't think about that right now.

46
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,471
I just want to raise our baby

47
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,558
in my hometown where I grew up.

48
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,894
Could you consider moving there?

49
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,191
What's there to think about?

50
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,193
If it's what you want, we'll do it.

51
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,991
Let's move to your hometown.

52
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,327
The three of us.

53
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:29,704
Okay.

54
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,467
YEAR 1999

55
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,941
How do you feel?
Has the dizziness subsided?

56
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,027
Yes, I feel better.

57
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,741
How many days have you gone
without eating?

58
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,576
You'll die, you know.

59
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,787
You can't live without eating anything.

60
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,664
Could you wait here for a second?
I'll be right back.

61
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,091
You can snack on this…

62
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,557
Hey!

63
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,422
Change into that right now and wait.

64
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,859
SAUNA

65
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:53,467
Excuse me.

66
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,387
How long do I have to wear this
over my head?

67
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,410
Gosh.

68
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,955
Who are you?

69
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,459
What is this place?

70
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,918
Just a minute.

71
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,715
THE CHERRY ORCHARD BY ANTON CHEKOV

72
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,647
What are you doing?

73
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,192
You have to tell me what you're doing.

74
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,797
Detective Choi, what the heck
do you think you're doing?

75
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:15,341
What you're doing is illegal.

76
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:18,386
Is the police allowed to
do this to people?

77
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,772
You recognize this, right?

78
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,275
The Youngjin sect.

79
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,404
What goes on there?

80
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,326
I don't know.

81
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,037
Lee Kyung-jin, Lee Young-deok,

82
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,123
and Jo Jae-young.

83
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,708
They're all connected
to that place, right?

84
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,962
I don't know what you're talking about.

85
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,004
And…

86
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,055
You've heard this before, haven't you?

87
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,307
What is this?

88
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,059
Is it a spell?

89
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,771
Does it trigger a certain reaction

90
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,441
among certain people?

91
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,776
Could it order someone to kill?

92
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,238
But why doesn't it affect us
when we listen to it?

93
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,327
Geez. You're really dense.

94
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,745
And one last question.

95
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,001
Who is Guru?

96
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,211
Did Guru command you

97
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,715
to commit those acts?

98
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,219
How many times
do I have to tell you, Detective Choi?

99
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,762
Those are all my questions.

100
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,056
I've got a lot of time.
So let's take it slow.

101
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:47,808
Also,

102
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,270
if you change your mind
and decide to cooperate, call for me.

103
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:57,985
That's Mr. Lee.

104
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,529
He's here to facilitate our conversation.

105
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,866
I'll return in 30 minutes.

106
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,786
And we'll start from the top, all right?

107
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:20,007
What's so funny?

108
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,093
Guru is…

109
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,221
truly amazing.

110
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,392
Guru told me

111
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,022
you weren't like a living person.

112
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,651
You're completely different
from other people.

113
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,152
Like a dead person.

114
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,699
Guru said he's the only one

115
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,120
who could save you, Detective Choi.

116
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,374
But before that can happen,

117
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,752
there's one procedure you have to undergo.

118
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,671
I told you about it before.

119
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,507
Detective Choi,

120
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,801
you'll peel off my skin,

121
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,887
pour hot water on me,

122
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,056
and then spit on me.

123
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,641
After that,

124
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,269
you'll become a living person again.

125
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,855
That's what Guru said.

126
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,441
He was correct.

127
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,443
I knew it.

128
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,782
Look at what you're doing right now.

129
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,365
Get up.

130
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:09,992
Get up, you bastard.

131
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,170
What do you see?

132
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,256
-What?
-Tell me what you see.

133
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,717
JO JAE-YOUNG

134
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,927
A name.

135
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,346
-Is that all you see?
-Yes.

136
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,473
She's Jo Jae-young.

137
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,725
The girl I sawed into pieces.
Isn't that her?

138
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,021
LEE SHI-JUNG

139
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,147
Who is this?

140
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,776
-Tell me who it is.
-What's this about?

141
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:45,778
CHOI KYUNG-JOO

142
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:46,779
Answer me.

143
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,448
Answer the question.

144
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,241
Who is this?

145
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,661
Lee Shi-jung. Choi Kyung-joo.
That's their names.

146
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,455
-Satisfied?
-That's all you really see?

147
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,378
That's how it looks to you, I guess.

148
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,213
When I see that,

149
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,632
I see people.

150
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,261
And I also see their homes.

151
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,722
I see the school they went to.

152
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,684
I also see their families
that are waiting for them.

153
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,645
And their unborn baby that died.

154
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,069
Kim Hwan-gyu.

155
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,655
Kim Hwan-gyu.

156
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:30,906
Yes.

157
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:42,209
And you're only talking about me, are you?

158
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,170
You crazy bastard.

159
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,186
Tell Guru this.

160
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,647
That we should go to hell together.

161
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:13,073
Do you really think
this interview is meaningful?

162
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,784
Do you really think

163
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,163
you can get the answers you want from me?

164
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,542
Do you really believe it?

165
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:27,546
You think you can solve
what's going on by asking me

166
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,092
about stuff that happened a long time ago?

167
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,681
We want to learn the truth.

168
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,228
I find it odd
that you keep repeating that.

169
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,648
Doesn't it sound dumb?

170
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,568
The truth is out there and all.

171
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,695
You don't even know
what you're talking about.

172
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,617
The results are all there is to it.

173
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,244
It's meaningless to wonder

174
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:03,916
what our purposes are
and how we got to this point.

175
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:08,295
It's your way of coping.
You just want reassurance.

176
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,547
That's your work process.

177
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:17,846
I'm not enlightened at all
from what happened in the past.

178
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,476
I just know one fact.

179
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,898
That the future exists.

180
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,778
I've been talking about that
for a very long time actually.

181
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,822
You've been talking about it?

182
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,073
To whom?

183
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,825
I can tell you that.

184
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,706
But I have a question for you.

185
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,667
What is it?

186
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,970
What is the real reason you came here?

187
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,265
What's your real question?

188
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,483
-Did you bring it?
-Yes.

189
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,614
And you?

190
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,992
-I brought it, of course.
-Nice.

191
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,167
Oh, Lord. Buddha.

192
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,461
I am grilling pork belly
at the break of dawn at school.

193
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,255
Please forgive me.

194
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:37,050
The book club member
always eats grilled pork belly

195
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,678
with chilled spicy noodles.

196
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,889
She must like to eat all sorts of food

197
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,724
because she reads a lot of books.

198
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,476
Hey, there's not enough.

199
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,479
They say she eats a lot, you know.

200
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,647
Okay.

201
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,818
Hey. Come here.

202
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:03,660
I'll grill it.

203
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:08,790
Have one.

204
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,752
Look here, teammates.

205
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,962
If any teacher sees us,
we'll be in trouble.

206
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,049
And if that happens, I'm going to run.

207
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,928
Oh, gosh.

208
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,931
We already have a bad reputation
at school as it is.

209
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,934
If rumors about
what we're doing goes around,

210
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:30,020
it'll be a black mark on my record
and derail my singing career.

211
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,146
We have no choice.

212
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,482
We have to do whatever we can.

213
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:37,903
This is the only place where we can get
the 1987 school magazine.

214
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:41,323
Are you sure Jae-young is talking about
our old school magazine?

215
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,245
It's on the news, you know.

216
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,081
The detective and his wife

217
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,876
were found dead in their home.
And they say

218
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,545
his wife graduated from our school.

219
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,757
And she published the magazine
with Jae-young's aunt.

220
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:02,219
They worked on the 1987 issue.

221
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,639
The school magazine is our last hope.

222
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:08,308
I'm certain it holds a clue.

223
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,195
It lacks somewhat in the presentation.

224
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:22,406
But it does look appetizing.

225
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,041
There are only a few copies left.

226
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:38,463
The high school and middle school
materials are mixed together.

227
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,507
It'll be really hard to find.

228
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:46,054
Anyway, get it done
before the morning bell rings.

229
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,057
I won't forget this, sister.

230
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,531
Hey, how much time do we have?

231
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:05,574
About 30 minutes.

232
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:07,993
Are you ready?

233
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,245
Let's not waste time talking. Let's hurry.

234
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,873
-I'll search the shelves.
-I'll go through the boxes.

235
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:46,990
Hey, what are you doing?
Hurry up and help us find it.

236
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:48,825
We don't have time.

237
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,494
Foolish sisters.

238
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,121
You start an investigation
by surveying the scene first.

239
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,372
Come on.

240
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,139
Gather around.

241
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,022
The criminal is in there.

242
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:20,982
Where?

243
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,360
While you were in a hurry

244
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:26,321
and going through the whole library,

245
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,240
I noticed this ladder.

246
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,283
Look at it. It's not in the right place.

247
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:33,829
As if somebody used it just a while ago.

248
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,206
So…

249
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,875
-Hey.
-Hey, I haven't finished talking.

250
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:41,670
Hey, hold it steady.
If I fall, I could break a leg.

251
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,756
You surprised me, you know.

252
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,384
I'm the one who found it, got it?

253
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,473
It's really here.

254
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,227
How did you know it would be there?

255
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,604
As soon as I get to school in the morning,

256
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,856
I always do my homework.

257
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:04,067
So when I get home, there's nothing to do.

258
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,819
I just read comic books.

259
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:09,114
I especially like reading Case Closed
and The Kindaichi Case Files.

260
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,407
So I've memorized all the issues.

261
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,701
I'm a pretty good sleuth.

262
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,953
But I find it strange.

263
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,707
Why was the ladder set near the box
where we found the issue?

264
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,791
It's elementary.

265
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,961
A criminal always leaves behind
tracks at the scene.

266
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:25,422
Criminal? There's a criminal?

267
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:29,718
No, not a real criminal
or anything like that.

268
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,429
-I mean--
-No. I think what you said is right.

269
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,805
-This is it.
-What?

270
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,891
Someone came here before we did.

271
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:39,895
And that person
was also looking for this issue.

272
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,396
I found it.

273
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:42,981
Seven Secret Spots.

274
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:48,528
That looks like Jae-young's aunt.

275
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,656
Is it her? I'm not sure.

276
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,657
It's her.

277
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,662
Which one of them died?

278
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,623
I don't know.

279
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,417
Where do you think

280
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,587
these people are now?

281
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,825
Have you woken up?

282
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,164
What have you done to me?

283
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,626
We purified your soul

284
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:48,004
from the outside elements
that seeped into it.

285
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,048
We call it "cleansing".

286
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,387
You think you have the right
to say such things?

287
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,229
Rights are not given to us.

288
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,356
We only believe Guru's words

289
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,818
and those beliefs are embedded within us.

290
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,156
What's so funny?

291
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,120
I'm sick and tired of this.

292
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:24,374
I don't care

293
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,460
what nonsense you believe in.

294
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,922
I don't care an ounce

295
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,426
about any absurd plots

296
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,178
you're hatching amongst yourselves.

297
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,056
So…

298
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,352
please leave my family alone.

299
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,606
Where is Jae-young?

300
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,153
You have Jae-young, don't you?

301
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,991
We did have doubts.

302
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:04,122
We wondered
how you'd be able to find this place.

303
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,418
Although Guru always turned out
to be correct.

304
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,212
This was

305
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,090
a very astonishing experience.

306
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,426
I don't want to hear it!

307
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,678
Stop spewing nonsense.
Tell me where you're keeping Jae-young.

308
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,223
You're in a very weak state.

309
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,435
You've completely lost your way.

310
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,689
Forget this obsession
over finding Jo Jae-young.

311
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,859
That matter is out of your hands.

312
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,112
You're lying.

313
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:40,992
I wasn't certain until I came here.

314
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,161
But not anymore.

315
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,705
Jae-young is alive.

316
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,417
And you are keeping her.

317
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:51,503
I'm right, aren't I?

318
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:56,383
You still believe you've found this place
of your own volition, don't you?

319
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,469
Fine.

320
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:04,474
What did you see before you came here?

321
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,645
Did you remember your high school days?

322
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,188
What?

323
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,821
I'll be more specific.

324
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,739
Do you recall it now?

325
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,951
The school you went to.

326
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,204
Your friends

327
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:28,581
from the magazine club.

328
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,127
Where are they now?

329
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:38,174
It's not purely by coincidence
that we've all come here.

330
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:44,222
This whole story begins
with you, old friend.

331
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,312
Do you remember this?

332
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:56,860
You do, don't you?

333
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:02,449
With this camera,
we could all be embraced by him.

334
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,578
You…

335
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,177
You died.

336
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,602
Jung-hyun, you did well by coming here.

337
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:35,565
Are you really Young-seob?

338
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,984
I have a story to tell you.

339
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:34,290
-Are you all right?
-Oh, hello.

340
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:38,378
Kim Hwan-gyu went into
the recuperating room a short while ago.

341
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:41,506
You finished less than an hour ago, right?

342
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:42,549
Yes.

343
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,471
I pulled these files together
by asking the investigators for a favor.

344
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,723
A lot of details
haven't been disclosed yet.

345
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:51,683
It's such a fresh case.

346
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:54,727
-I see. I'll take a look at it.
-Did you get anything out of him?

347
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,188
We got one answer.

348
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,316
You're not going to tell me?

349
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,653
I'll tell you after I piece it together.

350
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,157
Please understand.

351
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:12,829
All right.

352
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:15,832
And the commissioner gave us a week.

353
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,961
We pulled this off even though
the special unit has taken over the case.

354
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,797
Once our time is up,
we can't stay involved, you know.

355
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,674
-You understand that, right?
-Yes.

356
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,594
Kim Hwan-gyu will certainly make a fuss.

357
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:30,138
It's just a matter of time
before this is leaked to the press.

358
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,931
You don't have much time.

359
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,229
Thank you, Chief.

360
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:40,648
Don't mention it.

361
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,360
Is Mr. Lee here?

362
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,320
Welcome.

363
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:28,947
Welcome.

364
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,593
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

365
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:04,315
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

366
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,504
What do you want?

367
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,631
Excuse me.

368
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:29,799
Oh, I…

369
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:31,843
I wanted to pray.

370
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,220
Are you from Praise Team Four?

371
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:35,430
-What?
-You are, right?

372
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,765
The leader of Team Four
is giving me such a headache.

373
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,809
He never gets the notice, you know.

374
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,144
Oh, I see.

375
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:44,272
Last time, we were supposed to
gather here and then leave together.

376
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,357
But we had problems with the logistics.

377
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,860
So you're supposed to
gather at Central Market.

378
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:52,530
We have to do more work
because of people like your team leader.

379
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:54,157
-I see.
-And Team Four members

380
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,200
have been coming here all morning

381
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,952
and giving me so much trouble.

382
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:01,539
Wait here for me.

383
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,584
I was going to cross over
after I finish up here.

384
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:07,545
-So let's cross over together.
-Okay.

385
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,815
Oh, I'm in the middle of the ritual.
Would you like to join me?

386
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,067
No, I already did it.

387
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:32,195
Then just wait for a little.
I'm almost done.

388
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,191
Oh, I'm fine.

389
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,764
To our honorable Saju citizens.

390
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:27,643
We have invited a special guest
for the launch ceremony

391
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:32,148
of the youth development committee
supported by Saju Market.

392
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:33,441
Lim In-gwan!

393
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:36,360
That's correct. Let me introduce him.

394
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:40,239
The Chamsahwe Party for Saju.

395
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:42,825
Committee chair, Lim In-gwan.

396
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:46,412
-Lim In-gwan!
-Lim In-gwan!

397
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,874
-Lim In-gwan!
-Lim In-gwan!

398
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,417
Right.

399
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,003
-All right. Marching forward.
-Forward.

400
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:56,631
-Future.
-To Lim In-gwan.

401
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,257
Right.

402
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,092
Hello everyone.

403
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:03,179
I'm Lim In-gwan,
a senate candidate for Saju city.

404
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,975
I greet you again.

405
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:13,731
-Lim In-gwan!
-Lim In-gwan!

406
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:15,066
-Lim In-gwan!
-Lim In-gwan!

407
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,579
LIM IN-GWAN

408
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:36,128
You're talking about Senator Lim In-gwan,
who was elected in the local elections

409
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,797
that were held recently.

410
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,965
Yes, that's correct.

411
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:43,844
We haven't confirmed that he's a member
of the Youngjin sect yet.

412
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,850
Although the judge found him
innocent of all charges,

413
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:53,980
support from the Youngjin sect
played a critical role

414
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:56,440
in getting him elected to the senate
despite his past charges.

415
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,317
Found innocent.

416
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,695
Found innocent.

417
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:04,532
He was charged for mismanagement
of the One Family Welfare Center.

418
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,326
-That's the case, right?
-Yes.

419
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,079
The court found him

420
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,666
innocent of all charges in 1987.

421
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,127
You also know a lot about the case.

422
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,128
It's because

423
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,464
I naturally heard
about the final court decision.

424
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,216
Until then,

425
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:26,512
my wife hadn't cut off
all contact with him.

426
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:31,726
What do you mean by
her cutting off contact with Lim?

427
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,269
Did your wife know him?

428
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:36,063
Is that what you're implying?

429
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:39,525
Yes.

430
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,653
Lim In-gwan

431
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,656
is the father…

432
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,784
of my late wife.

433
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:02,131
That's correct, sir.

434
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,551
Oh my gosh.

435
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:14,810
This is the venue.

436
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,397
At full capacity,

437
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,524
this stadium can seat 30,000 people.

438
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,695
I'm hoping to fill the entire stadium.

439
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:27,656
How have you been?

440
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:29,950
You didn't come to the funeral.

441
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,661
I couldn't bury my own child.

442
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,955
I failed to protect her as her father.

443
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,418
I've lost all purpose in my life
after I lost her.

444
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:41,837
You look fine now.

445
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,215
I tried

446
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:47,468
so hard to forget my loss.

447
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,179
But that didn't work.

448
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,306
Then

449
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,976
a savior appeared in my life.

450
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:01,941
I now have a newfound belief.

451
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:05,528
I found a reservoir of strength,
which I didn't know I had,

452
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,739
to overcome

453
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,283
any hardships in life, Hyung-in.

454
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,120
Is the name

455
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,580
of this savior, Guru?

456
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:22,378
I was wondering
why you suddenly showed up.

457
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:25,714
Yes.

458
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:29,218
You and I are no longer close,
so to speak.

459
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:31,095
Father.

460
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,848
You're aware

461
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:37,017
of the recent spate of murders
that have been occurring, right?

462
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,185
Yes, I am.

463
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:42,481
As a citizen of Saju,
I lament these recent incidents.

464
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,024
I believe these murders

465
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:47,862
are connected to a new religious movement
called Youngjin.

466
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,321
Which means

467
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,825
I think this individual called Guru
is also involved.

468
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,411
So?

469
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,705
I sense that

470
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:02,168
you know something
about the Youngjin sect.

471
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,963
If you would cooperate,
it would help with my investigation.

472
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:14,597
How do you think you came here?

473
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,559
You think you came here on your own?

474
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:19,643
What?

475
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:22,062
I feel like

476
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:25,274
you're in a hurry.

477
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,026
Father.

478
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:29,278
What is causing you to be in such a rush?

479
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:32,615
Is it because of
the kidnapping of that girl?

480
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,326
Or is it because of the death
of your partner?

481
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:36,994
Why?

482
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,163
Is it making you enraged?

483
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,291
Is that why you're snooping around
in all sorts of places?

484
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:44,210
I don't know what you're getting at,

485
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:45,878
but I think that's enough.

486
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,550
You need to stop.

487
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:55,179
There's nothing you can do.

488
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,350
This is as far as it gets.

489
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,228
Don't get involved anymore.

490
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:04,730
Understand?

491
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,401
There will be memorial ceremonies

492
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:12,905
for the 1987 terrorist victims
everywhere around the city.

493
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,202
Since you're on the campaign trail,

494
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:20,496
I assume you'll be attending
such ceremonies.

495
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,332
Of course, I will.

496
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:26,126
As a citizen, it's my civic duty.

497
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:27,962
I'm not sure I'll ever go.

498
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:29,922
I've never attended

499
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,841
any of those ceremonies.

500
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,678
And the day of the ceremonies

501
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,264
is the same date
I hold rites to honor my late wife.

502
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,772
I don't know what each of us is pursuing.

503
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:47,940
But I sincerely wish

504
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:51,110
we're not on opposing sides.

505
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,935
YOUNGJIN BRAIN STUDY SCIENCE VIDEO

506
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:38,699
YOUNGJIN BRAIN STUDY SCIENCE VIDEO

507
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:04,224
Do you remember that day, Jung-hyun?

508
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:08,312
A videotape was delivered
to our club room in 1987.

509
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:10,189
We all gathered around to watch it.

510
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,400
We didn't know about it back then,

511
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:16,987
but his seed was planted in our souls
after we viewed it.

512
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:20,949
That seed remains in our soul

513
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:23,494
ever since it was planted there…

514
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,998
until he lets it sprout within us.

515
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,085
And a budding seed

516
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:35,381
can turn into a tree,
a blooming flower, or a poisonous herb.

517
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:36,525
All right, let's begin now.

518
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:57,838
He has tasked you with a sacred duty.

519
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:02,718
He also kindly led you here.

520
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:06,096
He gave you a mission.

521
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:17,441
Look at these faces, Jung-hyun.

522
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:21,778
It's us.

523
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:26,909
We carried out
the Saju station gas attack.

524
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,290
We were chosen.

525
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:07,866
And this is where history was made.

526
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:13,830
Kyung-ho, wait for me.

527
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:15,666
I'm here.

528
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:22,965
This looks like an abandoned building.

529
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:28,679
It was occupied just a few years ago.

530
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:30,514
What was it used for?

531
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:36,019
That…

532
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,278
Impossible.

533
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:47,739
It's really there.

534
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:54,288
Kyung-ho, how did you know that?

535
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:58,208
Why did you come here alone?

536
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:02,879
You're not going to take pictures?
Isn't this what you were looking for?

537
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:06,675
Answer my questions first.

538
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:10,387
It's not to come
to a remote place like this by chance.

539
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:14,099
Where were you for so long?
What were you up to?

540
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:19,479
Did you perhaps…

541
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:22,899
draw that?

542
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:23,984
So

543
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:26,778
all the things we found…

544
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:30,073
were stuff you made?

545
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,327
Jung-hyun.

546
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,457
You ask too many questions.

547
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,044
You just

548
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:44,880
have to follow what I say.

549
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:47,799
What?

550
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:49,593
That's how it's always been.

551
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:53,972
You wouldn't have been able to endure it
unless you followed me.

552
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:57,225
What are you talking about?

553
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,313
I don't understand a thing you're saying.

554
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:08,362
Of course, you don't remember.

555
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:12,783
You wouldn't know how it feels to be

556
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,329
left in that dark room

557
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:19,373
with no light or sound.

558
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:25,212
You wouldn't understand it.

559
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,555
You'll never know how it feels forever.

560
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:40,477
Jung-hyun.

561
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:43,980
Look at me.

562
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,002
Look at this.

563
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:08,463
Look at it.

564
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:16,471
You just have to do as I say.

565
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,833
This isn't a simple interview, is it?

566
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,336
What is the question
you really want to ask?

567
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:52,382
Should I say it out loud for you?

568
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,885
Am I involved in
the kidnapping of my daughter?

569
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:58,346
Do I have anything to do with
the murders or the Youngjin sect?

570
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:02,559
What is the real purpose
behind these incidents?

571
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:05,562
Am I right?

572
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:09,483
Or maybe not?

573
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:15,322
What you're really curious
about is this, isn't it?

574
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,616
Who is Guru?

575
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:21,495
Could I be Guru?

576
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,164
Then please answer the question.

577
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:27,417
Mr. Cho.

578
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,711
Are you Guru?

579
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:32,756
I guessed it correctly.
That was it all along, right?

580
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:35,759
Mr. Cho.

581
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:37,093
It's amusing.

582
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:43,934
You already picked an answer,
but you keep asking the same question.

583
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,156
Damn it.

What brings you here at this hour?

587
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:39,067
When I came in the morning,

588
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:43,196
Aly looked really sick.
I came to check on him.

589
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:45,156
I just got home too.

590
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:48,159
-Seems like he's asleep. It's very quiet.
-I see.

591
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,705
I baked some special treats for Aly

592
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,748
since he wasn't eating his food.

Aly died.

PERSONAL INFORMATION

604
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,803
After the first victim was found,

605
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,265
so many things changed
in the following days.

606
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:39,437
When my partner, Detective Lee, died,

607
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,899
I lost control.

608
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:45,527
I was

609
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:47,445
on a warpath,

610
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,949
destroying whatever I came across.

611
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:58,248
I became paranoid
that people were scowling at me.

612
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,460
It felt like
I was thrashing around in a trap

613
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,047
that someone had laid out.

614
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:07,340
A trap?

615
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:12,303
Why did you think it was a trap?

616
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:15,723
I had…

617
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:19,227
a creeping feeling…

618
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,398
that they were watching me…

619
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,319
for a very long time.

620
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,492
Oh, no. Aly.

621
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,377
Oh, no…

622
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,797
What are you doing, Mr. Choi?

623
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,717
Come and give Aly one last hug.

624
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,896
Oh, you poor thing.

625
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:04,647
Oh gosh. Aly.

626
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:21,372
Oh, you poor thing. Oh gosh…

627
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,792
Aly. Oh my. I'm sorry.

628
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,844
Oh gosh. I'm sorry.

629
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:46,439
Oh no. Oh gosh. You poor thing…

630
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:47,774
I'm so sorry.

631
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:54,656
Oh gosh…

632
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,367
Oh gosh. Aly.

633
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:00,078
They're watching me.

634
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:03,122
They're entrapping me.

635
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,043
They're calling me.

636
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:11,965
I had to end everything.

637
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:14,425
In order to do that,

638
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:17,720
I had to meet him.

639
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:21,140
I had to meet…

640
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:24,227
Guru.

641
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,437
Who did you think was Guru?

642
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:32,110
Let me rephrase that question.

643
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:35,238
Have you met a person called Guru?

644
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,074
Yes.

645
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:40,952
You actually met Guru?

646
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:42,662
Yes,

647
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:45,999
I did.

648
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:55,717
Let's try to use the quadratic formula.

649
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:59,012
So we made the function here.

650
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:00,305
You put a plus C here.

651
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:09,731
You carry it over.
Then look at the next line.

652
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:11,482
It becomes minus C.

653
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:13,026
Now that it's minus C,

654
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:15,695
you have x squared plus BX

655
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:18,239
divided by A.

656
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:31,336
Carry C over. It becomes minus C.

657
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:35,173
Now we take out A.
We make them equal here and here.

658
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:37,175
One side has to be squared.

659
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:38,676
Now we're almost done.

660
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:41,804
Sir.

661
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,015
What is it, Jung-hyun?

662
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:45,933
Can I go to the nurse's office?

663
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:47,226
Are you feeling sick?

664
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,482
I got a cut on my hand.

I'm right, aren't I?

668
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:01,778
I'm going to do everything
according to plan. There's no more time.

669
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:07,385
You can't change anything.

670
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:08,594
Look over there.

671
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:11,472
If you can't escape…

672
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:12,849
Oh gosh, Jung-hyun.

673
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:14,183
…just embrace it.

674
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:17,728
Let's proceed with the idea you had.

675
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:21,941
He's much more dangerous
than you think he is.

676
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:24,193
I wish that they will approach me.

677
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:27,655
And I wish they will ask me a question.

678
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:29,574
That symbol and creepy bell ring.

679
01:04:30,324 --> 01:04:32,994
