1
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:47,380
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,477
Mom.

3
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,396
Mom!

4
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,234
Mom!

5
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,736
Is anybody there?

6
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,414
Are you okay?

7
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:22,957
What?

8
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:29,088
Mom, I was calling you.
Why didn't you answer me?

9
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,216
What are you talking about?
You were asleep.

10
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,223
I must be very sick, Mom.

11
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,767
I just had a nightmare. It was so vivid.

12
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,769
You did?

13
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,066
Your friends came by.
Should I tell them to go?

14
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,609
Who came?

15
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,115
Are you dating Yong-tak?

16
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,825
He hasn't said anything.

17
00:01:58,701 --> 00:01:59,911
So you two are dating.

18
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,540
It's not official until he asks me out.

19
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,377
I'll leave the notes I took here.

20
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,047
I envy you two.

21
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,968
But why is he eating ice cream
in the morning?

22
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,469
Isn't it too cold?

23
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,888
It wakes him up.
He didn't sleep well last night.

24
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,269
-He didn't sleep well?
-Yes.

25
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,729
He says he's been having strange dreams.

26
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:33,194
I heard that Yong-tak was having
the same recurring dream.

27
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,990
I still remember it even after ten years.

28
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:39,993
Really?

29
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,620
Why can't I remember anything?

30
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,749
Jung-hyun.

31
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,753
Do you know why I remember
that morning so clearly?

32
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:54,883
Because a few days later,
the terrorist attack occurred.

33
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,467
During the Chuseok holidays…

34
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,094
After the attack,

35
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,638
you didn't come to school again.

36
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,684
Yes, I didn't.

37
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,770
After you stopped coming to school
due to the terrorist attack,

38
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,356
the school magazine club was disbanded.

39
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:14,068
And we hardly talked
to one another in school.

40
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,613
That's how we graduated.

41
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,477
Do you know the herbicide, Gramoxone?

42
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,649
It's cheap and effective.

43
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,194
So lots of farmers used it to kill weeds.

44
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,613
But Gramoxone is also

45
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,409
called the Blue Devil.

46
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,412
The minute you ingest it,

47
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:10,124
it will damage your tongue,
esophagus, and lungs.

48
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,127
It'll burn everything in its path.

49
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,673
The pain is akin to being burned alive.

50
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,549
And it feels like your flesh is melting.

51
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:23,429
You'll experience hellish pain.

52
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:26,849
I see.

53
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,143
A few years ago,

54
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,482
a 12-year old girl poured Gramoxone
into her dad's makgeolli drink

55
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,277
and killed him.

56
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,653
What's worse is the fact

57
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,532
she took a video of her dad dying.

58
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,617
We found the tape.

59
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,537
So I asked the girl

60
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,624
why she did it.

61
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,919
I told her I wasn't asking her
why she killed him.

62
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,046
I wanted to know
why she videotaped her dad

63
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,383
as he was dying.

64
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,636
What she told me

65
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,598
stayed with me for quite a while.

66
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,517
What did she say?

67
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,894
She did it to not forget.

68
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,942
She didn't want to forget

69
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,486
how much she hated her dad.

70
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:25,450
So to prevent herself
from forgiving her dad over time,

71
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,245
she made that videotape.

72
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,332
That's what she said.

73
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,884
I think about what she said
from time to time.

74
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:50,641
I constantly try to get rid of memories
about disturbing cases I've worked on.

75
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,564
But she was doing the opposite.

76
00:05:58,566 --> 00:05:59,776
If I may,

77
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,196
can I ask you if what happened that day

78
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,992
is also one of your disturbing memories?

79
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,082
I heard that there was an accident.

80
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,162
Team One. What's the status?

81
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:55,623
The hallway on the first floor is clear.

82
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,291
We have confirmed
the presence of individuals.

83
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,047
Team One. What is the status?

84
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,550
Team Two.
We're going in to provide support.

85
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,371
-Stop!
-Don't move!

86
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,292
Die!

87
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,673
Head to the second floor.

88
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,501
-What the hell?
-What is it?

89
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,212
Don't be afraid. We're the police.

90
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,007
Are you being held here against your will?

91
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,925
Who did you say you are?

92
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,135
We're the police.

93
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,931
But this door is too thick to break open.
We'll need a key to open it.

94
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,933
No, we can't.

95
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,602
What? You can't do what?

96
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,061
It's too noisy outside.

97
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,149
They might be listening to everything.

98
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,405
Detective Lee, check that area.

99
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,282
-Okay.
-Be careful.

100
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,202
Damn it.

101
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,204
Hang in there for a minute.

102
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:27,877
What is this?

103
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,004
This way.

104
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,981
-Hey, drop your weapon.
-Hey, you punk.

105
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,275
It's over. Drop your weapon.

106
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:54,070
I told you to drop your weapon.
You crazy bastard!

107
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,404
Detective Lee, stay calm.

108
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,079
Drop the gun.

109
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,290
-Do you see it?
-Hey! Drop the gun.

110
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,919
-You can't see it?
-You piece of shit!

111
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,713
-Don't play games with us!
-Detective Lee, stay still.

112
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,800
What are you talking about? Talk to us.

113
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,177
That woman over there.

114
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,389
You don't see her?

115
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,100
Damn it.

116
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,769
No, I don't see anyone.
Who are you talking about?

117
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,397
So that's it.

118
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,193
-That's what Guru has been telling us.
-Guru?

119
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,362
-Hey! Wait!
-I'm sorry, Dear.

120
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,788
Detective Lee.

121
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,666
Check that area.

122
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,544
Stay focused.
And don't let your guard down.

123
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:52,878
Okay.

124
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:09,895
Detective Lee.

125
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,983
Take the keys.
Go back to those people we saw.

126
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,736
-Stay calm.
-Okay.

127
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,448
Damn it.

128
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,703
I see you're all ready to leave.

129
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:08,996
Please be patient.

130
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:11,874
I unlocked it.

131
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,975
CROCODILE SNACK SHOP

132
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,147
What is that?

133
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:18,857
It's a Tamagotchi.

134
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,445
Check if I memorized it all.

135
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:31,954
Detective Choi, I did not intend
to hide any evidence.

136
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:37,543
My friend, Jo Jae-young,
asked me not to tell anyone

137
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,463
about the tape.
So that's why I didn't mention it.

138
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:46,093
But since Jae-young is still missing,

139
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,929
I'm very worried about her.

140
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:52,099
That's why I think giving you the tape

141
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,350
that Jae-young lent to me

142
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:57,646
-is the right thing to do--
-Can't you speak naturally?

143
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,899
-You sound like a robot.
-It's too long.

144
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,400
You interrupted me.

145
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,320
-What comes next?
-I hope you'll forgive me.

146
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,114
I hope you'll forgive me.

147
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:12,411
Hey, people are asking for refunds
for the mixtape we made this time.

148
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,121
We're going to lose money.

149
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,416
I heard that everyone at school
thinks we're losers.

150
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,335
Hey, that's nothing.

151
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,503
My mom won't even fix me any meals.

152
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:25,049
I need to be loved to grow up
into a healthy person.

153
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:31,013
When Jae-young returns,
let's make her pay for this.

154
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,390
Right. We're going through this
because of her.

155
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,268
I think she should be the one
who goes to buy instant noodles for us

156
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,770
at the snack shop for a year.

157
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,396
-Yes.
-I totally agree.

158
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,564
That's right.

159
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,025
-Hurry up and memorize it.
-Let me have it.

160
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,778
Detective Choi…

161
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,335
Hello.

162
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:05,798
We came to see Detective Choi Hyung-in.

163
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:06,882
Why do you need to see him?

164
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,803
We're in the broadcasting club
at Gyeongcheon Girls' Middle School.

165
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,473
We have something
to give to the detective.

166
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:17,768
He is busy at the moment.
I'll give it to him so leave it with me.

167
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,859
-What is this?
-It's a cassette tape.

168
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,780
But there's something

169
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:33,117
I also need to tell Detective Choi.

170
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,827
Go ahead and say it. I'll write a note.

171
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,289
It won't be necessary. It's okay.

172
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,127
That's all you need, right?
I'll just give this to him. Okay?

173
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,462
Okay.

174
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,105
Take the medicine.

175
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,252
I don't think your dog
will live that much longer.

176
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,215
He's around 15 years old, I think.

177
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,719
I feel sorry for him.

178
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:39,016
If my wife were alive,
he would have had a fun life.

179
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,062
Living with an owner like me isn't fun.

180
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,155
You quit drinking, didn't you?

181
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,994
After taking a sip,

182
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:03,332
I remember why I tried so hard
to quit drinking.

183
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,626
What was the reason?

184
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,213
I can forget things for a while

185
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,757
when I drink.

186
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,510
But when I get sober the next day,

187
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,847
I'm saddled with guilt.

188
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,225
Then I go back to having a drink.

189
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,478
You know what?

190
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,648
It's similar to
how a low-life gambler who owes money

191
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,318
turns to loan sharks to borrow more.

192
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,868
Hyung-in.

193
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,413
Don't blame yourself for it.

194
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,333
It wasn't your fault.

195
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,177
Hold on a minute.

196
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,944
Let's go.

197
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,281
Now.

198
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,826
Get off first, Chief.

199
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,746
Why aren't you getting out?

200
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:29,001
It's because you're taking your time.

201
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,264
You can have it if you want.

202
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,808
Isn't this expensive?

203
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,186
I don't know.
I have a bunch of them at home.

204
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,491
Oh, Chief.

205
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,901
I didn't expect
to see you here, Detective Choi.

206
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,570
I was told you were partners.

207
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,573
Yes.

208
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:45,244
You're friends with Detective Lee's wife?

209
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,704
Yes. She's an old high school friend.

210
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,164
I see.

211
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,756
You must feel bad about
what happened to your partner.

212
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,095
My feelings are of no significance.

213
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,472
My partner is probably
going through a lot.

214
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,145
I need to go.

215
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,273
I just came to see how he was doing.

216
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,401
Oh, I'm sorry for taking up your time.

217
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,485
That's all right.

218
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,569
Whenever I see you,

219
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,530
I have

220
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,116
so many questions to ask.

221
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,493
I know

222
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,621
you're busy working on the case.

223
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,459
Ms. Jo,

224
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,796
a special investigation unit

225
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,299
has been assigned to this case.

226
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:44,761
They'll probably investigate
your niece's disappearance as well.

227
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,097
What are you talking about?

228
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,934
-A new team will take over the case?
-Yes.

229
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,770
Not right now, but it'll happen soon.

230
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,439
What about you, Detective Choi?

231
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,566
You'll be joining the new team, won't you?

232
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,782
This doesn't make sense.

233
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,368
It looks like

234
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,121
the police are dropping the case entirely.

235
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,123
No.

236
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,793
A more experienced team than us
will take over the investigation.

237
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:43,528
Ms. Jo Jung-hyun.

238
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,158
I don't know
if it's okay for me to tell you this,

239
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,162
bu on October 6, 1987,
one day before Chuseok,

240
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,040
I lost my wife.

241
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,669
She was a victim of
Jo Kyung-ho's terrorist attack.

242
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:06,134
Searching for Jo Kyung-ho's daughter

243
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,471
and talking with
that bastard's family members

244
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,474
feels like a form of punishment.

245
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,309
Of course, you had no part of it.

246
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,646
And that's also the case with your niece.

247
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,440
But it's hard for me
not to feel any anger.

248
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,068
No matter how hard I try.

249
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:30,033
I realize how I feel about this case

250
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,953
after my partner got severely injured.

251
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,204
It's clear to me now.

252
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,580
I'm

253
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,834
not a saint
who doesn't harbor any ill will

254
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,044
towards you and your family.

255
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:45,298
So that disqualifies me
from handling this case anymore.

256
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,556
I'm so sorry.

257
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,393
I'm very sorry.

258
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,436
I'm sorry.

259
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,521
No.

260
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,483
I don't feel any compassion

261
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,903
for your pain and anguish.

262
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,030
So it's better

263
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,033
for someone else to take over this case.

264
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,245
Please…

265
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,792
don't stop looking for my niece.

266
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,838
I refuse.

267
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:30,010
I hate looking at you and your family

268
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:32,888
crying in front of me.

269
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:36,850
That's who I am.

270
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:41,730
I'm sorry.

271
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,378
Oh, what now?

272
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,141
What is it, Chief?

273
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,644
You'll be able to return to the force.

274
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:26,149
Chief, speak slower. I can't understand.

275
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,277
Or you can write it down.

276
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,874
You'll be able to return to the force.
Don't worry.

277
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:45,877
I don't understand what that means,

278
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,004
but it's good news, right?

279
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,298
I know that.

280
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:16,950
Hello?

281
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,410
Do you know what time it is?

282
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,161
I don't know. What time is it?

283
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,497
It's only 9 p.m.

284
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,041
Why did you call? You're so annoying.

285
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,502
Hurry up
and turn on the instant messenger.

286
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,421
I'm too tired.

287
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,173
Hurry up and open it. It's urgent.

288
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,592
Oh gosh.

289
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,727
I logged on. What now?

290
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,437
-Don't you see it?
-See what?

291
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,230
Jae-young has logged on.

292
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,649
-Take a look.
-What?

293
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,193
JAE-YOUNG: ONLINE

294
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,032
-You're right.
-I told you so.

295
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:00,618
-Did you send her a message?
-Yes, but she hasn't answered back.

296
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:05,457
Jae-young, where are you?

297
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,833
Are you okay?

298
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,004
She's not answering, right?

299
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,632
No.

300
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,511
You'll find it
in the 1987 school magazine.

301
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,685
SEPTEMBER 8, 1999

302
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,451
KILLERS, THE ANATOMY OF EVIL,
COLD BLOOD MAN

303
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:54,839
MISSING CASE OF JAE-YOUNG
SUSPECT HAS CONFESSED

304
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,768
-Chief.
-Oh, you came.

305
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,895
-Sorry for the late-night call.
-Not at all.

306
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,940
Why do you think he confessed?

307
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,442
How can we understand
a psycho's intentions?

308
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:27,205
I've been telling you again and again.

309
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,626
I want to see Detective Choi Hyung-in

310
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,337
of the mobile investigative unit.

311
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,842
I won't talk to anyone else

312
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,468
if you don't bring him here.

313
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,555
You don't know my face, I see.

314
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:49,060
Do you happen to be

315
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,646
Detective Choi Hyung-in?

316
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,984
Oh, you are.

317
00:28:56,693 --> 00:29:00,196
You look
exactly like you do in that photo.

318
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,328
What? A photo?

319
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:09,748
Yes, sir.

320
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,667
Detective Choi Hyung-in.

321
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,472
Mr. Kim Hwan-gyu.

322
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,516
Are you taking orders
from someone by any chance?

323
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:30,894
No.

324
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:32,979
There's nothing like that.

325
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,983
But someone showed you my picture.

326
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,069
Did that person order you

327
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,905
to kidnap the girl?

328
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,367
And is Jae-young

329
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,120
with that person right now?

330
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,293
You're asking all the wrong questions.

331
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:06,846
But Detective Choi,
can I ask you something?

332
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:12,811
What do you think?

333
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,438
Will Guru

334
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,483
love me?

335
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,075
Why are you asking me that?

336
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,786
And who is Guru for that matter?

337
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:34,666
Is he the one behind all of this?

338
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,253
Did he also give you orders?

339
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,629
Guru told me

340
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,424
you would tear me apart.

341
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,427
-What?
-After I tell you everything,

342
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,888
he said you would

343
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,016
peel the skin off my body with a knife.

344
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,686
-Hey, Mr. Kim Hwan-gyu.
-And then

345
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:58,147
you would pour scalding hot water on me.

346
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,607
What nonsense is this?

347
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,276
And when I beg for mercy,

348
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:03,903
you will

349
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,573
spit on me.

350
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,328
Damn it.

351
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,832
I finally see what's going on now.

352
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,921
I don't know who this Guru guy is.

353
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,425
But based on the crazy stuff
he's telling you,

354
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:27,552
he's not going to protect you at all.

355
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,722
If it's proven that

356
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,892
you committed the kidnapping alone,

357
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,854
then your life will be over,
Mr. Kim Hwan-gyu.

358
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,107
You'll rot in prison
and never see the light of the day.

359
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,193
Every word you say

360
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,031
will determine your fate.

361
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:49,532
So Mr. Kim,

362
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,952
you better think before you speak.

363
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:58,249
Is this conversation

364
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,252
being recorded, by any chance?

365
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,963
I could turn off the microphone
if you want.

366
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,006
No.

367
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:06,966
Keep recording.

368
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,218
Okay. Start talking.

369
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,012
I

370
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,599
kidnapped Jo Jae-young

371
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:18,019
on July 15th,

372
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:22,106
-and on the next day, July 16th,
-Hey Kim Hwan-gyu.

373
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,400
I strangled Jo Jae-young to death.

374
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,528
-After that, I cut her body into pieces.
-Kim Hwan-gyu!

375
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,530
I loaded the body parts onto a car

376
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:32,784
and threw them over the Busan Bridge
into the ocean.

377
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:36,245
I carried this out alone.

378
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,456
I regret…

379
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,586
the crime I committed.

380
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,676
I'll ask you to start again.
Speak the truth.

381
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:53,930
Did you

382
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,975
kill Jo Jae-young?

383
00:32:58,768 --> 00:32:59,811
Yes.

384
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,272
I killed her.

385
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:12,740
Start over from the top, you bastard.

386
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:19,831
I

387
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:23,960
kidnapped Jo Jae-young

388
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,380
on July 15th,

389
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,009
and on the next day, July 16th…

390
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:37,098
CONDOLENCES

391
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:02,915
Jae-young was a special classmate to us.

392
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:07,879
Although she had recently
transferred to our school,

393
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:09,464
she was a model student

394
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,674
and made many friends.

395
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,719
She was loved by many students.

396
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:19,557
We've lost Jae-young in an unexpected way,

397
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:24,896
but we'll always remember her.

398
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,362
Would you like me to
drive around the school?

399
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,199
Yes, could you?

400
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:40,953
Let Jae-young's soul
see her school one last time.

401
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,522
Aunt.

402
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,232
Aunt.

403
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,278
When did she log in?

404
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,155
A month ago.

405
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,659
She didn't say anything else?

406
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:23,121
She said we'd find it
in the 1987 school magazine.

407
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,330
And then she logged off.

408
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,541
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

409
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:30,169
Well, she didn't say anything else.

410
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:33,548
We thought someone was
playing a prank on us.

411
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,759
But you should have still told me!

412
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,599
I'm sorry.

413
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:49,856
But

414
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,650
we…

415
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:55,778
Don't cry.

416
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,114
You're making me cry now.

417
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:00,700
We…

418
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,660
We never imagined

419
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:07,915
that Jae-young would be dead.

420
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,044
We believed that

421
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:15,006
she would return
as if nothing had happened.

422
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,760
And we didn't want to worry you, Aunt.

423
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,639
That's why we didn't tell you.

424
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,602
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

425
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,233
You don't need to be.

426
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:38,029
Moon-sook, I'm sorry.

427
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,657
I'm sorry for getting mad.

428
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:45,786
Don't cry.

429
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,237
What's the matter?

430
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,114
Why are we going to the crematorium
when her body wasn't found?

431
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,659
But we can't do it without you.

432
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,953
It's okay. I can take care of it later.

433
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:33,876
Min-jae, Young-seob knew that
Jae-young was going to be kidnapped.

434
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,045
It doesn't add up.

435
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,382
And the symbol I saw
in Kim Hwan-gyu's home

436
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,384
is the same symbol we saw ten years ago.

437
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,972
That bastard, Kim Hwan-gyu,
could not have done this by himself.

438
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,308
What does it matter at this point?

439
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,601
No, Mom.

440
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,270
Jae-young might still be alive.

441
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,562
Jung-hyun…

442
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:55,898
Even if

443
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,901
Jae-young is actually dead,

444
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,154
I'm going to find out what I can.

445
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,490
There's nothing holding me back now.

446
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:09,120
I'm going to find Young-seob's family
and get answers from them.

447
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,621
If that doesn't work…

448
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,877
I'm going to see that bastard too.

449
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,379
What did you just say?

450
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,008
Don't you even think about it.

451
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:35,438
Anyone in there?

452
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,735
Are there any adults at home?

453
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:41,819
Who are you?

454
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:44,113
I came here before.

455
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:46,574
A person called Jung Young-seob
used to live here.

456
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,243
Who are you?

457
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,538
Hello. I'm a friend of Young-seob.

458
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:54,040
Young-seob?

459
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,666
Who is Young-seob?

460
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,337
He used to live here.
You don't know him? It's Jung Young-seob.

461
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,465
I don't know who you're talking about.

462
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:07,219
My son and I live here
with my granddaughter.

463
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,305
No such person
called Young-seob lives here.

464
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:14,185
If it's okay with you,
can I take a look around your house?

465
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:16,979
-What?
-I know it's a big favor to ask.

466
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,939
Could you please let me?

467
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,193
Oh gosh. What is the meaning of this?

468
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,489
Thank you.

469
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,708
That's our storage room.

470
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,837
This is the house. I remember.

471
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,342
So how long have you lived here?

472
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,595
We moved here ten years ago.

473
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:56,477
Hello?

474
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,979
Are you a renter? Is that why you came?

475
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,106
A renter?

476
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:04,318
Aren't you the people who came by before,
asking to rent our house?

477
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,999
YOUNG-SEOB'S MOM

478
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:24,547
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached…

479
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,695
JO JUNG-HYUN

480
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,391
The doctor said I'll get better

481
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,603
even though it won't be a full recovery.

482
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,898
So please stop looking at me like that.

483
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:25,566
It's very awkward.

484
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,781
I'm thinking about

485
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,201
quitting the force.

486
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:44,293
I did some research
and found that we could transfer

487
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:47,004
to a state-owned company
since we worked as civil servants.

488
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:50,090
With some luck, I think I can get us
transferred to the same place.

489
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,219
But we'll have to take an English test.

490
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,554
So let's prepare for it.

491
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:57,264
What?

492
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,058
What did you say?

493
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:04,063
I'm getting sick and tired…

494
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,400
but it's not because of you.

495
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,748
Detective Choi,
do you know what you're eating?

496
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:23,916
What?

497
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:25,292
The snack you're eating with your beer.

498
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,379
That's a snack I made for your dog.

499
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:29,588
I told you earlier.

500
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,884
Oh, is that so? It was on the table. So…

501
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,678
I put it there to let it cool.

502
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:39,765
I was going to stop you sooner,
but you seemed to like it.

503
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:42,685
It's rather tasteless. You sure like it.

504
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:49,858
Oh, it's good.

505
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,830
New voice message.

506
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:07,293
Detective Choi,
you're not answering my calls now.

507
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:10,629
I heard that the girls
from the school's broadcasting club

508
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:13,215
gave you a cassette tape.

509
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:16,802
I was wondering if I could listen to it.

510
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:19,013
Please call me back
when you hear this message.

511
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,389
I'll wait for your call.

512
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,696
Has your family come to visit you?

513
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:40,826
Yes, my sister came to visit just once.

514
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,246
Do you remember the conversation
you had with her?

515
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,624
Yes, I do.

516
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:50,753
She pretended to be calm,
but she was very anxious.

517
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:54,340
She also seemed to be terrified.

518
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,135
Why do you think

519
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:01,680
she thought she had to see you
all of a sudden?

520
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:05,851
I don't know.

521
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:11,732
That's a question
I would like to ask you instead.

522
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,237
Don't you think you came too late?

523
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,575
You came too late.

524
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,746
SEPTEMBER 10, 1999

525
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:19,049
Hi Jung-hyun.

526
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:26,181
I can't talk you out of quitting, right?

527
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,016
No, Chief.

528
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:31,979
-What do you plan on doing?
-I'll transfer to a state company first.

529
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,272
Once I settle down,

530
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:38,527
-I'm thinking about getting a degree.
-What kind of degree?

531
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,572
It's just an idea for now.

532
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:45,409
A degree in criminal psychology, maybe.

533
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:47,911
Since you meet crazy criminals,

534
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,497
you must want to know
how their minds work.

535
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:16,231
Did anyone leave a package for me?
A cassette tape.

536
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,733
Oh, that.

537
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:20,736
I left it at the hospital by mistake
when I went to see Detective Lee.

538
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:22,863
He didn't give it to you?

539
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:24,990
Okay. I'll call him.

540
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:34,500
I haven't seen your face
in 12 years, right?

541
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,003
I'll get straight to the point.

542
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:39,838
Jae-young is missing.

543
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,633
I already know.

544
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:43,884
Did you plan it?

545
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:48,889
-Jung-hyun.
-It's you? Right?

546
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,141
You did this, right?

547
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,228
Do you think I didn't know?

548
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,522
I knew you were contacting Jae-young.

549
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:59,274
So don't play games with me.

550
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,401
Tell me what you know.

551
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:07,741
What I know… Let's see.

552
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:10,953
I wasn't in direct contact with Jae-young.

553
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:11,954
What?

554
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:13,956
Let me set the record straight.

555
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:18,752
Did it ever cross your mind that Jae-young
might have reached out to me first?

556
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:21,255
Don't you say that. That's crazy.

557
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:23,048
Why does it sound crazy?

558
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,302
I don't have time for these games.

559
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:31,014
Just tell me what you know.

560
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:34,434
You're worried about Jae-young

561
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:37,062
but you don't know anything about her.

562
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:39,439
I know a lot more than you do
as you rot in prison.

563
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:40,566
No.

564
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:44,111
I'm asking you for real, Jung-hyun.

565
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,738
Do you really know her well?

566
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:47,781
For example,

567
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,284
have you mentioned me to her?

568
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:54,371
Have you ever talked about

569
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:58,041
what I did that day to her?

570
00:47:58,834 --> 00:47:59,876
No.

571
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,129
Because it's unnecessary.

572
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,715
Why do you get to decide that?

573
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:07,009
You've got some nerve
to say that, you know.

574
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:08,885
Have you gone crazy in your prison cell?

575
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,721
What I did

576
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:14,933
is like an unavoidable destiny
to Jae-young.

577
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:16,435
So why are you rejecting it?

578
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:19,229
By not mentioning it,

579
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,440
you might have created

580
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:25,569
unnecessary guilt
to grow inside Jae-young's mind.

581
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:26,486
Guilt?

582
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,739
Why should she be ridden
by guilt because of what you did?

583
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:29,823
Who do you think you are?

584
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:33,619
You're dead to us.

585
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,705
That's not possible.

586
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:41,209
Jung-hyun, you're totally delusional.

587
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:47,716
You still don't get it?

588
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,479
Why did you return to Saju?

589
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,022
What?

590
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:05,192
Why did you decide
to return to our hometown?

591
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,194
Because Jae-young wanted to go back.

592
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,238
Let me rephrase the question.

593
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,367
Why do you think Jae-young
wanted to return to Saju?

594
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,869
And why didn't you ask her
why she wanted that?

595
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:17,454
What were you afraid of?

596
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:21,833
Because she might have mentioned that
if you had asked?

597
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:23,293
Shut up.

598
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,537
Hold on for a second.

599
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:02,582
I found it.

600
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:06,253
It got thrown into a bag with other stuff.
I forgot about it.

601
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,463
I'll come to pick it up then.

602
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:11,466
I'll call you on my way
after I get off work.

603
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,719
Sure. Call me then.

604
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:41,788
What did you just do?

605
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:43,915
I'm calming you down.

606
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:49,129
Did you try this on Jae-young too?

607
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:50,839
Try what?

608
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,009
Jae-young's kidnapping.

609
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:58,597
Did you hypnotize Kim Hwan-gyu
to kidnap her?

610
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:05,854
There was…

611
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:09,274
no reason…

612
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:13,653
for Kim Hwan-gyu to kidnap Jae-young.

613
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:19,075
I'm not defending him.

614
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:22,287
But…

615
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,040
Hwan-gyu had…

616
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:27,959
no motive…

617
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:33,632
to kill Jae-young, whatsoever.

618
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,219
Jae-young…

619
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,056
was a nice kid.

620
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,727
You don't see kids like that often.

621
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:55,070
Mom, Jae-young and I

622
00:51:57,739 --> 00:51:59,741
were living hidden lives.

623
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:04,329
Like moles living underground…

624
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:08,708
It's all

625
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:13,004
because of you that we had to…

626
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:17,759
live like this.

627
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:22,138
Tell me.

628
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:26,184
What have you done?

629
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,812
You crazy bastard.

630
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,236
Jung-hyun.

631
00:52:38,154 --> 00:52:40,365
There is something you forgot.

632
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:45,078
You're the most important person
in this plan.

633
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:51,543
But you're removing yourself from it.

634
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:00,218
What?

635
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:02,554
Why did you come to see me?

636
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:05,348
What came to your mind
to compel you to see me?

637
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,267
Do you understand what I'm saying?

638
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,355
Cut the bullshit.

639
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:16,526
I'll tell you.

640
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:20,280
You came here after seeing that symbol.

641
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:21,990
But you still haven't asked me

642
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:25,118
anything about that.

643
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:30,874
Jung-hyun, why aren't you asking
any questions about that?

644
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:35,170
Because you're afraid?

645
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:40,216
When we left the orphanage
a long time ago,

646
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:45,388
I planted that inside you.

647
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:52,520
This story begins with me,
Jae-young and you.

648
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,440
You can't forget that.

649
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:59,694
If you do, you'll commit the same mistake.

650
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:02,656
And then it'll lead to the same event.

651
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:07,827
You'll never be able to
go back to a normal life.

652
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:08,954
Jung-hyun.

653
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:06,469
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached,

654
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:07,971
please leave a message…

655
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:20,358
Excuse me. I'd like another beer.

656
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:22,360
Okay.

657
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:43,339
Detective Choi called.

658
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:45,425
Oh, he did?

659
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,802
I guess he'll be here soon.

660
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:49,304
Yes.

661
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:51,306
Is that the tape?

662
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:57,562
Yes, I thought I'd listened to it.

663
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:09,699
The whistling sound is so creepy.

664
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:10,992
Whistling sound?

665
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:15,080
I can't hear any whistling.

666
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:17,832
Really?

667
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:22,170
There's a bell ringing
and whistling sounds.

668
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:23,505
Really?

669
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:52,659
The candidates are stopping by towns
and campaigning vigorously.

670
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:55,161
Candidate Lim of the Chamsahwe Party

671
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:58,832
predicts victory as he points out
the strong support he's getting.

672
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:01,376
Candidate Lim is asking voters
to elect him

673
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:04,087
because Saju needs someone
to lift its economy.

674
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,131
He says it's time for a fresh new face,

675
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:08,049
and promised to get
the stalled Saju power plant

676
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:11,052
off the ground and breathe new energy
into the economy.

677
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,433
Are you okay?

678
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:01,311
Did you have a nightmare again?

679
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:04,022
Yes. I'm fine.

680
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:08,693
Go back to sleep. I need a glass of water.

681
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:28,374
Are you awake?

682
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,552
What is that?

683
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:41,721
This has never happened before.

684
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:46,494
NO TRESPASSING

685
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:11,477
NO TRESPASSING

686
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:58,311
Did Guru command you

687
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,355
to commit those acts?

688
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:05,151
Do you really think
you can get the answers you want from me?

689
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:08,362
We want to learn the truth.

690
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:10,615
Do you recall it now? Your friends.

691
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:13,784
What you're really curious
about is this, isn't it?

692
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:15,786
Who is Guru?

693
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,580
What have you done to me?

694
01:05:19,498 --> 01:05:21,125
Guru told me

695
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:23,878
you weren't like a living person.

696
01:05:27,214 --> 01:05:32,219
