Black history.

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,140
He wanted to laugh at me.

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,100
Fu Sichen and I are enemies.

8
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,620
Every minute here,

9
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,860
It's a disgrace and a torment.

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,580
I want to escape.

11
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,380
When he comes back,

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,780
I rushed out immediately.

13
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,620
What we need to do now

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,900
Waiting for him to come back.

15
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:48,820
If he doesn't come back,

16
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,940
I'm definitely not sleeping.

17
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,060
Are you waiting for me to come home?

18
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,780
I missed the best time to escape.

19
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:05,820
What is this guy doing?

20
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,260
Where are you looking?

21
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,740
What kind of weird look is that?

22
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,060
You used to be a female cat.

23
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,940
No wonder you're so naughty.

24
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,740
So you haven't been sterilized yet.

25
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,300
I'll take you to the pet hospital.

26
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:33,740
Kittens

27
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,900
I'm going to the pet hospital.

28
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,540
He can't see me if he hides here.

29
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,020
What are you doing here?

30
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,100
Can't you find me?

31
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:44,900
Can't find me.

32
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,700
So you like to play hide and seek.

33
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,500
Who has the time to play with you?

34
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,340
Be good. It doesn't hurt at all.

35
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,140
I'll reward you with a cat bar after I finish.

36
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,380
Who cares about your cat strips?

37
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,620
Take it away.

38
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,300
It seems that today is doomed.

39
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,060
So you want to visit your savior.

40
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,780
Xiao Nian is so sad for me.

41
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,060
The female lead is too miserable.

42
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,380
The man is a scumbag.

43
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,140
You should be with a man.

44
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,900
(Xiao Nian)

45
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,580
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,420
Pei Pei is like this. I'm still watching TV.

47
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,460
It's okay.

48
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,620
You can't keep staring at Pei Pei.

49
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,940
What did the doctor say this morning?

50
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,300
The doctor said Pei Pei was fine.

51
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,620
When Pei Pei wakes up.

52
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,580
So,

53
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,540
You can take Pei Pei home.

54
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,700
Take it home.

55
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,980
I think we can consider this.

56
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,980
It's really inconvenient here.

57
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,340
This morning, I want to clean Pei Pei's face.

58
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,340
Just barged into a few paparazzi.

59
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,380
And then I gave it to you.

60
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:19,980
Hold it there.

61
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,380
We won't consider it.

62
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,180
Take it home and take care of it.

63
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,420
(Yes. Ask Fu Sichen to take me home.)

64
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,020
I'll take care of Fu Sichen.

65
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,020
What's going on?

66
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,300
If you insist on it,

67
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,180
It's a deal.

68
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,020
I'm talking about my own home. What are you thinking?

69
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,700
Did something pass just now?

70
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,020
I saw a cat wearing a sheet.

71
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,140
No animals were harmed during the filming.

72
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,180
