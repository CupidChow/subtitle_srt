The dress of the heroine of our drama club doesn't fit.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,180
Which character?

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:12,940
Let me see.

7
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,500
Can you do it?

8
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,740
Who can't?

9
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,220
I'm the future Empress.

10
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,020
Which character's clothes are these?

11
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,860
The princess in Sleeping Beauty.

princess

13
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,220
I prefer modern clothes.

14
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,220
This is not good.

15
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,780
You don't like acting so much.

16
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:36,940
Yes?

17
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,100
Don't try.

18
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,060
Who is the leading man of this drama?

19
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:42,460
I

20
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:43,740
you

21
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,900
I remember this play has a kissing scene, right?

22
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,100
I'm so close to you. It's inappropriate.

23
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,058
Also

24
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,580
One of them

25
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,940
The princess touched the spindle and the prince kissed her awake.

26
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,740
Kiss me.

27
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,220
My first kiss is still here.

28
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,100
I'm not acting.

29
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,420
Don't worry, I'll take the seat then.

30
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,540
Put your chin on your lips.

31
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,340
You can wake up then.

32
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:25,934
Oh

33
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,060
My princess.

34
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,420
I'm here.

35
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,740
What a beautiful and kind and lovely princess.

36
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,780
Let me lift your curse.

37
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:01,660
My first kiss was in front of so many people.

38
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,940
You did well today. This is your reward.

39
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,180
I cooked the steak myself.

40
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:11,700
What about

41
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:12,700
It tastes good.

42
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,220
It's just my stomach.

43
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,900
Look at your mouth full of sauce.

44
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,220
You know what?

45
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,260
Pei Zhen loves the steak I cooked for her.

46
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,060
Every time I cook her steak,

47
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,340
Although she doesn't say it,

48
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,020
but

49
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,060
I know she loves them.

50
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,420
You seem to understand what I said.

51
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,980
Are you Pei Zhen?

52
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,340
No animals were harmed during the filming.
