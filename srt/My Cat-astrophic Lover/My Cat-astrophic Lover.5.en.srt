(Two years ago)

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:12,980
Are you scared?

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,500
Or

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,300
Let's change to a cartoon.

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,460
I will be scared.

8
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:19,660
Don't change it.

9
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,620
This one.

10
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,820
Are you sure?

11
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,540
I like to watch movies with the lights off.

12
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,340
Just close it.

13
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:28,860
Who are you afraid of?

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,220
that

15
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,260
Here we go.

16
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,180
This movie is really good.

17
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,420
It's indeed the best story this year.

18
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,060
Aren't you scared?

19
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,580
Finished

20
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,300
The movie was so boring that I nearly fell asleep.

21
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:27,900
Really?

22
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,140
There's a figure.

23
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:38,340
Where is it?

24
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,540
Over there.

25
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,460
Why are you laughing?

26
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,700
You are still like a child.

27
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,660
You're stubborn.

28
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,740
If you had told me earlier, we would have finished earlier.

29
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,540
I'm not scared.

30
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,740
Okay, I believe your silly sister.

31
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,260
You're home alone today.

32
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,340
Don't be afraid.

33
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,420
I'm leaving now.

34
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,140
Why are you still here?

35
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,100
It's getting late outside.

36
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,140
I suddenly thought of

37
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,220
There are several places in this movie today.

38
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,620
Not so good.

39
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,580
You must have no idea.

40
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,940
I'll teach you.

41
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,220
Thank you so much, Miss Pei.

42
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,300
Please come in.

43
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,420
Don't mention it.

44
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,700
To show my gratitude,

45
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,380
Mr. Pei, you can sleep in the bed tonight.

46
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,580
What about me?

47
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,460
You can sleep on the couch.

48
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,820
Well

49
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,980
Just right

50
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,860
It's me.

51
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,140
And a few acting problems.

52
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,980
I want to ask you.

53
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,860
No animals were harmed during the filming.

54
