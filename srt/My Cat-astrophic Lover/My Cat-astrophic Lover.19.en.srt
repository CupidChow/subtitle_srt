[Episode 19]

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,220
I just came to bring you some breakfast.

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,860
If there's nothing else, I'll leave now.

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:15,860
to sit properly

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:16,540
Agent Xiao.

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,540
Have you figured out how to answer my question?

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,740
This time,

9
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,700
Don't lie.

10
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,260
Why did you go after the cat

11
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,940
Your cat became Pei Pei.

12
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,780
Why is Pei Pei so smart?

13
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:30,940
Why did you take her to escape?

14
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,340
Why is it that every time you buy something,

15
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,180
Pei Zhen likes them.

16
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,860
Why do you like to talk to Pei Pei so much?

17
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,460
When I kissed Pei Pei,

18
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,460
You would scream to stop it.

19
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,260
Why is it that every time Pei Pei looks at me,

20
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,700
The way Pei Zhen looks at me.

21
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,620
And these problems

22
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,260
I need answers.

23
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:48,620
Brother Si Chen.

24
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,740
Can you ask one by one?

25
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,220
You have too many problems.

26
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,220
We can talk later.

27
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:55,580
No need

28
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,180
I recalled that

29
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,020
I've listed all the problems.

30
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,740
Don't try to make up a lie.

31
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,900
You only have two minutes to organize the language.

32
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:03,620
then

33
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,540
From the first one,

34
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,580
this

35
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,700
Why are you two arguing in the early morning?

36
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,940
Let her sleep.

37
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,500
It's annoying.

38
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,020
I know.

39
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:17,820
original

40
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,020
You are Pei Zhen.

41
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,140
According to this reasoning,

42
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,540
The person who kissed me secretly last night

43
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,460
It's you.

44
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:30,820
therefore

45
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,940
You like me.

46
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,420
It's annoying.

47
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,700
It's so embarrassing.

48
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,500
It turns out that the person Fu Sichen likes

49
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:53,940
but

50
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,620
I like his things.

51
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,500
He found out so quickly.

52
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,540
It's so embarrassing.

53
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,860
I want to find a hole to enter.

54
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,180
Run away.

55
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,100
No, no.

56
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,020
If he runs away, he will catch him.

57
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,340
He's strange. No cat can't sleep.

58
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:19,780
What should we do?

59
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,060
The world will be destroyed.

60
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,860
very good

61
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,420
He finally went to bed.

62
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,980
Do you have anything to drink?

63
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:51,780
Commander Fu.

64
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,300
you

65
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,220
You pervert

66
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,500
What are you doing?

67
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,460
No animals were harmed during the filming.

68
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,460
