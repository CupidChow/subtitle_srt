What else do you want to do?

00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:35,900
Don't worry.

However

17
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,660
I'm still interested in the resources

18
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,660
More interested.

19
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,340
It's so sweet.

00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:50,380
Give me a kiss.

You said you liked me back then.

25
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,380
What's the situation now?

26
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,740
Now I like you.

27
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,860
You threw me off again.

28
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:23,300
Are you feeling accomplished?

29
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:25,820
You scum.

30
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,940
Say something.

31
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,180

00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,100
I want to...

37
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,540
When I went out today,

38
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,540
I forgot to feed it cat food.

39
00:01:53,466 --> 00:01:55,060
So it came out to chase me.

40
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:04,540
Pei Pei.

41
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,500
Jerry, Master Cat.

42
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,260
Shoveling shit officer is wrong.

43
00:02:15,266 --> 00:02:16,180
After I went back,

44
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,900
I'll give you cat sticks as compensation.

45
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,980
Pei Pei's world collapsed.

46
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,740
I had a telepathic connection with her.

47
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,940
I can understand her.

48
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:48,620
Pei Pei.

49
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,540
Are you all right?

50
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,980
Don't take it too hard.

51
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,100
Commander Fu.

52
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:57,900
Pei Pei.

53
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,020
Don't scare me.

54
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,180
Pei Pei.

55
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,020
Pei Pei.

56
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:07,980
Pei Pei.

57
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,700
Don't do anything stupid.

58
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,740
To do something stupid.

59
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,540
You think too much about Nian Nian.

60
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,980
I won't do it for others' mistakes.

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,820
To punish myself.

62
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,180
I just want to be human again.

63
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:16,980
And take care of them.

64
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,340
Wait

65
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,180
My door is closed.

66
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:19,980
You can't go there.

67
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,460
to close

68
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,620
Why did you close it?

69
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,100
I'm still lying inside.

70
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:26,460
Xiao Nian

71
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:28,620
Xiao Nian

72
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,820
You'd better tell me the truth.

73
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,020
No animals were harmed during the filming.
