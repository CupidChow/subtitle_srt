00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,660
What?

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,940
Do you really want me to eat cat food?

5
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,300
How can I eat cat food?

6
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,300
Pei Zhen.

7
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,540
You're a top female star.

8
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,380
You can't let yourself fall.

9
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:07,220
Or take one.

10
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,100
Just one.

11
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,020
It's better than starving to death.

12
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,820
I ate them all.

13
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,980
I ate all the cat food.

14
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,740
What did I do?

15
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,260
Why did I come here?

00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,900
(Two years ago)

17
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,460
Open the door

18
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,380
Fu Si Chen, open the door.

19
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,700
Open the door

20
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:57,780
You're here.

21
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,700
Mom and Dad asked me to bring these Spring Festival gifts to you.

22
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,740
And specifically told me

23
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,940
Don't work too hard. Go home often.

24
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,380
That's it.

25
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,140
Bye

to wait a moment

27
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,940
There's no such thing as a gift.

28
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,500
Take it in yourself.

29
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,900
I have something to do at home.

30
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,060
Let me think about it.

31
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,180
You didn't stay at home for long this time, right?

32
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,260
What kind of excuse?

33
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,380
Do you want me to report to your family?

34
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,740
Commander Fu.

35
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,380
I'll

36
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,420
Why are you closing the door?

37
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,660
After all, I'm also your brother.

38
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,780
Your parents told me

39
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,100
Let me take care of you.

40
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,140
You...

41
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,580
Don't go out during the Spring Festival.

42
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,180
I'm not a child.

43
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,580
But in my eyes,

44
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,900
You've always been

45
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,100
Look.

46
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,060
Your smile is so cute.

47
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,540
Is it because I'm too good?

48
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,260
And let you live in my shadow.

49
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,180
So he rejected me.

50
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,660
If you are shameless,

51
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,860
No animals were harmed during the filming.
