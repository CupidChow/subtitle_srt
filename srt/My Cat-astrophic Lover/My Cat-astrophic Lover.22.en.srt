00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,460
Miss Lin is so beautiful.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,260
So graceful.

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,580
The meeting is about to begin.

6
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,060
But I haven't seen Fu Sichen yet.

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:15,780
Don't worry.

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,020
He will definitely come.

9
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,980
He is the fish on our chopping board.

10
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,060
At the mercy of us.

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,820
Welcome to the media.

12
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,300
To my fan meeting.

Because this is gonna be the biggest story of the year.

17
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,780
It's really worth it.

18
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,900
Commander Fu.

19
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,860
The sun is coming out today.

20
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,380
Why is he here?

21
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,140
I knew you would come.

22
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,340
I'm bored.

23
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,700
What on earth is Fu Sichen doing?

24
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,060
Bad guy

25
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,740
Left me at home alone.

26
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:01,620
Pei Pei.

27
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:02,860
Come on.

28
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,860
Have some snacks.

29
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,420
Look at us. We are hungry and thin.

30
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,300
Didn't Fu Sichen tell you where he went?

31
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,340
What are you talking about?

32
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:11,300
I cannot understand

33
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,060
My phone is out of battery.

34
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,500
Pei Pei.

35
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,820
Let's just sit here.

36
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,420
Fu Sichen will be back soon.

37
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,700
He went to visit famous doctors for you.

38
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,060
I believe you can change back as soon as possible.

39
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:28,140
Really

40
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,860
If you're too bored here,

We

42
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,900
Let's watch TV for a while.

43
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,020
It's not pretty.

44
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,420
This is not pretty.

45
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:47,740
Change.

46
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,220
Wait

47
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:51,620
What was that?

48
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,740
The TV is so ugly now.

49
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,580
Change it back.

50
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,260
A blockbuster news triggered the media.

51
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,580
Lin Yousu and Fu Sichen are in love.

52
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,980
This could be the biggest story of the year.

53
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,060
I will continue to report for you.

54
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,740
What does that mean?

55
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,580
Pei Pei.

56
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,740
Pei Pei.

57
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:17,900
Pei Pei.

58
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:18,940
You're a cat now.

59
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,100
You can't defeat them.

60
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,260
Let go of me.

61
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,300
Fu Sichen is a pig's hoof.

62
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,620
What the hell is going on?

63
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,260
Pei Pei.

64
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,180
kitty

65
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,940
Is the most flexible creature in the world.

66
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,220
Dear media friends,

67
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,300
to be sorry

68
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,660
You didn't reveal my relationship with Miss Lin until now.

69
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,340
So are you really in love underground?

70
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,100
At this special time,

71
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,380
I really don't want to take public resources.

72
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,620
So you chose this time to reveal your relationship.

73
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,420
Are you prepping for the new variety show?

74
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,420
The main reason is that

75
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,380
I don't want our personal relationship

76
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,700
Bring too much trouble to the audience.

77
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,860
I hope you will bless us.

78
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,340
Thank you

79
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,260
So you broke up with Miss Pei Zhen?

80
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,620
Please pay attention to it.

81
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,380
The new work of Si Chen and I

82
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,860
We will have more works in the future.

83
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,740
Stay tuned.

84
