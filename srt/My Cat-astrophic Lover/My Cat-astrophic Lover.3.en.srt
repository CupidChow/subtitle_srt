[Episode 3]

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:07,820
Hello.

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,660
How is Pei Zhen?

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,220
Why is Jerry here?

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,420
Miss Lin, you're here.

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,780
Brother Si Chen, what a coincidence!

8
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,300
We meet again.

9
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:20,940
Miss Lin,

10
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,460
Is this just your cat?

11
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,380
Yes, Jerry.

12
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,220
I'm her cat.

13
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:28,940
Don't.

14
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,820
Pei Pei tried to save Jerry

15
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,900
Thank you for taking care of Jerry.

16
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,260
My driver was too careless.

17
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,900
That's why it's like this.

18
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:40,540
How about this?

19
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,740
I'm willing to pay for all the medical expenses.

20
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,060
Let's add a WeChat.

21
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,140
Miss Lin,

22
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,020
The Fu Yin Emperor

23
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,140
And never added anyone else's WeChat.

24
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,620
He may not be used to it.

25
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,900
Who said that?

26
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,860
You can add it.

27
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,740
The sun is rising in the west.

28
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:03,980
However

29
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,860
You have to give me this kitten.

30
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:09,260
can

31
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,860
After all, Pei Pei was injured for it.

32
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,380
I hope I can pass it.

33
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,220
To wake up Pei Zhen.

34
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,700
We finally solved a competitor.

35
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,100
You said you just wanted to scare her.

36
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,220
But now,

37
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,500
What should we do?

38
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,380
You're so useless.

39
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,380
Don't be afraid of me.

40
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:38,540
Correct!

41
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,380
The endorsements of the drama that Pei Zhen received

42
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,180
Get them all.

43
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,340
She's a vegetable now.

44
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,420
I can't do anything.

45
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,020
Also

46
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,860
Ask around.

47
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,700
What's Fu Sichen's announcement recently?

48
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,180
I'm going to do everything he did.

49
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,260
I don't believe it.

50
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,060
You can't fire him.

51
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,180
Well

52
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,860
Brother Si Chen.

53
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,860
We need to find a professional nurse for Pei Zhen.

54
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,340
Men and women.

55
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,460
man

56
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,380
Are you kidding me?

57
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,660
How could it be a man?

58
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,660
Or a woman.

59
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,540
I'll take care of her.

60
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,660
This is not good.

61
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,300
You're always so busy.

62
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,300
We were childhood friends.

63
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,980
Both parents are close.

64
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,980
It's a deal.

65
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,620
I'll think of a way.

66
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,420
Aren't you busy?

67
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,660
Get back to work.

68
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,540
In that case,

69
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,820
Please.

70
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,220
I'm leaving now.

71
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,740
You've made up your mind.

72
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,060
You haven't got my opinion yet.

73
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,940
You are my little cat now.

74
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,060
Where are you going?

75
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,860
No animals were harmed during the filming.

76
