00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,340
[Episode 20]

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,460
Is really unexpected.

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,260
You became a cat.

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,700
What is this?

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,140
The soul?

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,620
This is the first time in my life

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,620
The most bizarre thing.

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,220
It's not scientific at all.

10
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,780
Just like in the TV show.

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,300
(Unscientific)

12
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,260
Unscientific question.

13
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,260
Maybe we should solve it in an unscientific way.

14
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:33,740
Correct!

15
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,100
Sleeping Beauty

16
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,940
It might work.

17
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,540
I don't think so.

18
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,540
Try to stick out your tongue.

19
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,060
I can't.

20
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,820
Why is it so obscene?

21
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,100
Commander Fu.

22
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:11,700
you

23
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:12,740
You pervert

24
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,980
What are you doing?

25
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,300
I want to see if I can wake up your body.

26
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,180
How could it be?

27
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,020
Have you read too many online novels?

28
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:23,940
Also

29
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,380
Just kiss her.

30
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,780
Why are you sticking your tongue out?

31
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,260
You shameless bastard.

32
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,060
You indecently assaulted me in front of me.

33
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,140
You're a cat now.

34
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,020
I can't understand you.

35
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,060
Also

36
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,620
I'm ignoring you.

37
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,820
Abominable

38
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,460
No matter what, he can't.

39
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,260
But why not?

40
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,780
He kissed my body.

41
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,340
Then it's me.

42
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,380
Why should I be jealous of myself?

43
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,140
That makes sense.

44
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,700
Then I can't be angry.

45
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,620
Don't be angry.

46
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,820
I want you to wake up.

47
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,860
I apologize to you.

48
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,500
It's my imagination.

49
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,060
No way

50
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,660
I can't let him know it's my problem.

51
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,500
I have to be angry. I need him to coax me.

52
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,580
If he doesn't coax me, I will say that he is fierce.

53
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:39,780
you

54
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:40,700
what are you doing?

55
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,460
I want you to wake up.

56
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,420
Look at you.

57
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,700
Always be a cat.

58
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,580
There's nothing we can do.

59
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,580
Don't you think so?

60
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,780
I can't do anything.

61
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,780
What else do you want to do?

62
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,980
Why are you so innocent?

63
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,980
We are all adults.

64
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,580
What are you talking about?

65
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,540

(you)

67
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,340
It's dangerous outside. Don't go out.

68
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,420
Commander Fu.

69
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,820
No animals were harmed during the filming.
