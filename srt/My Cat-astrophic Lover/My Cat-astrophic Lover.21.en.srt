What do you want to do?

You're really Fu Ying Emperor.

20
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,820
I figured it out right away.

21
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,420
What do I want?

I'm fine.

39
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,460
There was a thief.

that

42
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,220
Then we should call the police.

Go to the hospital.

44
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,340
I might be busy recently.

45
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,700
