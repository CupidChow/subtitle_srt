What are you doing? Give it back.

5
00:00:20,966 --> 00:00:22,260
You're going to Shanggang Film Academy.

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,740
Do you care where I go?

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,740
And meddling in the affairs of others.

8
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,660
Then we have no destiny.

My art exam results

10
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,900
I barely got into the Capital Film Academy.

11
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,420
I remember the Capital Film Academy.

12
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,060
Seems to be someone's dream.

13
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,420
Am I helping others?

Commander Fu.

You came to Versailles for me, right?

16
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,100
We'll be peers from now on.

17
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,060
We might have a chance to cooperate.

18
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,940
If I become the leading man,

19
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,460
I will definitely give you a girlfriend.

20

00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,180
it's not important

26
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,580
The next announcement has been revised temporarily. Have a look.

27
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,100
Why are you changing so much?

28
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,820
It's not Lin Yousu.

29
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,180
I used to steal the female lead.

30
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,100
Everyone in the circle knows it.

31
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,420
This time, he has made investment.

32
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,860
And added the lens.

Brother Si Chen.

If you mind,

35
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,620
Go talk to your agent.

36
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,100
Ask him to adjust it.

37
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:49,940
it's not important

38
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,100
It's a public welfare variety show.

39
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,820
As long as I can help the animals.

40
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,100
I'm too lazy to bother her.

41
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,780
By the way, Xiao Nian,

42
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,660
Take care of it later.

43
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,900
Don't let Lin Yousu step into the lounge.

44
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:06,780
That's right.

45
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,820
And complete the task.

46
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,580
I'm going to work.

47
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,180
Lunch and cat sticks later.

48
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,620
Will be sent to you.

49
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,540
Stay here, okay?

50
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,620
No, I'm finally free.

51
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,020
I'll find a way to change back into a human.

52
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,980
Let's go. Bye.

53
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,820
How could you be kissed again?

54
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,340
It ticks me off

55
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,380
It ticks me off

56
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,540
A stupid thing that can't be raised.

57
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,820
You almost ruined my appearance.

58
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,540
How can I act if I have scars?

59
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,100
You should have left it under the wheels.

60
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,100
Calm down.

61
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,820
How can I calm down?

62
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,100
Come on. Look at this hot search.

63
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,260
I was scratched.

65
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,180
I didn't see any splash.

66
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,980
Now the whole Internet is watching my jokes.

67
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,100
How can I calm down?

68
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,340
Don't worry.

69
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,020
The program "Cute Pets Go Forward"

70
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,900
Aren't we also attending?

71
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,260
When the program is finished,

72
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,620
There must be a way.

73
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,180
To make this little cat disappear from the world.

74
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,820
Make it disappear.

75
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,260
It's not that simple.

76
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,340
No animals were harmed during the filming.
