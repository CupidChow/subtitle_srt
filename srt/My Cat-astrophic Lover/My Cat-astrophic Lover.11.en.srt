Once all the infrastructure is in place,

I met such a shameless man.

34

When Brother Si Chen went to Pei Zhen's company,

00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,860
To negotiate the cooperation of this variety show.

49
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,460
Our relationship is simple.

50
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,980
Please don't misunderstand.

51
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,060
What happened

52
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,140
Lin Yousu has posted and deleted

53
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,340
What does that mean?

54
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,220
Brother Si Chen.

55
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,340
Lin Yoo Su posted it and deleted it. Now it's all over the internet.

56
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,720
That you gave Lin Yoo Su to the publicist.

57
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,700
I'm telling you,

Our operation is perfect.

59
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,340
That's what you mean.

60
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,700
The Water Army we bought is really effective.

61
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,700
Now the internet is full of trouble.

62
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,580
Miss Lin is really resourceful.

63
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,700
of course

64
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,700
Don't worry.

65
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,060
Fu Sichen, let's wait and see.

66
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,540
No animals were harmed during the filming.

67
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,420
