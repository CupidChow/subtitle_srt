Pei Pei.

Xiao Nian

00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,660
What about Pei Pei?

9
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:25,460
Pei Pei.

10
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,460
Is Pei Pei gone?

Pei Pei.

13
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:30,660
Why is the bedroom door open?

14
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:32,980
I locked it.

15
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:36,780
that

16
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,180
She must have gone to look for her body.

17
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,300
Did you say something to Pei Pei?

18
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,060
Sorry, Brother Si Chen.

19
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,100
I really have no choice.

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,020
but

21
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,220
But Pei Pei promised me.

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,380
He said he would discuss the matter when you came back.

23
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:50,460
you

24
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:52,900
Wait for me.

25
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:22,860
Ah

26
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,580
Isn't this our cat Jerry?

27
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,060
Last time you scratched my face,

28
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,420
I haven't come to you.

29
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,180
What day is it today?

30
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,300
You brought him here.

31
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,820
It's so easy to come here.

32
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,260
My body is here.

33
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,660
I've wanted to kill you.

34
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,300
Can't be raised.

35
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:14,300
I have to do it myself.

36
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:32,700
you

37
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,940
You woke up.

38
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,700
I'm back.

39
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,820
Pei Zhen.

40
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,140
I wanted to let you live.

41
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,500
But it's good that

42
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,340
It's too late to wake up early.

43
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,140
You woke up at this time.

44
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,620
What a pity.

45
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,140
I should have killed you with my car.

46
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,380
Instead of turning you into a vegetable.

47
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,580
I blame myself for being too soft.

48
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,740
as matters stand

49
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,940
I won't let you stay.

50
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,300
Pei Zhen.

51
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,540
You have no one to blame but yourself.

52
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,700
I just woke up and I'm leaving forever?

53
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,220
Go to hell.

54
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,140
No animals were harmed during the filming.
