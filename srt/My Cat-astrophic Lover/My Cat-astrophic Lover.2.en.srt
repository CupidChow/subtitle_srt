And sent them here.

00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:11,940
Let me take care of you.

(Five minutes ago)

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,300
Look what you just did.

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,220
It's on the top search list.

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,820
Fu Sichen and Pei Zhen seem to be in love.

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,340
Why did you bother Lin Yusu?

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,340
She's known to be difficult to deal with.

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:29,740
You know,

12
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:30,420
Now, pass the weft and smell it.

13
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,660
To your acting career.

14
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,940
How much it will affect you?

15
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,020
I'm not that free.

16
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,820
They can say whatever they want.

17
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,300
Are you challenging

18
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,940
Are provoking and destroying themselves.

19
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,620
So what?

20
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:44,980
I also told Fu Sichen

21
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,020
One day,

22
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,820
I want him to bow to me.

23
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,260
What about

24
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,260
Am I super brave?

25
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,500
So brave.

26
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,300
Go down.

hey

28
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,660
Xiao Nian is too grumpy.

29
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,140
Take a taxi yourself.

00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,460
down

31
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,540
To scare her.

What a cute little cat.

From the danger of life.

34
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,940
But the head was badly hit.

35
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,700
If you're lucky,

36
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,060
You will wake up soon.

37
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,340
If it's unfortunate,

38
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,580
I'm afraid you'll be a vegetable forever.

39
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:43,660

person in a vegetative state

41
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,420
Pei Pei, it's my fault.

00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,700
Pei Pei.

43

I'll let you do whatever you want.

47

(Hold on)

48
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,260
What was that?

49
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,020
I must be brain-damaged.

50
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,460
I'm hallucinating.

51

(Fu Sichen)

52
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,980
What are you doing here?

53
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,180
I turned into a cat.

Little kittens.

55

Give me a hug.

58
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,300
Look at my cat Meow Fist.

00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,900
No one can touch me.

60
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,900
What a fierce little cat.

61
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,180
Xiao Nian, you are such a fool.

62
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,260
Take a punch from me.

63
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,580
Xiao Nian

64
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,900
You're still in the mood to make fun of cats.

65
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,420
Hello.

66
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,260
How is Pei Zhen?

67
