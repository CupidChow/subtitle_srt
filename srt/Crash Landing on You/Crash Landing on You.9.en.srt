1
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,970
ALL CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND BACKGROUND ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,605
Life

3
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,774
is full of surprises.

4
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:10,612
You can't be sure of anything in life.

5
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,877
Just tell him what I told you to say.

6
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:16,970
Hello?

7
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,225
-It's me.
-Where are you?

8
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,144
Why did you call? Just come home.

9
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,438
By the way, whose phone is this?

10
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,984
I'm leaving now.

11
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,027
To where?

12
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,948
Come on.

13
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:40,743
I told you already that I'll be leaving
with Gu Seung-jun.

14
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,620
You'll be leaving right now?

15
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:44,873
Yes.

16
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,083
It turned out that way.

17
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,419
I'm leaving sooner than expected.

18
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,046
Where are you right now? I'll be there.

19
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,591
No.

20
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,385
I've already left in a car.

21
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,179
I'm sorry.

22
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,682
I left without even saying goodbye to you.

23
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:08,479
But we've said goodbye many times,
you know.

24
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,940
So saying it one more time
might be pointless.

25
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,233
You're wrong.

26
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,735
I know we've said it

27
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,195
many times before, but we still need
to say our last goodbyes.

28
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,781
We do need to say it again.

29
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,825
So tell me where you are right now.

30
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:21,910
Don't hang up!

31
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:24,162
Listen to me.

32
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:27,290
Tell me what you see. I can find you.

33
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:38,676
Jeong Hyeok.

34
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,721
I love you.

35
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,940
Let's go!

36
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,750
The person you have reached
is not available.

37
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:22,553
GU SEUNG-JUN

38
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:32,730
The phone is either turned off or out
of the service area and cannot be reached.

39
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:57,588
Jeong Hyeok? You need to come home now.

40
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,466
-My gosh.
-What's going on?

41
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,718
What is happening?

42
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,344
There he is.

43
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,013
Jeong Hyeok.

44
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,890
The State Security Department
is searching your house now.

45
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,642
-Gosh.
-I think they're looking for Sam Suk.

46
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,442
Are we all thinking the same thing now?

47
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:22,071
He's fuming mad, but that only makes him
even more attractive.

48
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,115
-Exactly.
-Right?

49
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,388
You're here, Ri Jeong Hyeok.

50
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,725
The higher-ups ordered me to do this.

51
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:54,145
Where did the lady from Division 11 go?

52
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,105
We need to take her with us.

53
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,239
-What for?
-I know everything.

54
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,994
That bitch does not belong to Division 11.

55
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,246
She is just living proof

56
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,042
I can use to completely destroy you,
your father, and your entire family.

57
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:23,883
Making people spill the truth
is my specialty, so don't you worry.

58
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,178
Whether I beat her up to a pulp

59
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,765
or burn her skin with electrical torture,
she'll talk after three or four...

60
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:05,883
I told you

61
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,845
that a thing or a person
is bound to change all the time.

62
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:11,597
You little shit.

63
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,517
You're finished.

64
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,231
Take him.

65
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,864
-My gosh!
-They're taking him?

66
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,824
-Captain Ri, are you all right?
-My goodness.

67
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,451
-Oh, no.
-Make way!

68
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,494
-Why are they taking him?
-Jeong Hyeok!

69
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,205
-My gosh.
-What do we do?

70
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,040
Jeong Hyeok! What should we do?

71
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,334
-Gosh!
-My goodness.

72
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,295
Gosh, what the heck is happening?

73
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,963
Shouldn't we tell them?

74
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,467
Can we really let them take him?

75
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,759
-What do we do?
-What do we do?

76
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,595
Gosh, Jeong Hyeok!

77
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,738
I must pull myself together and focus.

78
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,616
Think, whatever it is.

79
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,036
Yes, I should think happy thoughts.

80
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,954
Something that makes me happy.

81
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,671
Jeong Hyeok boiling noodles.

82
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:32,512
Jeong Hyeok who didn't know the difference
between candles and scented candles.

83
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,935
But now he knows the difference.

84
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,082
Jeong Hyeok who covers me with a blanket

85
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,251
on his way
to get himself a glass of water.

86
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,462
I'll see you off.

87
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,965
-No need.
-All is well.

88
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,425
I'll be fine after taking medication
and going to bed.

89
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:13,386
I'm fine.

90
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,429
Jeong Hyeok who always lies

91
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,391
and says that he's fine
even though everything is going astray.

92
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,144
Then you'll be safe.
As long as you stay in my sight.

93
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,772
Tell me what you see. I can find you.

94
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,192
Does he think he's a superhero or what?

95
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:32,280
He always says that he can do anything
and find me no matter where I am.

96
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:36,033
Jeong Hyeok likes to talk bullshit
and bluff.

97
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,455
I miss you.

98
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,581
Where am I?

99
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,384
Hello? Is anybody there?

100
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,262
Is anyone outside? Hello?

101
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,523
Right.

102
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,859
They wouldn't have locked me up here

103
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,195
if they were going to let me out.

104
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:44,912
Some bastards

105
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,873
abducted me and locked me up here.

106
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,750
Why didn't they kill me?

107
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,795
What are they after?

108
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,720
Are they watching me right now?

109
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,399
Who are you?

110
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,908
RUN AWAY AND YOU DIE!
LET'S BUILD A STRONG SOCIALIST COUNTRY

111
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,332
As you probably know,

112
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,961
it's not easy for regular soldiers like us
to come here.

113
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,466
But my childhood friend
just so happens to be

114
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:42,928
working as a high-ranking officer
at this detention center.

115
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:46,348
I don't think he deserves
to take credit for it though.

116
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,475
I agree.

117
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,143
I mean, whose fault is it to begin with?

118
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,520
Dan's mother came by the other day.

119
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:56,775
Master Sergeant Pyo got drunk that day
and told her everything about Se-ri.

120
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:02,990
I mean, not everything about her.

121
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:06,452
I heard her mother is a rich businesswoman
who owns a department store in Pyongyang.

122
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:10,498
Maybe she hired some people to track
Se-ri down and did something to her.

123
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,667
Hey, no way.

124
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,212
I've seen it so many times
in those South Korean dramas.

125
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,423
When someone interferes
with their kid's wedding,

126
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:23,552
the rich in the South either splash water
on that person's face or give money.

127
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,432
But the rich here are tougher,

128
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,936
so maybe she abducted her
to teach her a lesson.

129
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:37,107
Captain Ri, that lady didn't seem like
she could do such a thing.

130
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,319
I'm warning you.

131
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,614
Don't do anything you're going to regret.

132
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,699
Comrades.

133
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,327
I need you to do something for me.

134
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,455
Only after getting locked up,

135
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,583
you called me and said
you wanted to see me

136
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,002
for the first time ever.

137
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,383
That woman is gone.

138
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,553
So?

139
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,180
You must know something about it.

140
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:11,475
Who did it?

141
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,352
Where was she taken to?

142
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,521
And is she

143
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,274
-okay?
-How ridiculous.

144
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,318
Your wedding is in a few days,

145
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,321
but you're worried about another woman.

146
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,782
You look as if you've lost everything.

147
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,619
This is actually good.

148
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:36,292
You should stay locked up here
until the day of our wedding

149
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,336
and just come out on that day.

150
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:41,630
I'll see you then.

151
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:43,674
Is it my father?

152
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,102
You told me
not to do anything I'll regret.

153
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,023
Whom did you ask for help
to make me regret my actions?

154
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,484
It can't be the State Security Department.

155
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,446
And there's no way your mother did it.

156
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,157
Did you

157
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,242
meet my father?

158
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,829
Did my father

159
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,584
-take her? That woman--
-That's right. She's dead.

160
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,170
You won't ever find her.

161
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,631
So you should just give up.

162
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,051
Go and tell my father.

163
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:31,096
If he hurts or harms her in any way,

164
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,016
he'll lose even the only son he has left
for good.

165
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,770
You'd better tell him.

166
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,414
IDEOLOGICAL DISCIPLINE

167
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,300
Should I have gone in with you?

168
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,177
How's Jeong Hyeok holding up?

169
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:14,098
Director Ri doesn't know
about this yet, right?

170
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,559
How did he end up in the detention center?

171
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,062
-He'll be furious when he finds out.
-Just leave him.

172
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,314
What?

173
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,192
Hey, your wedding
is just around the corner.

174
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,611
I have to keep him there

175
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,323
to marry him.

176
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,284
I'm not following at all.
Can you elaborate?

177
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,294
U Pil.

178
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,922
-Dad.
-Gosh.

179
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,175
What brings you here?

180
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:56,682
Yesterday, some men came
and took that pretty lady from the South.

181
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,936
And she dropped this.

182
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,244
U Pil.

183
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,538
Have you shown this to anyone else?

184
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,667
Don't tell anyone about this, okay?

185
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,835
Okay, Dad.

186
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,505
Will she be okay though?

187
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,892
They say you never know
what someone is really thinking.

188
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:25,062
We've known him for a long time.
I can't believe he fooled us all along.

189
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,481
I don't understand Captain Ri.

190
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,860
He's not the type
to brag about his family background.

191
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,071
-Exactly.
-Still.

192
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,533
This is huge news.
How could he keep it from us?

193
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,453
Captain Ri's father is the Director
of the General Political Bureau?

194
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,873
I still can't believe it.

195
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,376
Director Ri
won't sit still if he finds out

196
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,671
that his dear son is locked up
in the detention center.

197
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,381
Shouldn't we tell him?

198
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:56,760
Captain Ri told us not to tell anyone,

199
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,303
so keep your lips sealed.

200
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,721
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

201
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:00,639
Let's go.

202
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,117
Everyone probably heard it, right?

203
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,245
I think you were a little too quiet.

204
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,873
It'd look suspicious
if we were chatting about it loudly.

205
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:29,251
But will that be enough
for the word to spread?

206
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,919
Hey.

207
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:35,132
You don't need 100 bees
to get 100 flowers to bloom.

208
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:40,137
It will only take half a day
for it to reach everyone in this area.

209
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:42,973
But the problem is,

210
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:47,394
whether or not it's true.

211
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,438
There's something else I need you to do.

212
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,900
Spread rumors about my family background,

213
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,694
that my father is the Director

214
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,655
of the General Political Bureau.

215
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,748
I don't think he'll get me out of here
even if he finds out that I'm here.

216
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:12,002
I want to spread rumors to find a way
to get out, so I need your help.

217
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:16,465
I told you.

218
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,842
He must've hurt his head when he got shot.

219
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,385
Don't worry, Master Sergeant Pyo.

220
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,471
All of it is true.

221
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,432
I don't have time.

222
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:29,144
The rumors must reach the Senior Colonel
as quickly as possible.

223
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:33,523
His father is the Director
of the General Political Bureau?

224
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:38,070
What if it's complete bullshit
and we got fooled?

225
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:41,073
Shouldn't you know him better by now?
He'd never do that.

226
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:50,165
His father is the Director
of the General Political Bureau?

227
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,459
That's right. My husband

228
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:55,754
heard his colleagues talk about it.

229
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,590
I have to say, there was

230
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:00,968
something different about him.

231
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:05,013
I mean, his looks alone are revolutionary.

232
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,432
And the way he talks and walks.

233
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,686
I always thought he looked
too confident for a captain.

234
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,562
-Exactly.
-Yes, totally.

235
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,691
To be honest,
when I saw his broad shoulders,

236
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,151
I knew that he was special.

237
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,487
-His shoulders?
-Yes.

238
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:21,989
Think about it.

239
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:26,702
He can show off those broad shoulders
because someone's got his back.

240
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:31,331
If he'd ever been intimidated by anyone
since he was little,

241
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:35,210
he wouldn't have
such incredibly broad shoulders.

242
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:39,047
-She has a point.
-That's a good theory.

243
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,757
-Right?
-Good point.

244
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,759
DEMILITARIZED ZONE

245
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,636
A deserter from Stakeout Squad 31.

246
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,847
-A deserter from Stakeout Squad 31.
-It's an emergency!

247
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,599
-An emergency!
-A deserter from Stakeout Squad 31.

248
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,185
A deserter from Stakeout Squad 31.

249
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,479
What? Another deserter?

250
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,985
Tell everyone to be on standby.
Where is Lieutenant Commander Cho?

251
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:02,362
Pyongyang?

252
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,364
Why at this critical time?

253
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,615
"Spy education"?

254
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,659
Goodness. Fine.

255
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:13,040
-Could you prepare my dinner now?
-I heard about it.

256
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,124
About what?

257
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,002
Captain Ri Jeong Hyeok.

258
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,921
I heard he went to the detention center.

259
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,842
Young people these days have no respect.

260
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:26,219
I mean, he defied his superior.
What was he thinking?

261
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,805
That punk won't be seeing
any sunlight for a while.

262
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,141
Have you ever wondered

263
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,771
why Captain Ri was being disrespectful?

264
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,107
It's because he's got no morals,
of course.

265
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,735
He was the one who tipped off
the Trial Bureau,

266
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:44,196
which is why Cho Cheol Gang
and I were investigated.

267
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,490
He kept digging around
and it was one hell of a headache.

268
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:49,493
Why do you think he's got so much nerve

269
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:53,080
to poke around, dig around,
and nose around?

270
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,665
You keep beating around the bush.

271
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,709
Just tell me what your point is.

272
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,712
Have you

273
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:04,591
ever met the Director
of the General Political Bureau?

274
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:07,844
How can I meet such a high officer?

275
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,139
Why? Does anyone have the connection?

276
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,724
There was, indeed.

277
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,393
But someone just cut it off.

278
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,521
Who did that?
What kind of a psycho would do that?

279
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,191
-It was you!
-Gosh! What's wrong?

280
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,276
Ri Jeong Hyeok was born
with the connection

281
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,278
to the Director
of the General Political Bureau.

282
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,447
What? How does he have the connection?

283
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:31,368
Ri Jeong Hyeok is the son of the Director
of the General Political Bureau!

284
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,286
What?

285
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:37,791
I told you to give him
the Preferential Star.

286
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,960
But you just gave it to a random man.

287
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,169
What? He can't see sunlight?

288
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,839
Your life is never
going to see sunlight now.

289
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,966
What are you going to do now? Tell me!

290
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,217
Where are you going?

291
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,526
Who are you?

292
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:06,820
What are you doing?

293
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,335
Have some tea.

294
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,598
It's pine mushroom tea.

295
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,184
It smells good, and I appreciate it

296
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,145
but I won't drink it.

297
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:43,190
It's not like
I was invited here as a guest.

298
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,817
I won't just drink
whatever you tell me to drink.

299
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,152
I'm not that dumb.

300
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,029
Where do you think you are?

301
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:54,284
You're her father, right?

302
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,329
You don't have to be surprised.

303
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,458
You look just like Ms. Seo Dan.

304
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,754
Your mouth, nose,

305
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,172
and especially

306
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,925
your glaring eyes

307
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,093
look just like hers.

308
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,179
-Is that so?
-Yes.

309
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:18,558
I'm quicker and more sensitive
than others at this kind of thing.

310
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,019
I see.

311
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,314
To be honest,
when I was first dragged here,

312
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:28,360
I was so upset
and wondered who would do this,

313
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,697
but now I get it.

314
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:34,783
You get it?

315
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:39,120
You think I'm in the way of your daughter.

316
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:42,791
You think I'm coming between the two,

317
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,336
and I totally understand.

318
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,216
Okay. Then tell me.

319
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,761
What was your purpose
of approaching Ri Jeong Hyeok

320
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,179
and staying with him?

321
00:25:57,264 --> 00:26:00,767
"Purpose"? That's absolutely unfair.

322
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,560
I am

323
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:05,105
a pure victim
of a second of the military gap

324
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:08,024
created by a momentary error
of the defense system

325
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,694
of the South and North Korea

326
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:13,571
caused by a strong and unexpected storm.

327
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,117
-What?
-It was an accident.

328
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,037
Sir, please think about it.

329
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:24,249
I'm running a company in South Korea.

330
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:27,377
It's not just a tiny store
but an enormous fashion company.

331
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:32,007
This might sound like bragging,
but we have 14 branches abroad.

332
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,552
So for what purpose would I come here

333
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:38,346
to put myself in trouble?

334
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,556
I am just

335
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,810
an innocent citizen of Seoul
who has been worrying

336
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:46,688
about what I should do with all that money

337
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:51,484
and if I will ever get to use
all the money before I die.

338
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:57,198
And Ri Jeong Hyeok helped me
out of humanity.

339
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:01,411
So are you saying
Ri Jeong Hyeok caused all this?

340
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,663
What? No.

341
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,707
That's not what I meant.

342
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,251
He hasn't done anything wrong.

343
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,712
I'm telling you.
He didn't do anything wrong.

344
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:13,631
I want to make that clear at least.

345
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:14,883
He didn't do anything wrong?

346
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,635
He hid an unidentified person
from South Korea.

347
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,805
At first, he tried to report me.

348
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,141
But I threatened him.

349
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,894
"If you report me, I will tell them

350
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,355
you and your men did
a poor job at guarding."

351
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,982
So he had to make

352
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,110
an inevitable decision
for his subordinates.

353
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:38,198
So is that all about your relationship?

354
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,912
To be honest,

355
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:45,830
I liked Ri Jeong Hyeok

356
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,166
a lot.

357
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:53,004
It just happened. I'm so sorry.

358
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:56,591
He didn't like me back though.
It was one-sided. You don't need to worry.

359
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,719
He must be thinking
I'm back in my country now.

360
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,054
I'm sure he doesn't care at all.

361
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:03,932
So, sir,

362
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:06,643
please help me.

363
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:07,560
Me?

364
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,730
You hired some men to kidnap me.

365
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:15,485
Obviously, you have some power.
That's why I'm asking.

366
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,405
Please be generous

367
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,782
and help me go home in one piece.

368
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:25,036
Actually, you know,
Ri Jeong Hyeok is just a captain.

369
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,456
He doesn't have any power.

370
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:31,376
He doesn't have any power.

371
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:38,174
If you help me this time,

372
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:42,470
I promise to return your favor.

373
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:48,476
Sir!

374
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,520
Sir!

375
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,188
Sir!

376
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,440
Sir!

377
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:15,545
Are you kidding me?

378
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,631
I've been training myself
with intermittent fasting.

379
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:40,361
I won't swallow
a single grain of rice here.

380
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,113
I'm sorry.

381
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,199
You haven't eaten anything today.

382
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,745
If you think the food is poisoned,
I can try it for you.

383
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,582
Who are you?

384
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,001
Actually,

385
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:56,920
that doesn't matter.

386
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,922
Why did you bring me here?

387
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:00,715
I'm sorry,

388
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,052
but we can't help it either.

389
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,722
The food is safe. You can eat it.

390
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,557
Wait.

391
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,185
Could you tell me

392
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:14,437
if Ri Jeong Hyeok is...

393
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,737
doing all right?

394
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:28,493
I don't want him to be in trouble

395
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,161
or be punished because of me.

396
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,664
That's the last thing I want.

397
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,709
Do you like him so much?

398
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:41,381
Well...

399
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,176
That's not it.

400
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:57,105
It's unhealthy for a woman
to stay in a cold room like this.

401
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,710
You should sleep here tonight.

402
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,253
By the way,

403
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:23,715
who is the owner of this room?

404
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,676
I believe one's bookshelves

405
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:29,178
tell the person's personality,

406
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,973
character, and taste.

407
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,226
And these books

408
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,271
remind me of someone I know.

409
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:43,318
Dan, what was the room number?

410
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,911
You're not

411
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:54,954
Seo Dan's mother, are you?

412
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:01,419
Are you Jeong Hyeok's mother?

413
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,966
THE DAUGHTER OF QUEENS
AND THE CEO OF SE-RI'S CHOICE DIES

414
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,468
MYEONGSEONG DAILY NEWS

415
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,972
She's a daughter of a rich family
and was registered dead.

416
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,768
Why on earth did she come here
and meet my son?

417
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,728
You must not send her back.

418
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:22,398
If she goes back to South Korea,
it will create a big buzz.

419
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:26,569
It will cause something
you need to take responsibility for.

420
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,447
The Military Director seems
to be up to something too.

421
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,074
We don't have enough time.

422
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:32,951
Just give me an order

423
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:36,663
and I will take her out tonight
and take care of her quietly.

424
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,834
Not at such a late hour.

425
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:43,252
Excuse me, sir?

426
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:47,590
My wife keeps insisting that we should
let her get some sleep at least.

427
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:48,800
Oh, well.

428
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:54,013
Let's wait and see for now.

429
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:28,214
Goodness, Jeong Hyeok.

430
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,467
Were you a child actor?

431
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:36,305
You look so handsome among other kids.
That's just unfair.

432
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,857
Look at the handwriting.

433
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,818
So cute.

434
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:59,787
I WANT TO BE A WORLD-FAMOUS PIANIST

435
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,581
Did you want

436
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:05,168
to become a pianist?

437
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,222
But...

438
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,267
you ended up being a soldier.

439
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,320
Sir,

440
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:00,783
I can let you visit him,
but bailing is a whole different matter.

441
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,660
You're the head of the detention center.

442
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,954
Bailing shouldn't be a big deal for you.

443
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,914
He assaulted his superior,

444
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,666
who was Battalion Security Officer.

445
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,127
It was the worst kind of mutiny.

446
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:15,256
The State Security Department
is pretty upset about it.

447
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:20,011
You can't make it to the main position
if you're slow like that.

448
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,309
Captain Ri's father is...

449
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:33,900
My legs are still shaky.
I have no idea how I made it here.

450
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:38,029
As a matter of fact,
as the head of the detention center,

451
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:42,241
I did have fundamental doubts
about whether it was an assault case.

452
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,037
-Right?
-An assault is

453
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,457
supposed to be done with this.

454
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,376
It means to hit with a fist.

455
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,836
Doesn't it mean to hit and beat?

456
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,171
No.

457
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,507
It can be called an assault
only when someone is beaten by a fist.

458
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:00,551
And?

459
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:06,474
It sounded like Captain Ri hit him
with his hand open.

460
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,560
That's what I heard, I believe.

461
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:13,814
-Then it wasn't an assault.
-No, it wasn't.

462
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,861
Where's Ri Jeong Hyeok, the poor man
who is behind bars for no reason?

463
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,321
I shall bring him with me.

464
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:23,824
RUN AWAY AND YOU DIE!
LET'S BUILD A STRONG SOCIALIST COUNTRY

465
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,621
I'm sure you have learned
some lessons from this.

466
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,164
First,

467
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:33,709
all kinds of things can happen in life.

468
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:38,547
Second, whenever that happens,

469
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,219
come to me.

470
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:47,014
You should have called me first.

471
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,475
You should correct your mistake, okay?

472
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,019
Okay.

473
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:56,524
All right. You've been through a lot.
So take a good rest for the next days.

474
00:37:56,607 --> 00:38:00,194
My wife said she prepared a feast.

475
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,737
So come to my place.

476
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,739
I'd like to ask you for a favor.

477
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,199
Okay.

478
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:06,826
What is it?

479
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,412
Tell me.

480
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:14,583
I'll put the white radish salad here
because it's his favorite.

481
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:15,751
Come on.

482
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,378
Put it here.

483
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,422
-Senior Colonel, you're back.
-Hi.

484
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,174
Oh, my. Welcome.

485
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,348
Why are you alone? Where is Jeong Hyeok?

486
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,852
I don't know.
He said he had to hurry somewhere.

487
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:37,315
By the way, he asked me for a weird favor.

488
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,483
What favor?

489
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:01,547
Jeong Hyeok must have gotten
his cooking skills from you.

490
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,007
Did Jeong Hyeok

491
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,176
make noodles for you?

492
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:08,054
Yes, he made me great noodles

493
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,805
and nice coffee too.

494
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,646
He must have gotten
the kind heart from you.

495
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:25,321
Jeong Hyeok, what do you think?
If you think it's too rushed...

496
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:27,907
It's an old promise.

497
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:29,408
I must keep it.

498
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:35,831
Jeong Hyeok used to be a sweet boy,

499
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,959
but he changed at some point.

500
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:43,839
He has become cold
and wouldn't let anyone be with him.

501
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,093
But you just said he's kind.

502
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:50,262
I'm glad to hear that.

503
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,040
Where is she?

504
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,208
Who?

505
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,709
You know who I'm talking about.

506
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:23,421
I know you took that woman.

507
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:26,382
-Where is she?
-Where should I hide?

508
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:29,593
Don't worry and just tell him
you don't know anything.

509
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,012
I have...

510
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,058
troubled his life too much already.

511
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:39,603
I don't want to see him again.

512
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,689
I will cry if I see him.

513
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:43,899
Is there

514
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,236
a basement or something?

515
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:52,658
Is she

516
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:54,577
dead?

517
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,622
Did you kill her?

518
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,501
Tell me!

519
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:06,297
Do you not worry about your future?

520
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,423
I do.

521
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,383
That's why I'm doing this.

522
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,511
I don't want to constantly
look back on this day

523
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,763
and be regretful in the future.
That's why.

524
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,557
"I could've protected her
if I'd been faster.

525
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,101
I could have saved her
if I'd done a better job."

526
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,854
I don't want to be thinking like that.

527
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:26,942
You know how miserable it is
to live a life like that.

528
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:33,699
Mu Hyeok.

529
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:48,589
On my way back home,
I couldn't even breathe.

530
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,592
I was worried
I might have put her in trouble.

531
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,677
If something happens to her,

532
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,097
I'll be living in hell
until the day I die.

533
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:02,520
Breathe, Jeong Hyeok.

534
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,022
Why can't you breathe?

535
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:09,151
We can't let our son
live in a living hell.

536
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,788
Jeong Hyeok.

537
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,123
You talk well.

538
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:26,710
I have never seen you talk so much.

539
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:40,599
What happened to your face?

540
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:42,518
Did you get hurt again?

541
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:46,647
I'm okay.

542
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,108
You always say you're okay.

543
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,653
Who did this to you?

544
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,573
I'm sorry I'm late.

545
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,534
Don't say that.

546
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:00,828
I'm the one who is sorry.

547
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,163
It's because of me.

548
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:06,959
I'm always the trouble.

549
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:09,169
You're not trouble.

550
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,381
If only I hadn't come here...

551
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:14,758
Don't say that.

552
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:17,386
That's not true.

553
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:28,272
So...

554
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:32,610
Did yelling at my face
make you feel better?

555
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,034
You should apologize to your father.

556
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:43,495
You are the one who caused trouble.

557
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:46,206
You can't yell at your father like that.
That's just rude.

558
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,083
Are you siding with him now?

559
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,501
Are you proud of what you did?

560
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,133
No, that's not what I meant.

561
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,011
If you had told me
that you found out about her--

562
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:01,764
If I did, would you have let me see her?

563
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:06,060
You're hiding that woman
and risking our family's safety!

564
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,396
But it's all my fault.

565
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,023
She didn't do anything wrong.

566
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:15,361
But she said it's all her fault.

567
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,739
She said she threatened you,

568
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:21,408
so you couldn't report her
to the State Security Department.

569
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,993
What...

570
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:24,536
That's not true.

571
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,955
I didn't care about the threat.

572
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:29,625
It was my own decision not to report her.

573
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,504
Why?

574
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:35,464
I didn't want her to be hurt.

575
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,636
I couldn't trust
the State Security Department.

576
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:43,263
Who knows
what would have happened to her in there?

577
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,349
She could have been hurt, used,

578
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:48,394
or disappeared into thin air.

579
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,605
I wasn't sure
that was not going to happen.

580
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,775
That's why I couldn't send her there.

581
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:58,529
Jeong Hyeok.

582
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:03,325
Goodness.

583
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,577
This is unbelievable.

584
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:06,537
Get out of my sight.

585
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:07,913
Sure.

586
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:14,294
We were in the middle of a meal.
Come and join us.

587
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,594
Jeez.

588
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:37,776
Oh, this? I'm okay.

589
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,571
I got into a scuffle with guys
from the State Security Department.

590
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,533
Even now, I can't go back
to the guest lodge. I'm in hotel now.

591
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:45,868
I didn't ask.

592
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:49,621
What did you order?

593
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:52,583
I haven't eaten anything the whole day,
and I'm hungry.

594
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:08,474
What's up? You're scaring me.

595
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:14,688
Do you know when I first met Jeong Hyeok?

596
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:19,026
I don't, but I'm really not interested.

597
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,903
I mean it.
I didn't ask and I'm not interested.

598
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:23,113
It was when I was 17.

599
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:24,990
We were

600
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,577
going to the same school.

601
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,957
The right side isn't waxed well.

602
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,667
Rub harder.

603
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,085
-Rub harder.
-Rub harder.

604
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:39,087
Isn't that Jeong Hyeok?

605
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:40,172
Where?

606
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:42,633
-Where?
-You're in the middle of cleaning.

607
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,553
You must see this.

608
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:47,804
Hurry over.

609
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:52,809
You can't see Jeong Hyeok
play basketball every day.

610
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,686
Who is Jeong Hyeok?

611
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:55,771
Don't you know him?

612
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:58,148
He got three grand prizes
at the National Art Competition

613
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,901
and he's preparing
for the Tchaikovsky Competition now.

614
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:02,819
That's awesome.

615
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:03,946
He's so cool.

616
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,332
Since then,

617
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:19,169
I couldn't get him out of my head.

618
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:31,473
Although we never talked to each other,

619
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:34,726
I believed we knew each other.

620
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,358
So our families arranged our engagement,

621
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:48,115
and I excitedly flew to Switzerland,

622
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,075
where Jeong Hyeok was studying.

623
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:07,968
-Bye.
-Bye.

624
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:29,239
Jeong Hyeok.

625
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:37,789
Dan?

626
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:42,336
I heard about you from my father.

627
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,672
-We went to Geumseong Middle--
-It's nice to meet you.

628
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,597
Nice to meet you.

629
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:58,435
"Nice to meet you"?

630
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,105
It wasn't his first time seeing me.

631
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,317
Even a street dog would recognize someone

632
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,111
whom it passed by so many times.

633
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:12,824
I knew him first.

634
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:16,745
I knew him before she got to know him.

635
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:20,207
I met him first and I liked him first.
Does that not matter?

636
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,752
You're a fool.

637
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,130
Things like that don't matter at all.

638
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:34,638
Hey, enough. How many shots did you have?

639
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,182
Do I look drunk to you?

640
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:38,850
Yes.

641
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:42,145
How did you know that, you punk?

642
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:45,273
You're not that stupid after all.

643
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:49,361
Ms. Seo, I can accept
that you talk down to me,

644
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:51,279
-but you can't just cuss at me--
-Hey.

645
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,449
-Yes?
-I can do whatever I want.

646
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:02,124
I can't understand.

647
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:03,291
What do you mean?

648
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:06,002
Why doesn't Jeong Hyeok like
an attractive woman like you?

649
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,173
-What?
-Don't you ever cuss with that mouth.

650
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,551
That's just my type.

651
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:14,094
You make my heart flutter.

652
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:15,470
Now, enough.

653
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:18,265
You have

654
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:21,935
a good eye, don't you?

655
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:26,064
You're not bad.

656
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:28,817
Right? I'm not bad.

657
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,363
What's the point though?

658
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,241
You were dumped by that woman.

659
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,745
If you hadn't gotten dumped,

660
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:41,204
things wouldn't have gone this bad.

661
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,582
What are you saying? I wasn't dumped.

662
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:44,958
You were the one...

663
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:46,418
What?

664
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,384
Who are you?

665
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,428
-Please excuse me.
-Who are you?

666
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:58,805
Hey.

667
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:00,640
You can sleep over.

668
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:02,225
Are you out of your mind?

669
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,602
Shut your mouth.

670
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:05,103
The whole neighborhood is listening.

671
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:07,105
Goodness!

672
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:19,910
I'm sure you just saw something.

673
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:23,663
Yes, I did see something.

674
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:27,751
I just don't remember what I saw.

675
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:33,089
You probably won't want to remember it.

676
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:37,052
By the way, I thought her fiancé

677
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:38,929
was a Captain at the frontline...

678
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,932
I can't remember anything.

679
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:49,397
Sleep over.

680
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:52,067
Goodness gracious.

681
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:53,527
Wait.

682
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,195
Oh, my.

683
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,739
Oh, no.

684
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,533
Oh, no.

685
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:00,700
Oh, no.

686
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,078
Where did

687
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:04,955
the son of a bitch go?

688
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:16,550
I need to exercise more.

689
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:18,218
What?

690
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:24,850
Yes, it's me.

691
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,186
What?

692
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:37,237
What?

693
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:43,201
Oh, it's you.

694
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:46,121
Who were you expecting?

695
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:48,123
I wasn't expecting anyone.

696
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:52,544
Since I'm in someone else's room
and in someone else's house,

697
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:55,005
I feel a bit anxious

698
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,465
and uncomfortable.
So I couldn't sleep well.

699
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:59,175
You feel anxious and uncomfortable,

700
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,261
so you played the piano
the whole night last night?

701
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:03,722
Did your mother tell you?

702
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:06,433
Well...

703
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:10,729
I had a lot going on in my mind.

704
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:16,401
When I feel depressed,
I try to calm myself down with art.

705
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:17,360
That's my habit.

706
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:29,080
By the way, did you want
to become a pianist?

707
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:37,005
I happened to learn
about the dream you had as a little boy.

708
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:40,884
It's all in the past.

709
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:44,804
Then can I ask you one thing?

710
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:48,350
This is what I played last night.

711
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:50,727
Do you know what this song is?

712
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:06,868
I asked everyone
who has quite some knowledge of music,

713
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:08,662
but no one knew it.

714
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:23,593
How do you know this song?

715
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:27,222
I heard someone playing it
when I was traveling in Switzerland.

716
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:30,725
I loved the song, so I memorized it.

717
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,812
But I couldn't find whose song it was.

718
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:36,147
It was

719
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:40,235
a snowy place by a beautiful lake.

720
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,071
What was it called?

721
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,073
Iseltwald.

722
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,576
Yes, that's the name of the place.

723
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:52,122
How do you know that?

724
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:13,184
This is the song.

725
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,520
So you know it.

726
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:18,982
Who wrote this song?
What's the title of it?

727
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:22,819
It was late afternoon.

728
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,196
And the place was all misty.

729
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:29,868
I was leaving Switzerland
after hearing about my brother's death.

730
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:33,747
What do you mean?

731
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,291
I wrote the song for my brother,

732
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:41,296
and I played it by the lake
for the first and the last time.

733
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,629
Are you saying

734
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,049
you are the person

735
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:53,178
who was playing the song that day?

736
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:58,892
How is this...

737
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:03,938
I can't believe this.

738
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:06,483
That day,

739
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,236
I was really lonely.

740
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,114
I truly

741
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:17,994
wished to die then.

742
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:22,165
I wanted to go to a beautiful place

743
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:25,126
and quietly disappear

744
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:27,587
so I didn't trouble anybody.

745
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,632
That's why I went there.

746
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:36,554
But you were...

747
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,476
there.

748
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:45,939
Even when

749
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:50,485
you didn't know it,

750
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:53,905
you saved my life.

751
00:58:57,825 --> 00:58:58,910
Listen to me carefully.

752
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:01,996
Tomorrow,

753
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:04,791
you will go back home.

754
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:40,577
There was a suspicious car

755
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:43,413
using a temporary license plate

756
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:46,791
in the military village at that time,
so we tracked the car.

757
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:49,752
And the car went toward Seojaegol
and then disappeared.

758
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:52,338
That's where Director
of the General Political Bureau lives.

759
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:57,302
So let's say that woman went there
by that car.

760
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,637
Even so, we don't know
if she's still there.

761
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:01,681
They might have killed her already.

762
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:05,059
The security officer working in Seojaegol

763
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:07,979
happens to be my college friend,
so I did some research.

764
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:12,317
I heard there were cars coming in,
but no cars have gone out yet.

765
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:17,488
Sir.

766
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:22,243
If you go there now,
you can catch something huge.

767
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:34,547
Present arms.

768
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:39,260
The car behind this is with me.
Let it pass too.

769
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:40,887
Yes, sir!

770
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:00,698
Hello, sir.

771
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:03,660
I have something urgent
to discuss with you,

772
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:05,620
and I'm in front of your house now.

773
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:08,122
Do you have a moment?

774
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:13,002
I'm sorry I came so suddenly, sir.

775
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:15,046
I'm sure

776
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:17,256
you have a good reason.

777
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:22,136
We have met before, right?

778
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:24,222
Yes, sir.

779
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:27,183
We briefly met at Ri Jeong Hyeok's ward.

780
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:29,435
Right, we did.

781
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,105
How did the two of you come together?

782
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:34,023
He tipped me off

783
01:01:34,982 --> 01:01:38,569
about something strange.

784
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:41,781
"Tipped off"?

785
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:45,993
He said a person wanted
by the State Security Department

786
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:47,745
is hiding here.

787
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:51,249
I'm not sure
whether I should believe him or not.

788
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:52,959
Are you saying

789
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:56,212
you want to search my house or something?

790
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:58,005
No way.

791
01:01:58,089 --> 01:01:59,507
I wouldn't dare.

792
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:02,593
But if such a person is hiding here,

793
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:05,263
that person might harm you.

794
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,515
That would be terrible.

795
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:11,686
Thanks for worrying about me.

796
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:16,607
URGENT INVESTIGATION REQUEST

797
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:20,778
This is an urgent investigation request
from the State Security Department.

798
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:24,449
I'm afraid we will have to search
your house for a moment, sir.

799
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:26,868
This is just for the sake of formality.

800
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:28,911
Carry it out with utmost respect.

801
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:31,247
-Search.
-Yes, sir!

802
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:52,977
Unbelievable.

803
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:55,521
An emergency switch?

804
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:57,273
An emergency switch, for goodness' sake.

805
01:02:57,899 --> 01:03:00,735
I thought that the fact
Captain Ri is the son of

806
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:03,946
Director of the General Political Bureau
might somehow benefit us too,

807
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:05,823
as we're his subordinates.

808
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:07,742
Benefit, my foot. This is just shocking.

809
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:09,327
We were

810
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:11,579
supposed to be on duty next spring.

811
01:03:11,662 --> 01:03:12,622
Hey.

812
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:16,751
We all got fooled by Captain Ri's lies.

813
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:19,629
Think about it.

814
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:23,382
If he was actually the son of the Director
of the General Political Bureau,

815
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:26,886
why would he get shot on the street
and put behind bars?

816
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:30,431
He probably told us lies
based on his personal hope

817
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:34,811
that in his afterlife,
he would like to be born as a son

818
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:38,272
of the Director
of the General Political Bureau,

819
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:40,566
and we all got fooled by it.

820
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:43,528
Why aren't you saying anything?

821
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:50,493
Is there something
you heard from Captain Ri?

822
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:56,791
So what favor
did Jeong Hyeok ask of the Senior Colonel?

823
01:03:57,375 --> 01:04:00,169
Jeong Hyeok said to my husband...

824
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,547
I would like to ask you for a favor.

825
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:04,757
Okay.

826
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:06,384
What is it?

827
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:08,761
Tell me.

828
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:12,890
I would like you to include my company
in the emergency switch.

829
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:16,102
But it's cold winter now.

830
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:19,021
He asked him to deploy them
at the frontline?

831
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:20,398
Frontline?

832
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:24,193
Has he lost his mind
after his time in the detention center?

833
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:26,028
Why would he ask that?

834
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:41,627
Captain Ri will go
to the frontline with Se-ri.

835
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:43,963
That's why he asked
for the emergency switch.

836
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:46,716
What? What do you mean?
Why do they go there?

837
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,885
She's going back to where she came from.

838
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:50,720
But that doesn't make any...

839
01:04:50,803 --> 01:04:53,431
If he can bring her back in there somehow,

840
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:56,100
it isn't complete nonsense.

841
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:58,227
I guess you're right.

842
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:01,981
No others know that area better than us.

843
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:04,275
I mean, we guard the guard post too.

844
01:05:04,358 --> 01:05:06,611
We search the area,

845
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:09,280
and Captain Ri is the officer in charge.

846
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:10,573
That area

847
01:05:10,656 --> 01:05:12,491
is our area.

848
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:28,883
BORDER

849
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:34,764
DMZ NORTH ENTRANCE 1

850
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:08,839
I am glad that you are looking out for me,

851
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:10,925
but this should be enough.

852
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:12,843
The sun will set soon.

853
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:14,428
Of course.

854
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:18,182
It seems like I was given a false report.

855
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:22,645
You punk.

856
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:24,689
You scum!

857
01:06:25,022 --> 01:06:27,984
Do you know where we are right now?
What are you playing at?

858
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:30,194
That's enough.

859
01:06:30,903 --> 01:06:33,072
Didn't Jeong Hyeok visit you?

860
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:35,199
Didn't he hide that woman?

861
01:06:35,282 --> 01:06:36,450
Hey!

862
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:40,705
It seems like you haven't heard the news.

863
01:06:41,288 --> 01:06:43,082
There has been an emergency company switch

864
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:45,084
due to a deserter at the frontline.

865
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:49,672
My son should be at the frontline
right now as the captain of the company.

866
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:51,382
I had no idea.

867
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:54,885
-I apologize for our discourtesy, sir.
-That's the place.

868
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:57,013
He went to the frontline

869
01:06:57,888 --> 01:07:01,017
-to send that woman to the south.
-Shut your mouth.

870
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:02,309
I know I am right.

871
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:05,646
There is a chance they entered
the demilitarized zone.

872
01:07:07,648 --> 01:07:09,108
I apologize, sir.

873
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:11,360
I will take care of him.

874
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:13,571
Drag him away.

875
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:16,198
Sir.

876
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:01,619
I didn't know there would be a village
in the demilitarized zone.

877
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:04,914
People lived here before the war.

878
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:09,543
This house is in the best shape.

879
01:08:10,711 --> 01:08:12,254
Come and sit down.

880
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:21,972
All right.

881
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:26,936
This isn't alcohol, but medicine.

882
01:08:28,145 --> 01:08:34,401
It must have been made before 1953--

883
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:35,820
Master Sergeant Pyo.

884
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:38,155
Yes, sir.

885
01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:47,832
Why is there a bowl on top of that crock?

886
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,793
It's a bowl for fresh water.

887
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,838
You mean the kind
that was used for prayer?

888
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:55,256
Yes.

889
01:08:56,715 --> 01:09:00,136
I think the person who lived here
had a son who went off to war.

890
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:04,932
There are his photos in the room.

891
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:09,645
We never touch one of those bowls.

892
01:09:10,604 --> 01:09:11,772
All of us have

893
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:14,650
a mother.

894
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:23,325
Your mother will be happy
once you go back.

895
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:24,869
She must have waited for you.

896
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:30,207
I don't know.

897
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:34,753
Oh, you can see it from here.

898
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:37,131
See what?

899
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:40,676
Do you see that tiny mountain?

900
01:09:41,635 --> 01:09:43,345
-Yes.
-It's Mount Bukhan.

901
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:44,597
It's in Seoul, right?

902
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:46,223
Really?

903
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:48,767
Is it so close?

904
01:09:49,393 --> 01:09:51,270
Even though it's so close,

905
01:09:52,396 --> 01:09:53,355
we won't

906
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:55,441
see each other again, right?

907
01:09:59,403 --> 01:10:00,279
Still,

908
01:10:00,821 --> 01:10:02,907
you will see your mother.

909
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:04,909
I am jealous.

910
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:10,164
I am not that close with my mom.

911
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:15,419
You will be able to see your mom
after being discharged.

912
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:17,963
Are you making fun of him?

913
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:20,883
He has nine years and seven months to go
before discharge.

914
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:22,009
What?

915
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:23,844
Nine years and seven months?

916
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:27,264
That's a long time.

917
01:10:28,682 --> 01:10:29,850
Eun Dong,

918
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:31,685
you must miss your mom a lot.

919
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:33,646
Yes.

920
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:38,067
I miss her. I am worried about her.

921
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:42,071
My hometown is colder than it is here.

922
01:10:42,696 --> 01:10:44,448
I wonder if there is enough firewood.

923
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:46,992
I wonder if my siblings are eating well.

924
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:49,078
My youngest sibling

925
01:10:49,828 --> 01:10:51,080
is weak,

926
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:53,707
so he gets sick often.

927
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:58,170
I am sure all of them are doing well.

928
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:03,467
Everyone, don't get hurt.

929
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:06,220
Make sure you eat well.

930
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:07,638
Stay healthy

931
01:11:11,016 --> 01:11:12,559
and live well, okay?

932
01:11:15,312 --> 01:11:16,397
You never know.

933
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:19,525
The two countries might suddenly reunify.

934
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:24,363
Stop talking nonsense.
Live well when you go home.

935
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:27,116
If you come back again, I will...

936
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:29,618
I will bury you

937
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:32,454
at a mountain

938
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:34,206
or a river.

939
01:11:36,917 --> 01:11:38,002
Suit yourself.

940
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:42,006
Bury me at a mountain or a river.

941
01:11:45,592 --> 01:11:46,510
The sun

942
01:11:47,177 --> 01:11:49,179
should set already.

943
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:54,310
That noisy woman can leave
only when it's dark.

944
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:11,702
Mother, we need to call a locksmith.
There is no master key either.

945
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:20,794
What brings you here?

946
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:22,379
Open the door.

947
01:12:31,555 --> 01:12:32,806
The passcode is my birthday.

948
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:36,518
The day I almost died.

949
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:48,238
Mother, how did you know the passcode?

950
01:12:48,989 --> 01:12:51,492
She is incredible.
How does she know everything?

951
01:12:51,575 --> 01:12:53,118
Maybe she can enter my house too.

952
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:54,787
Aren't you worried?

953
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:04,129
My goodness.

954
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:08,092
I wonder who had taken it
from the auction in Hong Kong.

955
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:09,843
It was here.

956
01:13:27,444 --> 01:13:28,570
I prepared coffee.

957
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:31,824
Thank you.

958
01:13:38,622 --> 01:13:39,706
By the way,

959
01:13:40,707 --> 01:13:42,042
what brings you here?

960
01:13:44,461 --> 01:13:45,671
So you will list your company.

961
01:13:47,548 --> 01:13:50,843
You must know that
your brothers aren't doing so well.

962
01:13:52,386 --> 01:13:53,303
Must you

963
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:54,805
do that?

964
01:13:56,473 --> 01:13:59,810
My brothers and my dad have nothing to do
with my company.

965
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:03,021
I founded it and raised it.
Now, I will list it.

966
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:04,189
Mom.

967
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:09,653
It wasn't easy to get this far by myself.
It was really hard.

968
01:14:12,197 --> 01:14:13,532
No one asked you to do that.

969
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:20,330
I know exactly what you are playing at.

970
01:14:21,331 --> 01:14:23,125
You want your father to see it

971
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:26,378
and realize that
you are better than your brothers.

972
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:29,214
You want to get chosen.
You want to take everything!

973
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:32,509
-Mom.
-"Mom"?

974
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:35,512
If you let go of your greed,

975
01:14:35,929 --> 01:14:38,474
we can have an easy relationship

976
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:40,225
like a real mother and a daughter.

977
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:41,560
It isn't greed.

978
01:14:42,936 --> 01:14:44,021
It's my dream.

979
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:46,064
Do you think

980
01:14:46,523 --> 01:14:47,900
you deserve that luxury?

981
01:14:49,693 --> 01:14:50,819
Because of you,

982
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:53,947
my life is hell.

983
01:15:03,207 --> 01:15:04,124
My goodness.

984
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:08,295
Mother, do you see this engraving?

985
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:12,466
Designer Jean Merritt passed away
right after she signed an autograph.

986
01:15:13,133 --> 01:15:16,386
This is the bag, Mother. My goodness.

987
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:17,596
Put it down.

988
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:19,973
-Okay.
-Come on out.

989
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:22,351
-Right now?
-Yes.

990
01:15:29,983 --> 01:15:31,193
What are you doing?

991
01:15:33,403 --> 01:15:37,366
We need to merge or take over
Se-ri's Choice eventually.

992
01:15:37,449 --> 01:15:38,867
These documents might help.

993
01:15:41,161 --> 01:15:43,956
EXCELLENT COMPANY AWARD
WOMAN CEO OF THE YEAR

994
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:58,095
Mother, isn't it you?

995
01:15:58,679 --> 01:15:59,763
I think it is.

996
01:16:31,336 --> 01:16:32,462
Take care.

997
01:16:34,631 --> 01:16:37,509
Go back to your life
as if nothing had happened.

998
01:16:39,845 --> 01:16:42,014
You are in no position to worry about me.

999
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:45,267
Don't worry about me. I will be okay.

1000
01:16:45,809 --> 01:16:49,771
I have so much work waiting for me.
I will get used to my old life in no time.

1001
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:54,818
As always,
I will earn and spend money well,

1002
01:16:55,402 --> 01:16:58,697
work diligently, and date men.

1003
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:03,952
"Date men"?

1004
01:17:05,996 --> 01:17:07,956
Should I not do that?

1005
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:10,459
Well,

1006
01:17:11,668 --> 01:17:12,753
it's up to you.

1007
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:15,714
Didn't you say we should have

1008
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,091
a post-breakup condolence period?

1009
01:17:20,427 --> 01:17:22,387
I believe it was six months.

1010
01:17:24,973 --> 01:17:27,476
I simply meant you should do it.

1011
01:17:28,602 --> 01:17:31,438
You told me to go back to my life.

1012
01:17:32,022 --> 01:17:34,066
I didn't tell you to go back to men.

1013
01:17:34,941 --> 01:17:37,986
You told me to do so
as if nothing had happened.

1014
01:17:38,945 --> 01:17:41,114
I didn't tell you to cozy up to men.

1015
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:46,870
Is a period of six months

1016
01:17:47,371 --> 01:17:48,205
enough?

1017
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:53,043
Sure.

1018
01:17:55,629 --> 01:17:56,672
Okay.

1019
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:58,924
For six months,

1020
01:18:00,592 --> 01:18:02,469
I will have a condolence period.

1021
01:18:05,764 --> 01:18:07,140
It was fate.

1022
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:09,476
Think about it.

1023
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:12,854
It's incredible
that we met by chance in Switzerland

1024
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:16,358
and then in North Korea.

1025
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:20,904
What is it?

1026
01:18:28,161 --> 01:18:29,705
You can date men

1027
01:18:31,623 --> 01:18:35,043
and hang out with other people
as if nothing had happened.

1028
01:18:37,629 --> 01:18:38,839
But

1029
01:18:40,632 --> 01:18:41,967
don't be lonely again.

1030
01:18:44,094 --> 01:18:48,515
Don't ever think about disappearing
at a scenic place.

1031
01:18:52,102 --> 01:18:53,228
You have me.

1032
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:56,231
You won't be by my side.

1033
01:18:58,567 --> 01:18:59,901
I won't be by your side,

1034
01:19:01,945 --> 01:19:04,114
but I will always hope

1035
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:07,159
that you won't be lonely.

1036
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:13,248
Be happy

1037
01:19:14,332 --> 01:19:15,417
until the end of your life.

1038
01:19:18,712 --> 01:19:20,130
I would be grateful if you do that.

1039
01:19:25,969 --> 01:19:27,179
How do you

1040
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:29,514
reach the border from here?

1041
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:35,687
If you go that way,
you reach Yeokgok Stream.

1042
01:19:40,525 --> 01:19:42,319
There is a small boat.

1043
01:19:43,653 --> 01:19:48,366
People hid it to catch fish with grenades
when the water level rises.

1044
01:20:18,605 --> 01:20:20,065
Then comes a mine-free path.

1045
01:20:20,899 --> 01:20:22,901
It's marked

1046
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:26,071
with square granite rocks
that are about 40cm tall.

1047
01:20:28,031 --> 01:20:32,619
There are no mines within the 10m radius.

1048
01:20:36,122 --> 01:20:40,794
If you walk down that path,
you will reach the Southern Limit Line.

1049
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:45,507
-It's not far from here.
-That's right.

1050
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:48,969
A round trip should take
about an hour or two...

1051
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:56,601
The hour is...

1052
01:20:57,394 --> 01:20:58,895
Dawn will break soon.

1053
01:20:58,979 --> 01:21:00,438
Why isn't he back yet?

1054
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:02,691
Maybe he got lost.

1055
01:21:03,316 --> 01:21:04,860
No way.

1056
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:16,329
What is it?

1057
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:20,208
This is a wrong path.

1058
01:21:21,084 --> 01:21:22,085
Again?

1059
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:24,921
We keep finding the wrong path.

1060
01:21:30,093 --> 01:21:31,887
I think I saw that place before.

1061
01:21:36,641 --> 01:21:39,394
The paths look alike, so...

1062
01:21:39,477 --> 01:21:40,687
Ri Jeong Hyeok.

1063
01:21:41,813 --> 01:21:42,772
Be honest with me.

1064
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:46,318
-What?
-You have no sense of direction, right?

1065
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:50,780
Among us, Captain Ri is the best
at finding the right direction

1066
01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:52,616
even in the dark.

1067
01:21:52,699 --> 01:21:53,533
Yes.

1068
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:57,704
I am bad at finding the right direction

1069
01:21:59,789 --> 01:22:01,207
in the dark.

1070
01:22:03,793 --> 01:22:04,836
I am sorry.

1071
01:22:07,839 --> 01:22:12,469
The fact he hasn't come back yet means

1072
01:22:13,553 --> 01:22:16,222
he has either gotten into an accident...

1073
01:22:16,306 --> 01:22:17,474
-What?
-What?

1074
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:19,893
Or he wants to spend more time

1075
01:22:20,644 --> 01:22:22,020
with her.

1076
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:24,356
-Right.
-I see.

1077
01:22:46,753 --> 01:22:47,837
We are here.

1078
01:22:53,385 --> 01:22:55,845
We are finally here.

1079
01:22:59,057 --> 01:23:00,684
Do you see that tree over there?

1080
01:23:06,231 --> 01:23:08,191
Walk toward that tree.

1081
01:23:08,566 --> 01:23:11,861
That's the entrance
of the South Korean search team.

1082
01:23:14,322 --> 01:23:16,741
The search team will do a round
in the morning,

1083
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:18,159
so ask them for help.

1084
01:23:21,413 --> 01:23:22,414
By any chance,

1085
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:27,335
can you walk me there?

1086
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,465
I can't take a single step

1087
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:34,217
over this line.

1088
01:23:42,559 --> 01:23:45,645
Don't forget to keep your eyes
on the rocks.

1089
01:23:53,236 --> 01:23:54,404
Jeong Hyeok,

1090
01:23:55,488 --> 01:23:56,865
don't forget about me.

1091
01:23:58,783 --> 01:23:59,617
I won't.

1092
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:03,747
How would I forget about a woman
who fell from the sky?

1093
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:07,125
I didn't fall.

1094
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:08,168
I descended.

1095
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:11,504
Sure.

1096
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:20,930
I will get going now.

1097
01:25:17,987 --> 01:25:19,197
A single step

1098
01:25:21,699 --> 01:25:22,742
should be okay.

1099
01:26:33,771 --> 01:26:36,065
I can't believe him.

1100
01:26:36,816 --> 01:26:41,321
All the books are dark and difficult.

1101
01:27:32,372 --> 01:27:34,916
I LOVE YOU

1102
01:27:37,418 --> 01:27:40,296
RI JEONG HYEOK

1103
01:27:42,924 --> 01:27:47,804
I LOVE YOU RI JEONG HYEOK

1104
01:27:59,607 --> 01:28:01,609
