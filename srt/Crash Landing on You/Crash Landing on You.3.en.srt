1
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,971
ALL CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND BACKGROUND ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:57,849
Identify yourself.

3
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,852
I'm asking you to identify yourself!

4
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:03,730
Are you mute?

5
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:07,818
Why were you hiding
in Captain Ri's kimchi cellar?

6
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:09,319
Forget it.

7
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,781
Even the mutes can talk once they go
to the State Security Department.

8
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,869
-My gosh.
-What's that sound?

9
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:19,496
Gosh.

10
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,374
-Move.
-What is it?

11
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,379
-What's the car number?
-What is that?

12
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,839
Who's driving it?

13
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,785
What are you doing to my fiancée?

14
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,455
-What? Fiancée?
-Did I hear it wrong?

15
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,707
What did you just say?

16
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,835
I would appreciate it if you put away
the gun you're pointing

17
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:07,794
at my fiancée.

18
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:15,927
I didn't know you were engaged.

19
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,822
Sorry about that.

20
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,869
If you're his fiancée...

21
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:42,788
Are you from Pyongyang?

22
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,127
We must follow our protocol,
so please cooperate.

23
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,171
We'll have to see

24
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,424
your Pyongyang resident card
and frontline entry pass.

25
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,273
Nothing will happen, right?

26
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,526
If Captain Ri arrived without any issues,

27
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,278
he'll sort things out at all costs.

28
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,323
Goodness,
that tactless man will sort things out?

29
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,451
I'd be thankful
if he didn't spill the truth.

30
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,453
The resident card and entry pass.

31
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,081
Do you not have them?

32
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:28,709
Sir.

33
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,169
My fiancée...

34
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,175
She came from South Korea.

35
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,137
South Korea?

36
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:43,765
Has he lost his mind?

37
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,642
What do you mean?

38
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,270
She belongs to Division 11.

39
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,481
-Division 11?
-Division 11?

40
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,568
-Seriously?
-Gosh.

41
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:58,739
Then are you saying she received
a medal from the Central Party?

42
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:03,535
Gosh, what kind of mission
did she accomplish in the South?

43
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,164
As you all know,

44
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,834
any information about those in Division 11
is strictly confidential,

45
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,587
so I cannot get into any details.

46
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,799
Anyway, Captain Ri is too upright.
It worries me.

47
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,553
He won't lie
even if he's threatened with a knife.

48
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,473
-He's too honest.
-Exactly.

49
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:27,851
It's important to be able to lie
when it is necessary.

50
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,604
My fiancée returned from the South
only recently,

51
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,231
so she doesn't feel comfortable
in front of a crowd.

52
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,692
May I take her back inside?

53
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:36,943
So the two of you

54
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,654
will spend the night together
at your place?

55
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:42,949
She's exhausted.

56
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:46,536
-Gosh!
-Oh, my.

57
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,246
-My goodness.
-Seriously?

58
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:52,167
-Well, they're engaged.
-I know, but...

59
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,971
EPISODE 3

60
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,277
No one's watching, so we can stop.

61
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:24,324
Well, you called me your fiancée
out of the blue.

62
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,243
I guess I got too immersed in it.

63
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,788
I had no choice.

64
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,457
Yes, I get it.

65
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,669
Considering it was totally improvised,
it wasn't bad.

66
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,880
Those wide-eyed ladies
seemed so surprised earlier.

67
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,132
I bet they thought
we looked so cute together and...

68
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,096
By the way, what is that? Division 11.

69
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,852
Why didn't anyone even question anything

70
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,562
after you brought up Division 11?

71
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,564
Is it a very powerful organization?

72
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,486
Have some water and calm down.

73
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,451
Random house inspections
happen occasionally,

74
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,413
but I didn't expect it'd happen today.
I'm sorry.

75
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:15,458
Well, I'm sure
you were equally surprised by it.

76
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,379
And you showed up at the perfect time,
so it's all good.

77
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,966
By the way, did you get hurt?

78
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,468
Are you all right?

79
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,436
I'm fine.

80
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,523
Division 11...

81
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,026
Right, what is that?

82
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,946
It manages special agents who work
in the South as well as their families.

83
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,114
Special what?

84
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,366
You mean, like a spy?

85
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,994
Their personal information
is kept strictly confidential.

86
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,245
That's why I said that.

87
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:56,041
Still, how could you tell them
that I'm a spy? That's crazy.

88
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:59,836
How else could I have explained
the way you look and talk?

89
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,797
Still, how are you going
to handle the consequences though?

90
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,009
What if they find out it's a lie?

91
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,303
You'll leave tomorrow night anyway,

92
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,014
so we just have to get through
this one day.

93
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,934
I don't want to be a spy though.

94
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:19,314
Captain Ri. Are you home?

95
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:20,899
Captain Ri.

96
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,860
-Maybe he's not home.
-Goodness.

97
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,237
He's inside, with his fiancée
or whoever she is.

98
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,948
-Do you
-Just the two of them.

99
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,574
really think we can hold out quietly?

100
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,410
Captain Ri!

101
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:40,335
My gosh, sorry to visit you unannounced
at this late hour.

102
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,545
It's okay. What brings you here?

103
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,714
You just returned from the outpost line,

104
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,299
so you probably have no food at home.

105
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,636
I should've paid you a visit sooner
as one of the elders in this town.

106
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,012
I'm sorry this is late.

107
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,139
It's okay.

108
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:56,851
Don't say no.
I made this chestnut wine myself.

109
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,062
Here are some potato pancakes.

110
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:03,066
We also brought some steamed corn.
They're still warm.

111
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:09,406
My gosh,
he can't carry all these by himself.

112
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:13,868
Then why don't we all go inside
and drop them off for him?

113
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:14,869
-Shall we?
-Wait.

114
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:16,997
I don't think I need help.

115
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,290
It looks like you do though.

116
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,764
She told us about you.

117
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,142
So you're Captain Ri's fiancée?

118
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,061
Yes.

119
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,188
Nice to meet you.

120
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,443
-Nice to meet you too.
-I heard you belong to Division 11.

121
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,904
What missions have you undertaken,
and where?

122
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:52,073
I am not allowed to tell you
any information

123
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:56,703
about my missions as well as where I was.

124
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,915
I must keep everything strictly

125
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,501
confidential.

126
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,421
I'm sure you know.

127
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,218
Gosh, that's right.

128
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,679
I asked such a silly question.

129
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,682
Good night, then.

130
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,977
-Good night.
-Nice meeting you anyway.

131
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,364
She's not that pretty.

132
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,118
It must be an arranged marriage.

133
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:42,207
I mean, Captain Ri doesn't seem to have
any feelings for her.

134
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,877
-It seems to be the case, right?
-You saw them.

135
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:50,048
Captain Ri seemed so upset
when she was right by his side.

136
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,841
I bet he can't stand her.

137
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,636
Gosh, did you see her hair?

138
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,180
It looked completely disheveled.

139
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,599
-What the...
-I thought she was a ghost.

140
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,893
I feel so bad for Captain Ri.

141
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:05,563
Next time you see her,
see if she has a tail, like a fox.

142
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,321
Fine.

143
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,616
A spy who's your fiancée.

144
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,201
It's all good.

145
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,746
But what will you do now?

146
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,331
About what?

147
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,501
Well, they'll ask you about me
even after I leave.

148
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,337
Especially that woman with round eyes.

149
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,422
"Why did you two break up?"

150
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,049
No, they won't ask.

151
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,261
They'll totally ask.
They'll grill you about it.

152
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,805
They'll gossip like there's no tomorrow.

153
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:42,433
No one can easily ask me
about personal matters.

154
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:43,685
They'll ask you very easily.

155
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,145
Judging from what I saw earlier,

156
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:49,023
you're in no position to act all tough
talking in your low voice and all.

157
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,568
They barged in like that
because they think you're a joke.

158
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,028
They obviously think you're a pushover.

159
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,282
What? I'm not a--

160
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,241
Mr. Ri.

161
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:00,994
What is the most important thing

162
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,663
when talking about
a romantic relationship?

163
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,624
"Why did they break up? And who ended it?"

164
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,626
Those are the most important questions.

165
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,378
What are you trying to say?

166
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,756
Anyone can probably guess what happened,

167
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,842
but I want to make it clear.

168
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,052
If anyone asks you why we broke up,

169
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:19,679
say you got dumped.

170
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,893
I don't know why that matters, but sure.

171
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,898
And you got dumped because...

172
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,359
Let's just say
our personalities were too different.

173
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,237
-Sure.
-And let's make it six months.

174
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,781
You can't date anyone
for six months after I leave.

175
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,743
Shall we call it a period
for post-breakup condolences?

176
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:47,582
That's it. Let out deep sighs like that.

177
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,209
Don't eat or smile.

178
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:52,462
You know,
you'll look all haggard and listless.

179
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:56,507
"He obviously got dumped ruthlessly
after clinging to her like crazy."

180
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:57,842
Anyone should be able to tell.

181
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,679
Did you just scoff?

182
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:03,598
You won't say, "Sure"?

183
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,936
-I might stay, then.
-Sure, let's do that.

184
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,817
I guess the thought of me staying here
scares you a lot.

185
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,363
-Get some rest.
-You're leaving?

186
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:22,909
Well, what if people barge in again
because no one here respects you?

187
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:26,120
What should I do if that happens?
Just stay here tonight.

188
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,249
I'll sleep in the master bedroom.
You can sleep in the living room.

189
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:32,669
My gosh.

190
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,422
This is just great.

191
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,132
Goodness.

192
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,802
The floor is so hard.

193
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,554
I've been treated like a princess
all my life,

194
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,098
so this is an interesting experience.

195
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,433
Thank you so much.

196
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,395
Stop talking nonsense and get some sleep.

197
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,605
I'd like to sleep,

198
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,775
but I obviously can't fall asleep.

199
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,486
I literally fell from the sky

200
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,030
and ended up in North Korea.

201
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:05,076
I nearly got shot, twice.

202
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,537
And today, I even got engaged.

203
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,749
I'm so wired that I can't fall asleep.

204
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:21,926
By the way, have you been to Switzerland?

205
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,722
Well, I wasn't trying to be nosy.

206
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,974
But I happened to see
your bookcase earlier.

207
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,435
One's book collection

208
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,563
usually reveals a lot
about his or her personality,

209
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,690
character, taste, and so on, you know.

210
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:40,987
But I have to say, you have a lot of books
that deal with dark subjects.

211
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,240
Also,

212
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,411
I saw something
that doesn't suit you at all.

213
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:50,705
Piano sheets.

214
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,541
I also saw a concert brochure.

215
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,210
And what was it?

216
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,254
The City of Basel Music Academy?

217
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:29,744
I can play the piano quite well myself.

218
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:33,164
I don't even need
the sheet music to play "For Elise".

219
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,585
You used to play the piano too?

220
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:44,884
If that's not the case,

221
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,720
do you have a girlfriend
who plays the piano?

222
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:52,475
What?

223
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,477
Maybe he actually does.

224
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,367
AIR KORYO

225
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:18,918
PYONGYANG

226
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,927
PYONGYANG SUNAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

227
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,908
North Korean women are beautiful indeed.

228
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,493
Please watch what you say.

229
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,454
What if someone figures it out?

230
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,873
Mr. Cheon, let's revise our contract.

231
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,500
I'll give you another 10,000 dollars,
so please don't nag me.

232
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:03,087
But if you nag me again,
you'll have to pay me 10,000 dollars.

233
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:04,422
Well...

234
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,299
Where are you going? It's this way.

235
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:07,258
This way?

236
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:13,514
Dan, you must've studied too hard
while you were in Russia.

237
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:15,433
You've lost a lot of weight.

238
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,226
I'm trying to lose weight.

239
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:21,397
Come on, you don't need to.
You shouldn't lose any more weight.

240
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,696
-Hey, run!
-Those punks.

241
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,406
-Take it out.
-Yes, sir.

242
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,909
There's no need to blame the thieves.

243
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,369
The one that failed to protect
his valuables is a fool.

244
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:36,662
By the way, Uncle.

245
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,040
Where's that car?

246
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,709
I lent it to someone.

247
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,670
Are you allowed to lend it to others?

248
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,756
Who'd even dare to ask you
to borrow that car?

249
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:48,799
Jeong Hyeok.

250
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,178
He said it was very urgent.

251
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:56,807
Really? Then what are you going to do?

252
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,267
What?

253
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,561
Will he bring the car back?

254
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,605
Or do you have to go to pick up the car?

255
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:06,526
I'll just get someone
to go and pick up the car--

256
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:09,111
-Okay.
-What? What do you mean?

257
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,531
I'll go and pick it up.

258
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,075
Right after my recital tomorrow.

259
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,243
You'll do it yourself?

260
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,703
I'm sure he knows that I'm back,

261
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,664
so it'd be odd if I didn't go myself.

262
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:21,123
Does he know?

263
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,587
-He doesn't know?
-I didn't tell him.

264
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,549
Well, he never asked.

265
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,594
He never asks me about you,
so I didn't have a chance to bring it up.

266
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,848
Would you still recognize him though?

267
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:39,559
It's been so long.

268
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:43,354
What woman doesn't recognize her fiancé?

269
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,779
They say even the rivers
and mountains change in ten years' time.

270
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:55,032
But that feisty girl
hasn't changed one bit.

271
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,423
I got it. Let's go.

272
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,307
Let's go.

273
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,059
North Korea.

274
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,186
Everything's going well.

275
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,753
Even the skies of Pyongyang
are giving me a warm welcome.

276
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,179
What's going on?

277
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,431
There are no windshield wipers?

278
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:03,517
I paid you a ton of money.
How could you bring a car like this?

279
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,437
It's not that, sir.
I was in a rush to pick you up,

280
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:09,565
so I forgot to remove
the windshield wipers.

281
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,484
The thieves must've taken them.

282
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,570
Anyway, what are you going to do?
You can't see a thing.

283
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:15,988
I can see.

284
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,450
Even now?

285
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,452
Well, yes. I can see everything.

286
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,372
Do you have
some supernatural powers or what?

287
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:27,375
Don't you worry. This happens often,
so we're used to it.

288
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,627
We can still drive fast enough.

289
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,213
-That's right.
-Are you kidding me?

290
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,423
We're driving
at ten kilometers per hour right now.

291
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,634
I can't believe this.

292
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:40,179
Mr. Cheon, you emphasized "trust" so much
when we were signing the contract,

293
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,932
but you forgot to make sure
the car would come with wipers.

294
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,227
Don't worry, sir. I'm good
at dynamic driving tasks like this.

295
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,187
Do you want to be bedridden for ten years?

296
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,772
Look straight ahead, please.

297
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:56,278
COAL MINE

298

FOR PEACE, PROSPERITY, AND UNIFICATION
OF KOREAN PENINSULA

299
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:27,935
THE DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA

300
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:33,232
WIRETAP ROOM

301
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,705
I see everyone working hard.

302
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:01,260
LET'S ACHIEVE ECONOMIC PROSPERITY
THROUGH COAL MINING

303
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,939
Sir, what brings you all the way here?

304
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:18,402
Ri Mu Hyeok's brother
is at the outpost now.

305
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,114
Captain Ri Jeong Hyeok.

306
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:24,200
It turns out

307
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,702
that he's Ri Mu Hyeok's brother.

308
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:30,122
Really? Then what do you know, sir?

309
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,627
Don't ask me. It is your job to find out.

310
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,255
He's extremely quick-witted,

311
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,132
so you'll have to be cautious.

312
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,677
We got a new directional microphone.

313
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,722
It doesn't need to be installed
inside his home.

314
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:50,351
At a close distance, we'll hear everything
that happens inside his house.

315
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,812
-Install it, then.
-Yes, sir.

316
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,023
A woman is staying at his place.

317
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,776
-A woman, sir?
-She seems a little peculiar.

318
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:02,488
He said that she belongs to Division 11,

319
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,157
but my guts tell me
that there's something suspicious.

320
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:06,367
Keep a close watch.

321
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:09,411
-Yes, sir.
-Even the littlest pebble

322
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:12,081
can make those in high places fall.

323
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,252
If we plan this out accordingly,

324
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:21,590
we can use that woman to destroy
his whole family. That's what I mean.

325
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:30,558
Isn't it about time
you stopped working as a wiretapper

326
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,518
and got a better job?

327
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,937
Your son gets good grades in school.

328
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,524
He deserves to prepare for college
in a posh apartment in Pyongyang.

329
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:01,589
He just passed the second guard post.

330
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,968
7 YEARS AGO

331
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:11,265
The vehicle is now approaching
Bongdeok Curve.

332
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,184
Now, passing the ninth speed bump.

333
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:16,562
You see, my brother

334
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,440
is studying in Switzerland at the moment.

335
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:20,900
Really?

336
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,235
He's a piano genius.

337
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,779
He's on full scholarship.

338
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:30,451
At his recent recital,
he received a standing ovation.

339
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,874
But every time he calls me,
he says that he's sorry.

340
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:43,464
One of us had to follow our father's path
and join the army,

341
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:47,676
but he thinks I had to choose that path
because he's a piano major.

342
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,263
Did you want to play the piano as well?

343
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,684
I enjoyed it too,

344
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:59,313
but I was definitely no match
for my brother, Jeong Hyeok.

345
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:03,359
Jeong Hyeok said he wrote a song for me.

346
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,654
He said he'll play it for me
when he returns home.

347
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:09,281
Are you happy?

348
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,158
Yes, I am.

349
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:14,703
Thinking about him always puts me

350
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,207
in a good mood.

351
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:28,175
Passing the last speed bump.

352
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,221
Arriving in five seconds.

353
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:36,994
-My gosh.
-It has a tiger drawn on it.

354
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,621
My, this black car is so cool.

355
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:43,417
-Look how shiny it is.
-What a cool car.

356
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,962
-Gosh, this is...
-I've never seen a car like this before.

357
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:49,173
-I know.
-A car like this in this small town?

358
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,719
What is this?

359
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,138
Captain Ri, who lives in this house,

360
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,140
brought this car from Pyongyang
last night.

361
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:02,895
I've heard of cars like this, but this is
my first time actually seeing one.

362
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:05,355
Kids, hands off. Don't touch it.

363
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,699
-What are you doing?
-My gosh.

364
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,245
What kind of car can it possibly be

365
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:22,956
that everyone has come to see it?

366
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,708
It's just a regular sedan.

367
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,961
Don't go around outside and stay home.

368
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:29,797
Hang on.

369
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:32,382
Let's go out together. I'll walk you home.

370
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:33,759
I'm good.

371
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:39,306
I think the ladies didn't see my face
yesterday because it was too dark.

372
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,392
That's probably
why they said those things.

373
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:46,188
Why does that even matter?
You won't see them again.

374
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,232
It's important
because I won't see them again.

375
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,442
That impression I made will last forever.

376
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,280
Why?

377
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,164
-Tie it up.
-Tie up what?

378
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:07,000
-Your disheveled hair.
-"Disheveled"?

379
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:10,671
Have you ever seen
such fancy disheveled hair?

380
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:15,217
Here, there are only two types of people
who walk around with such messy hair.

381
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,760
Foreigners or crazy women.

382
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,972
Is that so? Then I'll be a crazy woman.

383
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:36,864
Gosh.

384
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,926
Aren't you like a baby?
You have something on your shoulder.

385
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,013
There's nothing.

386
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,058
Just stay still. I won't harm you.

387
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:12,316
Fine, then. Touch my hair a bit.

388
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,444
-What?
-Touch my hair.

389
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,487
Don't you know how to pat someone sweetly?

390
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,489
I don't.

391
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,200
Just do it, will you?

392
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:26,121
If you don't do it,
I will settle down here.

393
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,583
We're engaged anyway,
so we might as well just get married.

394
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:32,085
I told you. Your face is totally my type.

395
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:44,973
Gosh, honey.

396
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:50,896
I'm leaving.

397
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:53,857
Wave your hand.

398
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,307
They say physiognomy is science.

399
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,893
She's all slutty just like her face.

400
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:33,063
She seemed to have uncommon beauty.
What's the matter?

401
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:39,528
Did you wrap your social skills
in the cabbage leaf and eat it up?

402
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:43,115
Sorry.

403
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:49,830
I'm thinking she might have eaten
the meat in the salt crock.

404
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:56,586
She doesn't deserve him. What a waste.

405
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,255
They said they're engaged, didn't they?

406
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,133
It's not like we will live with him.

407
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:06,263
By the way, why is the one
who will live with him not helping?

408
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:14,813
All the women in this village
are having a kimchi battle today.

409
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:17,482
You have a battle when you make kimchi?

410
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,236
Well, it's just an analogy.

411
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,573
It means we will work hard
as if we are in a battle.

412
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,409
Why are you explaining yourself?

413
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,872
Come and give us a hand.

414
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:36,585
No, I won't.

415
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:39,713
Goodness.

416
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:45,135
Is this family not going to eat
kimchi this winter?

417
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:49,264
No. I don't like kimchi.
Could you put your fingers away?

418
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,100
Well, then.

419
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,149
MARCHING TOWARD GREAT VICTORY

420
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,650
Attention!

421
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,655
Captain Ri, Company Five has assembled
for the morning training.

422
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:08,158
-Executive Officer Hwang Yeong Beom.
-At ease.

423
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,868
At ease!

424
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:12,371
-Master Sergeant Pyo Chi Su.
-Yes, sir.

425
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,206
-First Lieutenant Park Gwang Beom.
-Yes, sir.

426
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,124
-Staff Sergeant Kim Ju Meok.
-Yes, sir.

427
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,001
-Private First Class Geum Eun Dong.
-Yes, sir.

428
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:20,754
Except for the four,
all of you go to the shooting range.

429
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,215
Yes, sir! Company, attention!

430
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,342
Company, forward march!

431
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:29,262
-Early in the morning at sunrise
-Early in the morning at sunrise

432
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:32,933
-The soldiers take off
-The soldiers take off

433
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:36,478
-The march ahead of them
-The march ahead of them

434
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,648
-Is long and tough
-Is long and tough

435
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:43,193
-The great golden star
-The great golden star

436
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:46,154
So what on earth did you say?

437
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:49,783
I mean, you got caught
at the random house inspection.

438
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:51,535
How did you get out of it?

439
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:55,080
Well... So I introduced her to them,

440
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:59,251
and he just said, "Okay. I'm sorry."

441
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,294
Then I said, "I'll go to bed now.
I'm tired."

442
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:02,462
That's how it went.

443
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:05,757
So what did you introduce her as?

444
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:11,179
Master Sergeant Pyo,
did you just yell at me?

445
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,599
I'm sorry.

446
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:19,396
I'm just frustrated.
What could you have possibly said--

447
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,814
I said she was my fiancée.

448
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:22,899
Really?

449
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,484
There was no other way.

450
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:27,529
I guess you could call it
a kind of disguise tactic.

451
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,450
We shouldn't have been so worried then.

452
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:34,578
We didn't know you could lie so well.

453
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,079
That's not true.

454
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:39,166
I've seen scenes like this
in South Korean dramas.

455
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:42,377
When the characters are hiding
and about to be caught...

456
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:43,336
Then?

457
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:48,383
The man and the woman hug each other
or kiss each other.

458
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,428
Why would they do that?

459
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:55,390
That's South Koreans' method
to avert crises.

460
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:58,185
Then what happens
after they avert the crisis?

461
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,355
The drama gets more interesting.

462
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:05,317
Because the two spend the night together.

463
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:20,123
You didn't come back last night
because you two...

464
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,087
Well, we weren't really together.

465
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:30,008
I slept in my room and she slept
on the floor. We were not together--

466
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,843
That's how they all fall in love.

467
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:33,094
One hundred percent.

468
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:36,515
I haven't seen any drama characters
that don't fall in love in that situation.

469
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:41,436
Sergeant Kim.

470
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:45,899
Are you showing off that you have seen
a lot of South Korean dramas?

471
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:47,609
I apologize.

472
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:55,158
After tonight, everything will be over.

473
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,786
Make sure to be perfectly prepared
until the end.

474
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,205
Did you find a boat
to sail to the high sea?

475
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:04,209
Yes, but it costs a 20,000 won-worth
phone card.

476
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,711
-Twenty thousand won?
-That's a lot.

477
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:09,339
Did you set the time and place
to meet the man's boat?

478
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:12,634
Yes, he will be there at 11 p.m.
and wait for exactly 5 minutes.

479
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,887
I want you guys to finish up
the repair work back in my place.

480
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,933
The people in the village are
greatly interested in the woman there,

481
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,476
so keep her from them.

482
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,061
What about you, sir?

483
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,522
There's something I have to do.

484
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,774
-Hello.
-Hello.

485
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,234
-You came.
-Yes.

486
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,111
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

487
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:32,612
-Hello.
-Hello.

488
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:35,407
I beat up 17 guys then.

489
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:38,368
-Just like this.
-Really?

490
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:40,787
The members of Company Five
are entering Captain Ri's place.

491
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:42,998
How's the reception?

492
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,499
Can you hear me all right?

493
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:47,794
Hello.

494
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,755
Come in. I was bored.

495
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:53,967
-Have you eaten?
-Why are you snickering?

496
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:58,138
Chi Su, you're saying nonsense again.
Okay. Suit yourself.

497
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:00,890
The reception is good.

498
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,058
Install it there.

499
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:03,435
Yes, sir.

500
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:10,525
Hold it.

501
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:15,363
Comrade, I would like
to have a word with you.

502
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:17,449
With me?

503
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,164
Do you think that makes sense?

504
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:28,001
Kwon Sang-woo and Choi Ji-woo
became a couple in the end. That's...

505
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:31,463
Fine.

506
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:34,466
But why did Shin Hyun-joon have to die?

507
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,718
Hey, Stairway to Heaven geek.

508
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,512
You keep bugging me with the drama

509
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:41,598
from years ago.

510
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,475
From my perspective,

511
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,978
it was right that Shin Hyun-joon died
at that point.

512
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:48,480
What?

513
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,315
What's right about that?

514
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,609
He was in love with Choi Ji-woo
his entire life.

515
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,277
Why did he have to...

516
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,196
Let's say he didn't die.

517
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:59,199
Then he would have had to watch
the woman he loves,

518
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,367
live happily with other man.

519
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,494
Think of it that way.

520
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:04,954
But still,

521
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,916
I think it's unfair that he had to die.

522
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,543
It's not like I killed him.

523
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,921
It's all over. Don't do this to me.

524
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,215
She insists she didn't kill him.

525
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,008
This is obsession. Women hate this.

526
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:19,552
"It's all over. Obsession."

527
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,805
You're frustrating me.

528
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,724
What are they talking about?

529
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:33,817
MINISTRY OF PEOPLE'S ARMED FORCES
POLICE DEPARTMENT, GUARD POST 10

530
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:38,446
Please show me your pass.

531
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,202
I'm the Captain of Company Five
of Civilian Police Battalion.

532
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,580
Is the head of the guard post here?

533
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:50,375
Yes. Around 11 p.m. on the 16th,

534
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52,836
three Kamaz trucks have passed here.

535
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,797
Guard Post 10 is the only way
to pass this area, right?

536
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,507
That's right, sir.

537
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:02,971
Was there anything suspicious?

538
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:06,099
That three heavy trucks
that can load ten tons each

539
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:09,769
come back and forth empty
doesn't happen so often.

540
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:13,106
There's no reason to do that
because it would be a waste of oil.

541
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,487
When I saw it pass the guard post,

542
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:21,990
at first, I thought
it was going to load water.

543
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,410
But the cargo box was still empty
on its way out.

544
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,953
Please show me your pass.

545
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,083
ENGINEER DEPARTMENT PASS

546
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,335
Were they really
from the Engineer Department?

547
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:35,879
I didn't check that.

548
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:39,007
But the vehicles definitely
belonged to the Engineer Department.

549
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,303
Did you identify
the woman who died that day?

550
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,055
That woman is from Sinuiju.

551
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,308
She was a long-distance trader
in this area.

552
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,561
Given that the license plate was found
around here,

553
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:54,230
it seems that she had an accident

554
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:55,982
while trying to hitchhike to Kaesong.

555
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:59,027
It's dark around here at night, so...

556
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,698
She could have been a witness.

557
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,327
It was dark,
so I couldn't see it clearly, but...

558
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,962
The armor attached
to the front of the trucks

559
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,925
wasn't ordinary armor.

560
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,261
They seemed to be made of special metal.

561
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,180
I haven't seen something like that before.

562
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:30,266
No vehicle would survive
a crash with such an armor.

563
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,936
I don't think you can use that
on normal occasions.

564
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,396
It must be put on only when necessary.

565
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,444
Why don't you go and check out the garage?

566
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:46,616
If anyone asks you about this incident,

567
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,910
I think you should say you don't know.

568
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,539
I don't want you to be in trouble.

569
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:54,165
Yes, sir.

570
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,342
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

571
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,190
Open the gate.

572
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,466
Thank you for coming a long way.

573
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:47,051
I'm Cho Cheol Gang.

574
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,526
You know,

575
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:07,155
there are a lot of people
who want to kill me in South Korea.

576
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,533
But I managed to escape from them

577
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:12,327
and make my way here.

578
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:13,494
And I almost died

579
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:16,748
while driving on a rainy road
in North Korea at ten kilometers per hour.

580
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,625
What do you think about that?

581
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:20,752
It's because I didn't have
the damn windshield wiper.

582
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:24,839
Do you think I spent all the money
to be treated like this?

583
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:26,549
You thought I was stupid, didn't you?

584
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,468
Look, Comrade Gu Seung-jun.

585
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,094
"Comrade"?

586
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:31,721
Why am I your comrade?

587
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,765
We don't have any comradeship.

588
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,642
I'm a businessman in a military uniform.

589
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:39,103
I get paid to protect my customer,

590
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:42,482
but I can also break contracts anytime.

591
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,652
You said you're a businessman.

592
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:47,153
Don't you need money?

593
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:52,158
You said there were many people
who want to kill you in South Korea.

594
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,702
If I take you to them,

595
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:56,537
I can make money.

596
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,625
As long as I can get what I want,
I don't care how.

597
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,460
Well, you said we were comrades.

598
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,421
Don't you think that joke was
too mean for your comrade?

599
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:08,007
Let's do this, Comrade.

600
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,928
He's not in the Philippines?

601
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,473
Are you sure you looked everywhere?

602
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,141
He left? When?

603
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,478
Go to Hong Kong and Macao.

604
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,397
You know me. My gut says it's Macao.

605
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,942
I don't think it's Macao.

606
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:28,653
-What?
-Why do you chase him from the back?

607
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,113
Wait for him in the front.

608
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,949
Are you playing
a quiz game with me or what?

609
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,284
Just say what you want to say.

610
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,871
His closest man, Manager Oh,

611
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:40,665
is an informant in China.

612
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,458
Is that what you were talking about?

613
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:45,795
Beijing, Shanghai, Yanbian, and Shenyang.

614
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:48,631
Do you think that punk, Gu Seung-jun,
wouldn't know China is my area?

615
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:50,633
He wouldn't go there
unless he wants to die.

616
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:56,597
Do you think he wouldn't have known
that you would think like that?

617
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,647
He must have gone to the very place

618
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:08,401
that you think he would never go.

619
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:20,163
Hey, don't go to Macao.

620
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:22,081
Go to Shenyang.

621
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:25,001
Why would you chase him from the back?
You must wait for him in the front.

622
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:28,004
That punk must have gone
to the place that I think

623
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:29,630
he would never go.

624
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,300
Tell him he should keep his head cold
for the company.

625
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,010
Give him realistic advice.

626
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:37,722
-The shareholder meeting is near.
-I know it's near.

627
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:41,100
So what? I'm the second son.

628
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:43,978
This kind of situation
is always unfavorable to me.

629
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:46,439
You need to make
the best of the cards you've got.

630
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:50,818
The cards your brother doesn't have
but only you have.

631
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:53,237
Do I have such a thing?

632
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:58,785
Me. You have me.

633
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,873
Father, the shareholder meeting is--

634
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,541
Just around the corner.

635
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,336
You must keep a cool head.

636
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:12,465
If the word gets out
that Se-ri was chosen as the heir

637
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:13,925
and then went missing--

638
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:16,219
Wouldn't that be a serious problem?

639
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:18,638
Then the stock price will obviously drop.

640
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:23,101
There's a big difference between
missing a daughter that no one cares

641
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:26,395
and missing the next chief executive
of Queens Group.

642
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:28,189
One would make the headline
on the first page

643
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,024
while the other
a small article on the fifth.

644
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:32,235
That's how different they are.

645
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,695
A small article on the fifth page
can be stopped.

646
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:37,281
The headline on the first page,
however, can't be.

647
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:39,700
You can't stop it.
Even the President can't.

648
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:41,160
It's impossible.

649
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:44,747
Of course,

650
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:48,084
what happened to Se-ri
really breaks my heart too.

651
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,877
It's true, Father.

652
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:53,381
He can't sleep at all at night these days.

653
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,509
And he can barely eat food.

654
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,262
Yesterday, he left
most of the braised sea bream head,

655
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,305
which is his favorite.

656
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:10,273
Everyone here is just as sad as I am.

657
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:11,858
You don't have to say anything.

658
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:15,528
Father, to overcome this crisis,
we need standard--

659
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,113
I agree.

660
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:19,615
We need standard tactics
to get through crises.

661
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:24,245
Although, this is the biggest crisis
we've met since the company's foundation.

662
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,955
Do you think we should work on our own

663
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:29,667
or get through the crisis
with a trustworthy partner?

664
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,128
I'm sure you remember

665
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:35,506
our stock price rose four days in a row
when we got married. Why?

666
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:38,009
Because I, the son of Queens Group,

667
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,094
had become the son-in-law of Sambok Group.

668
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,638
If you choose me, Sambok will help Queens

669
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,849
get through this crisis.

670
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:49,729
If you announce your new heir

671
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:52,023
at the shareholders general meeting,

672
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:55,484
I'm sure Se-ri's disappearance
will be easily forgotten.

673
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,866
You.

674
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:05,494
How are you going to make up
for the 100 billion won you lost?

675
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:08,581
Do you think
the shareholders will accept you?

676
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:09,916
Speaking of which,

677
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:14,045
what do you think about
putting an end to Seri's Choice?

678
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:18,216
I was thinking we could use it
to make up for the insufficient fund.

679
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:20,468
The company's owner

680
00:45:21,594 --> 00:45:23,429
is gone anyway.

681
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:32,897
If they still haven't found her,
I guess there's no hope.

682
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,775
The employees keep asking me about it.
Until when do we have to hide it?

683
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:39,028
Exactly. Like hiding would bring
the dead back to life.

684
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,488
Who's dead?

685
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:42,698
Who is he?

686
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:46,244
He's my friend. He's in charge of
Chairwoman Yoon's insurance.

687
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:48,496
Ten billion...

688
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,039
What brings you here?

689
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:53,000
I found something very important.

690
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:54,877
A PARAGLIDER SURVIVES A STORM

691
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:56,170
Do you know who this is?

692
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:58,965
Her name is Ewa Wisniewska.

693
00:45:59,048 --> 00:45:59,882
Ewa what?

694
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:02,927
She survived an accident similar
to what happened to Chairwoman Yoon.

695
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,053
Su-chan, that's nonsense.

696
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:06,222
In 2007, while she was paragliding
in Australia,

697
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:08,683
she suddenly got swept away by a storm.

698
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:11,477
It says it was larger than
the tornado this time. Take a look.

699
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,812
No, I won't.

700
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:15,856
Ewa Wisniewska got sucked up
to 30,000 feet

701
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,567
and spent an hour in the atmosphere
that was minus 40 Celsius.

702
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:21,821
She landed on a secluded place
and then rescued.

703
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:24,573
Do you understand? She was rescued.

704
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:26,867
Then did that Ewa person
also go missing for days

705
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:28,327
before she got rescued?

706
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:29,662
No, she didn't, but--

707
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,247
-See?
-But

708
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,498
it gives us hope

709
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:35,793
that Ewa Wisniewska and Chairwoman Yoon
used the same paraglider.

710
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,837
It's one of the best paraglider models

711
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,463
that can survive natural disasters.

712
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:42,466
The chances are low
that the storm broke it.

713
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:45,052
Which means Chairwoman Yoon
might have crash-landed somewhere

714
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:47,138
and waiting for us...

715
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,188
It's too early to give up.
I won't give up.

716
00:46:56,272 --> 00:46:59,442
Even her family almost gave up.
Who do you think you are?

717
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:01,152
We've done enough searching--

718
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:03,154
We need to broaden the search area.

719
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:06,741
Fine. Let's say she landed somewhere.
Then why haven't we heard from her?

720
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,993
You can use your phone
everywhere in Korea.

721
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:10,619
-She's on a deserted island.
-He's crazy.

722
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:13,456
The tornado was 40m per hour
and was heading northwest.

723
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:14,957
-Check this out.
-No, I won't.

724
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:18,252
The Yellow Sea has many deserted islands.
Dangnamri Island, Deolgeomeori Island,

725
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:19,837
-Maebak Island, Wisaeri Island,
-Fine.

726
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,006
-There's even an island called Seri.
-Okay.

727
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,716
-Just listen for a minute and--
-I'm good.

728
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:25,092
Would you like some potatoes?

729
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:27,094
-Sounds good.
-Wait there.

730
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:30,765
Keep digging.

731
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:33,642
Look.

732
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,227
Hey. It's a rope thief!

733
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:37,271
Catch him!

734
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:38,939
What is a rope thief?

735
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:40,858
Oh, my.

736
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:44,320
Stop!

737
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:46,572
Stop there, you beggar!

738
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:49,700
You!

739
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,160
Let go of me!

740
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,456
You...

741
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,876
I know you beggars have no morals,

742
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:02,546
but how dare you come to rob
a captain's place?

743
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:05,925
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

744
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:09,345
What's this?

745
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:11,055
I didn't steal this.

746
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:13,891
I found it in the marketplace.

747
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:15,726
I'm not lying.

748
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,105
I'll give this to my little sister.

749
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:20,898
She's been starving for three days.

750
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:23,067
She can't open her eyes.

751
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:37,790
You act as if you own this house.

752
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,208
Those are not yours.

753
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,711
You're taking all the food

754
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:46,257
in Captain Ri's house
just to feed that child beggar.

755
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:49,969
He's not the only child beggar out there.

756
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:52,179
You have no idea. Just stay out of it.

757
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:56,725
Did you hear what I said?

758
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:58,602
Can't you hear me?

759
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:01,313
You're being fooled by that beggar.

760
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,692
Sir, I told her

761
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:08,320
those child beggars steal things
here and there and also lie.

762
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:10,906
What? Your sister is starving?

763
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,367
He's saying bullshit
to make us feel bad for him.

764
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:15,578
That's not true. I didn't lie.

765
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:18,122
I just want to feed my sister
so she won't die.

766
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:20,416
-Shut up!
-You shut up.

767
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:22,126
You heartless punk.

768
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:25,337
You don't know anything.

769
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:26,881
Captain.

770
00:49:27,423 --> 00:49:29,467
If the work is done,
go and do some pumping.

771
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:31,260
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

772
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:39,268
Wash your face and hands.

773
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:42,521
You need to eat with clean hands
not to get sick.

774
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:54,492
What are you doing?

775
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:57,703
Give him what you have to give him.
We need to leave too.

776
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,292
Captain!

777
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:20,518
The song you and I used to sing together

778
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:27,775
Do you remember the song?

779
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:33,864
The season when we walked together

780
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:40,788
Do you miss the season?

781
00:50:54,343 --> 00:51:00,307
The stars in the sky you and I

782
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:01,934
Looked at

783
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:02,893
I'm sorry I'm late.

784
00:51:03,686 --> 00:51:06,939
-One sad night
-I brought a lot of food.

785
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:13,654
The petals of the season

786
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,781
That stayed in the small hands

787
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:20,661
For a while

788
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:27,084
The song you and I used to sing together

789
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:30,462
-Do you
-Eat up.

790
00:51:30,546 --> 00:51:34,300
remember the song?

791
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:40,431
The season when we walked together

792
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:47,479
Do you miss the season?

793
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:52,651
Are you listening?

794
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:57,740
Do you miss those days?

795
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,491
All right. Do we have everyone?

796
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:04,246
Now, I'm going to give you awards.

797
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:07,207
-Awards?
-Are you a general or what?

798
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:09,627
Who are you to give us awards--

799
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:11,503
First, Number One Award.

800
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:16,383
Gosh, this somehow makes me nervous.

801
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:21,096
The award goes to Geum Eun Dong!

802
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:24,683
-Me?
-Yes, you're number one.

803
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:27,686
You get the Kindness Award.

804
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:30,731
I hereby present this certificate of merit
to Geum Eun Dong

805
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:33,984
in recognition
of his pure and nice treatment of me.

806
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:35,944
You can choose your prize.

807
00:52:36,028 --> 00:52:37,321
Is there a prize?

808
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,198
What is a certificate of merit
without a prize?

809
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:42,201
One can be received after reunification
and one can be received now.

810
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:44,828
One you can receive after reunification
is a hundred million won.

811
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:50,459
-What's that?
-I mean a hundred million won.

812
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:56,215
If you bring
this certificate of merit to me

813
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:59,843
after reunification, I will give you
a hundred million won. And...

814
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,054
What you can receive now

815
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,389
is eight kilograms of corn.

816
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:05,265
I see.

817
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:06,850
Choose a hundred million won.

818
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:10,354
I choose eight kilograms of corn.

819
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:14,191
Okay. You chose corn over money.

820
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:15,442
Here.

821
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:19,113
Take it from the storehouse
in the backyard.

822
00:53:20,656 --> 00:53:22,866
I knew it. What's in the storehouse
doesn't belong to you!

823
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,243
Captain Ri,

824
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:26,578
look at the way
that immoral woman behaves.

825
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:29,081
Let's move onto the second winner.

826
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,334
Kim Ju Meok!

827
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,295
Really?

828
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:37,005
Yes. You are the second winner.

829
00:53:37,089 --> 00:53:39,675
A certificate of merit
for the love of the Korean Wave.

830
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:40,801
I hereby present

831
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:44,096
this certificate of merit to Kim Ju Meok
because it's commendable

832
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,890
that he grew his love
for Korean dramas here.

833
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,684
As a prize, you can either have

834
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:50,477
lunch with Choi Ji-woo after reunification

835
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:53,981
or receive

836
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,400
that TV right now.

837
00:53:58,527 --> 00:53:59,987
Look here.

838
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,655
Don't worry.

839
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,949
I choose lunch with Choi Ji-woo.

840
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:06,118
See? He is like that.

841
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:08,203
Keep your promise.

842
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:09,455
Of course.

843
00:54:10,456 --> 00:54:11,707
Congratulations.

844
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,629
The third winner will receive

845
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,592
a very important certificate of merit.

846
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:27,806
Park Gwang Beom.

847
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:31,101
It's for the gift of mankind.

848
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:34,813
I hereby present this certificate of merit

849
00:54:34,897 --> 00:54:37,316
because you are
the most handsome one in here.

850
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,735
For goodness' sake.

851
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:42,362
By which criteria?

852
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:45,866
You aren't the most handsome one
by any criteria.

853
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:48,202
For goodness' sake.

854
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,621
Captain Ri.

855
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:54,166
You can either have a blind date
with Miss Korea after reunification

856
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:57,669
or have a goodbye hug with me right now.

857
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:02,090
I am not sure if I understand,
but I will choose neither.

858
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:04,343
You are very lofty.

859
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:08,722
Both in the South and North,
handsome men are lofty.

860
00:55:10,766 --> 00:55:11,934
Take the certificate of merit.

861
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:15,854
That concludes the presentation--

862
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:16,897
Hey!

863
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:19,733
What? Do you want one?

864
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:25,572
I didn't use these many times.

865
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:28,575
I will give them to you
so that you will wash up.

866
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:33,372
Shampoo and conditioner. What are these?

867
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:34,957
You use them for washing your hair.

868
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:40,045
Bodywash.

869
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:43,048
Captain Ri, did you buy these for her?

870
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,218
She said they are essential.

871
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:48,929
Shampoo, conditioner, bodywash...

872
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:51,139
Why do you need these things
to wash your hair?

873
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:52,724
I think you are mistaken.

874
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,394
The bodywash isn't for your hair.

875
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,396
He is right. It is for your body.

876
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:58,605
Really?

877
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:01,275
Now, that concludes

878
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,528
the presentation of certificates.

879
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:05,779
Thank you.

880
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,784
What?

881
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,289
It's nothing.

882
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,797
What is it?

883
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:25,674
-Come.
-Let go of me.

884
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:31,430
Here.

885
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:35,517
This is a special thank you present.

886
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:39,521
Someone visited earlier.

887
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:42,900
Someone who knocks on the door
and sells all sorts of items.

888
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:45,027
-A peddler?
-That's right.

889
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:47,237
A peddler visited earlier.

890
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:49,197
The items were low-grade,

891
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:51,450
but I found this tomato plant.

892
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:53,285
The yard was too empty.

893
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:56,121
Since I had no money,

894
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:58,123
I exchanged it
for half a sack of potatoes.

895
00:56:58,707 --> 00:57:01,293
Didn't it occur to you
that you were taking a loss?

896
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:02,878
I did take a loss, right?

897
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:05,631
That man ripped me off.

898
00:57:06,715 --> 00:57:09,718
But today is my last day here.

899
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:11,678
Since I am very thankful for you,

900
00:57:11,762 --> 00:57:13,305
I went ahead and made that trade.

901
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:15,307
I don't know why you decided to thank me

902
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,517
by using half a sack of my potatoes.

903
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,521
You will regret your words

904
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:24,191
when you eat tomatoes later on
thanks to me.

905
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,026
You will want to thank me,

906
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,236
but I won't be by your side.

907
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:29,738
Firstly,

908
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:32,407
I don't like tomatoes.

909
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:35,160
Secondly, I have neither interest
nor talent

910
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:36,536
in keeping a plant.

911
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:41,541
Think of it as a pet
and raise it with love.

912
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:45,337
They say onions
that hear nice words grow well

913
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,464
while the ones that hear bad words wither.

914
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,341
I read it in the newspaper.

915
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:51,259
Don't be ridiculous.

916
00:57:51,343 --> 00:57:53,220
Okay? Water it diligently

917
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:55,514
and say ten nice words to it every day.

918
00:58:00,102 --> 00:58:03,146
Onions wither and die
when they hear bad words?

919
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,612
Lieutenant Commander Cho.

920
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:15,367
Captain Ri's fiancée

921
00:58:15,951 --> 00:58:18,912
doesn't seem to be
in the perfect mental state.

922
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:22,249
But she hasn't shown
any suspicious behaviors.

923
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,252
She's going back to Pyongyang tonight.

924
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:27,295
Yes.

925
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:36,179
After many complications,
she will finally leave.

926
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:40,308
It takes a weight off my mind.

927
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:44,146
I feel a bit sad too.

928
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:48,275
Why would you feel sad?

929
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:51,486
I hope I don't see her in my dream!

930
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:56,116
Still,

931
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:59,703
she had good tastes.

932
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:06,084
I wonder if she set out already.

933
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,207
Thank you for everything.

934
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:29,376
I mean it.

935
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:33,171
I won't see you again, right?

936
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:37,259
Probably.

937
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:42,597
I can go to Africa

938
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:44,474
and even Antarctica, but not here.

939
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:46,726
It's a shame

940
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:49,020
that you live here.

941
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:53,150
It's a shame that you live there.

942
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:33,940
Did you bring a phone card?

943
01:01:39,571 --> 01:01:41,531
-Is it her?
-Yes.

944
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:42,574
Is she going alone?

945
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:49,581
Two of us.

946
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:53,501
-Are you going too?
-After she boards a ship, I will return.

947
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:55,462
Then one phone card won't be enough.

948
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:02,969
We must hurry. They won't wait
for more than five minutes.

949
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,512
Come aboard.

950
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:21,863
Although it has only been a few days,

951
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:24,241
it feels like I am returning
after a few years.

952
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,576
I am sure it feels the same for those
who await you.

953
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:28,495
A second feels like an eternity

954
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,580
when you don't know
if your family member is alive.

955
01:02:33,959 --> 01:02:35,085
I don't know.

956
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:37,212
I doubt that.

957
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:40,131
I will know once I return

958
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,217
if my safe return

959
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:45,720
makes them happy or flustered.

960
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:52,602
I'm quite loose-tongued today.

961
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:55,730
I simply told you
because I know I won't see you again.

962
01:03:03,655 --> 01:03:06,199
Since I won't see you again,
let me tell you this.

963
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:09,327
Don't say you can play the piano very well

964
01:03:09,411 --> 01:03:11,413
just because you can play For Elise.

965
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:14,040
Don't say that anywhere else.

966
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:21,506
Since I won't see you again,
let me tell you this.

967
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:25,385
My name is Yoon Se-ri.

968
01:03:28,013 --> 01:03:29,180
My name is Ri Jeong Hyeok.

969
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:35,228
I am a member of the Haeju Yoon Clan.
Haeju is in North Korea, right?

970
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:37,272
I am a member of the Jeonju Ri Clan.

971
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:42,110
What an irony!

972
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:55,832
Trawler 1004. Trawler 1004.

973
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:57,959
Halt. Halt.

974
01:03:58,251 --> 01:04:00,420
Stop the engine right this instant.

975
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:05,675
Why are they suddenly making a fuss?

976
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:10,180
Stay hidden. I will take care of this.

977
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:14,100
Trawler 1004. Trawler 1004.

978
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:15,769
Halt. Halt.

979
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:18,104
Stop the engine right this instant.

980
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:34,162
What is this about?

981
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:36,706
Trawler.

982
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:40,126
Didn't you receive a call
about the navel control order?

983
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:42,754
What? I didn't receive a call.

984
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:44,714
What is the reason
for a sudden control order?

985
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:47,092
It must be

986
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:49,886
because people smuggle
out of the country these days.

987
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:52,680
Who does that?

988
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:55,475
Thank you for your hard work.
I will turn the vessel around.

989
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:58,395
Let's see the hold.

990
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:01,147
What? Why?

991
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:03,358
I need to check if you do an honest trade

992
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:06,319
or smuggle goods and people.

993
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:12,534
Chief Coast Guard.

994
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:15,078
You must be new here.

995
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:19,082
I was very close
to the former Chief Coast Guard.

996
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:25,171
The Chief Coast Guard
you were very close to

997
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,716
got fired for taking bribes.

998
01:05:30,385 --> 01:05:32,387
-Open up.
-What should we do?

999
01:05:33,721 --> 01:05:35,265
Do something.

1000
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,476
As a soldier, you should know ways

1001
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,019
to overcome adversaries.

1002
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:43,231
Don't tell me you are at your wits' end.

1003
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:49,821
In South Korean dramas...

1004
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:54,409
What? This is not the time
to talk about dramas.

1005
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:57,120
There is a trick the protagonists use

1006
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:58,788
when they are being chased.

1007
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:00,915
What is it?

1008
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:02,792
You should know.

1009
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:05,170
Everyone uses the trick.

1010
01:06:05,253 --> 01:06:06,713
I don't know. What is it?

1011
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,840
What is the trick everyone uses?

1012
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:13,261
When I first heard about it,

1013
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:15,972
I thought it made no sense.

1014
01:06:16,556 --> 01:06:18,475
But now that I am in this situation,

1015
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:20,852
I see that it might be the only way.

1016
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:23,730
Hey! Stop talking and do something!

1017
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:25,523
Open up.

1018
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:29,319
What are you doing? Open up.

1019
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:31,446
Now, I will do something.

1020
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,157
Don't be startled

1021
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:35,950
and look at me, nothing else.

1022
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:31,172
Onions wither and die
when they hear bad words?

1023
01:07:37,345 --> 01:07:38,763
Lieutenant Commander Cho.

1024
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:43,434
Captain Ri's fiancée

1025
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:46,938
doesn't seem to be
in the perfect mental state.

1026
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:50,191
But she hasn't shown
any suspicious behaviors.

1027
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,194
She's going back to Pyongyang tonight.

1028
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:55,238
Yes.

1029
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:56,322
Sea.

1030
01:07:57,323 --> 01:07:59,242
Please hold, Lieutenant Commander Cho.

1031
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:00,743
Ri Jeong Hyeok is saying something.

1032
01:08:02,245 --> 01:08:03,371
Sunlight.

1033
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:05,290
Azalea.

1034
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:07,250
Dewdrop.

1035
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:09,168
Fleecy cloud.

1036
01:08:10,378 --> 01:08:11,546
Calico cat.

1037
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:14,382
SUNLIGHT, AZALEA, DEWDROP,
FLEECY CLOUD, CALICO CAT

1038
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:15,967
What is he saying?

1039
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:19,012
I am not sure.

1040
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:22,015
It sounds like a secret code.

1041
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:23,266
Kite.

1042
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:26,894
Maybe not.

1043
01:08:28,313 --> 01:08:29,689
I take the kite back.

1044
01:08:30,565 --> 01:08:32,525
HE TOOK THE KITE BACK

1045
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:38,072
Rose.

1046
01:08:39,157 --> 01:08:40,366
Breeze.

1047
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:42,368
First snow.

1048
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:50,335
Piano.

1049
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:20,990
Ri Jeong Hyeok is a loser.

1050
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:23,451
He told us to come and protect you.

1051
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:24,661
I am not a child!

1052
01:09:24,744 --> 01:09:26,913
-He wanted us to keep watch.
-He is over-the-top.

1053
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:29,624
It's not like Captain Ri is
an immoral man who would be doing this

1054
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:31,501
when he's engaged to someone else.

1055
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:34,295
Go and take her down a peg.

1056
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:36,381
I can do that no matter how I dress.

1057
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:39,759
I should check
if she really is in Division 11.

1058
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,056
This is Se-ri one.

1059
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:47,183
There's a suspicious transmission
from Mount Janam.

1060
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:49,852
What are you thinking?
What are going to do?

1061
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:52,230
