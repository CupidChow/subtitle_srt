1
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,970
ALL CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND BACKGROUND ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,351
We need to get out of here now.

3
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,311
Oh, no.

4
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,159
Are you hurt?

5
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:40,702
No.

6
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,203
What about you?

7
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:11,733
Jeong Hyeok.

8
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,863
Oh, no. Wake up.

9
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:20,742
What do I do? Jeong Hyeok.

10
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,454
Gwang Beom, are you all right?

11
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:26,915
Captain Ri.

12
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,709
-Captain Ri.
-What do we do?

13
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,503
We need to leave now.
Your flight is leaving soon.

14
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,797
Oh, right. I don't have time.

15
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,801
Gwang Beom, give me the car key.

16
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,221
-What?
-You're injured too.

17
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:45,099
You can't drive with your leg injured.
Give me the car key now!

18
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:46,935
Come on.

19
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,116
SUNAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
SARIWON

20
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,452
Is there a hospital there?

21
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:07,080
What are you talking about?
You need to go to the airport.

22
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,039
Answer me!

23
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,376
There's a hospital in Sariwon, but...

24
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:21,094
Don't do this. Go to the airport first,
and we'll take care of--

25
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,221
What if he dies before that?

26
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:30,478
Which direction now?
Hurry. We don't have much time.

27
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,231
Turn left.

28
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,821
He might end up dying in a car accident,
not the gunshot.

29
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,663
UNDER CONSTRUCTION

30
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:52,083
What do we do? It will take a long time
if we take a detour.

31
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,716
-Gwang Beom.
-Yes.

32
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,759
Do you know what my favorite movie is?

33
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,012
Pardon?

34
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,889
Mad Max: Fury Road.

35
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,182
What?

36
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:24,949
EMERGENCY ROOM

37
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,492
PEOPLE'S HOSPITAL OF SARIWON

38
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,078
EMERGENCY ROOM

39
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,458
Blood pressure, 70 over 50.
He's unconscious.

40
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,959
He's losing a lot of blood.

41
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,837
It's a hemorrhagic shock.
He might have a cardiac arrest.

42
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,923
Press the wound with gauze
and use vasopressors.

43
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,633
-Get ready for surgery.
-Yes, Doctor.

44
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,887
Se-ri, you can go now.

45
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,306
If you hurry now,
you can make it before the flight leaves.

46
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:51,642
He's losing a lot of blood, so we need
extra blood for blood transfusion.

47
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:54,270
We don't have it in our hospital,
so find it. It's an emergency.

48
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:55,938
Pardon?

49
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,982
What?

50
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,734
We need to find blood?

51
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,153
It looks like they don't have blood.

52
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,822
Then what do we do? A person is dying.

53
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,450
-She said it's an emergency.
-I wish I could give my blood,

54
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,911
but my blood type doesn't match his.

55
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,914
Blood type?

56
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,458
-What's Jeong Hyeok's blood type?
-O.

57
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,835
O? I can give him mine.

58
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,963
Se-ri. If you don't go now,
you won't ever be able to go.

59
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,220
Attention.

60
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:31,641
When I call your name,
take your passport and get on board.

61
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:36,813
As soon as you get on board,
you must give me back your passports.

62
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,399
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

63
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:41,734
-Kim Seon Suk.
-Yes.

64
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,404
-Ra Yeong Sil.
-Yes.

65
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,324
-Kim Jeong Sun.
-Yes.

66
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,078
Coach.

67
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,288
About the reserve player.

68
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,583
The one from the General Political Bureau.

69
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,627
-Right.
-She hasn't come yet.

70
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,213
And we can't reach
Captain Ri Jeong Hyeok either.

71
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,538
She hasn't come yet, right?

72
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,207
You said she took off.

73
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,669
Did Lieutenant Cho Cheol Gang stop her?

74
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,963
I told you.

75
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,382
That man is good.

76
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,844
I get he's good, but where did he...

77
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,305
Where did he send her?

78
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,599
Hurry and contact Cho Cheol Gang.

79
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,601
How are those who got shot?

80
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:59,270
They didn't get shot
on important body parts or bones.

81
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,438
If it was purposely done,

82
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,441
the only explanation to it is
that the gunner has excellent techniques.

83
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,320
Where is Ri Jeong Hyeok?

84
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,530
I just asked Company Five about him,

85
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,241
and they told me he went away
to attend a workshop.

86
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,244
A workshop?
At the General Staff Department?

87
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,580
Yes. They say
that is why he went to Pyongyang.

88
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,956
Call the headquarters.

89
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,125
-Look into his whereabouts.
-Yes, sir.

90
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,628
-Seize Company Five's firearms logbook.
-Yes, sir.

91
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,923
Please wait here.

92
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:42,897
Se-ri.

93
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:44,899
Gwang Beom.

94
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,488
We don't know

95
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,199
how the surgery will go.

96
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,786
Don't you think we should
call Jeong Hyeok's family?

97
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:00,248
Captain Ri's phone is broken.

98
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,172
Okay.

99
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,509
You should go on
and get the rest of the treatment.

100
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,010
I'll stay here.

101
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:28,901
OPERATING ROOM

102
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,567
Why don't we get our photo taken?

103
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,735
I mean,

104
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,947
we won't see each other again
after I leave. It will be a memento.

105
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,116
There is no need for us to remember

106
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,452
or keep a memento of each other.

107
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:20,786
Look at you.

108
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,002
After acting all arrogant...

109
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,589
What a weirdo.

110
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,642
-Tweezers.
-Tweezers.

111
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,898
Attach the styptic gauze.

112
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,443
Plasma injection.

113
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,030
Administer urokinase

114
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,115
-and general antibiotics.
-Okay.

115
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,577
Tweezers.

116
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,251
OPERATING ROOM

117
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:12,963
Be careful.

118
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,300
The surgery went well.

119
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,762
I was worried
his main artery might have been damaged,

120
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,639
but luckily, that wasn't the case.

121
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,184
Still, he has lost a lot of blood.
His blood pressure is yet to rise

122
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,520
and he must watch out
for tetanus and blood poisoning.

123
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,896
Above all,

124
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,898
he must regain his consciousness soon.

125
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,067
Let's see how it goes.

126
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:35,903
Thank you.

127
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:42,535
PEOPLE'S HOSPITAL OF SARIWON

128
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,501
Jeong Hyeok.

129
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,800
I am not

130
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,219
used to things like this.

131
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:03,973
I have been only

132
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:09,395
loving myself and hating myself.

133
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,399
And I have been only protecting myself

134
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,818
and abandoning myself.

135
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,239
All I had was myself.

136
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,450
I had nobody else.

137
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,663
So this is awkward for me.

138
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,376
Having someone else

139
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,629
that is not myself.

140
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,091
You looked at me,

141
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,927
listened to me,

142
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:44,930
smiled at me,

143
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,266
ate with me,

144
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,102
kept the promise with me

145
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,522
even if we didn't make any contract,

146
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,151
and protected me.

147
00:12:58,986 --> 00:12:59,987
You did...

148
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,159
all...

149
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,952
those things.

150
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,330
All along,

151
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,375
I had you by my side.

152
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,715
Usually,

153
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:22,426
I don't

154
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,262
get scared,

155
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,477
but now I'm a bit scared.

156
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,940
I'm scared something might happen to you.

157
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,152
Does this mean

158
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,572
you have become

159
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,535
a special person to me?

160
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,458
Jeong Hyeok.

161
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,252
I got an urgent message for you
from your family in Pyongyang.

162
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,213
Your brother

163
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,175
died of an accident.

164
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,386
You must hurry back to your country now.

165
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,674
Is that your piano?

166
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,636
Can you play the piano?

167
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,432
Could you please play it for me?

168
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:26,443
This might be my last time
playing the piano.

169
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,820
Why?

170
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,322
Well...

171
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:39,164
I wrote a song for my brother.

172
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:47,756
Would you be my last audience?

173
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,261
Jeong Hyeok.

174
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:02,349
Well done. You did well.
I'm so proud of you.

175
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,268
Are you all right?

176
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,811
Why are you here...

177
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,190
Don't talk yet. You just woke up
from general anesthesia.

178
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,108
Later.

179
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,030
You shouldn't sit up now.

180
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,957
Did you

181
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,252
not take the flight?

182
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,214
I couldn't take the flight.

183
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,593
Why?

184
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:39,595
Well...

185
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,390
I couldn't go because of the situation.

186
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,979
You should have gone.

187
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:50,814
I know.

188
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,859
I should have,

189
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,530
but I couldn't.

190
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,200
-Listen to--
-Just to send you back home,

191
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,244
we all risked our lives.

192
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,915
Do you know what that means?

193
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,625
I do.

194
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,252
If you do, why are you still here?

195
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,922
You made all that effort
go down the drain.

196
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:24,097
How much more do you have to
trouble us until you feel sorry?

197
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,315
It seems the anesthesia
hasn't completely worn off yet.

198
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,068
And that's probably why

199
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,612
you're showing your true feelings.

200
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,743
The doctor said you needed
a complete rest.

201
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,079
I don't want you to upset you,

202
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,539
so I will leave for now.

203
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:53,919
When you feel better later,
you can get mad at me then.

204
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,296
RI JEONG HYEOK

205
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,689
The patient woke up. Please check on him.

206
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,150
I see. I will let the doctor know...

207
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:23,782
The wound is clean
and there's no bloody discharge.

208
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,242
Despite a lot of blood loss,

209
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,744
your blood pressure has risen
thanks to the blood you received.

210
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,705
You're very lucky.

211
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,583
Still, avoid too much exercise.

212
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,211
You need to be treated well
for the next 15 days.

213
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,632
You and your girlfriend must be
meant to be.

214
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,884
Luckily, your blood types matched.

215
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,928
If she didn't give you her blood,

216
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,014
-you could have been in big trouble.
-She's right.

217
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,517
I told her she would faint
if she cried after giving her blood away,

218
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,145
but she cried the whole day.

219
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,689
-Where did she go?
-Before he woke up,

220
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,232
she cried because he didn't wake up.

221
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,276
After he woke up,
she cried because he woke up.

222
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:00,861
Is that so?

223
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,322
Please rest well.

224
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,826
Maybe she's crying again somewhere.

225
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,184
I wish

226
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,812
I could go somewhere,

227
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,315
but I don't have a car

228
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,026
nor a place to go.

229
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,529
How pathetic.

230
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,498
Have you lost your mind?

231
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,209
You can't move just yet.

232
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:00,087
It's cold. Do you want to catch a cold?

233
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,172
It's not your place to worry about me.

234
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,217
You got shot by a gun today.

235
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,510
Seriously.

236
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,889
Hold onto me. Let's go in.

237
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:12,808
I didn't mean

238
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,435
what I said earlier.

239
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,564
I'm sorry I was harsh to you.

240
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,151
Okay.

241
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:28,782
Fine. I accept your apology.

242
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,325
You're not dead.

243
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,453
I'm just thankful that you're alive.

244
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:36,456
Compared to that,
forgiving you is nothing.

245
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,209
Now hold onto me. Let's get in.

246
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,548
What is it?

247
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,884
You wanted to go home so badly.

248
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,596
You should have just left.

249
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,017
I wanted to,

250
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,647
but I couldn't. I told you.

251
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,858
For once,

252
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,528
I had to protect you too.

253
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:15,245
Stop looking at me with such wistful eyes.

254
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,205
Don't misunderstand me.

255
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,417
-I'm just looking.
-No, you're not.

256
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:25,046
For a second,
your eyes were so very wistful.

257
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,468
See?

258
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:33,054
Even now, you're looking at me
with those wistful eyes.

259
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,512
FIREARMS LOGBOOK

260
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,224
CAPTAIN RI JEONG HYEOK

261
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:21,228
The man in the shootout must be him.

262
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:26,107
Seeing that hasn't made it back yet,
he must be suffering from an injury.

263
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,402
From this moment forward,
everyone at the switchboard

264
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:30,820
will be on emergency standby.

265
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,031
-Yes, sir.
-Call every hospital

266
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:36,159
that is within a radius of 20km
of the place of the gunfight.

267
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,578
Call all the hospitals
and doctors' offices

268
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,580
-in even tiny villages.
-Yes, sir.

269
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,374
-Hello?
-Is this...

270
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,042
Is this the emergency room in Songnim?

271
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:47,379
Do you have a patient
called Captain Ri Jeong Hyeok?

272
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,130
Okay.

273
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,216
Is there a patient named
Ri Jeong Hyeok there?

274
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,218
Is this People's Hospital of Pungdeok-ri?

275
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,011
This is Unit 527.

276
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,805
Why won't take pick up the phone?

277
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,061
MR. RI

278
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,567
The person you have reached
is not available.

279
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,321
Why won't he pick up the phone?

280
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,784
The person you have reached
is not available.

281
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,289
What happened?
Did you meet Cho Cheol Gang?

282
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,583
-Yes.
-Where is Yoon Se-ri?

283
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,710
He said he didn't know either.

284
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,878
What are you talking about?

285
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,047
They mobilized a truck corps
to stop her, but--

286
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,466
A truck corps? Is there such a corps?

287
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,427
There's no such a corps.

288
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:38,388
They're Cho Cheol Kang's private troops.

289
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:43,476
So did they make
a car accident or something?

290
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,270
-With the trucks?
-Yes.

291
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,732
But apparently, Yoon Se-ri disappeared.

292
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,609
Disappeared?

293
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,236
Cho is looking for her.
I'm sure he'll find her soon.

294
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:58,074
How could you make a car accident?
You could have hurt her.

295
00:26:58,658 --> 00:26:59,659
Hey.

296
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,579
Wasn't our goal to keep her
from going back to South Korea

297
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:03,913
no matter what happens to her?

298
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,040
Are you saying

299
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,667
you don't mind killing her?

300
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:10,587
I thought we didn't mind that.

301
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,301
You must be busy.

302
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:18,762
What?

303
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:21,431
You want to be human
while being a con man.

304
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,475
I'm sure you're busy.

305
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,024
Oh, my.

306
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:33,818
Who is that?

307
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,702
That's the bitch from earlier.

308
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,705
Sam Suk has just left,

309
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:48,375
and there she enters,
as if she's been waiting.

310
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,542
I will bring tears

311
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:52,045
to that bitch's eyes.

312
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,925
Looking at her mother's face,
that might be hard.

313
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:58,885
Then?

314
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:02,764
Make her show us respect. That's enough.

315
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:09,979
I heard

316
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,899
the head of the village was here.

317
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,152
She just came,
and she's talking informally.

318
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:26,037
That's me. Who are you?

319
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:33,211
I'm the mother of the fiancée
of Captain Ri Jeong Hyeok

320
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:36,881
of the frontline unit.

321
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,300
I'm thinking of getting an apartment here.

322
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,427
That would be difficult.

323
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:44,514
Why is it difficult?

324
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:47,767
It's difficult
because there's no empty place.

325
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:51,604
I know the tall apartment building
at the entrance of the village is empty.

326
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,398
I heard all about it.

327
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:54,691
By the way,

328
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:59,612
you seem way younger than me.

329
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:02,449
Is that how you show respect
to the elderly?

330
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:07,537
Let's just go.
We can find a place elsewhere.

331
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,206
-Let go of me.
-I didn't hold you.

332
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:18,006
I know that you're uneducated,
but this is just outrageous.

333
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:21,176
You're supposed to be kind to strangers.

334
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:24,137
What's with this attitude?

335
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,638
I don't get what you're saying.

336
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,100
What's with all the fuss?

337
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:33,938
Who are you?

338
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:42,322
I'm the wife of the Senior Colonel,

339
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:44,407
who is the boss

340
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,035
of Captain Ri Jeong Hyeok.

341
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,125
I didn't expect to see
such a noble person on the street.

342
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,003
Dan, come on and say hello to her.

343
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:05,428
How about we drop all this
and have a peaceful conversation

344
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:08,848
over a glass of juice? What do you say?

345
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,475
We don't need juice.

346
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,394
Just tell us why you need an apartment.

347
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,525
My daughter is marrying Captain Ri soon.

348
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,194
So I'm here to find them an apartment.

349
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,198
I see.

350
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,992
-However--
-Oh, right.

351
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,453
Look at me, being all forgetful.

352
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:35,625
I'm running a department store
in Pyongyang.

353
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,294
That's probably

354
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:43,466
why I have these things in my bag.

355
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:44,968
They're so heavy.

356
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,390
Next time I come,

357
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:54,644
I will make sure to bring more things
that you might need.

358
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:00,608
Here's one more for you.

359
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:05,864
This is where my aunt lives,

360
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:09,534
so I know very well about this place.
Why don't you go up and take a look?

361
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:11,828
Please.

362
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:19,043
After all, a marriage has to be
consented by both families.

363
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:25,925
Usually, it doesn't hurt
to listen to your parents.

364
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,344
-Right?
-I learned that from my experience.

365
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,555
-Right?
-I agree.

366
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,224
Let's go.

367
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:37,437
All the rooms
in this tall apartment building

368
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,607
has open mountain views.

369
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,066
The location is excellent too.

370
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,110
Water in the back
and mountains in the front.

371
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:46,321
-It's the other way round.
-Right, yes.

372
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:50,325
All the key facilities in the village
are only five minutes away by foot.

373
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,786
Thank you. This way, please.

374
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,331
She got two.

375
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,166
Welcome.

376
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,339
Which floor are you going to?

377
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,883
Comrade Operator. Fifth floor, please.

378
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,552
The fifth floor is the perfect floor.

379
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:19,062
Does it stop often?

380
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,275
This is why I said it's the perfect floor.

381
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,945
A person I know lives on the 17th floor,

382
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:30,281
and said when there's a blackout,
he couldn't walk up all the stairs

383
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,909
so he went back to the camp
and slept there.

384
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,036
No wonder. The 17th floor is very high.

385
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,412
-It is indeed.
-For sure.

386
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,414
Five floors are walkable.

387
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:41,000
Let's pull the doors open together.

388
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,585
Don't worry.

389
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,050
Come up.

390
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,553
-The door opens really smoothly.
-Hold my hand.

391
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:54,305
Come on.

392
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,224
Don't worry.

393
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,309
-Come on.
-Come on out.

394
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,561
Come on. There you go.

395
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,439
Look at the European-style wallpaper.

396
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,316
Isn't it just the ultimate luxury?

397
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:09,696
The landlord graduated
Pyongyang University of Fine Arts.

398
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,990
That's probably why this apartment is
so gorgeous.

399
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,199
-That's right.
-Right?

400
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:17,078
Oh, my. Isn't this the famous Sung fridge?

401
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,831
It's a perfect size. I love it.

402
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,628
It's a perfect size to keep books inside.

403
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,464
In the bottom shelves,
you can put your clothes.

404
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,427
The electricity isn't stable,

405
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,596
so fridges are often just for decoration.

406
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:39,767
It must be very convenient
to store things.

407
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,144
-Right?
-For sure.

408
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:47,900
Goodness. I haven't seen you
since you were a baby.

409
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:52,363
-You're all grown up now.
-I mean, do they raise a goat in here?

410
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,699
It's an eco-friendly way
of using the space.

411
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:57,368
I'm sure you haven't
even imagined this in Pyongyang.

412
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:00,329
My aunt is raising it

413
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:03,374
so she can throw a party
when her son goes to college.

414
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,085
But I don't think he's smart enough.

415
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,421
-Oh, my.
-Hey.

416
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:10,715
Parents can't force their kids to study.

417
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:13,551
-That's true.
-That boy needs to be beaten up.

418
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,388
The goat has grown
into a perfect size to eat.

419
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:31,110
They raise chickens too?

420
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,029
We all raise chickens on the terrace.

421
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,573
Where do you raise chickens
in Pyongyang then?

422
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,451
Oh, my. Eggs.

423
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:40,453
Well done.

424
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,414
Mom.

425
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,542
-Do you want to continue the tour?
-Why?

426
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:49,670
-I'll go to Jeong Hyeok.
-Okay, sure.

427
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:51,923
Gosh, what was that?

428
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,720
The person you have reached
is not available.

429
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,683
Could something have happened for real?

430
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,491
What? What is she doing here?

431
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,352
Goodness!

432
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,729
What are you doing here?

433
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,274
That's my question.
What are you doing, Ms. Seo Dan?

434
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:55,027
Oh, right. You came to this village
when I gave you a ride last time.

435
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,904
Why did you come here again?

436
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,032
-This is where my fiancé lives.
-Fiancé?

437
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,868
-This is?
-What's wrong?

438
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:06,038
Well, I know this house too.

439
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,499
Are you saying you know Ri Jeong Hyeok?

440
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,251
Right. Mr. Ri.

441
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,546
I'm also waiting for him now.
He's not home.

442
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,924
If you like, you can wait for him
in my car. It's cold.

443
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,262
You look better with your hair down.

444
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,055
I mean, I saw you.

445
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:27,226
You look better with your hair down.

446
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,021
I'm not sure

447
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,357
what you're talking about.

448
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:36,819
I'm sure you know.

449
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:58,674
You have no fever.

450
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,302
But why is your face so red?

451
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,096
No, it's not.

452
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,808
It's red. Did you something
you're not supposed to see?

453
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,688
Well, I'm the one who saw something
I'm not supposed to see.

454
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,398
Last night,

455
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:20,071
I saw two people having a deep kiss
out there in the dark.

456
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,616
The world must be near its end.

457
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,285
It was in the middle of the night.
How vulgar is that?

458
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,620
Everyone is asleep at that hour.

459
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:30,456
When everyone is asleep,
they should be asleep too.

460
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:32,959
Why did they have to come out
in the rain and do that?

461
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,878
I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

462
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:39,382
I'm the one who saw it,
and I say it was bad. What do you know?

463
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,135
Why is your blood pressure rising?

464
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:46,055
Your pulse is fast too.

465
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,723
I'm okay.

466
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,768
No, you're not.
You're supposed to take a complete rest.

467
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,646
I'll tell the doctor about it.

468
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,618
What did you say?

469
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:09,787
I didn't say anything.

470
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:13,582
You didn't.

471
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:16,627
I didn't.

472
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:21,465
What are you doing, by the way?

473
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:26,470
You got a hole in your uniform.
Because of the gunshot.

474
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,557
I washed it to get the blood off.

475
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,268
I'll make sure to sew it up nicely.

476
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:33,936
I may not look like it,

477
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:38,733
but I have the Asian fashion industry
in the palm of my hand.

478
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:52,788
Now, we have three options.

479
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,081
Number one.

480
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,209
Pretend nothing happened last night
and act like before.

481
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,003
Number two.

482
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:02,840
Act as if nothing happened last night
and never talk about it.

483
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:06,302
-Aren't they the same?
-They're slightly different.

484
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:08,512
What's number three?

485
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,099
Honestly, it's not like we are teenagers.

486
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,894
Don't pressure each other
over such a trivial thing.

487
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,188
Is that also slightly different?

488
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,315
Of course it is.

489
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,442
Let's go with number three.

490
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:27,073
-You want to go with number three?
-Yes.

491
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,162
It looks like what happened last night
is pressuring you a lot.

492
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,999
-You told me to choose one, so--
-Right. I did say that.

493
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,211
You made a good choice.

494
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:43,923
But anyway,
it means you did feel pressure, right?

495
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,760
I understand though.
Yesterday, you got shot,

496
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,638
you got surgery,
you were still under anesthesia,

497
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:55,017
it was pouring, and I was crying.

498
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,769
So you probably did it on impulse.

499
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,980
I understand.

500
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,692
-But--
-I'm not giving you any pressure.

501
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:04,860
I hate that.

502
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,696
Such a minor physical contact
is not that big a deal to me.

503
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,240
Let's both be cool about it.

504
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,038
I will return the sewing box.

505
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:44,984
Se-ri.

506
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:49,989
How did you come here?

507
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:52,283
Because we heard the sad news, obviously.

508
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,869
We made up an excuse,
so we should bring some cement back.

509
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,329
Is Captain Ri all right?

510
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,790
I was so surprised to hear about him.

511
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,251
He's okay now. Don't worry.

512
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:06,714
The sadder news is that
you didn't leave, again.

513
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,966
To us, it's devastating news.

514
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:13,012
He may say so, but when he heard the news,
he was very worried about you.

515
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:16,557
Is that true?

516
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:18,350
Worry, my foot.

517
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,896
We brought some food.

518
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:25,149
That's good. This hospital gives rice
without side dishes.

519
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:27,109
It's up to the patients' to make them.

520
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:30,154
I bought some things
and made a lunchbox earlier.

521
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,323
What is "lunchbox"?

522
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:33,282
A packed lunch.

523
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:34,867
I see.

524
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,077
Did you make it yourself?

525
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,329
Yes.

526
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:40,664
Did you make the patient eat it?

527
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,333
That's right.

528
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:45,920
Gosh, it must have been

529
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,631
as lethal as a bomb.

530
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,216
Let's go.

531
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:54,428
She should have been more considerate
of the patient.

532
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,641
He fell asleep!

533
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,435
He was awake just now.

534
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,525
Captain Ri looks very pale.

535
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,360
Are you sure he is recovering?

536
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:14,281
It's strange to see someone so spirited
lying on a bed.

537
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,034
He looks a bit different, doesn't he?

538
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:19,745
He doesn't look different at all.

539
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:21,205
He does.

540
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:22,957
How did he get shot?

541
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,209
He shouldn't have pretended to be agile.

542
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,086
Don't say that.

543
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:29,505
He must be flustered to be bedridden.

544
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,298
Embarrassed is more like it.

545
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,509
-Hey.
-He got shot during operation.

546
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:35,386
Weren't you listening earlier?

547
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,221
He was trying to protect me.

548
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:39,557
He got shot in my stead.

549
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:43,185
He couldn't dodge the bullet.

550
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,603
-I see.
-I see.

551
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,522
I wouldn't say he got shot in your stead.

552
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:50,109
We can't rule out that possibility
that Captain Ri failed

553
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:52,444
to dodge the bullet
because it was too fast.

554
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:54,196
We know how it is.

555
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,115
The real life isn't like a movie.

556
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:58,784
You can't dodge a bullet.

557
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,375
Thank you for coming.

558
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:07,835
You should get going now.

559
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,254
But we came a long way.

560
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:13,048
-Do you have a soft drink?
-Stop talking nonsense

561
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,967
-and go.
-Hey, don't push me.

562
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,260
Take care.

563
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,678
We will come again.

564
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,764
Take care. Bye.

565
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,232
Open your eyes.

566
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:33,193
Why would you pretend to be asleep?

567
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,486
You are such a bad actor.

568
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,077
Did they leave?

569
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,829
Of course they did.

570
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:48,167
I am too ashamed to face them.

571
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,421
Tell me.

572
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,465
Did you fail to dodge?

573
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:01,764
Did you?

574
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,353
I didn't try to dodge.

575
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:11,607
-Why not?
-Had I dodged, you would have gotten shot.

576
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:18,614
I am touched.

577
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:20,866
It's like a movie.

578
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:24,370
But don't do that from now on.

579
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,164
I doubt we will face
such a situation again.

580
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:30,417
Even if we do,

581
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:33,379
don't even try to look cool

582
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:34,963
and dodge.

583
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,466
The same goes for you.

584
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:42,346
If something like this happens again,
don't stay behind because of me.

585
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:43,681
Just go.

586
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,600
You always have to have the last word.

587
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,185
I mean it.

588
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:52,272
To think that you could have gone back
to Seoul

589
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,192
makes my heart ache.

590
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:58,112
Of course I have a back-up plan.

591
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:01,323
Gu Seung-jun promised
to send my regards to my family.

592
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:04,702
I am sure that they know
I am alive by now.

593
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,216
It's cold.

594
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,596
What's the name of the game?

595
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,265
Boy General.

596
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:28,308
Is it fun?

597
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:31,019
Let me play it once.

598
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:33,897
Seo Dan, how old are you?

599
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,482
You are so small-minded.

600
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,068
What was the name of the game?
I will download it.

601
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:39,862
-You can't download it.
-Sure I can.

602
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:41,530
It must be on the App Store.

603
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:43,449
Cellphones here don't have such a thing.

604
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:45,117
When you go to Pyongyang,

605
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:48,287
go to the App Market
and ask them to download it.

606
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:49,830
App, what?

607
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,790
App Market.

608
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:54,918
It's at Bongsa Market at Pyongyang.

609
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,211
No way.

610
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,756
Do I need to buy an app
at an actual market?

611
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,133
How many times do you need to ask?

612
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:02,426
Let me concentrate.

613
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:05,012
Weren't you

614
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:07,055
waiting for your fiancé?

615
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:10,642
I guess you aren't worried about
being unable to reach him.

616
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:13,145
This isn't time to concentrate on a game.

617
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:16,148
I didn't concentrate on it.

618
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:17,733
Aren't you hungry?

619
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:18,901
I am.

620
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:21,737
Why don't we go and have some noodles?

621
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,322
Noodles, my foot.

622
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,546
By the way, how did you meet your fiancé?

623
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:42,549
The decision was made a long time ago.

624
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:44,593
I see. It's an arranged marriage.

625
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:45,677
Yes.

626
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:48,555
Did you set the wedding date?

627
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:50,933
It's next month.

628
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:53,143
But your fiancé goes to the hotel
with another woman.

629
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:57,773
It's not like that.
They use separate rooms.

630
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:59,066
They do everything separately.

631
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:01,610
They are carrying out a secret operation.

632
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:03,987
-Did he confess his love to you?
-He...

633
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:08,116
Well,

634
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:10,244
we will get married soon.

635
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,328
Hey, come on.

636
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:15,290
I told you on the rooftop that I seem to
have a few things to teach you.

637
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,125
Listen carefully.

638
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:19,044
It might sound coldhearted,

639
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:22,965
but it's hard for you and your fiancé
to feel a romantic attraction.

640
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,844
-Why not?
-The ending is marriage.

641
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:28,679
What about it?

642
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:30,764
You are suddenly talking down to me.
In any case,

643
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,558
The very reason one gets the butterflies

644
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,768
is because one knows not
how things will end.

645
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,436
Will we continue to date? Will we part?

646
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,230
Will I get turned down? Will we be happy?

647
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:40,232
We have no way of knowing!

648
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:41,942
You need to be curious and anxious.

649
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:44,611
Your heart needs to beat fast
to feel a romantic attraction.

650
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,323
You think it's impossible
because we set the wedding date.

651
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:52,452
You should have captured his heart
before setting the wedding date.

652
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,042
Give me a bottle of soju.

653
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,377
Okay.

654
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:03,672
To set the wedding date,

655
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:05,424
couples have dinner, drink tea,

656
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:06,925
go to a movie, confess love,

657
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,552
fight, stay up all night,

658
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:11,680
break up, run toward each other,
and do all sorts of crazy things.

659
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:13,432
But you set the wedding date.

660
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,309
There is nothing to do now.

661
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:17,728
There is no excitement.

662
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:19,938
That's the downside
of an arranged marriage.

663
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,232
How do you know so well?

664
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,777
I almost had an arranged marriage.

665
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:27,779
But it fell apart.

666
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:32,659
Once that happened,
my heart began to flutter.

667
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:35,996
I couldn't stop thinking about her.

668
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:45,797
I will turn off the light.

669
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,972
Will you sleep there again?

670
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:57,559
What other choice do I have?

671
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,812
It will be cold due to the frigid air
from the floor.

672
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:03,357
Sleep here.

673
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:12,991
Should I do that?

674
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,578
It is cold down here.
I almost got a facial paralysis yesterday.

675
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:20,123
What are you doing?

676
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,545
Sleep here. I will sleep there.

677
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:27,839
Then you will be cold.

678
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:29,800
I was fine

679
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:32,052
when I slept in a hole
during the winter training.

680
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:34,054
Coldness doesn't bother me.

681
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:37,015
The situation is completely different now.
You are a patient.

682
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:43,271
Are you suggesting
that we use the same bed?

683
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,606
Don't feel uncomfortable.

684
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:45,649
This is my bed.

685
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:47,609
As I always say,

686
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:50,654
there is no need for a war
if we stay within our boundaries.

687
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:54,825
That's what I wanted to say.

688
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:21,560
Are you asleep?

689
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:28,692
Already?

690
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:35,574
How could you fall asleep
in this situation?

691
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,931
The name is Ri Jeong Hyeok.
Is there such a patient?

692
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:24,474
Are you sure he has a gunshot wound?

693
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,769
-People's Hospital of Sariwon?
-Yes, sir.

694
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:31,356
Only the First Lieutenant's name
was recorded, so it took us a while.

695
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,946
Contact the hospital.

696
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,782
-Tell them to keep an eye on him.
-Yes, sir.

697
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:05,640
GU SEUNG-JUN

698
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:30,540
Hello.

699
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:31,833
Seung-jun.

700
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:34,377
Yoon Se-ri?

701
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:37,839
I contacted Mr. Ri so many times.

702
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:38,924
Are you

703
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:40,592
okay?

704
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:43,553
I asked you for a favor the last time.

705
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,972
I asked you to give my regards
to my father.

706
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,349
How did that go?

707
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:48,683
Did you do it?

708
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:51,394
That was why I contacted Mr. Ri.

709
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:53,980
Let's talk in person.

710
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:56,066
Where are you? I will go to you.

711
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:57,525
Okay.

712
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:28,139
There you are, Captain Ri.

713
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:32,102
We searched for you everywhere.

714
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:34,312
I was so preoccupied with surgery

715
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:35,939
that I reported to the base belatedly.

716
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:39,943
That's right. We didn't get ahold
of your whereabouts until now

717
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:41,653
because of that.

718
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:43,822
Give it to me.

719
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:47,117
Get out.

720
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,038
FIREARMS LOGBOOK

721
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:54,749
It's the Records of Firearms
of the fifth company.

722
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,335
That's your signature, right?

723
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:01,047
-Yes.
-You took out

724
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,383
a nine-millimeter semi-automatic,

725
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:06,177
enough ammunition for a battle,
and a grenade launcher.

726
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:08,763
Were you preparing for a war?

727
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:10,974
The same kind of ammunition

728
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:14,102
as the one you took out was used to attack

729
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:16,354
the soldiers of the Engineer Brigade
near Sariwon.

730
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:18,189
What do you think that means?

731
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:20,150
It means I fired the shots.

732
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:28,241
Are you saying you shot
the soldiers of the Engineer Brigade

733
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:32,537
to protect a South Korean spy?

734
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:34,247
She isn't a spy.

735
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:37,334
To protect my woman,

736
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:41,588
I shot people who purposefully tried
to cause a car accident.

737
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:43,506
"Purposefully"?

738
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:45,633
How are you so certain?

739
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:47,552
Do you have any grounds?

740
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:52,307
On what grounds are you so certain
that she is a spy?

741
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,809
-That's--
-Chief Three of United Front Department

742
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:56,394
told you that, right?

743
00:55:57,937 --> 00:56:01,316
Jeong Hyeok, it's about
what you asked me a few days ago.

744
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:04,611
Apparently, Mr. Choi introduced
Lieutenant Commander Cho Cheol Gang

745
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:07,906
to Chief Three
of the United Front Department.

746
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:11,409
He asked for information on Division 11.

747
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,244
Is everything okay with you?

748
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:15,997
According to Article Three, Clause Two

749
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:20,043
of the management regulations
regarding undercover agents,

750
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:23,421
a proposal must be submitted
in order to receive personal information

751
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:25,256
regarding the special agents

752
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:27,675
of Division 11.

753
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:30,136
Did you do that?

754
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,472
Would it be okay if I request
an investigation?

755
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:37,060
Comrade Ri Jeong Hyeok.

756
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:41,064
It seems like you have a lot to say.

757
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:45,485
Let's see if you can run your mouth
at the State Security Department.

758
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:46,820
First Lieutenant.

759
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,657
Arrest Ri Jeong Hyeok.

760
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:54,411
Is the matter so pressing that you must
drag away a patient with a gunshot wound?

761
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:01,418
I can't believe this is happening!

762
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:03,670
First, the State Security Department.

763
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,256
Now, Director
of the General Political Bureau.

764
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:09,092
This is an interesting way
to start the day.

765
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:11,010
There is a rumor that the director's son

766
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,762
is in this hospital.

767
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,013
I heard the rumor, too.

768
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:16,182
It's the patient with a gunshot wound.

769
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,475
The tall and handsome one?

770
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:20,979
He is the son of the Director
of the General Political Bureau.

771
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:23,231
You wait and see.

772
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:26,192
I will marry into the family

773
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,570
and bring about the dazzling revival

774
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:30,947
of the economy of this hospital.

775
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:33,366
I think he has a girlfriend.

776
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,786
You can seduce a man with a girlfriend!

777
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,037
You can't.

778
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:41,374
Dan, what was the room number?

779
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:55,138
What are you doing? Who are you?

780
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,223
Who are you?

781
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,141
BTS.

782
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,978
I saw you watch a BTS music video.

783
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:06,900
-I am sorry.
-It's okay. I am sorry.

784
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,485
Let's just go quietly, okay?

785
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:13,198
You asked me to get the person
you recommended on the plane

786
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:14,824
as a member of the national team.

787
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:18,203
Why does the State Security Department
want to arrest you?

788
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:19,871
Honey.

789
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:22,373
Answer me right this instant!

790
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,544
Please calm down. Let's ask him later.

791
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:28,046
Stay out of this!

792
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,759
What kind of trouble are you scheming?

793
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,677
If you make a wrong move,

794
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:37,639
so many people will use it against me
and take me down.

795
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,475
Despite being my one remaining son--

796
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:43,102
Don't tell me
to stay out of my own son's business!

797
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:44,771
He got shot.

798
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:46,648
He almost died.

799
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:48,483
He is our one remaining son.

800
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:51,277
We should be thankful

801
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:53,488
that he called us to a hospital,
not a funeral house.

802
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:55,740
We should be proud that he is alive!

803
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,954
You should ask him if he is hurt
and console him.

804
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:02,872
Why do you keep cornering him?

805
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:06,167
You should side with him,
not the State Security Department.

806
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:11,506
Jeong Hyeok!

807
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:14,509
My goodness, Jeong Hyeok!

808
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:16,678
Let me get a good look at you.

809
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:25,353
Your limbs are intact.

810
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:29,274
How did this nonsense happen?

811
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:30,608
How did he get shot?

812
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:35,113
I don't know
if he should continue being a soldier.

813
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:38,658
Mom, whatever you want to say,
I don't think--

814
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:41,119
Before something worse happens,

815
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:44,330
he should change his job.

816
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:49,168
There shouldn't be another widow
in my household besides me.

817
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:52,880
Wasn't Jeong Hyeok pursuing the arts?

818
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:57,677
Thanks to his mother who was an actress,
he has good looks.

819
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,637
He was born with artistic skills.

820
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:01,639
Because of that,

821
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:04,601
I wanted my daughter to marry
the second son, not the first son.

822
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,227
Mom, please!

823
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:09,439
I apologize.

824
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:11,983
Mother is this way because she is shocked.

825
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:12,942
That's right.

826
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:15,403
I was shocked beyond belief.

827
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:18,072
I did a disservice to everyone.

828
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:19,824
I apologize.

829
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:22,118
As you can see, the surgery went well.

830
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:23,786
I simply need to recover.

831
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:25,330
Please don't worry.

832
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,765
Let's go.

833
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:47,894
PEOPLE'S HOSPITAL OF SARIWON

834
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:02,617
Thank you. You can sit down.

835
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,453
By the way, how are you so good
with the Seoul accent?

836
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,706
I watch the dramas and copy the accent,

837
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:11,376
-but it's hard.
-I picked it up

838
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:13,127
because I heard and used it a lot.

839
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:14,170
I see.

840
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:16,130
Sticking to the basics is the key.

841
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:21,302
I am the biggest ARMY of Pyongyang,
Hyun Min Ji.

842
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,471
It's nice to meet you.

843
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:27,058
Who is your favorite member?

844
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,519
-What?
-For me, it's Jungkook.

845
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:30,520
He is so charming!

846
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:33,064
How about you?
Who is your favorite member?

847
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:34,774
For me,

848
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:37,443
it's Ri Jeong Hyeok.

849
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:39,112
What?

850
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:41,155
He is so charming.

851
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:42,657
He is my favorite.

852
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:49,497
Bye.

853
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:55,920
Bye.

854
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:04,303
She's so cool.

855
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:13,688
I guess someone's been looking after you.

856
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:16,023
Who is it?

857
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:22,447
It's the person you're thinking of.

858
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:25,158
You said she's your partner
in your operation.

859
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,243
Is she your caregiver too?

860
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:30,830
Dan.

861
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:33,291
There's something I must tell you.

862
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:36,627
I never intended to fool you,

863
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:39,964
but things ended up happening that way.

864
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:41,591
What do you mean?

865
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:49,891
You see,

866
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:53,269
I like that woman.

867
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:56,647
I have feelings for her.

868
01:02:58,357 --> 01:02:59,859
You think you fooled me?

869
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:04,947
No. I didn't fall for your lie,
so you can't say you fooled me.

870
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:06,282
I was never fooled by you.

871
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:09,660
I thought I could marry you
even if I had no feelings for you,

872
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:13,581
but I don't think we can get married

873
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:15,958
if I have feelings for someone else.

874
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:20,713
I heard she's going to leave soon.

875
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:23,257
Is it not true?

876
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:26,511
-It is true.
-That's the reason.

877
01:03:27,261 --> 01:03:28,346
Don't you see it?

878
01:03:29,096 --> 01:03:31,557
You're sad because she's leaving soon.

879
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,684
You're afraid you may never see her again.

880
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:35,603
That's why your heart is fluttering.

881
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:38,105
You're deluding yourself
into thinking that is love.

882
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:40,274
I'm not deluding myself--

883
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:42,443
Our wedding date is set,
so you don't feel thrilled.

884
01:03:43,027 --> 01:03:44,445
I don't make your heart flutter.

885
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:47,031
This is what happens
with arranged marriages.

886
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:50,201
Dan, what are you talking about?

887
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:51,327
Anyway...

888
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:54,914
As for our wedding, nothing will change.

889
01:03:56,457 --> 01:03:58,334
You have feelings for her?

890
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:00,670
Sure, go ahead and like her.

891
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:02,964
When she leaves, those "feelings"

892
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:05,007
will all be gone.

893
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:24,485
Those stupid feelings will all be gone.

894
01:04:29,156 --> 01:04:32,410
You're already done?
You can stay longer and chat more.

895
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:35,746
Mom, my wedding dress.

896
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:36,706
What?

897
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:39,876
Let's go and get my wedding dress.

898
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:41,836
We should get ready for my wedding.

899
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:42,837
Right, let's go.

900
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:49,135
Thank you.

901
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:52,805
I couldn't really stay there.

902
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:54,223
Why not?

903
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:55,933
Well...

904
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:58,477
I had a bit of a situation.

905
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:02,023
By the way, where are we going?

906
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:06,444
Oh, it's where I usually stay
when I'm here.

907
01:05:06,527 --> 01:05:10,031
I figured you probably haven't eaten
or even had a chance to wash up.

908
01:05:10,114 --> 01:05:12,408
You can eat some good food and rest up.

909
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:15,161
-What kind of place is this?
-You'll see.

910
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:22,793
My gosh, what is this fancy mansion?

911
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:24,670
What?

912
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:26,714
You're Chairman Yoon's only daughter.

913
01:05:26,797 --> 01:05:28,007
You're impressed by this?

914
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,342
First, tell me.

915
01:05:29,842 --> 01:05:31,052
Did you contact my family?

916
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,637
Have a seat first.

917
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:38,643
-Did you contact them?
-We can't call a Korean number from here.

918
01:05:39,226 --> 01:05:40,937
But it seemed urgent,

919
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,481
so I contacted them through my friend
who's abroad.

920
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:45,983
-And?
-What do you think?

921
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:48,069
They're over the moon happy
that you're alive.

922
01:05:48,152 --> 01:05:50,905
Really? Who? My mom? My dad?

923
01:05:50,988 --> 01:05:52,865
All of them, I heard.

924
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:56,243
Everyone from your parents to brothers
are so happy.

925
01:05:57,495 --> 01:05:58,704
You're lying.

926
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,748
-What?
-There's no way Se-jun and Se-hyeong

927
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,416
were happy to hear that I'm alive.

928
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:05,753
Even if you guys fight all the time,
a family is still a family.

929
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:09,090
They still care more about you
than a complete stranger would.

930
01:06:09,173 --> 01:06:10,925
I heard you had been missing

931
01:06:11,008 --> 01:06:12,426
since the paragliding accident.

932
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:14,595
So you actually managed
to get in touch with my family.

933
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,222
Yes, I told you.

934
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,140
So you landed here after the accident?

935
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:19,892
That's insane.

936
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:22,853
The weather was crazy that day.

937
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:25,439
And I found out later that the radars

938
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:27,984
can't detect paragliders
because they're not engine-powered.

939
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:29,485
It was the worst-case scenario.

940
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:32,238
That's why they couldn't find you
no matter how hard they looked.

941
01:06:32,613 --> 01:06:36,033
I heard your brothers even hired
private agencies to find you.

942
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:39,704
They said you can put your worries to rest
now that they know you're alive.

943
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:43,249
They said you mustn't do anything reckless
to go back soon.

944
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:45,334
There's a lot going on politically,

945
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:48,129
and you're like a celebrity, you know.

946
01:06:49,213 --> 01:06:50,172
They said

947
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:52,967
they'll secretly look for a way
you can return safely.

948
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:57,513
Right, they're even postponing
the general shareholder meeting

949
01:06:57,805 --> 01:06:59,265
as it would be pointless without you.

950
01:06:59,765 --> 01:07:01,350
THE 36TH GENERAL SHAREHOLDER MEETING

951
01:07:36,093 --> 01:07:37,636
THE 36TH GENERAL SHAREHOLDER MEETING

952
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,221
Before we begin,

953
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:44,810
I'd like to clarify a few things
regarding the rumors about my family

954
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:48,022
that have been spreading

955
01:07:48,689 --> 01:07:51,650
in the stock market recently.

956
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:54,612
Yoon Se-ri,

957
01:07:55,112 --> 01:07:57,490
the CEO of Se-ri's Choice
who is also my daughter,

958
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:01,911
has been missing
since an unfortunate accident.

959
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:06,874
We searched for her for a month
while keeping it confidential

960
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:10,669
but could not find her.

961
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:18,052
Hence, according to Article 90
of the Family Registration Law

962
01:08:18,135 --> 01:08:21,055
and following the guidelines
for certifying deaths...

963
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:35,653
We have completed registering her death.

964
01:08:43,577 --> 01:08:45,204
THE 36TH GENERAL SHAREHOLDER MEETING

965
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:47,581
Did you see this?
Apparently, Yoon Se-ri is dead.

966
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:49,416
Isn't she Cha Sang-u's ex-girlfriend?

967
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,544
-Yes, she is.
-She's dead?

968
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:54,505
Hey, Chang-sik.

969
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:03,514
YOON SE-RI'S DEATH
REGISTERED BY HER FAMILY

970
01:09:04,431 --> 01:09:05,558
Hello?

971
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:06,475
Su-chan.

972
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:08,686
Did you faint?

973
01:09:08,769 --> 01:09:10,938
THE 36TH GENERAL SHAREHOLDER MEETING

974
01:09:11,021 --> 01:09:12,356
Gosh, I'm worried sick.

975
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:14,984
Out of all 94,823,847 stocks

976
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:19,155
with voting rights,

977
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:21,198
a total of 5,798 shareholders,

978
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:23,742
including those
who signed a power of attorney,

979
01:09:24,076 --> 01:09:29,123
have exercised their voting rights
representing 70,040,947 stocks.

980
01:09:30,624 --> 01:09:34,545
Over two-thirds of the shareholders
attending this meeting have voted

981
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:42,386
in favor of Mr. Yoon Se-hyeong
taking over the management rights.

982
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:33,187
Gosh, is this really necessary?

983
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:36,690
I'll be sent to the concentration camp
if I get caught selling wedding dresses.

984
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:38,609
Please understand.

985
01:10:40,152 --> 01:10:43,781
Dan, you've gotten even prettier
after living abroad for a few years.

986
01:10:44,531 --> 01:10:45,574
Have a seat.

987
01:10:49,995 --> 01:10:52,790
So you got back from Shanghai today.

988
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:54,416
I'm sure you brought something new.

989
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:58,420
I obviously didn't go all the way there
just to eat some xiaolongbao.

990
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:05,803
I brought this wedding magazine
from the South. It's a new edition.

991
01:11:06,387 --> 01:11:08,806
My gosh! A new edition, indeed.

992
01:11:09,306 --> 01:11:12,935
I was so scared of getting caught
while smuggling this in.

993
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:16,063
Look through this
and pick something gorgeous.

994
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:21,277
Dan has fair skin and a sharp jawline,

995
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:25,114
so something with a boat neck
and a dramatic, full skirt

996
01:11:25,197 --> 01:11:26,991
will look amazing on her.

997
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:29,493
Will you be okay with a full skirt?

998
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:33,163
She has lost quite a bit of weight.

999
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:36,083
Just look at her.
Any dress would look amazing on her.

1000
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:37,501
She's lost too much weight.

1001
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:46,176
YOON SE-RI HASN'T BEEN SEEN IN PUBLIC

1002
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:48,595
So? Is there anything you like?

1003
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:52,266
MISSING SINCE PARAGLIDING ACCIDENT

1004
01:11:52,349 --> 01:11:56,478
Hey, I told you to pick out a dress.
Why are you looking at this?

1005
01:11:57,354 --> 01:11:58,564
Mom.

1006
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:00,983
I have to go somewhere.

1007
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:02,526
Where?

1008
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:06,071
-Open the door for me, please.
-You can't take that. Give it back!

1009
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:07,614
Let me out at once!

1010
01:12:07,698 --> 01:12:09,491
YOON SE-RI HASN'T BEEN SEEN IN PUBLIC

1011
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:19,626
-You didn't find her?
-No, I didn't see her anywhere.

1012
01:12:24,256 --> 01:12:26,508
Oh, dear. Had I known,

1013
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:29,178
I wouldn't have gone
to Masikryong Ski Resort.

1014
01:12:29,553 --> 01:12:33,140
I missed the opportunity to meet the
Director of the General Political Bureau.

1015
01:12:33,265 --> 01:12:36,977
Still, his son
is asking for our help, you know.

1016
01:12:37,061 --> 01:12:38,395
Yes, you're right.

1017
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:42,566
I've been told that I will turn
my life around at the age of 55.

1018
01:12:43,567 --> 01:12:45,694
You said he's asking to see
the security footage, right?

1019
01:12:46,278 --> 01:12:50,032
You can just call us over
if you need anything.

1020
01:12:50,657 --> 01:12:51,909
We would've made a copy

1021
01:12:52,409 --> 01:12:55,371
so that you could comfortably
watch the footage in your bed.

1022
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:56,497
It's okay.

1023
01:12:56,914 --> 01:12:58,540
Thank you for your help.

1024
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:01,502
You must be busy.
You can all go back to work.

1025
01:13:02,586 --> 01:13:04,088
Are any of you busy at the moment?

1026
01:13:05,839 --> 01:13:07,257
We have a lot of time to spare.

1027
01:13:07,341 --> 01:13:09,927
We have nothing better to do,
so please keep looking.

1028
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:14,640
There.

1029
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:22,356
What is it? What's the matter?

1030
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:30,239
May I use your phone?

1031
01:13:30,322 --> 01:13:32,950
Gosh, you don't even need to ask.

1032
01:13:33,033 --> 01:13:36,412
Feel free to use everything
at the hospital as if it's yours.

1033
01:13:37,162 --> 01:13:38,831
Did you look up the license plate number?

1034
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:43,127
Yes. The vehicle does belong
to the Ministry of People’s Security,

1035
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:44,545
but it's fake.

1036
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,713
-You mean, the number is fake?
-Yes.

1037
01:13:46,797 --> 01:13:48,424
I looked further into it,
and it looks like

1038
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:52,302
the State Security Department
uses the vehicle.

1039
01:13:52,553 --> 01:13:55,222
Apparently, it was used
for a long-term event at the guest lodge.

1040
01:13:55,722 --> 01:13:58,475
But from what I know,
the guest lodge was shut down a while ago.

1041
01:13:59,017 --> 01:14:00,185
I wonder what's going on.

1042
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:01,728
Where is the guest lodge?

1043
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:03,313
On the map, it's showing

1044
01:14:03,397 --> 01:14:06,942
in Bongdeok-dong in Kaesong.
The coordinates are 35, 129.

1045
01:14:07,025 --> 01:14:09,319
It won't be easy to find it though.

1046
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:24,126
Hey.

1047
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:25,961
Why didn't you wake me up?

1048
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:27,671
Because you seemed exhausted.

1049
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:29,715
Can I use your phone?

1050
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:34,678
Have a seat. The food is ready. Let's eat.

1051
01:14:34,761 --> 01:14:36,263
Let me make a call first.

1052
01:14:36,346 --> 01:14:37,556
A call? Why?

1053
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:40,184
I left without even telling him.
He must be waiting for me.

1054
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:41,351
Who?

1055
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:42,769
That bodyguard?

1056
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:44,438
Yes.

1057
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:47,191
But you don't need him anymore.

1058
01:14:49,067 --> 01:14:50,194
What?

1059
01:14:52,237 --> 01:14:54,698
I said, you don't need him anymore.

1060
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:15,552
Is it Yoon Se-ri?

1061
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:17,137
Her name.

1062
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:22,976
You have me now.

1063
01:15:24,144 --> 01:15:26,230
You can stay here with me and go home.

1064
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:28,690
Why do you want to spend time with him?

1065
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:31,985
You said you couldn't be there.
That's why you escaped.

1066
01:15:33,987 --> 01:15:35,405
The situation earlier today...

1067
01:15:37,032 --> 01:15:38,492
Wasn't it dangerous for him as well,

1068
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:40,702
not just for you?

1069
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:44,081
Let's be honest. You can just leave.

1070
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:45,749
But what about him?

1071
01:15:46,917 --> 01:15:48,919
He has to live here
for the rest of his life.

1072
01:15:50,003 --> 01:15:51,880
Don't you think you're being cruel to him?

1073
01:15:55,467 --> 01:15:57,219
You see,

1074
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:00,347
he might die because of you.

1075
01:16:06,937 --> 01:16:08,855
Can you explain this?

1076
01:16:13,527 --> 01:16:16,238
YOON SE-RI HASN'T BEEN SEEN IN PUBLIC

1077
01:16:16,321 --> 01:16:17,948
So this is her?

1078
01:16:19,032 --> 01:16:20,951
The woman you like.

1079
01:16:24,288 --> 01:16:25,247
Answer me.

1080
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:28,375
Did you know

1081
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:30,127
who she really is?

1082
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:32,462
Yes, I did.

1083
01:16:32,546 --> 01:16:35,382
What the heck is a South Korean woman
doing here?

1084
01:16:35,465 --> 01:16:37,092
She ended up here due to an accident,

1085
01:16:38,135 --> 01:16:39,261
and we met by chance.

1086
01:16:42,723 --> 01:16:45,475
-She'll go back soon.
-So you're helping her hide?

1087
01:16:46,059 --> 01:16:47,102
That's right.

1088
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:51,023
If you get caught,
you might lose everything you have.

1089
01:16:52,566 --> 01:16:53,483
What I'm saying is,

1090
01:16:54,901 --> 01:16:56,653
she could get you killed.

1091
01:16:57,237 --> 01:16:58,572
And you still

1092
01:16:59,406 --> 01:17:00,866
like her?

1093
01:17:19,384 --> 01:17:20,761
100 PERCENT PURE CARBONIC ACID

1094
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:23,096
THIS IS THE TASTE OF TRUE BEER

1095
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:24,222
WELL-MADE BEER

1096
01:17:51,583 --> 01:17:53,752
You studied classical music
back in school, right?

1097
01:17:54,878 --> 01:17:55,921
Do you know this song?

1098
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,118
What is this song?

1099
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,246
I don't know.

1100
01:18:29,913 --> 01:18:32,374
I just happened to hear it somewhere
a long time ago,

1101
01:18:32,457 --> 01:18:34,292
but I have no idea whose song it is.

1102
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:36,545
I looked up all the songs I could think of

1103
01:18:37,629 --> 01:18:40,298
and asked my acquaintances
that know a lot about music,

1104
01:18:40,424 --> 01:18:41,717
but no one knows what song it is.

1105
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:45,178
Play it again.

1106
01:19:12,497 --> 01:19:13,707
I have no clue.

1107
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:20,213
I really want to hear it one more time,

1108
01:19:20,964 --> 01:19:22,466
but no one recognizes the melody.

1109
01:19:23,049 --> 01:19:24,593
Where did you hear it?

1110
01:19:26,303 --> 01:19:27,721
A few years ago,

1111
01:19:28,805 --> 01:19:30,724
I went to Switzerland.

1112
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:48,241
Back then,

1113
01:19:48,825 --> 01:19:50,744
I didn't want to live.

1114
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:52,704
I thought

1115
01:19:53,205 --> 01:19:56,124
it'd be nice to spend my final moments

1116
01:19:56,249 --> 01:19:57,959
in a place with beautiful scenery.

1117
01:19:59,252 --> 01:20:01,671
But during the trip, I realized

1118
01:20:02,172 --> 01:20:04,132
that I did not want to die.

1119
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:06,176
I just didn't want to live.

1120
01:20:07,719 --> 01:20:08,845
I just

1121
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,389
needed some consolation.

1122
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:15,894
I'd never live the kind of life where
I could be loved by those whom I love,

1123
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:18,021
but I still

1124
01:20:18,396 --> 01:20:19,773
wanted to hear someone say

1125
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:21,608
that I could live

1126
01:20:22,275 --> 01:20:24,402
and that I must keep on living.

1127
01:20:34,913 --> 01:20:36,540
And right at that moment,

1128
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:39,125
that melody started playing

1129
01:20:39,543 --> 01:20:41,211
as if it was the answer to my prayer.

1130
01:20:42,629 --> 01:20:44,548
"You can live.

1131
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:46,883
You must get through this."

1132
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:49,761
It gave me solace.

1133
01:21:56,494 --> 01:22:00,123
If you like him,
you should just disappear now.

1134
01:22:00,707 --> 01:22:03,126
They broke off their engagement.
He's not her boyfriend.

1135
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:05,503
A fake marriage with you?

1136
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:09,716
I, too, will do anything
to protect my fiancé.

1137
01:22:09,799 --> 01:22:14,012
Bring that South Korean woman to me
at once.

1138
