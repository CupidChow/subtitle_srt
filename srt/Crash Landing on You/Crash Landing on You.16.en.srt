1
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,971
ALL CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND BACKGROUND ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,334
Gu Seung-jun!

3
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,310
Seung-jun, stay with me.

4
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,604
Don't worry. I'm okay.

5
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:46,315
No.

6
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:51,445
Gu Seung-jun.

7
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,197
Gu Seung-jun!

8
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,825
AMBULANCE

9
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,464
Hang up another IV fluid bag

10
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,549
and check her vital signs again.

11
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,176
Ms. Yoon.

12
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,344
Ms. Yoon.

13
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,569
Inject epinephrine through the IV line.

14
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:33,612
Yes, Doctor.

15
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:53,298
Ms. Yoon, can you hear me? Ms. Yoon.

16
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:55,717
-Start CPR.
-Yes, Doctor.

17
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,886
-Get the defibrillator ready.
-Got it.

18
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,472
We'll begin defibrillation.
Charge to 150 joules.

19
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,558
Charged.

20
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,268
One, two, three.

21
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,938
Charge to 200 joules.

22
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,233
-Charged.
-One, two, three.

23
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,075
Are you okay?

24
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,035
Stay with me.

25
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,038
Look at me.

26
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,040
Look straight at me.

27
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,377
You told me...

28
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,090
that when you're doing better...

29
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,592
Later on, if I visit you

30
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,846
when I am doing better...

31
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,183
And if

32
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:47,811
you are

33
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,564
still single...

34
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,652
Then please give me...

35
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,488
a chance.

36
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,118
I was going to give you a chance.

37
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,039
I was going to wait until you visit me.

38
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,752
I was going to wait for you.

39
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,587
I like you, Dan.

40
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,590
Because I like you,

41
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,093
I will keep in mind where I am going.

42
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,348
I will live that way.

43
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:31,897
I will do that from now on.

44
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:33,857
I was happy.

45
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,447
Hearing that...

46
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,035
made me happy.

47
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,340
Dan.

48
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,721
That time,

49
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,934
what were you referring to?

50
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,021
Ramyeon?

51
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,858
That man?

52
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:18,652
Or...

53
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,072
me?

54
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,242
Why not?

55
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,578
I like it.

56
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:33,333
What?

57
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,211
You like what? Ramyeon?

58
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,464
Or did you mean that man?

59
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,341
Or...

60
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,135
me?

61
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,227
You.

62
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,354
It was you.

63
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,232
It was you, Gu Seung-jun.

64
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,111
I knew it.

65
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,171
Gu Seung-jun.

66
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,382
Gu Seung-jun.

67
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,051
Seung-jun.

68
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,185
Excuse me.

69
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,397
I think he fainted. Please do something.

70
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,693
Do something, please. Anything.

71
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:42,861
I feel

72
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,364
so bad for him.

73
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:50,910
Please do something. Please!

74
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,665
Wake up.

75
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,085
Wake up.

76
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,213
Please wake up, Seung-jun.

77
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:03,923
Please.

78
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:05,884
Seung-jun...

79
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,352
It's back.

80
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,731
-Give her the full amount of oxygen.
-Yes, Doctor.

81
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,416
She's stable now.

82
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,420
Let's wait and see how she recovers.

83
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,214
All right, then.

84
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,602
We heard she was in critical condition

85
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,480
and thought we should be here.

86
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,856
Thank you.

87
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,567
I'm relieved. It sounds like
she passed the critical stage.

88
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,612
Then,

89
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,198
does he have to leave again?

90
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:14,119
But her condition might worsen.

91
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,707
And she might look for him
when she wakes up.

92
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,253
Please see what you can do.

93
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:53,033
It's nice to eat together like this.
It's been too long.

94
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,618
Hey, don't laugh.

95
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,579
Sorry?

96
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,790
They might assume that we're some
kooky soldiers seduced by capitalism

97
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,292
and think that we're easy.

98
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:07,714
It's still not safe to assume
that their evil scheme has ended.

99
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:10,842
What scheme?

100
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,094
Think about it.

101
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:17,015
I'm the most elite agent of the DPRK.

102
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,184
They obviously wouldn't want to lose me,

103
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,394
especially when I came down here
of my own accord.

104
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:25,231
That's why they're feeding us so well.

105
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:28,735
To tell you the truth,

106
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,405
I already got an offer.

107
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,323
"An offer"?

108
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,617
In American Imperialists' terms,

109
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:40,080
I guess I can say I got scouted?

110
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,957
We can send you back
if you'd like to return,

111
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,669
but what you wish to do
matters more to us.

112
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,630
What?

113
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:54,928
If you decide to stay,
we can help you get settled.

114
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,273
They want me to stay.

115
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,319
That's how capitalism works.

116
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,821
Just like this saying,

117
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,199
"Take what's useful
and ditch what's useless."

118
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,744
They find my skills very useful,
so they're eager to keep me here.

119
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:24,082
You always talk about
how much you hate capitalism,

120
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:27,127
yet you seem to have already
acquainted yourself with the slangs here.

121
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,171
-Well...
-But the thing is,

122
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:35,093
he asked all of us
the exact same question.

123
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,554
-All of you?
-That's right.

124
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,515
You too, Eun Dong?

125
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,978
Perhaps they did that
because they were afraid

126
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:50,233
I'd think I'd get lonely and say no if
they asked me to stay here all by myself.

127
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,906
Has anyone seen Captain Ri?

128
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,954
Not even once.

129
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,791
I tried asking the investigator,
but he won't tell me anything.

130
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,550
A WEEK LATER

131
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:19,846
I heard you suggested exchanging those
awaiting repatriation.

132
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:22,891
We have a few from the South

133
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,977
who are serving time in jail
for espionage charges anyway,

134
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,022
so I'd say we and the South
have nothing to lose.

135
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,440
No, it's different.

136
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:34,027
The six soldiers who got arrested
in the South are still being investigated,

137
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,947
whereas the nine South Koreans here
are already serving their sentences.

138
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,157
The difference is huge.

139
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,244
It's just us here, so let's be honest.

140
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,330
The Military Department went ahead

141
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:48,625
and prosecuted them without investigating
or putting them on trial.

142
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,461
I bet some of them think it's unfair.

143
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,046
Sir.

144
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:57,133
You can never hide an awl in your pocket.

145
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,387
You want to cover up
the fact that your son

146
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,014
betrayed us for a woman.

147
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,851
That is why you're trying to push ahead
with a deal that is so unfair for us.

148
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,939
I'm sure they know
that it's a losing bargain for them.

149
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,899
But they want them back no matter what?

150
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:15,652
They obviously want
to settle this quickly.

151
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:18,613
Yes, they want us to hand them over
as soon as possible.

152
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,698
And they want to keep it confidential.

153
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,825
They want the confidentiality term
to be five years.

154
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,119
They're being sensitive about it
because one of them

155
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,496
is a high-ranking officer's son.

156
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,207
Are we sure that they never engaged
in espionage or any activities

157
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,376
that serve the interest of the North
while being here?

158
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,003
Yes. As you can see in the summary
of the investigation report

159
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:38,132
and the statements signed by them,

160
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,385
they didn't really do anything
except for the gunfight

161
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,761
with Cho Cheol Gang.

162
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,305
And how do they feel
about going back to the North?

163
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:45,890
They all want to return.

164
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:50,061
Then why don't we send them back
in secret as per the North's request?

165
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,647
Going public with it
won't do us any good anyway.

166
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,109
I agree. The conditions they suggested
are favorable to us.

167
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,069
The Ministry of Unification
agrees as well,

168
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:01,239
but we can't just yield to their request
without trying to strike a deal.

169
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:06,077
How about we suggest a reunion
of the separated families as well?

170
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,955
I don't think we have anything to lose.

171
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:10,957
They'll try to strike a deal,

172
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,710
to take advantage of this opportunity
and make the most of it.

173
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,295
How will you take responsibility
for everything?

174
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,841
I have a plan.

175
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,137
-What's your plan?
-Pardon me?

176
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,394
The South sent me these documents
on the evidence they found.

177
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,521
Apparently, Cho Cheol Gang,
who defected to the South

178
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,774
after committing countless crimes and even
killing someone while being transported,

179
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:41,237
has been in contact with you
on a regular basis.

180
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:43,281
Did you give him the orders?

181
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,453
Of course not, sir.

182
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,290
Right?

183
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,252
You see, my son would never do
such a thing either.

184
00:13:56,335 --> 00:14:00,548
He'd never betray his country
because of a woman.

185
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,971
Are you saying
we should cover up for each other?

186
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,306
Is that what it sounded like?

187
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:12,518
Fine.

188
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,396
On one condition, though.

189
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,275
The Military Department
will have full authority

190
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:22,612
over the entire repatriation process,
including where we'll receive them.

191
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,989
You wouldn't say no to that, right?

192
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,164
Hello.

193
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,957
-Nothing happened, right?
-Hello.

194
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,584
Let's go in.

195
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:41,964
Ms. Yoon.

196
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,634
How are you feeling?

197
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:48,846
-Good to see you.
-You look so weary.

198
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,391
I'm okay now. Have a seat.

199
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:52,683
Okay.

200
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,568
When did you wake up?

201
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,237
A few minutes ago.

202
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,366
Would you please excuse us?

203
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,660
I have to talk to Se-ri about something.

204
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,953
-Sure.
-Sure.

205
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,416
Se-ri.

206
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,043
I just got a call.

207
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,215
He'll be sent back to the North.

208
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:34,851
When?

209
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,478
When will he leave?

210
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,231
Now.

211
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:48,531
Now?

212
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,577
Yes, he has to leave now.

213
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59,709
Seeing you now pains me more

214
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,129
than the thought of
possibly ruining my entire life.

215
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,799
That's great news.

216
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,053
That's great.

217
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,474
I suppose

218
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,102
he didn't keep on lying.

219
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:21,063
The investigation must've gone well.

220
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,649
That's why he can return, right?

221
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,235
I'm so relieved.

222
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,493
Do you want to go see him?
Shall I take you to him?

223
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:45,171
I've said goodbye to him
a number of times already.

224
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,507
Too many times, in fact.

225
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,802
I no longer have anything else
to say to him.

226
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,474
And I don't want him
to see me like this...

227
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:01,562
because it'll only make it
more difficult for him to leave.

228
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,358
I don't even want him to know

229
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,069
that I suffered.

230
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,245
You think he didn't know?

231
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,791
He...

232
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,294
stayed by your side the whole time.

233
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,137
EMERGENCY OPERATING ROOM

234
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,819
Even during

235
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,613
your long surgery...

236
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,153
Why must we keep seeing her suffer?
It's so cruel.

237
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,195
Come on. Let's go.

238
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:38,659
Honey, I think I should stay here
for a little longer.

239
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,161
What? Why?

240
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,246
She could wake up anytime.

241
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,915
I should stay by her side
because I'm her sister-in-law.

242
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,377
-I'll get mad at you.
-Hold on.

243
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:49,795
Come on. Let's go.

244
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,824
Even while waiting for you
to regain your consciousness,

245
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:24,705
he stayed by your side
without eating or sleeping for days.

246
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,215
-Ms. Yoon.
-Mother!

247
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,716
-Are you okay?
-She woke up.

248
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,093
Mother, she woke up.

249
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,555
Ms. Yoon.

250
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,808
Ms. Yoon.

251
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,560
WAITING ROOM

252
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,913
He left the hospital after seeing you

253
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,249
regain your consciousness.

254
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:03,179
Even if you said goodbye to him
multiple times,

255
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:06,849
you'll still miss him.

256
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,560
You really won't see him?

257
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,480
I want to see him.

258
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,483
Take me there.

259
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:16,942
Take me to him.

260
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,945
I really want to see him.

261
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,215
I have to say...

262
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,638
Thank goodness

263
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:47,389
that woman

264
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,517
woke up.

265
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,105
I know.

266
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:57,817
We had no idea

267
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:02,071
that Se-ri had collapsed
due to her illness.

268
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,952
How could you guys have known that?

269
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,747
After we leave,

270
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,750
we won't be able to find out
how she's doing,

271
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:20,214
so it's really good to hear
that she's regained her consciousness.

272
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,385
She'll be okay now.

273
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,272
Mr. Kim.

274
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:40,651
Did you bring all these cars
because we're leaving?

275
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:44,738
-That must've been a lot of work.
-Yes, it was a lot of work indeed.

276
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,119
We'll never come back here, right?

277
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,787
We shouldn't.

278
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,208
It's raining cats and dogs.

279
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:00,004
We won't need to come back here,

280
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,883
but I'll probably think about this place
from time to time.

281
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,603
Here we go. Hold tight.

282
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,547
Hello?

283
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,384
What?

284
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:52,389
No, we do have some time, but...

285
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,522
Where are you now?

286
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:15,162
INTER-KOREAN TRANSIT OFFICE

287
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,477
KAESONG

288
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:45,359
Is that the Military Demarcation Line?

289
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,655
Yes.

290
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:51,949
I think so.

291
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:56,870
So we'll be in the North
after we cross that line?

292
00:24:57,955 --> 00:24:58,997
That's right.

293
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:03,001
All right. Let's get out now.

294
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:56,365
We still have about five minutes.

295
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,701
Why don't we have them cross the line
on the dot?

296
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:02,329
We have a long way to go,
so why waste time?

297
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,289
Let's do it now.

298
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,501
Okay.

299
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,217
We'll do that, then.

300
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,985
No. What are they doing?

301
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,112
Why...

302
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,240
Jeong Hyeok!

303
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:24,870
Don't run.

304
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,580
Jeong Hyeok!

305
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:30,250
You can't leave just like that.

306
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:31,627
I can't let them take you

307
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,670
-like that.
-Stop running!

308
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:35,797
What do I do
if you just leave me like that?

309
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:40,093
How would I live
after you leave like that?

310
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:41,261
What should I do?

311
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,713
PEACE

312
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,891
You're not fully recovered yet.

313
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:30,185
What if you collapse again?

314
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:33,397
Can't you take better care of yourself?

315
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,441
Why are they putting handcuffs on you?

316
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:38,360
Are you getting arrested?

317
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,531
No. I can't do that. I can't let you go.

318
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,992
Don't leave. Can't you stay here?

319
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,953
Don't worry.

320
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,373
Do you not know me?

321
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,417
Nothing will happen.

322
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,128
But why are they dragging you over?

323
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,755
What if something happens to you there?

324
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:00,924
It's all because of me.

325
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,510
It's all my fault.

326
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:08,140
Nothing will happen.

327
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,810
But even if

328
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,438
something happens,

329
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,900
it's not your fault.

330
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:22,029
I have no regrets.

331
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,949
You came into my life like a gift.

332
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,328
I'm just grateful for that.

333
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,124
Me too.

334
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,421
Thank you, Jeong Hyeok.

335
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,218
I broke your heart with my word
the other day.

336
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,679
It broke my heart too.

337
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,308
I'm so sorry.

338
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,352
Please don't dwell on it.

339
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,103
It's okay.

340
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,815
I didn't mind it at all.

341
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,236
Don't worry about it.

342
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:06,323
So...

343
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:09,368
Can't we see each other again?

344
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,995
I will never get to see you again?

345
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:14,581
Forever?

346
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:16,792
What do I do?

347
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:21,004
What should I do when I miss you so much?

348
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:31,640
Just wait

349
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,560
and pray desperately.

350
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:41,566
You asked if you can meet
someone you miss that way.

351
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:45,779
You can.

352
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:54,788
I love you.

353
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:01,753
I love you.

354
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,090
I really do.

355
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,734
Se-ri.

356
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:11,781
Take cake.

357
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:13,825
Se-ri.

358
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,578
Stay healthy.

359
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:19,122
Take care.

360
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:24,836
Bye.

361
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,466
Take care, guys.

362
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,679
Don't get hurt.

363
00:33:56,576 --> 00:34:03,542
PEACE

364
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,226
Really?

365
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:41,705
-What are you doing?
-Are you going to pick Jeong Hyeok up?

366
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:44,874
Make sure

367
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,711
to bring my son home alive.

368
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:49,629
Please.

369
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,506
Do you think Jeong Hyeok is only your son?

370
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,677
Whether something happens
to Jeong Hyeok or you,

371
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:57,721
I will get there right away.

372
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,639
Don't be weak

373
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:02,267
worrying about how I hold up on my own.

374
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,271
I'll see you later.

375
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:54,277
Why are we getting off here?

376
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,196
We were on our way to Pyongyang.

377
00:35:56,279 --> 00:36:00,033
You will be executed
after the court-martial after all.

378
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:03,203
Wouldn't it be better to vanish here

379
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:06,498
before causing your family trouble?

380
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,460
Even if we end up dying,
we'd like to stand trial.

381
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:12,545
And the comrades behind me

382
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:15,590
just arrived late
after the Military World Games.

383
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:16,883
They are not like me.

384
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:19,552
I'm the one who committed a crime.

385
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,057
It doesn't matter.

386
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:28,103
We're just sending them with you,
so you won't be lonely on your way.

387
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,684
Military Director. Didn't I tell you?

388
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:12,772
You can't carry out an execution
without investigation and trial.

389
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:15,525
It might cause innocent victims.

390
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:22,240
But things are different

391
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,701
when I witnessed someone
trying to kill my son.

392
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:33,418
You can't be innocent.

393
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,878
Damn.

394
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,948
I'm sorry for making you worry.

395
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,993
I'm just glad you're back.

396
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,623
You came back alive.

397
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,291
So it's fine.

398
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:19,714
Is Yoon Se-ri all right?

399
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:22,842
Yes.

400
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:36,773
Are you crying?

401
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:02,882
Mother.

402
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,982
My dear son.

403
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:22,318
Thank you.

404
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,946
Thank you for coming back alive.

405
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,615
I'm glad that you're alive.

406
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:35,081
The roses of Sharon have blossomed.

407
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,919
The roses of Sharon...

408
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,636
The roses of Sharon have blossomed.

409
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,346
U Pil.

410
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,265
Dad!

411
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:54,893
U Pil.

412
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,938
Mom.

413
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:05,403
Man Bok.

414
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,117
I didn't hear a thing from you.

415
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:17,081
I thought you were dead.

416
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,502
Why did you not even give me a call?

417
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,216
I'm so sorry.

418
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:30,803
I'm sorry.

419
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,639
Thank you for coming back alive.

420
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,225
Thank you for staying alive.

421
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,154
Failed again?

422
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,575
What do we do?

423
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:57,705
We have to talk to her.
She might get seriously ill.

424
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,307
Please leave me alone.

425
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:20,895
Dan, just tell us.

426
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:25,525
What do you want your uncle
and me to do for you?

427
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:27,360
Nothing.

428
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,780
I don't want you to do anything.

429
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,660
Please leave me alone.

430
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:38,663
Why not?

431
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:47,296
Look at us.

432
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,383
We're here

433
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:53,011
to cry with you.

434
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,097
We can listen to you.

435
00:41:56,931 --> 00:42:00,226
And we can go through
all the hard times with you.

436
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,074
Sure.

437
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:19,787
And I can get you a guy
who's a lot better than him.

438
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,084
Why?

439
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:26,335
Damn it.

440
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,632
Please get out.

441
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,514
Why...

442
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:42,393
Don't come near me.

443
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:44,353
-What's wrong?
-Why did you...

444
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:50,693
Why would you say that?

445
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,320
Have you lost your mind?

446
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:53,738
I was just...

447
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:56,616
Dan.

448
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,118
Why? Do you want to eat?

449
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:01,746
-Mom.
-Yes.

450
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,873
-Uncle.
-Yes.

451
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:07,668
I want to get my revenge.

452
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,467
We're experts in that field.

453
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:16,302
Isn't that right?

454
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:18,179
Sure. We are.

455
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:22,016
I need you to find someone first.

456
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:34,153
About Gu Seung-jun...

457
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,073
I'm sorry about that.

458
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:44,205
I heard some members of the gang

459
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,999
who sent the guys that day
are still in this country.

460
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:49,877
Right.

461
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,132
Don't worry about the consequences,
and just tell me where they are.

462
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:56,717
There's no way

463
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,679
they will leave this country alive.

464
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,891
And there must be people

465
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,519
who financed the gang.

466
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:08,771
Maybe...

467
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:11,691
Her second brother was quite greedy.

468
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:14,944
And the easiest thing to do is

469
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,071
to tempt someone greedy.

470
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:20,658
It's Yoon Se-ri's second brother,

471
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:23,744
I guess.

472
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:31,752
All right. Let me get this straight.

473
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:34,547
I never asked them
to capture Gu Seung-jun.

474
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,175
You did. Is that right?

475
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:40,136
And Gu Seung-jun happened to die
in the process.

476
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,972
That's what the people you hired did.

477
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:46,392
It has nothing to do with me, right?

478
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:49,228
Will you say something?

479
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,814
When Manager Oh brought Cho Cheol Gang

480
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:54,775
and said all the crap
like capturing or killing Se-ri,

481
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:57,361
I got furious and stormed out of the room.

482
00:44:57,445 --> 00:45:00,823
It's you who ordered Cho Cheol Gang
to take Se-ri.

483
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:01,866
You admit it, right?

484
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,295
Yoon Se-hyeong, you know nothing.

485
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:20,927
A recording without consent of the other
has no legal validity.

486
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:24,513
Does it even matter?
I'm just stating the facts.

487
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:26,432
Who would believe that?

488
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:30,186
I did the whole thing for you,
Yoon Se-hyeong.

489
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:33,773
For me? Don't give me that baloney.

490
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:36,108
Think about the consequences
of what you've done for me.

491
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:37,568
I'm now

492
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,446
about to lose my position
as the president.

493
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:45,409
If something goes wrong,
I might end up in jail because of you.

494
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,411
Calm yourself down.

495
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:49,747
It's North Korea
where Gu Seung-jun got killed.

496
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:53,334
Why would they want to deal with a case
that happened in North Korea?

497
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:56,003
I took care of things,
so the police won't find out

498
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:58,965
the money we wired and call history.

499
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:03,177
Even Cho Cheol Gang
who tried to kidnap Se-ri

500
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:05,221
just died when we didn't do anything.

501
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,307
We have nothing to worry about.

502
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,646
Are you sure about that?

503
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:23,864
When did you get out of the hospital?

504
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:25,408
Today.

505
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:27,910
I got here as soon as I left.

506
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:29,954
Sit.

507
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:32,206
This isn't your house.
Don't tell me what to do.

508
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:38,170
When will you get questioned by NIS?

509
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:39,839
I did it already.

510
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,342
I think I'll be prosecuted.

511
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:47,179
It's about the violation
of the National Security Act.

512
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:48,889
You should get a good attorney.

513
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:52,643
Don't worry. She will have my attorney.

514
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,229
She might be accused
of misprision of felony.

515
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:58,315
But there were extenuating circumstances,

516
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:02,069
so she will be given
a suspended sentence or a fine.

517
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,948
Still, it's not a minor crime.

518
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:07,950
What if there's an article about her?

519
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:11,412
Mind your own business. There will be
more than a probation for you two.

520
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:15,082
-What?
-If you knew about the law that well,

521
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,793
you should've been more cautious.

522
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:22,006
Knowing someone is a criminal
or about to commit a crime,

523
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:26,010
if you offer money
or other pecuniary advantage

524
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:29,430
or provide a place
for communication, stakeout, or contact,

525
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:32,725
you shall be sentenced to a penalty
of up to ten years in prison.

526
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:35,061
What are you talking about?

527
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:36,812
Come on out.

528
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:46,030
I brought them from NIS.

529
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:47,531
I'm sorry.

530
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:50,034
There's a broker named Cheon

531
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,578
who used to take care of Gu Seung-jun.

532
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:54,872
He sent all the account details

533
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:57,958
and phone call recordings

534
00:47:58,167 --> 00:48:00,586
to Ms. Yoon through China.

535
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:06,634
I just did what these two told me to do.

536
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,720
What are you talking about?
Who told you to do that, you idiot?

537
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:14,016
Hey. How dare you
try to put the blame on us?

538
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,393
I guess you two have a lot to talk about.

539
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:19,647
This case is solicitation of murder,
solicitation of kidnap,

540
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:20,940
and concealment of an offender.

541
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:24,360
There are a lot of charges.

542
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:27,613
The police and NIS will need
a joint investigation.

543
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,156
Anyway,

544
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,243
come with us.

545
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:35,871
You said it will be okay.

546
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,707
Go ahead and do something.

547
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:44,797
Dad.

548
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:49,135
Are you going to sit back
and watch me get arrested?

549
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:52,596
You should think
about the image of our company.

550
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,722
Shut your mouth.

551
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:57,017
So you are a businessman.

552
00:48:57,852 --> 00:48:58,936
Do you still not get it?

553
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:01,522
That I'm cutting you off?

554
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:06,277
I'm cutting out the rotten part
before it gets serious.

555
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:45,024
HOW TO MAKE SCORCHED RICE
HOW TO COOK NOODLES

556
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:20,786
Are you still up?

557
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:26,417
If you're reading my message now,
it means you're still awake.

558
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:31,130
Jeong Hyeok, how...

559
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,308
Click Message.

560
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:46,395
Pick a date and time you want.

561
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:47,813
Done.

562
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:52,151
Write a message.

563
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,695
Give it a try.

564
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:10,044
I still worry a lot about you.

565
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:13,464
And I have a lot of things left
to tell you.

566
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:17,634
So I'm sending these messages
to tell you all of them.

567
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:24,016
What I want to tell you the most
is on your bookshelf.

568
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:30,356
I LOVE YOU, YOON SE-RI

569
00:52:30,439 --> 00:52:33,859
It's my reply to the message
you sent me before.

570
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,531
I LOVE YOU, YOON SE-RI

571
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:40,741
What?

572
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:43,952
Is he a little kid or what?

573
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:48,499
He just copies all sorts of stuff.

574
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,585
I LOVE YOU, YOON SE-RI

575
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:55,464
I LOVE YOU, YOON SE-RI

576
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,354
Good morning.

577
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:13,315
Don't go to work on an empty stomach.

578
00:53:13,399 --> 00:53:15,484
Make sure to eat at least an apple.

579
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:31,583
Just so you know,

580
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:35,170
it's good that you stick to your lane,

581
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:38,632
but you shouldn't look only forwards.
You should look aside from time to time.

582
00:54:02,531 --> 00:54:04,283
Eat regularly at scheduled times.

583
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:08,871
And don't eat alone.
Enjoy your meals with other people.

584
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:10,497
With relish.

585
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:16,420
So did you check the meat
as soon as you got here?

586
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:19,339
Did you see that
at the entrance to the town?

587
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:22,092
The way women looked at me...

588
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:23,177
I didn't see it.

589
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:29,057
Why don't you take a walk
for 30 minutes from 12:30 p.m.?

590
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:32,769
I'll make sure
to go for a walk at that hour.

591
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,321
It's good to have a walk.

592
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:44,239
Jeong Hyeok.

593
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,700
It's good to have a walk.

594
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:50,579
Se-ri.

595
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,005
Potato is good...

596
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,675
as FF.

597
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:05,511
What?

598
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:09,431
Do you not know FF? The fried potato.

599
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:11,558
What was the name again?

600
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:13,936
-You mean French fries?
-Exactly.

601
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:17,689
It's totally COMI.

602
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:20,359
What does that mean?

603
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:23,111
Do you not know what COMI means?

604
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:27,366
It's crispy on the outside
and moist on the inside.

605
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:31,995
It's no big deal.

606
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:35,707
You just sound like a Seoul citizen.

607
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:38,835
It actually suits me well.

608
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:44,216
Actually, I turned on the faucet
and waited to get

609
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,885
hot water this morning.

610
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,304
So I was kind of surprised.

611
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:52,474
I also waited
to get electricity for a while.

612
00:55:52,558 --> 00:55:53,725
I know.

613
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,520
There has always been no electricity here.

614
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:59,189
I can put up with all that.

615
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:03,652
But it's frustrating
that there's no Internet connection here.

616
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,822
It's feels like new hell.

617
00:56:07,406 --> 00:56:08,824
When I lie down at night,

618
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:13,161
I see the video game screens
on the ceiling.

619
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:32,681
Gosh, look who's here.

620
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:34,349
Hello, Mrs. Go.

621
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:36,685
It's been a long time.

622
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:38,562
What brings you here?

623
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:43,775
Dan is moving out
of her matrimonial home today.

624
00:56:45,444 --> 00:56:48,447
No, it's okay. Don't be like that.

625
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:52,200
I feel so good and lighthearted.

626
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:54,453
It's chilly out here.

627
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:55,746
Why don't we go inside?

628
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:57,247
Shall we?

629
00:56:57,331 --> 00:57:01,126
I recently went to Europe.

630
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:03,211
-Europe?
-My gosh.

631
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:04,880
I see.

632
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:08,008
And I found some

633
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:11,887
limited-edition products
you'd love a lot there,

634
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,972
so I bought them.

635
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,098
You bought them?

636
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:21,563
Yeong, Wol?

637
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:23,899
Myeong, Ok?

638
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,903
I think it looks

639
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:30,447
like me somehow.

640
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:33,533
And this is how I looked
when I got married.

641
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:35,744
This is no better than my actual face,

642
00:57:36,328 --> 00:57:38,497
but I'm sure it is me.

643
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,998
-I looks the same.
-I know.

644
00:57:40,082 --> 00:57:43,627
-What is going on?
-My gosh.

645
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:46,004
They are the new products

646
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:49,049
from Se-ri's Choice for this spring.

647
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,843
-Se-ri's Choice?
-Are you serious?

648
00:57:51,927 --> 00:57:54,346
Does it mean Se-ri did this for us...

649
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:55,681
I know.

650
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:57,849
My gosh.

651
00:57:57,933 --> 00:58:01,603
I said you don't have to
be like this around me.

652
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:04,898
I don't have any grudge against the lady

653
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:06,024
from down South.

654
00:58:06,108 --> 00:58:08,235
I can't kill my enemy

655
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,529
when she doesn't come
under my observation.

656
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:13,365
I can't even see her now.

657
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:15,117
So I have no grudge.

658
00:58:16,368 --> 00:58:19,037
She wasn't here for a long time,
but she didn't forget us

659
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:21,707
and made things like this for you guys.

660
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:25,210
I don't think she's an ill-mannered lady.

661
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:26,503
I know.

662
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:27,921
She's not ill-mannered.

663
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:30,173
She's really good at heart.

664
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:33,385
The name of the limited line products

665
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:35,679
of Se-ri's Choice for this season

666
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:39,891
is saudade.

667
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:41,935
It says saudade here.

668
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:43,186
SAUDADE

669
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:44,980
What do we do?

670
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,314
What should we do?

671
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:49,067
Gosh, I can't believe this.

672
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:53,488
YEONG

673
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:55,407
Does it say Yeong?

674
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:56,533
Yes.

675
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,161
And this is Wol as in Wol Suk.

676
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:01,288
It says Myeong as in Myeong Sun.

677
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,582
And this is Ok as in Ok Geum.

678
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:07,878
So she got there safely.

679
00:59:08,754 --> 00:59:10,672
I guess she's doing fine.

680
00:59:11,423 --> 00:59:14,509
Apparently, she didn't forget us.

681
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:17,262
I wish

682
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:19,473
I could tell her

683
00:59:19,765 --> 00:59:21,683
that we got these

684
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:24,311
and we will use them well.

685
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:26,063
Where should I say that to?

686
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,191
I believe she will know how we feel.

687
00:59:29,858 --> 00:59:31,151
I hope so.

688
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:39,659
Do you see something over there?

689
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:40,911
No.

690
00:59:42,871 --> 00:59:45,040
I'm tearing up because of the light
from the sky.

691
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:09,981
What are you looking at?

692
01:00:10,649 --> 01:00:11,650
Aren't you coming down?

693
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:13,693
No. I'll be right there.

694
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:16,279
Give me ten minutes.
No, only five minutes.

695
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:17,280
You have three minutes.

696
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:21,159
What should I wear?

697
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,836
Three minutes were too short.

698
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:33,004
Do you like my clothes?

699
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:34,965
I tried to look good.

700
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:38,051
Well...

701
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:42,347
I mean, this is our first date.

702
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:44,516
It's not a date.

703
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:46,810
The weather is so nice.

704
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:51,064
-It's not so good.
-I like it, though.

705
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:57,279
How does this place look
when flowers blossom?

706
01:00:57,696 --> 01:00:58,655
Well...

707
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,073
I guess it's not bad.

708
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:01,408
I see.

709
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:06,079
I should come back here with you
when flowers blossom.

710
01:01:07,956 --> 01:01:09,332
I didn't say I'd do that.

711
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:13,253
I'll be happy if you do.

712
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:22,304
As spring wind blows

713
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:26,516
Scattering cherry blossom petals

714
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:11,561
First of all,

715
01:02:12,229 --> 01:02:13,313
you're pretty.

716
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:16,233
And you make me want to become

717
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:18,818
a better man.

718
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:22,197
You're so amazing
that you make me feel that way.

719
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,033
You are an amazing woman.

720
01:03:07,075 --> 01:03:08,368
I was thinking

721
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:12,539
we should get together sometime.

722
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:15,375
Thank you for coming all the way.

723
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,794
I don't know what to say.

724
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:19,838
It's okay.

725
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:24,134
I had to come because
I'm the one who has something to say.

726
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:33,560
Why are you doing this?

727
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:38,523
I'm going to tell you
something I feel sorry about.

728
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:41,192
So I apologized in advance.

729
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:52,078
I'm afraid my daughter is not meant
to be with your son.

730
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:55,915
Is it

731
01:03:57,334 --> 01:04:00,170
because you heard something about us?

732
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:05,050
We wouldn't need other reasons.

733
01:04:08,053 --> 01:04:09,262
Dan says

734
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:13,892
she doesn't want to marry Jeong Hyeok.

735
01:04:14,476 --> 01:04:18,521
I feel bad for her for spending
the past ten years on him, but...

736
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,190
I am

737
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:24,319
heartily sorry for that.

738
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:27,614
Please don't be.
You don't have to apologize.

739
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:30,617
I'm the one who should apologize.

740
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:35,372
Jeong Hyuk got transferred
without telling his fiancée.

741
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:38,249
And his parents didn't say anything

742
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:41,169
other than that the wedding is postponed.

743
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:44,506
I was upset back then.

744
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:47,258
I wanted you to apologize to me.

745
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:50,929
But things are different now.

746
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:54,099
I'm breaking off

747
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:58,978
this engagement
because my daughter doesn't want it.

748
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:02,357
I should apologize.

749
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:06,152
We weren't being considerate.

750
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:10,198
There were complicated circumstances,

751
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:12,575
but we didn't have a chance to explain...

752
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:16,996
I will explain our circumstances.

753
01:05:18,206 --> 01:05:19,499
Dan

754
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:22,544
has someone she loves.

755
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:27,424
And the guy loves Dan...

756
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:33,972
even more

757
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,224
than his own life.

758
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:42,439
So I have no choice.

759
01:05:43,398 --> 01:05:45,191
We only live once.

760
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:47,902
And they love each other
more than their lives.

761
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:50,238
There's nothing I can do about it.

762
01:05:55,243 --> 01:05:56,703
You are right.

763
01:05:57,871 --> 01:05:59,122
I agree with you.

764
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:01,875
Do you?

765
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:04,085
Yes.

766
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,256
Mrs. Go.

767
01:06:09,549 --> 01:06:11,050
I'm truly sorry.

768
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:13,052
And thank you.

769
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:47,170
I said I would come
to see you this weekend.

770
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:49,297
Right.

771
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:51,174
I know that.

772
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:56,221
But I wanted to come here again.

773
01:06:56,888 --> 01:06:58,640
I once came to this house

774
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:01,142
while you were gone.

775
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:03,895
To my house?

776
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:13,613
I know a man like me

777
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,324
should not do this

778
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:21,162
to a woman like you, Dan.

779
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:26,251
Still,

780
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:29,170
I wanted to give it to you.

781
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:52,193
I came here with Seung-jun.

782
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:53,945
I see.

783
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:57,657
He helped me a lot.

784
01:07:58,616 --> 01:08:00,034
Where is he now?

785
01:08:00,118 --> 01:08:01,494
I couldn't reach him.

786
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:04,497
He went far away.

787
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,084
He will never come back.

788
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:12,046
But why...

789
01:08:12,964 --> 01:08:14,090
I don't know.

790
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:18,136
I don't know the reason.

791
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:21,681
A lot of things happen in life.

792
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:25,977
And we can't explain
why most of them happen.

793
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:30,607
When I went to Switzerland to see you,

794
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:35,945
I didn't know the reason back then.

795
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,865
The reason you kept taking pictures

796
01:08:39,157 --> 01:08:40,742
of the scenery

797
01:08:41,576 --> 01:08:43,995
when I'd gone all the way there
to see you.

798
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:51,252
Shall we get some coffee...

799
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:53,189
But the night when I came to this house,

800
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:57,485
I could finally understand why.

801
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,162
That's...

802
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:12,500
I was looking for a candle that night
and found this by accident.

803
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:16,379
I hated seeing that camera
in Switzerland so much

804
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:18,423
that I recognized it immediately.

805
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:21,926
I took it with me
so that I could throw it away.

806
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,471
After all, I had been your fiancée
for the past ten years.

807
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:28,057
I thought I had the right to do so.

808
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:35,356
This is very old, so I'm sure it's broken.

809
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,316
I got it fixed.

810
01:10:37,984 --> 01:10:40,319
And I finally found it.

811
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,363
Found what?

812
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:47,076
The reason...

813
01:10:48,828 --> 01:10:50,997
you refused to look at me
back in Switzerland.

814
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:58,671
I guess

815
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:01,883
this was meant to be.

816
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:11,619
Don't live too happily, though.

817
01:12:50,741 --> 01:12:52,702
Today is the Mangzhong season.

818
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:54,453
It's the day we plant seeds.

819
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:57,331
What? Mangzhong?

820
01:12:57,957 --> 01:13:00,126
Was he a farmer in his past life?

821
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:04,005
Gosh, Jeong Hyeok.

822
01:13:07,466 --> 01:13:08,843
So you'll be getting

823
01:13:09,302 --> 01:13:11,554
a flower pot.

824
01:13:14,181 --> 01:13:16,392
-What is this?
-You'll know what it is

825
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:18,436
after you grow it.

826
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:21,355
It may be sensitive and fussy,

827
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:23,441
but if you do as you're told,

828
01:13:23,774 --> 01:13:26,903
it'll sprout after two weeks.

829
01:13:28,988 --> 01:13:30,823
You need to water it.

830
01:13:31,532 --> 01:13:34,368
But since it's sensitive to humidity,
don't give it too much water.

831
01:13:34,452 --> 01:13:36,996
-Give it moderate amount of water.
-How much

832
01:13:37,955 --> 01:13:39,165
is "moderate"?

833
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:42,793
Is this enough?

834
01:13:43,794 --> 01:13:45,504
It needs sunlight as well.

835
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:48,507
But don't put it under the sun
for too long.

836
01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:50,843
Keep it under the sun
for a moderate amount of time.

837
01:13:56,557 --> 01:14:00,686
And lastly, this is the most
important part when growing plants.

838
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:03,940
You probably know well.

839
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:07,068
Say ten nice things to it every day.

840
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:11,280
This is so much work.

841
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:19,288
Ms. Sold Out, upper price limit,
stock option,

842
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:22,625
legendary sales, excellent brand,
high return,

843
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:25,962
going public on the KOSDAQ,
the best in the field, limited-edition,

844
01:14:28,255 --> 01:14:29,298
and Ri Jeong Hyeok.

845
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:39,642
What?

846
01:15:13,634 --> 01:15:15,052
How's Chairwoman Yoon doing?

847
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:17,304
She's a bit strange.

848
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:19,515
She's strange in a different way
this time.

849
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:21,475
What is it now?

850
01:15:24,437 --> 01:15:25,813
She's a bit...

851
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:33,404
excited.

852
01:15:39,577 --> 01:15:40,911
In between working,

853
01:15:40,995 --> 01:15:43,164
make sure to stretch and exercise.

854
01:15:45,332 --> 01:15:49,045
Let's talk about that
after the business trip next week.

855
01:15:49,128 --> 01:15:50,421
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

856
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:52,923
As you all know, we've collaborated

857
01:15:53,007 --> 01:15:56,510
with a famous e-commerce company in China
for our upcoming products.

858
01:15:56,594 --> 01:15:59,597
We've incorporated
the new design patterns.

859
01:16:00,181 --> 01:16:02,349
This is from the first batch of samples.

860
01:16:02,433 --> 01:16:04,518
We'll be modifying them

861
01:16:04,602 --> 01:16:06,312
according to what you say,

862
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:08,022
so please share your opinions with us.

863
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:09,440
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

864
01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:13,069
She'd get upset at the slightest noise
when having a meeting.

865
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:15,696
She was the most sensitive person ever.
However...

866
01:16:22,703 --> 01:16:23,954
I'm sorry.

867
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:28,793
That's Chopin.

868
01:16:30,211 --> 01:16:32,171
I like his music too.

869
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:35,758
My favorite one is "Nocturne."

870
01:16:38,052 --> 01:16:39,136
You should take that call.

871
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:41,555
Thanks to her,
the rest of us can take a break as well.

872
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:45,184
-Right. Let's go.
-Yes, ma'am.

873
01:16:52,191 --> 01:16:54,235
I like Chopin.

874
01:16:54,318 --> 01:16:56,362
I especially like "Nocturne."

875
01:16:56,654 --> 01:16:58,364
Seasons changed,

876
01:16:58,906 --> 01:17:01,033
but his messages kept coming.

877
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:04,161
Today is Malbok.

878
01:17:05,913 --> 01:17:08,040
Thanks to you, I'll become

879
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:10,334
a lunar calendar expert.

880
01:17:10,543 --> 01:17:12,920
Appreciate the flowers that bloom
during each season.

881
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:15,923
Eat the dishes that are best
during each season.

882
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:23,973
All right. It's Malbok today,

883
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:25,724
so enjoy the chicken

884
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:27,351
and go home early.

885
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:32,523
I hope you won't miss the small happiness

886
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:36,318
that you can and must find
in your everyday life.

887
01:17:37,278 --> 01:17:39,488
We've never welcomed spring

888
01:17:39,947 --> 01:17:43,409
or sweated during the summertime together.

889
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:45,077
But thanks to his messages

890
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:48,330
that came like presents
every few days or so,

891
01:17:48,873 --> 01:17:52,793
it felt like we were spending
every season together.

892
01:17:53,794 --> 01:17:57,047
I was afraid he'd feel sad if I were.

893
01:17:57,715 --> 01:18:01,385
So I tried my best to laugh, be thankful,

894
01:18:01,802 --> 01:18:04,555
and be happy.

895
01:18:20,654 --> 01:18:24,408
Since it's 12 a.m.,
it must be your birthday.

896
01:18:24,992 --> 01:18:26,285
Happy birthday.

897
01:18:27,578 --> 01:18:28,787
Thank you.

898
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:32,374
I'm afraid this will be my last message.

899
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:35,836
Apparently, reserved messages
have a one-year limit.

900
01:18:36,212 --> 01:18:38,964
And I must go now.

901
01:18:40,341 --> 01:18:41,508
Really?

902
01:18:42,092 --> 01:18:44,345
I wonder if the flowers have bloomed.

903
01:18:48,807 --> 01:18:49,808
They have.

904
01:18:50,643 --> 01:18:52,102
They're edelweiss.

905
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:56,523
I know.

906
01:18:57,775 --> 01:19:01,612
Let's meet in the country
where those flowers bloom.

907
01:19:02,863 --> 01:19:04,990
I cannot tell you the exact date.

908
01:19:06,492 --> 01:19:07,451
But

909
01:19:08,619 --> 01:19:10,162
if we both

910
01:19:10,663 --> 01:19:11,914
try our best,

911
01:19:12,623 --> 01:19:15,167
perhaps, fate will be on our side.

912
01:19:15,793 --> 01:19:17,419
What is this?

913
01:19:18,629 --> 01:19:20,506
He's so vague.

914
01:19:26,512 --> 01:19:27,888
Hello, Yeong Ae.

915
01:19:27,972 --> 01:19:31,225
-They're warm.
-Hello, there.

916
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:33,102
-Buy some tofu.
-Could you give me one?

917
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:35,062
Sure. Here.

918
01:19:35,145 --> 01:19:36,146
Let's go.

919
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:38,023
-How far have you gone?
-How far have you gone?

920
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:39,984
-I'm at the village.
-I'm at the village.

921
01:19:40,067 --> 01:19:42,027
-How far have you gone?
-Here you go.

922
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:43,237
I'd like one too.

923
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:45,864
-Okay. Here you go.
-Thank you.

924
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:47,157
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

925
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:48,367
I hope business will thrive.

926
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:49,618
Goodbye.

927
01:19:54,331 --> 01:19:57,001
Right, is it today?

928
01:19:57,167 --> 01:19:58,877
Yes, it is.

929
01:20:00,337 --> 01:20:02,381
I can't believe it's been two months.

930
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:05,843
I feel this way every time,
but it's been ages.

931
01:20:05,926 --> 01:20:08,012
I agree.

932
01:20:08,095 --> 01:20:11,473
Every time I feel Jeong Hyeok's absence
in this village,

933
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:13,517
I have a great urge

934
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:15,936
to send my husband,
who's doing nothing at home,

935
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:17,771
to the outpost instead.

936
01:20:17,855 --> 01:20:20,607
You read my mind.

937
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:23,569
All right, then. Shall we boil the eggs?

938
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:25,362
Of course.

939
01:20:25,446 --> 01:20:27,656
I'll cook the dishes myself.

940
01:20:28,407 --> 01:20:30,701
And I'll fill his crocks like always.

941
01:20:31,285 --> 01:20:34,830
Great. Let's get to work
and meet in the afternoon.

942
01:20:53,307 --> 01:20:54,683
Aren't you cold?

943
01:20:54,767 --> 01:20:56,352
No, I'm not.

944
01:20:56,435 --> 01:20:57,895
I guess you didn't know.

945
01:20:57,978 --> 01:21:00,606
I naturally have a lot of heat in my body,

946
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:02,941
so I don't feel cold at all.

947
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:05,611
Hey, guys.

948
01:21:07,321 --> 01:21:08,489
What is it?

949
01:21:08,572 --> 01:21:10,491
Are your lips on fire?

950
01:21:10,574 --> 01:21:12,201
Oh, this?

951
01:21:12,368 --> 01:21:14,745
I paid a hefty sum to buy this
from the market.

952
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:17,581
It's from the South.

953
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:20,834
The name of this product is
"Lips that Bring about Spring."

954
01:21:21,168 --> 01:21:22,544
I beg to differ.

955
01:21:22,836 --> 01:21:25,547
I bet the anchovies will think
that it's chojang and charge at you.

956
01:21:25,631 --> 01:21:27,299
What did you just say?

957
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:31,053
If you're all here,
why aren't you working?

958
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:33,180
My, spin around.

959
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:38,435
-Goodness, Yeong Ae!
-You look pretty.

960
01:21:39,645 --> 01:21:42,272
I'm just happy because spring is coming.

961
01:21:42,356 --> 01:21:43,440
Wow.

962
01:21:43,524 --> 01:21:46,860
Besides, I naturally have a lot of heat
in my body.

963
01:21:46,944 --> 01:21:49,238
-I see.
-I see.

964
01:21:54,618 --> 01:21:57,287
It's the spring breeze. Let's go inside.

965
01:21:57,371 --> 01:21:58,622
-Shall we?
-But I thought you had

966
01:21:58,705 --> 01:22:00,582
-It's the spring breeze.
-a lot of heat.

967
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:05,587
It really feels nice to be here together.

968
01:22:05,671 --> 01:22:10,134
As the head of this village,
I should've done this earlier.

969
01:22:10,217 --> 01:22:13,011
I promise to do this more often
in the future.

970
01:22:13,095 --> 01:22:13,929
Right.

971
01:22:14,012 --> 01:22:15,722
Thank you.

972
01:22:15,806 --> 01:22:19,017
I'd appreciate it if you showed that much
hospitality to the new captain as well.

973
01:22:19,101 --> 01:22:21,311
Of course, don't you worry...

974
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:23,480
What?

975
01:22:24,314 --> 01:22:25,399
What did you say?

976
01:22:27,067 --> 01:22:28,902
I have been discharged by my superiors

977
01:22:28,986 --> 01:22:32,072
and chosen as the pianist
for the National Symphony Orchestra.

978
01:22:32,156 --> 01:22:34,283
-Gosh, my blood pressure...
-Oh, dear.

979
01:22:34,366 --> 01:22:37,369
-What's wrong with me?
-Out of the blue?

980
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:40,914
-Yes.
-This is too sudden.

981
01:22:40,998 --> 01:22:43,375
We're going to miss you terribly.

982
01:22:44,418 --> 01:22:46,503
The new captain will be living here,

983
01:22:46,587 --> 01:22:48,255
so please help him out.

984
01:22:49,173 --> 01:22:50,174
Goodness.

985
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:52,718
Then

986
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:55,387
who's the new captain?

987
01:23:00,851 --> 01:23:03,729
-I see.
-It's him.

988
01:23:04,062 --> 01:23:06,523
No, it's not him.

989
01:23:07,107 --> 01:23:09,276
It's him. Over there.

990
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:12,362
What?

991
01:23:12,946 --> 01:23:14,323
-I see.
-I see.

992
01:23:17,367 --> 01:23:18,785
Are you talking about him?

993
01:23:19,244 --> 01:23:20,412
Yes.

994
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:22,873
Hello.

995
01:23:22,956 --> 01:23:25,083
My name is Pyo Chi Su.

996
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:28,003
I heard the villagers are so generous

997
01:23:28,086 --> 01:23:31,965
that the crocks are always filled
with meat.

998
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:34,426
I do look forward to living here.

999
01:23:37,596 --> 01:23:40,766
That's actually a false rumor.

1000
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:44,811
And our villagers
aren't that generous either.

1001
01:23:45,395 --> 01:23:48,148
To be honest, we're quite stingy.

1002
01:23:48,232 --> 01:23:49,274
You're right.

1003
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:53,820
We're not the type to be
overly friendly with others.

1004
01:23:53,904 --> 01:23:55,781
-We're not like that.
-No, we're not.

1005
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:58,659
You won't be able to help it.

1006
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:00,786
I see.

1007
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:08,001
If you leave like this,

1008
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:10,462
when will we be able to meet again?

1009
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:12,464
I'm sure we'll meet once again.

1010
01:24:12,548 --> 01:24:14,383
If I get to perform once again,

1011
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:16,843
I'll invite you all to Pyongyang.

1012
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:32,067
Let's eat.

1013
01:24:32,651 --> 01:24:35,028
-Thank you for the meal.
-Thank you for the meal.

1014
01:24:35,112 --> 01:24:36,780
Thank you for the meal.

1015
01:24:36,863 --> 01:24:38,657
Thank you for the meal.

1016
01:24:38,865 --> 01:24:40,242
Eat up. Here.

1017
01:24:41,243 --> 01:24:42,703
Give us the meat dish.

1018
01:24:42,786 --> 01:24:43,662
Here.

1019
01:24:44,413 --> 01:24:46,164
Here you go.

1020
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:50,919
Put that here.

1021
01:24:51,545 --> 01:24:52,838
Here.

1022
01:24:53,505 --> 01:24:55,632
-Eat up.
-You too.

1023
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:01,221
-Right?
-Yes.

1024
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:05,809
I haven't seen my husband
for quite a while.

1025
01:25:05,892 --> 01:25:07,561
Where the heck is he?

1026
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:26,955
Have some.

1027
01:25:56,902 --> 01:25:59,237
Goodness, I can't believe it.

1028
01:25:59,321 --> 01:26:00,947
-Hi, Mom.
-Hey, honey.

1029
01:26:01,031 --> 01:26:02,115
-Hi.
-Hey.

1030
01:26:02,991 --> 01:26:07,037
I'm sorry. I spent all day playing golf.

1031
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:09,289
You weren't just playing golf.

1032
01:26:09,373 --> 01:26:11,333
It's all part of your business.

1033
01:26:13,043 --> 01:26:13,919
You're the best.

1034
01:26:15,879 --> 01:26:19,049
It's the best choice you've made
in your lifetime.

1035
01:26:19,341 --> 01:26:20,592
What?

1036
01:26:20,759 --> 01:26:22,135
Playing golf?

1037
01:26:22,219 --> 01:26:23,261
No.

1038
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:26,473
Agreeing to leave the business
in the hands of a professional manager.

1039
01:26:26,556 --> 01:26:29,059
Look at how great the company is doing.

1040
01:26:29,142 --> 01:26:30,894
Are you being sarcastic?

1041
01:26:31,103 --> 01:26:32,062
No way.

1042
01:26:33,063 --> 01:26:35,148
Mom, you should tell her that

1043
01:26:35,232 --> 01:26:37,025
a professional manager
may manage our company,

1044
01:26:37,109 --> 01:26:39,027
but I'm taking care of many things.

1045
01:26:39,611 --> 01:26:41,613
I have to look into everything,

1046
01:26:41,697 --> 01:26:43,907
give orders, and confirm things.

1047
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:46,159
Without me, this company would crumble.
Do you know that?

1048
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:47,994
Really?

1049
01:26:48,328 --> 01:26:49,663
Yes, I'm telling you.

1050
01:26:52,958 --> 01:26:54,084
If that's the case,

1051
01:26:54,835 --> 01:26:58,213
may I suggest something?

1052
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:02,718
It's the most ideal business
if we want to reform our company.

1053
01:27:06,012 --> 01:27:07,764
Let me hear it first. Tell me.

1054
01:27:08,432 --> 01:27:11,685
Never mind. You don't have
any power anyway.

1055
01:27:11,768 --> 01:27:13,270
Forget about it.

1056
01:27:13,770 --> 01:27:15,939
What are you talking about?

1057
01:27:16,022 --> 01:27:19,526
Mom, say something. I guess you won't.

1058
01:27:19,609 --> 01:27:23,071
Look at the shares we have.
We have quite a lot.

1059
01:27:23,155 --> 01:27:24,740
On top of that, I'm the eldest son.

1060
01:27:24,823 --> 01:27:27,117
So why don't I have any power?

1061
01:27:27,701 --> 01:27:29,578
Come on, tell me.

1062
01:27:29,995 --> 01:27:32,706
It's about establishing
a scholarship foundation.

1063
01:27:33,665 --> 01:27:36,084
-What?
-It's a foundation that supports children

1064
01:27:36,168 --> 01:27:39,671
from low-income families, whether they be
in Korea or abroad,

1065
01:27:39,755 --> 01:27:43,383
and teaches classical music
if they're talented.

1066
01:27:44,593 --> 01:27:47,387
Many companies do that nowadays.

1067
01:27:48,054 --> 01:27:51,850
I think we could send them
to a prestigious music college

1068
01:27:52,434 --> 01:27:55,312
in Switzerland
where all the musical geniuses gather.

1069
01:27:56,021 --> 01:27:57,022
Never mind.

1070
01:27:57,439 --> 01:27:59,941
Not everyone can do this.

1071
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:03,320
What do you mean? We should do it.

1072
01:28:03,403 --> 01:28:05,030
Honey, do this.

1073
01:28:05,739 --> 01:28:07,783
You'll be raising musical geniuses.

1074
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:09,451
How awesome is that?

1075
01:28:09,534 --> 01:28:10,952
-Do you think so?
-Yes.

1076
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:13,580
Are you sure you can do it?

1077
01:28:13,663 --> 01:28:16,166
Look at her sounding me out.

1078
01:28:16,249 --> 01:28:19,586
Do you think I wouldn't be able to do it?
It's a cakewalk.

1079
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:22,798
Then I'll introduce you to a staff,
so get started.

1080
01:28:22,881 --> 01:28:24,007
Fine.

1081
01:28:24,966 --> 01:28:27,010
Do you want to go to the department store
with me?

1082
01:28:27,093 --> 01:28:28,929
Okay. What do you want?

1083
01:28:29,221 --> 01:28:30,180
Keep me updated.

1084
01:28:30,263 --> 01:28:31,681
-Bye.
-Okay.

1085
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:37,270
You'll be supporting musical geniuses
from all around the world.

1086
01:28:37,938 --> 01:28:40,148
Honey, you're so awesome.

1087
01:28:41,107 --> 01:28:42,692
You truly are.

1088
01:28:42,776 --> 01:28:44,653
And this awesome man is yours.

1089
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:47,155
-You're the best.
-You're so awesome.

1090
01:28:47,823 --> 01:28:52,410
ONE YEAR LATER

1091
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:54,389
Did you not see him?

1092
01:29:57,934 --> 01:29:59,769
It won't be easy.

1093
01:29:59,853 --> 01:30:01,354
The reporters are posting articles

1094
01:30:01,438 --> 01:30:03,940
about how Se-ri's Choice and Queens Group

1095
01:30:04,024 --> 01:30:06,651
have joined hands
in raising musical geniuses

1096
01:30:07,444 --> 01:30:10,947
and are holding performances
once a year in Switzerland.

1097
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:13,867
I'm reaching out to him

1098
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:16,161
by posting these articles online.

1099
01:30:16,870 --> 01:30:19,623
But there's no guarantee
that he'll read them

1100
01:30:20,707 --> 01:30:25,003
or show up in Switzerland.

1101
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,173
It breaks my heart

1102
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:30,300
to see you return
in disappointment every time.

1103
01:30:33,303 --> 01:30:34,596
Waiting for him

1104
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:37,057
is my only way of hanging in.

1105
01:30:44,648 --> 01:30:45,857
But Mom...

1106
01:30:46,733 --> 01:30:47,692
He...

1107
01:30:49,235 --> 01:30:51,029
found me every time.

1108
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:53,907
No matter where I was.

1109
01:30:54,491 --> 01:30:55,492
He will

1110
01:30:57,744 --> 01:30:59,287
find me again someday.

1111
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:04,376
You're right.

1112
01:31:05,377 --> 01:31:07,545
I'm rooting for you.

1113
01:31:11,716 --> 01:31:12,926
Should you be heading out?

1114
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:15,345
I thought you were going to see Se-hyeong.

1115
01:31:15,553 --> 01:31:16,596
Right.

1116
01:31:17,097 --> 01:31:18,515
Our attorney is coming too.

1117
01:31:19,933 --> 01:31:23,770
He's filing for divorce
while being incarcerated.

1118
01:31:23,853 --> 01:31:25,563
Even I haven't done that.

1119
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:27,691
He's giving me a headache.

1120
01:31:27,774 --> 01:31:28,983
I should go now.

1121
01:31:30,235 --> 01:31:31,820
-Bye.
-Bye.

1122
01:31:46,126 --> 01:31:50,004
Edelweiss symbolizes precious memories.

1123
01:31:52,465 --> 01:31:54,467
What should I do, Jeong Hyeok?

1124
01:31:55,593 --> 01:31:59,389
It's impossible for me to cherish you
just as a memory.

1125
01:32:01,099 --> 01:32:02,350
So even if

1126
01:32:02,976 --> 01:32:04,728
we don't meet this year,

1127
01:32:05,228 --> 01:32:06,438
Maybe next year.

1128
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:08,690
If that doesn't work too,

1129
01:32:09,107 --> 01:32:10,400
I'll anticipate the year after.

1130
01:32:11,693 --> 01:32:13,987
Until the day you find me,

1131
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:15,363
I'll be waiting

1132
01:32:16,114 --> 01:32:17,323
and praying.

1133
01:33:17,801 --> 01:33:19,677
That's the decision I've made.

1134
01:33:21,805 --> 01:33:24,474
We only get to live one life.

1135
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:28,436
But I have decided to spend mine

1136
01:33:29,687 --> 01:33:32,732
encountering the love of my life,

1137
01:33:33,358 --> 01:33:34,984
letting him go,

1138
01:33:36,277 --> 01:33:40,281
and waiting to meet once again.

1139
01:33:44,202 --> 01:33:46,454
That's what I've decided to do.

1140
01:33:47,539 --> 01:33:48,998
So if you feel the same way,

1141
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:52,126
come to me.

1142
01:34:38,131 --> 01:34:39,924
I always do this.

1143
01:34:41,175 --> 01:34:43,511
I do well until right before the landing.

1144
01:34:47,015 --> 01:34:48,224
In life,

1145
01:34:48,892 --> 01:34:50,685
it's always the end that matters the most.

1146
01:34:53,062 --> 01:34:56,065
I don't think your landing was that bad.

1147
01:34:56,774 --> 01:35:01,070
I mean, I did land successfully,
but the ropes are all entangled.

1148
01:35:01,696 --> 01:35:04,782
-I think you fell on the right spot.
-Look at this.

1149
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:11,497
No, let me correct myself.
You didn't fall.

1150
01:35:11,873 --> 01:35:13,374
You've descended.

1151
01:35:27,931 --> 01:35:29,390
I've missed you.

1152
01:35:55,583 --> 01:35:57,126
I knew it.

1153
01:36:00,213 --> 01:36:01,714
I knew

1154
01:36:02,632 --> 01:36:04,133
you'd be able...

1155
01:36:06,219 --> 01:36:08,388
to find me.

1156
01:36:11,933 --> 01:36:14,310
But I still can't believe

1157
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:17,355
you've come all the way here.

1158
01:36:21,442 --> 01:36:23,486
It must've been difficult.

1159
01:36:23,987 --> 01:36:26,155
It must've been dangerous.

1160
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:28,366
How?

1161
01:36:29,742 --> 01:36:31,661
How did you come here?

1162
01:36:34,664 --> 01:36:36,457
I got on the wrong train.

1163
01:36:43,673 --> 01:36:45,967
And that very train brought me here.

1164
01:36:47,135 --> 01:36:49,262
It brought me to the place
I've yearned to come

1165
01:36:50,430 --> 01:36:52,265
every morning and night.

1166
01:36:55,518 --> 01:36:56,811
It brought me to my destination.

1167
01:38:20,019 --> 01:38:22,313
I heard you are very good at what you do

1168
01:38:22,396 --> 01:38:25,108
but only accept phone calls

1169
01:38:25,191 --> 01:38:27,276
instead of allowing your clients
to visit you.

1170
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:30,279
A few years ago, I was arrested
by the control officers

1171
01:38:30,363 --> 01:38:32,198
and had to spend some time behind bars.

1172
01:38:33,032 --> 01:38:34,075
Oh, dear.

1173
01:38:34,158 --> 01:38:37,078
Goodness, it must've been tough.

1174
01:38:37,161 --> 01:38:39,539
Don't get me started.

1175
01:38:39,622 --> 01:38:42,208
It was so terrible

1176
01:38:42,291 --> 01:38:45,044
that the spirit that had possessed me
left me.

1177
01:38:47,046 --> 01:38:48,047
"Left"?

1178
01:38:48,589 --> 01:38:51,050
Doesn't that mean
she's no longer spiritual?

1179
01:38:51,134 --> 01:38:52,468
You're right.

1180
01:38:52,552 --> 01:38:55,555
That's why I couldn't offer my services
for some time.

1181
01:38:55,638 --> 01:39:00,935
But recently,
a virgin ghost has possessed me.

1182
01:39:01,018 --> 01:39:03,646
That's why I have outstanding foresight
when it comes

1183
01:39:03,729 --> 01:39:06,566
to dating, marriage,
divorce, and remarriage.

1184
01:39:06,649 --> 01:39:09,068
That's great news!

1185
01:39:09,152 --> 01:39:12,321
When do you think
my daughter will get married?

1186
01:39:14,532 --> 01:39:16,033
Let me see.

1187
01:39:30,089 --> 01:39:34,844
There's only one man
who's the love of her life.

1188
01:39:34,927 --> 01:39:38,598
But three years ago, they parted ways.

1189
01:39:39,182 --> 01:39:42,143
That means there'll be
no more men in her life.

1190
01:39:42,727 --> 01:39:44,437
She's pretty good.

1191
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:45,813
Shut up!

1192
01:39:45,897 --> 01:39:49,233
However, she'll become
extremely successful.

1193
01:39:49,317 --> 01:39:51,068
She'll go abroad quite often as well.

1194
01:39:51,152 --> 01:39:54,655
With the amount of success she'll have,
she won't need a man.

1195
01:39:54,739 --> 01:39:57,617
But still,

1196
01:39:57,700 --> 01:40:00,119
she's going to be lonely.

1197
01:40:00,203 --> 01:40:02,455
Could there be a solution to that?

1198
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:08,002
The solution lies within the capital.

1199
01:40:08,586 --> 01:40:10,421
She could find a man in one year,

1200
01:40:10,504 --> 01:40:12,215
six months,

1201
01:40:12,298 --> 01:40:14,508
or even a month.

1202
01:40:15,176 --> 01:40:16,969
Which one do you prefer?

1203
01:40:17,053 --> 01:40:18,262
Pay her!

1204
01:40:22,266 --> 01:40:23,434
What are you doing?

1205
01:40:25,228 --> 01:40:28,814
I heard this fortuneteller was good.

1206
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:31,359
I was wondering when you'd get married.

1207
01:40:31,943 --> 01:40:35,071
Didn't you always tell me
to live a trendy lifestyle?

1208
01:40:35,488 --> 01:40:38,532
Then let's live that way.

1209
01:40:38,991 --> 01:40:42,119
Being single is the trend nowadays.

1210
01:40:42,203 --> 01:40:45,289
Well, you are right about that, but...

1211
01:40:45,957 --> 01:40:48,918
I'll be busy preparing for my performance
in Russia next month.

1212
01:40:49,168 --> 01:40:50,503
I'm going to rehearsal.

1213
01:40:50,878 --> 01:40:51,879
Okay.

1214
01:40:55,299 --> 01:40:57,802
Goodness, I know she's my daughter,

1215
01:40:57,885 --> 01:40:59,720
but she's just fabulous.

1216
01:41:00,554 --> 01:41:01,847
Ma'am.

1217
01:41:02,473 --> 01:41:06,644
I'd like you to write
a one-month talisman.

1218
01:41:06,852 --> 01:41:10,356
Myeong Eun, let her be.
She doesn't want to get married.

1219
01:41:10,439 --> 01:41:13,150
I never said it was for her.

1220
01:41:13,734 --> 01:41:15,945
Since she's so adamant about it,

1221
01:41:16,028 --> 01:41:19,240
I'll let her live a flourishing life.

1222
01:41:20,866 --> 01:41:22,201
But I'd like a man myself.

1223
01:41:24,203 --> 01:41:27,498
Give me the best one you have.

1224
01:41:55,651 --> 01:41:59,405
It's great news that you'll be moving
to Pyongyang,

1225
01:41:59,488 --> 01:42:01,282
but we'll miss you terribly.

1226
01:42:02,783 --> 01:42:04,952
If you don't want to
be looked down on there,

1227
01:42:05,036 --> 01:42:06,912
you must look sophisticated.

1228
01:42:06,996 --> 01:42:09,081
Stop by my salon to get your hair done.

1229
01:42:09,165 --> 01:42:11,542
I'll give you the Goodbye Hairstyle.

1230
01:42:12,877 --> 01:42:14,211
Thank you.

1231
01:42:14,879 --> 01:42:17,840
I guess that fortuneteller
wasn't that bad.

1232
01:42:17,923 --> 01:42:19,633
In any case, they are going far away.

1233
01:42:20,217 --> 01:42:23,721
It's great news that they're leaving
to live a better life.

1234
01:42:24,305 --> 01:42:26,557
For the past 30 years, her husband
worked in the dark

1235
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:28,851
while eavesdropping on others.

1236
01:42:28,934 --> 01:42:31,562
Now, he finally gets to work
under the sun.

1237
01:42:32,605 --> 01:42:36,650
You're right.
It's all thanks to Jeong Hyeok.

1238
01:42:36,734 --> 01:42:37,777
That's right.

1239
01:42:37,985 --> 01:42:41,447
By the way, didn't you say
that he got a job

1240
01:42:41,530 --> 01:42:44,867
at 4.25 Arts Film Studio?

1241
01:42:44,950 --> 01:42:46,702
Yes, you're correct.

1242
01:42:46,786 --> 01:42:50,331
Then, what exactly does he do there?

1243
01:43:12,061 --> 01:43:14,730
Products from the South?
We sell no such things.

1244
01:43:14,814 --> 01:43:17,650
Are you positive?

1245
01:43:18,275 --> 01:43:20,945
I heard they bought them here.

1246
01:43:21,028 --> 01:43:22,321
That's impossible.

1247
01:43:24,532 --> 01:43:27,868
Shampoo, conditioner, and body wash.

1248
01:43:27,952 --> 01:43:30,913
I can't bear to take showers without them.

1249
01:43:30,996 --> 01:43:34,166
What? You look like you'd manage
without a bar of soap.

1250
01:43:35,334 --> 01:43:37,378
Anyway, we don't have them here.

1251
01:43:38,462 --> 01:43:40,923
Gosh. We're not control officers.

1252
01:43:42,842 --> 01:43:45,094
-You're not?
-He may look like this,

1253
01:43:46,178 --> 01:43:49,098
but he's our captain.

1254
01:43:49,765 --> 01:43:50,766
Hey.

1255
01:43:54,145 --> 01:43:57,189
This is the most popular one these days.

1256
01:43:57,398 --> 01:43:59,108
It's a new kind of shampoo.

1257
01:43:59,191 --> 01:44:00,276
It's from Se-ri's Choice.

1258
01:44:00,359 --> 01:44:01,402
"Se-ri..."

1259
01:44:04,572 --> 01:44:06,824
Is this really that popular?

1260
01:44:06,907 --> 01:44:08,409
Of course.

1261
01:44:08,659 --> 01:44:09,827
It's the number-one best.

1262
01:44:11,203 --> 01:44:15,124
That wench must be making a ton of money.

1263
01:44:15,207 --> 01:44:16,625
You're right.

1264
01:44:19,044 --> 01:44:20,212
I miss her.

1265
01:44:21,505 --> 01:44:22,631
I miss my sister.

1266
01:44:23,716 --> 01:44:25,301
Sister, my foot.

1267
01:44:27,011 --> 01:44:30,514
I wonder if Captain Ri
has departed already.

1268
01:44:31,348 --> 01:44:32,933
When we talked last week,

1269
01:44:33,017 --> 01:44:34,935
he said he was departing this weekend.

1270
01:44:35,019 --> 01:44:36,812
He must have left already.

1271
01:44:38,105 --> 01:44:39,565
And I'm sure Se-ri's there as well.

1272
01:44:47,573 --> 01:44:50,910
As you can see, the customers

1273
01:44:52,369 --> 01:44:53,537
love it.

1274
01:44:57,416 --> 01:44:58,584
That's great.

1275
01:44:58,709 --> 01:44:59,793
Good work, everyone.

1276
01:45:01,504 --> 01:45:02,755
You can go home now.

1277
01:45:03,255 --> 01:45:04,798
Right. I'm sure you all know

1278
01:45:04,882 --> 01:45:07,009
that I'll be on a two-week vacation
starting tomorrow.

1279
01:45:07,092 --> 01:45:08,761
If something urgent pops up,

1280
01:45:11,263 --> 01:45:14,016
decide what to do among yourselves
and push forward with it.

1281
01:45:14,099 --> 01:45:18,604
My phone will be turned off.
I don't want any of you to call me.

1282
01:45:19,396 --> 01:45:21,190
Ma'am, are you going to Switzerland again?

1283
01:45:21,273 --> 01:45:23,734
Did you hide treasure there or something?

1284
01:45:23,817 --> 01:45:27,196
You're not Heidi,
so why do you keep going there?

1285
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:28,280
Goodbye.

1286
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:32,243
-It's a guy, right?
-It's lasting a while this time.

1287
01:45:32,326 --> 01:45:33,327
I think he's a foreigner.

1288
01:45:33,410 --> 01:45:34,912
It's a long-distance one, right?

1289
01:45:34,995 --> 01:45:38,415
We may have to write up
an English press release.

1290
01:48:23,205 --> 01:48:24,748
He just started.

1291
01:48:26,542 --> 01:48:27,751
I know.

1292
01:51:43,488 --> 01:51:45,490
