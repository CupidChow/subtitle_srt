1
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,971
ALL CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND BACKGROUND ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,645
I told you not to come.

3
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:04,606
I don't want you to see my face.

4
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,239
Next year,

5
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,700
the year after that,

6
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:17,995
and even the one after that

7
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,707
will all be good.

8
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,086
Because I'll be thinking about you.

9
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,715
I'll be grateful that you were born
into this world.

10
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,260
I'll be grateful

11
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,598
that the person I love is still breathing.

12
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:43,061
That's why your birthday

13
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,315
will always be a good day.

14
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,187
I thought you had left.

15
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,774
Are you planning to cry like that
once I leave?

16
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,652
No one plans to cry.

17
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,905
Tears come unexpectedly.

18
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,992
I don't want you to cry alone.

19
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,454
Since I cried today, I won't do it again.

20
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,123
I got vaccinated just now.

21
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,884
I heard

22
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,178
by chance.

23
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:00,764
Stop making things

24
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,351
hard for your father

25
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,436
and go back.

26
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,897
I will take care of that matter.

27
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:14,277
There is something called
the Bambi Syndrome.

28
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,865
When a baby deer

29
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,868
meets people in the mountains,

30
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:27,332
people pet it saying it's so cute.

31
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,543
But once people leave,

32
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,087
the baby deer

33
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:35,424
can't go back to its family.

34
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,218
Due to the smell

35
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,930
of people on its body,

36
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:43,974
its family

37
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,475
rejects it.

38
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,312
The baby deer
that is rejected from its group

39
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,607
dies in the end.

40
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,237
Are you worried

41
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:01,491
that I will be rejected and abandoned

42
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,869
by my group?

43
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,204
I will protect myself.

44
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,540
Believe in me.

45
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,251
In my world,

46
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:17,340
I will use my status, people, money,
and everything else.

47
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,217
Cho Cheol Gang...

48
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,136
No.

49
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,597
No one will be able

50
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,933
to take me down.

51
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,144
Believe in me...

52
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,024
and go back, Jeong Hyeok.

53
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,862
Go back to your world.

54
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:52,292
Wasn't it the first time she cried?

55
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,627
You are right.

56
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,296
Even when she crossed the ceasefire line,
she didn't cry.

57
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,299
Even when she got caught
on the smuggling boat, she didn't cry.

58
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,803
And even when she failed to escape
through the airport,

59
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:04,596
she didn't cry.

60
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,102
Just how much did you listen in on us?

61
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:17,943
Why aren't they coming back?

62
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:22,364
I hope the two of them just run away!

63
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,201
Don't say something so dangerous.

64
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,954
Military World Games will be over
in a few days.

65
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:32,457
We must go back with Jeong Hyeok
before then.

66
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:34,876
I am sorry.

67
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,630
She didn't even blink
when I told her that I will bury her.

68
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,715
Seeing her cry so suddenly

69
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:42,968
got me flustered.

70
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:45,887
I will go out for a second.

71
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,190
-What are you doing outside?
-I was worried.

72
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:58,733
Are you okay?

73
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,443
I am okay.

74
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,237
-Let's go inside.
-Okay.

75
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,406
Everyone is worried and waiting for you.

76
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:35,228
I got startled because I didn't expect
such an event.

77
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,481
-I am sorry.
-Don't be.

78
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,319
Were you guys worried about me?

79
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,614
Gosh, no one worried about you.

80
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,908
Pyo Chi Su, I didn't expect anything
from you.

81
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,163
Who chose this cake?

82
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,250
Where did you get
such an old-fashioned cake?

83
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,384
-Let's light the candles.
-Okay.

84
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,970
I have only seen this in a drama.

85
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,515
This is my first time
to light candles on a cake.

86
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,560
Let's turn off the light.

87
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,820
All right.

88
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,822
Let's begin.

89
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,659
-Happy birthday, happy birthday
-Happy birthday, happy birthday

90
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:34,371
-Take this bouquet of flowers
-Take this bouquet of flowers

91
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:37,582
-Happy birthday, happy birthday
-Happy birthday, happy birthday

92
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,751
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

93
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:40,794
One more time!

94
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,964
-Happy birthday, happy birthday
-Happy birthday, happy birthday

95
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:47,092
-Take our blessings
-Take our blessings

96
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:50,220
-Happy birthday, happy birthday
-Happy birthday, happy birthday

97
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,056
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

98
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,225
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

99
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:59,437
I never thought I would hear
the North Korean birthday song.

100
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:03,066
You know that you need to make a wish

101
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,235
before you blow out the candles, right?

102
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,030
Didn't you know?

103
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,202
I am teaching you so many things.

104
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:17,622
All right. Close your eyes

105
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,209
and wish for what you want the most.

106
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,753
You blow out the candles after that,

107
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,547
and your wish will come true.

108
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,893
Did you finish making a wish?

109
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,772
Let's blow out the candles.

110
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,191
One, two, three.

111
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,989
Live a good life.

112
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,198
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

113
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,825
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

114
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,326
Thank you, everyone.

115
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,048
EPISODE 13

116
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:09,716
Come in.

117
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,637
I hope I didn't disturb your rest.

118
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,181
You didn't.

119
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,475
What brings you here?

120
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,436
What is it?

121
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,688
Do you have something for me?

122
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:24,856
Is it my birthday present?

123
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,108
It's a present,

124
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,027
but it's nothing big.

125
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,783
It doesn't matter. Let me see what it is.

126
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,826
Let me tell you in advance

127
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,579
that this isn't a token of anything.

128
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,874
You don't have to give it
a special meaning.

129
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,001
Okay. I won't do that.

130
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,922
I had to do something for your birthday
when I found out about it.

131
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:52,217
And I had a bit of free time,

132
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,470
so I bought it.

133
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:59,808
Although I bought it
without any thoughts...

134
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:03,478
If you think it's nothing,

135
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,356
you can pawn it.

136
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,317
Are you sweating?

137
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,071
It's hot in here.

138
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:17,450
Give it to me. Is this your first time
to give a present to a woman?

139
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:18,701
Why are you so nervous?

140
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,045
It's a ring.

141
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,052
It should fit.

142
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,601
It fits perfectly on my thumb.

143
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,229
That one is mine.

144
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,524
What?

145
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,494
Are these couple's rings?

146
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,539
Is it your first time
to receive a present from a man?

147
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:08,209
You shouldn't have taken it away from me.
Had you waited a little,

148
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:12,964
I would have put it on your finger.

149
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,720
Gosh,

150
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,889
when you said you hadn't dated anyone,

151
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:22,849
I think you were kidding.

152
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:24,851
Tell me.

153
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,270
Where did you learn this?

154
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:30,398
Where did you learn
to make a woman's heart flutter?

155
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:35,778
Give it to me.

156
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,156
Let me do it for you too.

157
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:55,882
Thank you.

158
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,889
It's the prettiest ring I have ever seen.

159
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,516
I won't take it off
for the rest of my life.

160
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,436
I won't mind if you do.

161
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,690
No matter what happens,

162
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,235
I will remember you.

163
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,700
I can't go further
because the road is blocked.

164
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,494
You can't go further? Here, take it.

165
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,916
Why is the road blocked?

166
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,167
For goodness' sake.

167
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,461
-For goodness' sake.
-The hour is late,

168
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,631
so I didn't expect to see you.

169
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,842
-Have you been well?
-Sure.

170
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:25,596
I'm glad you're here. There are
many questions I've wanted to ask you.

171
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,558
-Pardon?
-The house was ready quite a while ago,

172
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:32,145
but why are the newlyweds
nowhere to be seen?

173
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,856
As you know,

174
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:39,944
Jeong Hyeok has an emergency
at the outpost line.

175
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,196
Right?

176
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:43,573
It's just that

177
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:49,495
I saw a strange man go into the house.

178
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:53,708
As the people's president
of this neighborhood,

179
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,587
I was thinking
that maybe I should make a visit.

180
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:02,050
I should have given this to you earlier.
Happy New Year.

181
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,343
-You shouldn't have.
-You shouldn't have.

182
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:08,181
That strange man you saw is my nephew.

183
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,432
His name is Alberto.

184
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,727
Alber...

185
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,689
He recently came back from Europe
when he received the country's calling.

186
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,900
I told him to stay in Pyongyang,

187
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:22,653
but he insisted upon staying here
because he missed the countryside.

188
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,614
-I see.
-Yes.

189
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,657
The air quality is better here.

190
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:27,700
Yes.

191
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:28,701
Then...

192
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,414
She seems to be in a hurry.

193
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,167
She seems to be in a great hurry.

194
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,754
I think she was lying
when she said he is her nephew.

195
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:41,589
I agree.

196
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,132
Is Dan having an affair?

197
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,261
It will be a bloodbath.

198
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:01,859
Hello.

199
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,612
-Comrade Al.
-That's right. I am Comrade Al.

200
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,323
We have met before, Mother.

201
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,159
-Mother?
-I was thinking

202
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:13,538
about visiting you in Pyongyang.

203
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,289
-Me?
-Of course.

204
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:19,502
I am honored that
you've come all the way here in person.

205
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,088
-Dan is here, right?
-Yes.

206
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,006
She is here,

207
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,926
but she drank vodka until sunrise
and passed out.

208
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,302
Again?

209
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,806
I was about to wake her up

210
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:35,101
and make her eat some pollack soup.

211
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,185
Is that so?

212
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,814
Could it be that

213
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:44,735
Dan slept here without telling you?

214
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:48,906
Her cell phone was off all day.

215
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:52,618
Gosh, you must have been startled.

216
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:56,372
I was a bit startled, but...

217
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,002
I will apologize to you in her stead,

218
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:04,338
so please don't scold Dan too much.

219
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:11,095
-Where in the world is Dan?
-She is in this room.

220
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,221
-This room?
-Yes.

221
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:17,727
For goodness' sake. I can't believe her.

222
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,771
Wake up right this instant!

223
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,987
What do you think you are doing?

224
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,913
Mother, you haven't had dinner yet, right?

225
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:39,248
Please come on out and eat.

226
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,924
All of these side dishes look familiar.

227
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:52,470
I think they were in my fridge
until yesterday.

228
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,936
Every table needs candlelight.

229
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:06,108
I heard that you are a British citizen.

230
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,277
What do your parents do?

231
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,030
-Mom.
-My father used to run a business.

232
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,157
He passed away a long time ago, though.

233
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:15,284
My mother remarried,

234
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,913
and I haven't seen her in 17 years.

235
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,873
Is that so?

236
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:28,297
What kind of relationship
do you have with Dan?

237
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:32,885
I have a crush on Dan.

238
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,015
I know that she likes

239
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,476
and is engaged to another man.

240
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:42,979
Why do you like

241
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,064
Dan?

242
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,484
Her disciplined sternness

243
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:52,238
and noble elegance that comes from it.

244
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,368
Her confidence and grace
which make her strong before anyone.

245
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,370
All of those are the reasons.

246
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:04,458
I think they were passed down
from her mother's side.

247
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,462
I like him.

248
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:12,925
He figured out
that your elegance comes from me.

249
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,219
He is a wise man

250
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,639
who has an eye for people.

251
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,851
We don't have that kind of relationship.

252
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,021
But he carried you home on his back,

253
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,608
and you spent the night with him
at the apartment I got you.

254
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:30,234
I told you, didn't I?

255
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:33,112
I only let him stay over
because of some situation.

256
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:36,824
Then when Jeong Hyeok returns
from the outpost line,

257
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:40,202
-will you marry him as planned?
-Why wouldn't I?

258
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:43,331
I am Jeong Hyeok's fiancÃ©e.

259
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,959
JURI MOTEL

260
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,732
It's you.

261
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,818
-Who are you?
-I think you know.

262
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:17,239
I remember. We talked on the phone,
Mr. Ri Jeong Hyeok.

263
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,792
Instead of showing up to an appointment,
you sent someone else.

264
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:31,462
I had an emergency that day.

265
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:34,882
I shouldn't have done that.
I did you a disservice. I am sorry.

266
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,259
Gu Seung-jun told me

267
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,554
that you are a talented broker,
but I should never trust you.

268
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:45,184
Given the nature of the job,
I connect people,

269
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,311
but I'm not necessarily loyal to them.

270
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,774
You don't need to be loyal to me.

271
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,902
Just answer the questions I ask.

272
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,613
I have a question.

273
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:02,576
It seems like the Military World Games
will end in five days.

274
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,913
Does the team's bus return that day?

275
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:07,498
Yes.

276
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:10,251
We need to get on that bus no matter what.

277
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:12,461
I see.

278
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:19,427
And it would be the safest for Jeong Hyeok
to take that bus.

279
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:24,932
His father took measures
despite the danger.

280
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:31,147
But if he doesn't go back then,
he won't be safe anymore.

281
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,567
It won't do if he fails to go back.

282
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:36,652
He must go back

283
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:38,946
no matter what.

284
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,742
She told you not to come?

285
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:46,871
That's right. She said
she will do the housekeeping for now,

286
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,540
so I haven't gone to her place
for two weeks.

287
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:50,583
Are you saying

288
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,502
Yoon Se-ri does the laundry
and cleans the house

289
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:57,381
without a housemaid?

290
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,300
AUTOMATIC

291
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,894
Se-ri, what are you doing?

292
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,228
I am cleaning.

293
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,689
With that?

294
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,571
There are so many interesting things
in South Korea.

295
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:25,743
I would buy everything
if only you could take them back.

296
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,501
This is like a magical pass.

297
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:36,712
People usually call it M.C.

298
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,298
-What's that?
-Mom's card.

299
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:43,260
Since this is Se-ri's card,
let's call it S.C.

300
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:45,387
Get to the point.
What do you want us to do with it?

301
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:48,307
S.C. is a card with no spending limit.

302
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,060
You can buy anything you want with it.

303
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,353
Really?

304
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:53,938
You have no fear.

305
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:57,107
Don't you believe me when I tell you
that I will make you a beggar

306
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:59,109
-in your later years?
-No.

307
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:01,654
Go ahead and spend all of my fortunes.

308
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,906
Do something about your clothes.

309
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:06,826
Pyo Chi Su, you are the worst.

310
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,578
This is driving me crazy.

311
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:11,747
You guys are like fashion terrorists.

312
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,583
Terrorists? Who do you think we are?

313
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:18,128
-We aren't terrorists.
-We aren't like that.

314
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:25,135
Fashion terrorists have nothing to do
with an actual terror attack.

315
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:28,097
It means that you have
no sense of fashion.

316
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:29,765
Really?

317
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,477
We do have a sense of fashion!

318
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:36,647
No, you don't. So do your best.

319
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,109
Before you leave,

320
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,279
I want to give you a present.

321
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:47,032
Buy everything you've wanted to get, eat,

322
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,119
and wear so far.

323
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:52,079
Make sure you do that.

324
00:22:58,752 --> 00:22:59,795
Chi Su.

325
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:05,175
Upon a glimpse, South Korea seems to be
a wealthy country.

326
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:08,220
But the marketplace reveals the truth.

327
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,683
Look at these pants.
They are ripped up like a rag.

328
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,646
They should have patched them up
before selling them.

329
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,232
I think people wear such jeans for style.

330
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:23,986
Style, my foot! Your knees will get cold.

331
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,614
My goodness.

332
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,336
Give me the same pair of jeans.

333
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,468
Do you like it?

334
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:49,303
Buy it in every color.

335
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,430
Buy ten of it.

336
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,848
Can I really do that?

337
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:55,934
My siblings will love it.

338
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,186
Of course.

339
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,688
One costs...

340
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:01,899
Five thousand won?

341
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,068
It's not cheap, but...

342
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,819
Forget it. Buy everything.

343
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:08,197
Are there clothes you like?

344
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,076
There are so many clothes
that I don't know what to pick.

345
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:13,452
This is...

346
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,499
the only thing I need.

347
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,919
-How does it move?
-My goodness.

348
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,630
You know

349
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:29,593
Tonight

350
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:33,138
I am the same as always

351
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,432
Thoughts of you

352
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,101
What are they doing?

353
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,687
I think they are beggars.

354
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:41,939
I knew it.

355
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,483
There are beggars everywhere.

356
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:48,237
I want those clothes.

357
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,534
In secret

358
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:12,428
Hey.

359
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,894
Let's talk about changing
the chairwoman of Se-ri's Choice

360
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:22,604
once more.

361
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:26,567
That item was rejected
after Chairwoman Yoon came back.

362
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,152
What if

363
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:32,030
Chairwoman Yoon has major faults

364
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:35,534
that keep her from running the company?

365
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:41,415
Don't you want to know
where Chairwoman Yoon was

366
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,875
while she was missing?

367
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:54,762
You want to backstab her
as soon as she comes back alive.

368
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:57,222
You are one impressive woman.

369
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:01,518
I am working hard
to make your son successful.

370
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:05,439
If you make me a bitch,
I will be disappointed.

371
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:09,735
No mother would sacrifice her daughter
to make her son successful.

372
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:13,989
I know where Se-ri has been,

373
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:17,117
and the fact that you and Se-hyeong
stopped her from escaping sooner.

374
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:20,245
My husband knows as well.

375
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,332
Se-hyeong is in Hong Kong for work, right?

376
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:26,251
Tell him to come back right away.
Come to the house with him.

377
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:34,843
Last night, Cha Sang-u posted something

378
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,846
that was clearly meant for you
on his social media account.

379
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,267
Look at this.

380
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,855
It must be about another woman.

381
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:49,566
"I am glad you are back safely.
Shall we go out again?

382
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,319
It's 2 a.m.
and alcohol is making me honest."

383
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:55,864
It's clearly and definitely a message
for you.

384
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,660
Why are you making a fuss
about a drunk man's words?

385
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:00,869
Stop and...

386
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:04,581
But reporters keep asking us
if he and you will get back together.

387
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:05,999
Get back together, my foot!

388
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,126
It has happened before.

389
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,212
Was it when she dated Shin Yeong-woong?

390
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,631
No, it was when she dated
that idol singer, Won Ji-hun.

391
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,383
They dated on and off.

392
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,760
-It was a total mess.
-Seriously.

393
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:17,886
Stop!

394
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:20,639
I have so much work

395
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,808
and absolutely no time
for this useless babbling.

396
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,269
Hurry up and get back to your work.

397
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:27,938
Yes, ma'am.

398
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,110
Lee Hyeok, what are you doing?

399
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,736
Come on.

400
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,114
No. Hyeok stays.

401
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:38,907
-What?
-I have

402
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:42,202
important and secret orders for him.

403
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,872
-Hurry up and get out.
-Okay.

404
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:07,185
I guess you weren't lying when you said
you'd go back and date men.

405
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:13,942
Those men just passed
through my life briefly.

406
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,445
Is that so?

407
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,907
Yes, it is.

408
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:25,037
Am I passing through your life?

409
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:27,456
Tell me if it happened already.

410
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:33,503
My goodness.

411
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:36,423
Little Hyeoky, are you jealous?

412
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,175
No!

413
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,093
Whose fault do you think it is?

414
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:42,137
Are you saying it's my fault?

415
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,598
You should have shown up sooner
in my life.

416
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:47,559
How was I supposed to do that
with the ceasefire line between us?

417
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:50,229
That's why I am so understanding.

418
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:53,690
It's a sad history,
not your personal fault.

419
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:55,525
In any case, it was hard for me too.

420
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,070
"Is he the one?" Then he wasn't the one.

421
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:01,114
"Is he the one?"
Then he wasn't the one either.

422
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,952
Since my fated one was in North Korea,
I kept breaking up with men.

423
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,830
It was so exhausting and stressful.

424
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:13,126
Since we met each other
after many twists and turns,

425
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,629
why don't we bunk off?

426
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,216
Are you up for it?

427
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:26,491
Are you satisfied
that you bunked off today?

428
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,038
The day you spend after bunking off
is never satisfactory.

429
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:33,206
Since it always happens without a plan,

430
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,542
you can't do much despite the will.

431
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:38,587
But it's memorable

432
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,422
even if you don't do much.

433
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:43,342
Have you ever bunked off before?

434
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,303
-Yes.
-What did you do?

435
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:49,389
I didn't do much too.

436
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:53,852
I skipped my class
and went outside to take photos.

437
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:59,232
Then I saw someone
who was thinking about jumping off

438
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:01,735
a tall bridge.

439
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:03,987
Who?

440
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,699
She was a woman. She was my type.

441
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:15,540
I see why you said
such days are memorable.

442
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,920
I asked her to take a picture of me.

443
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:23,298
Stop it. You don't need to give me
the details.

444
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:26,468
She asked me if she must take it
at such a scary place.

445
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:31,848
With trembling hands, she took the camera.

446
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,365
Where is that?

447
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,201
Switzerland.

448
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,538
On Panorama Bridge Sigriswil.

449
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,919
That woman was quite memorable.

450
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:03,046
Even after that, I wondered

451
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,799
if she was doing all right

452
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:09,052
and if she would do anything bad

453
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,304
every now and then.

454
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:15,684
Because she was my type.

455
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:34,828
Then...

456
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:38,665
the woman next to you was

457
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:40,834
Ms. Seo Dan?

458
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,589
You said I could do better than her.

459
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:49,009
I wonder...

460
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,387
how many times we have met.

461
00:32:58,268 --> 00:32:59,436
I am

462
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:02,731
very happy now.

463
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,235
They say

464
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:11,656
one sees the flashback
of the best moments in their life

465
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,284
for a moment

466
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:18,788
before they die.

467
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,210
I think this will be

468
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:26,963
one of those moments.

469
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,284
We should win, right?

470
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,078
-What the...
-Look at him.

471
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:01,456
-Oh, come on!
-What was that?

472
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,918
-What are you doing?
-Hey!

473
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,586
What's with all the fuss?

474
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,588
They're watching a soccer game.

475
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,841
What an ultimate entertainment.

476
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:14,010
It's an international competition.

477
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:16,471
Hey, who cares
about international competitions?

478
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,474
-Chi Su is right.
-Right.

479
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:22,269
We must focus on our mission,
which is to send Captain Ri

480
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:24,229
safely back home, and go back home.

481
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,773
-But it's a match between Korea and Japan.
-What?

482
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,276
JAPAN: 0, KOREA: 0

483
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:30,652
Go, go!

484
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:33,196
-Keep going!
-Just go!

485
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,533
-Run!
-Run!

486
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,743
-Run!
-Run faster!

487
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,412
-Go!
-Shoot!

488
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,462
Captain Ri!

489
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:51,381
Se-ri!

490
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,057
-Korea for the win!
-Korea for the win!

491
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:04,144
-Republic of Korea!
-Republic of Korea!

492
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,480
-Republic of Korea!
-Republic of Korea!

493
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,734
-Republic of Korea!
-Republic of Korea!

494
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,613
-There you go.
-Go!

495
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:20,869
-Oh, come on!
-It was so close!

496
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,830
-Good. Keep going.
-Go, go!

497
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,624
-Go!
-Keep running!

498
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:27,917
-Go!
-Shoot!

499
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:37,969
-Cheers.
-Let's drink.

500
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,221
That was great.

501
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:43,850
I'm paying for all the chickens today.

502
00:35:58,782 --> 00:35:59,616
Yangsongi beoseot.

503
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,582
Why do you always say words
that end with seot?

504
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,042
Damn it.

505
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,252
Drink it up.

506
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:12,671
Drink up.

507
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,173
-Hurry and drink up
-Hurry and drink up

508
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,676
-Drink it up now
-Drink it up now

509
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:20,303
If you don't, you're a coward
If you drink it, you are a hero

510
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:21,304
One more time!

511
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:23,431
-Hurry and drink up
-Hurry and drink up

512
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,558
-Drink it up now
-Drink it up now

513
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:28,728
If you don't, you're a coward
If you drink it, you are a hero

514
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:40,699
Thank you...

515
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:48,957
It's even nicer to see you out here.

516
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:55,255
When I found out that you betrayed me,
I got angry at first.

517
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,299
But I understood.

518
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:03,763
One can't only live off
the same food all the time.

519
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:10,186
However, you must face the reality.

520
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,648
Do you think

521
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:17,110
the Director of the GPB will protect you
when you get back?

522
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:22,657
After all, you're the person
who killed his eldest son.

523
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:28,955
After being used, you will be abandoned.

524
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:36,171
Was it the Director of the GPB
that has been providing for your family?

525
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:41,676
Was it Ri Jeong Hyeok who freed
your old mother from the prison?

526
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,847
Could you please just
turn a blind eye to me?

527
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:49,517
I would like to pay for what I did

528
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,353
to Ri Mu Hyeok.

529
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:01,529
Paying your debt to a dead man or...

530
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,783
saving your only child's life.
What's your choice?

531
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,118
What do you mean?

532
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:13,208
It's U Pil from this morning.

533
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:17,170
Sir.

534
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:21,466
Loyalty and Justice.
They're all good. But,

535
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:25,595
the reason I don't pursue them is
not because I don't know they're good.

536
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,097
Rather than those fancy ideas,

537
00:38:28,181 --> 00:38:32,936
I choose to protect my family and my kids.
That's why.

538
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:36,189
Who can blame that?

539
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:43,655
And I used to be a child beggar
who was born on the street.

540
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:48,952
I have no one to protect
and nothing to fear.

541
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:52,789
That's why I can risk everything
and just go for it.

542
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:56,668
If I catch Ri Jeong Hyeok here
and take Yoon Se-ri back home,

543
00:38:56,751 --> 00:39:01,422
I can go up to a higher position.

544
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:06,886
So...

545
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,764
make your decision.

546
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,516
Comrade.

547
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:27,240
I think it's better
that you sleep up here.

548
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,576
I said I'm fine. Enjoy your bed.

549
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:31,828
Thank you, Sir.

550
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,541
Before you guys met us,
you slept in a sauna?

551
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,251
Yes.

552
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,379
But that place was really great too.

553
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:44,799
There are so many interesting things
in South Korea.

554
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:47,844
What else was interesting?

555
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:52,140
I went to a place called internet cafe
with Ju Meok.

556
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,851
I did this thing called computer game
for the first time.

557
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,270
You played a computer game too.

558
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:01,274
Well, it's a good experience to have
at your age.

559
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:03,985
At first,

560
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:07,655
I saw the amateurs shooting rifles
like children.

561
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,200
So I thought, "I will show them
how to do it," and started to play.

562
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:16,414
But it was harder than I'd thought.

563
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:19,709
It's not as easy as it looks.

564
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,753
That's right.

565
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:27,675
So I studied the features
of the weapons and armors I had.

566
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,346
But then some South Korean punk

567
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,265
armed with expensive gears showed up
and messed up everything.

568
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:35,850
Oh, no.

569
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:39,270
I got angry and said,
"Stop hiding behind the computer.

570
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:41,481
Let me see you face."

571
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,442
-And?
-He didn't show up.

572
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:50,031
After all, he was one of those typical
rich and cowardly capitalist bluffers.

573
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,200
That stupid Tomato Cultivator.

574
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:56,955
What was your name in the game?

575
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:00,208
It was Desperate Effort.

576
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,965
-I see.
-So I--

577
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:10,134
Why don't you stop talking
and go to bed now? It's late.

578
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:14,722
Where are you going?

579
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,225
To get some water.

580
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,645
Sleep tight.

581
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:30,780
What's wrong?

582
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:32,824
If you're hungry...

583
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,078
No, I'm not.

584
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:43,418
Is it because you miss your family?

585
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,257
You will soon be able to see them again.

586
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,719
This is all because of me. I'm sorry.

587
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:04,856
IGNORANCE IS DARKNESS!

588
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,734
We have been thinking

589
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:10,945
if there is any way
we could help you, Yeong Ae.

590
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:15,783
And Myeong Sun
has something to say to you.

591
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,286
-What is it?
-I can't reach my husband

592
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,246
who went on a long-term business trip.

593
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:22,915
So I went to his close friends

594
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:24,709
and asked them some questions.

595
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:28,504
Friends, you mean by the wiretappers?

596
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:29,756
Yes.

597
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:31,257
You know how good wiretappers are.

598
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,634
There's nothing they don't know
about our village.

599
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:35,803
You're right.

600
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:36,846
Yes.

601
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,515
Then what did his friends

602
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,225
say to you?

603
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:44,020
They said the incident
the Senior Colonel was involved

604
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,813
happened because

605
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,357
Lieutenant Commander Cho Cheol Gang

606
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:50,818
tried to dig up dirt
on the Director of the GPB.

607
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:55,156
-Oh, my. Yeong Ae.
-Goodness.

608
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:58,242
How dare he tried to mess up
with such a high-ranking official.

609
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:02,163
Cho Cheol Gang must have been
killed secretly.

610
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,581
My goodness.

611
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:06,793
Why does Ri Jeong Hyeok happen to be

612
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:08,920
at the frontline now of all times?

613
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:10,630
I know!

614
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:13,591
It might not be the direct way

615
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,426
to the Director of the GPB,

616
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:18,596
I know a detour nearby.

617
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:21,557
-What?
-The Director of the GPB's

618
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:25,436
-future daughter-in-law's mother's...
-Yes?

619
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,396
nephew who used to live in Europe.

620
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:29,565
What?

621
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:33,402
Goodness. I can't believe I took a bath
with the water boiled in a cauldron.

622
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,490
Now I have done everything.

623
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:40,910
Comrade Nephew from Europe,
are you in there?

624
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,787
Please open the door.

625
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:44,038
Maybe he's not in there.

626
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:45,289
Yes, he is.

627
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:46,916
He's in there.

628
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:50,169
We just saw the cauldron's steam

629
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:53,172
coming out of this apartment.

630
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:54,590
There was steam indeed.

631
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:55,925
Right?

632
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:57,260
Keep knocking.

633
00:43:58,427 --> 00:43:59,971
Open the door.

634
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,889
We can unlock the door if we want.

635
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,308
But that's illegal.

636
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,561
-What's up?
-It's Dan.

637
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:09,814
Well, as the President of the village,
I just wanted to check--

638
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:10,773
Please come in.

639
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:12,024
-"Come in"?
-Okay.

640
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:18,781
Oh, my goodness.

641
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:22,869
Hey.

642
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,080
Hello.

643
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:28,749
Looks like I have many visitors.

644
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:42,555
Oh, my. I'm sorry
that we all suddenly have showed up.

645
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:44,557
Hopefully we didn't
make you feel uncomfortable.

646
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,808
I feel uncomfortable.

647
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:51,105
Yeong Ae, isn't it great?

648
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:56,027
We came to meet the Director of the GPB's
daughter-in-law's mother's

649
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:59,906
nephew who used to live in Europe.

650
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:03,576
But we happened to meet
his future daughter-in-law.

651
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:04,994
What's your business?

652
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:12,919
This is

653
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:16,088
what I got from my mother-in-law.

654
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:19,717
I have been treasuring it dearly.

655
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,427
Then keep treasuring it dearly.

656
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:27,016
As a matter of fact,

657
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:30,311
my husband is imprisoned
by the State Security Department.

658
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:34,815
Could you put in a word for him
to the Director of the GPB,

659
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,400
who will be your father-in-law?

660
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:38,361
I don't accept personal requests.

661
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,072
Is there anything else you want to say?

662
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:45,576
Come on, Dan.

663
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,496
Don't be so uptight.

664
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:53,793
She might sound cold
as the cold wind in the winter,

665
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,628
but her heart is warm
like a spring breeze.

666
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,714
Please leave the name of your husband.

667
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,968
I will put in a good word for him
with my aunt.

668
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:04,929
Oh, my. Comrade Nephew from Europe

669
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,014
can talk sense, right?

670
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:10,726
Please take good care of it.

671
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:12,728
Don't you worry.

672
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:15,731
By the way, I feel like
I have seen you before.

673
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,566
Me?

674
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:21,904
I saw you coming out
of Captain Ri's house the other day.

675
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:23,280
-Is that true?
-Yes.

676
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:25,741
I sent him on an errand.

677
00:46:25,825 --> 00:46:27,326
I needed to pick up something.

678
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:29,829
-I see.
-I see.

679
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,165
That's right.

680
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:38,462
Goodness. I'm finally outside.
It's all thanks to you.

681
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:41,382
I have been staying home
these last few days and it was hard.

682
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,553
Tell me.

683
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,471
Why did you go to Jeong Hyeok's place?

684
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:50,016
You know Jeong Hyeok is at the frontline.

685
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:53,269
Don't you think of lying to me.

686
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:59,442
I don't lie to you, Dan. I decided not to.

687
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:03,279
The thing is...

688
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,907
Ri Jeong Hyeok contacted me
from the frontline.

689
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:08,701
Why?

690
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:12,872
Cho Cheol Gang didn't die
while being transported.

691
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:15,124
He disappeared.

692
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,585
He went to South Korea.
He wants to bring Se-ri back

693
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:20,171
and destroy Ri Jeong Hyeok's family.

694
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:21,714
And?

695
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,092
So Ri Jeong Hyeok...

696
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:28,262
went to Seoul.

697
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:33,225
To save Se-ri and catch Cho Cheol Gang.

698
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:38,397
He didn't want to trouble
people around him,

699
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:41,859
so he didn't tell anyone about it
and asked me favors.

700
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:45,488
So I ran some errands
and set him up with some people.

701
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:47,656
I'm not sure why I did that, but...

702
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:51,994
Dan.

703
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:54,205
Are you okay?

704
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:58,584
Dan. I'm sorry.

705
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:00,711
Don't cry--

706
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,642
All right. Tell me what you found out.

707
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:16,644
Myeong Eun.

708
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:20,397
There is good news and bad news.

709
00:48:21,107 --> 00:48:22,441
What would you like to hear first?

710
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:26,529
No funny business, you punk.
Just tell me already.

711
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:29,740
First, Alberto Gu

712
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:32,451
is indeed a businessman from the UK.

713
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,497
He owns international businesses

714
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,541
all over the world.

715
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,627
-What's the bad news?
-This is the bad news.

716
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:43,462
What are you saying?

717
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:47,216
The Director of the GPB recently
tracked down

718
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:50,302
illegal businesses on a large scale.

719
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:52,680
He tracked down smugglers, drug dealers,

720
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:55,683
and those who got paid
for hiding criminals.

721
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:56,809
Were you all right?

722
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:59,061
Of course. Thanks to your wealth,

723
00:48:59,145 --> 00:49:02,314
I have never been interested in money.

724
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,401
-And?
-There's a British business man

725
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,111
who is involved in the incident.

726
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:10,281
And that's Alberto Gu.

727
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:13,200
What?

728
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,411
The State Security Department
is looking for him.

729
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:18,622
Apparently, he swindled
a lot of money in South Korea

730
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:21,208
and escaped to our country.

731
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:27,423
Then what's the good news?

732
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:30,676
-Right. The good news is...
-Yes?

733
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:34,096
Dan seems to know about this.

734
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,515
-What?
-She knew it from the first place.

735
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:38,225
It means

736
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:41,687
Dan didn't fall for a swindler at least.

737
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,606
You lunatic.

738
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,816
How is that good news?

739
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,235
What's wrong with you?

740
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,487
What's wrong? Why do you always hit me?

741
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:52,239
-What is it that I did wrong?
-You punk!

742
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:05,252
What are you doing?

743
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:11,383
I will send Ju Meok on an errand later,
and I want him to look pretty.

744
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,470
Ju Meok, you can remove it now.

745
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:18,974
What errand?

746
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:22,061
He will look
like a very sophisticated South Korean

747
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:23,979
and pick up something.

748
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:27,483
I would make a sophisticated South Korean
very well.

749
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:30,653
Yesterday, I was standing
at an intersection,

750
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:33,030
and people asked me directions.

751
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:35,199
They thought I was from Seoul.

752
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:37,743
That's not it.

753
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:40,204
Ju Meok, I think you should get changed

754
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,747
before you go.

755
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,165
What? I need to get changed?

756
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:45,834
Yes. Here, we don't wear just anything

757
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:48,379
when we run errands.

758
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:53,550
-Oh, my.
-You look gorgeous.

759
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:54,551
You look great.

760
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:56,637
It suits you very well.

761
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,097
-Does it?
-Yes.

762
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:01,475
Do South Koreans really dress like that
when they run errands?

763
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,143
Yes, we do. I told you.

764
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:36,695
Se-ri usually doesn't ask me
favors like this,

765
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:39,156
but she said she really would like me
to do this favor.

766
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:45,746
She said you were one of the people

767
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,373
she likes the most.

768
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:55,047
She told me you came from
somewhere really far away to see me.

769
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:57,508
Thank you.

770
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,303
Not at all.

771
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:08,018
If there's anything you'd like to say,
feel free to do so.

772
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:21,031
You said

773
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,660
those who love each other

774
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:26,662
will always meet again.

775
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:36,338
No matter...

776
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:40,884
how far you are...

777
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:48,308
You'll always come back to each other.

778
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:53,188
Yes. That's right.

779
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:56,608
True love will always return.

780
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:40,402
-Where's Ju Meok?
-He said he's not hungry.

781
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:42,112
Why not?

782
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:47,326
He refuses to eat anything
on top of the sacred meal he had

783
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,828
with Actress Choi Ji-woo.

784
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:58,504
Ju Meok, let's meet again.

785
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,050
Okay, Ji-woo.

786
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:04,885
Let's meet again.

787
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,851
But the only way to do that
is through unification.

788
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:20,025
Did you do your errand well?

789
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:22,653
-Se-ri, you totally duped me.
-Let me see.

790
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:25,489
How did you deceive me so easily?

791
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:27,616
Didn't you see me doing this

792
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:28,909
earlier in the morning?

793
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,744
Do South Koreans really dress like that

794
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,204
when they run errands?

795
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:33,997
Yes, we do. I told you.

796
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:35,374
What is that?

797
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:39,753
The American imperialism does this

798
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:43,340
as a way of declaring that they will lie.

799
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:47,594
That's right. So even though I did lie,

800
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:49,471
God would've forgiven me.

801
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:57,354
How are you so tolerant of yourself?

802
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:03,151
Thank you so much.

803
00:56:03,819 --> 00:56:05,946
You made my lifetime dream come true.

804
00:56:07,656 --> 00:56:10,909
I'd have no regrets even if I died today.

805
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:13,412
You got the award you deserved.

806
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,665
Love for K-drama Award.

807
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:23,255
Eun Dong, you received
the Hospitality Award.

808
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:31,221
And...

809
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,226
Chi Su, you received
the Fragrant Scalp Award.

810
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:46,361
Are we saying our goodbyes once again?

811
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:50,157
Yes.

812
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,579
Why do we keep saying goodbye?

813
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:59,666
Who knows? This may not be our last.

814
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:07,215
Even still, we should say our goodbyes
in advance when we can.

815
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:16,099
By the way, I gave you my card
so that you could splurge,

816
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,018
but you didn't spend much.

817
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:21,897
So I prepared a gift for each of you.

818
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:27,778
Are you all ready to leave?

819
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:30,030
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

820
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:32,199
They'll be sending us another bus

821
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:35,786
so that the other athletes won't notice.

822
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,749
Aren't you coming with us?

823
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:46,380
A man who goes by Manager Oh
will contact me.

824
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,216
You can go first.

825
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:51,551
I'll join you once I'm done.

826
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:58,392
Good work.

827
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,853
Now I'll lure Ri Jeong Hyeok

828
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:04,356
through Manager Oh.

829
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:07,025
In the meantime, act normally

830
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:10,445
and report
Jeong Hyeok and Se-ri's whereabouts.

831
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:18,161
Oh, my.

832
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:20,455
I think something broke.

833
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:22,958
That's understandable.

834
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,626
Hold my hand, will you?

835
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,170
All right.

836
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:35,429
Father.

837
00:58:35,721 --> 00:58:37,973
Do you even know how old that is?

838
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:40,017
You can't destroy them like this--

839
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,768
What did you say?

840
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:43,937
You should've told me the truth

841
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:45,981
when you had the chance.

842
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:47,107
Father!

843
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:51,695
Are you going to believe these men
whom you've never met

844
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:54,865
or me, your son?

845
00:58:57,451 --> 00:58:59,327
I trusted you.

846
00:58:59,411 --> 00:59:02,998
Then please keep doing so.

847
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:05,500
-It's a misunderstanding.
-Shut up!

848
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:11,006
Why do you think I appointed you
to that position?

849
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:12,883
Because you're competent?

850
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:14,342
Don't be ridiculous!

851
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:16,636
It was because
you were the most incompetent.

852
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:20,974
You're a doormat to your wife
and was conned so easily.

853
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:23,935
I thought if you were aware
of how much you lacked,

854
00:59:24,019 --> 00:59:27,981
you'd ask others for help
instead of keeping everything to yourself.

855
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:29,524
I thought you'd do that.

856
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:31,693
That was why I gave you that position.

857
00:59:32,444 --> 00:59:35,072
Are you saying the reason
you picked me among my siblings

858
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:37,908
was because I lacked the most?

859
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:41,078
I was aware of that, but I had no idea
how much you had lacked!

860
00:59:43,163 --> 00:59:44,414
I made a mistake.

861
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:46,958
I'm going to hold
a general meeting of stockholders soon.

862
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,921
Just accept your fate
and get ready to be demoted.

863
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:54,007
Why are you doing this?

864
00:59:58,345 --> 01:00:02,140
Father, I fully understand
why you're so upset.

865
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:05,477
Please forgive us
for not telling you earlier.

866
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:07,395
Get up.

867
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:10,232
I don't want to see either one of you,
so get out!

868
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,736
Please take a look at this.

869
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:16,613
You can make your decision afterward.

870
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:22,661
That's Gu Seung-jun.

871
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:25,580
He and Se-ri were hiding together
up North.

872
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:29,835
Do you really think it was coincidental?

873
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:38,176
This is something we recently found out
while investigating.

874
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:42,472
Do you remember Gu Myeong-su,
the president of Guryong Corporation,

875
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,766
whose company you forcefully
took over 20 years ago?

876
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:46,852
Seung-jun is his son.

877
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:51,064
He had disguised himself
and approached our family on purpose.

878
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:52,315
What?

879
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:54,234
We had to confirm this

880
01:00:54,943 --> 01:00:56,736
before telling you.

881
01:00:57,404 --> 01:00:58,655
We apologize.

882
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:01,032
Father, to be honest,

883
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:03,410
all kinds of thoughts ran through my head.

884
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,287
"Why were they spotted together
in North Korea

885
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:06,955
when they had called off their marriage?

886
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:11,751
Is the money he stole related to Se-ri?"

887
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:14,671
But first, I told him
to send her back home.

888
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:16,673
That's when he told me

889
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:19,467
to give up half the money
that was scammed.

890
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:21,720
But what could I do?

891
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:24,389
My first priority was to bring Se-ri back.

892
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:27,100
Is that so?

893
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:30,520
I'll have to verify

894
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:32,480
if you're still lying to me

895
01:01:32,564 --> 01:01:34,524
or if Se-ri really did that.

896
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:38,236
If I find out that you lied once again,

897
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:40,780
not only will you lose your position

898
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:43,325
but everything that you currently have.

899
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:47,996
Call her.

900
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,998
I have nothing to say to you.

901
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:52,584
I feel the same way.

902
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:55,295
Father called for you,
so hurry up and come.

903
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:57,464
Mom's not doing too well either.

904
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:01,384
What's wrong? Is it because
of her low blood pressure?

905
01:02:01,468 --> 01:02:03,553
It's all because of you.

906
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:07,182
Were you ever helpful to our family?

907
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:11,228
Tell him I'll be on my way soon.

908
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:25,408
The recording has ended.

909
01:02:31,206 --> 01:02:33,625
That's the route she takes to come here.

910
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:35,835
She drives the car herself,

911
01:02:35,919 --> 01:02:37,420
so do as you wish.

912
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:39,422
Does that mean

913
01:02:39,506 --> 01:02:42,425
you don't care whether I abduct

914
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:44,511
or kill her?

915
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:49,975
You can do whatever you want
to do with her.

916
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:54,145
I just don't want her around me.

917
01:02:55,063 --> 01:02:57,107
That's all.

918
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:02,112
Then I better get ready.

919
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,212
Se-ri

920
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:21,840
just left.

921
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:24,801
We'll be leaving soon as well.

922
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:36,646
NORTH KOREAN ATHLETICS TEAM

923
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:16,394
NO ENTRY

924
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:41,813
Jeong Hyeok should be here soon.

925
01:05:43,898 --> 01:05:46,860
Now that he'll arrive soon,

926
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,779
I think I'm done with my job.
May I go now?

927
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:52,615
Not yet.

928
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:56,453
Once I kill him

929
01:05:56,536 --> 01:05:59,456
and get on the boat with Se-ri,

930
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:02,000
that's when you'll be done with your job.

931
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:05,753
I've arranged the time and place,

932
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:08,840
and he'll arrive soon.
I think I'm done here.

933
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:23,521
There he is.

934
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:51,341
I knew it.

935
01:06:51,716 --> 01:06:53,801
I knew you'd come.

936
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:56,554
You're not a coward

937
01:06:56,638 --> 01:07:00,600
who'd leave Se-ri behind and return
to the North, knowing I'm still here.

938
01:07:01,392 --> 01:07:02,435
You're right.

939
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:06,356
I have no plans
to leave my woman here all alone. No.

940
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:08,900
As long as a scumbag like you is here,

941
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:11,277
I didn't plan on going back.

942
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:11,379
Hey!

943
01:09:01,179 --> 01:09:02,388
Man Bok.

944
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:06,017
Do you have something to tell me?

945
01:09:06,601 --> 01:09:08,353
If you do, please tell me.

946
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:19,364
All my life, I've been reporting things
that I've eavesdropped on.

947
01:09:20,782 --> 01:09:22,533
But you're asking me to speak my mind.

948
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,537
Thank you.

949
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:30,124
I will

950
01:09:31,209 --> 01:09:32,919
tell you what's on my mind.

951
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:35,880
I met with Cho Cheol Gang today.

952
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:39,509
He threatened me with a photo of my child.

953
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,345
I'm terrified.

954
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:46,391
But I'm going to put up a fight this time.

955
01:09:46,474 --> 01:09:49,143
Aren't you coming with us?

956
01:09:53,064 --> 01:09:55,233
I need to stop by somewhere.

957
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:57,652
A man who goes by Manager Oh
will contact me.

958
01:09:58,111 --> 01:09:59,654
You can go first.

959
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:01,614
I'll join you once I'm done.

960
01:10:16,087 --> 01:10:17,755
Tell him I'll be on my way soon.

961
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:24,137
I want to believe

962
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:28,266
that my mom is sick
and everything my brother said.

963
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:31,894
Do you truly believe that my brother
has colluded with Cho Cheol Gang

964
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:33,688
and schemed this?

965
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:35,231
We'll find out.

966
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:40,737
Don't look so frightened. It's unlike you.

967
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:43,489
What's there to be scared of
when we're here?

968
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:44,824
-He's right.
-He's right.

969
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:54,542
Se-ri

970
01:10:55,418 --> 01:10:57,044
just left.

971
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:50,765
Eun Dong, how's it going?

972
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:54,894
Don't overdo it
and make yourself stop growing!

973
01:11:55,895 --> 01:11:58,439
Don't worry. I'm doing fine.

974
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:08,574
What was that? He's really one of a kind.

975
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:11,744
Hey, be careful!

976
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:14,956
Don't worry.

977
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:18,000
We're from the special forces.

978
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:22,755
It's cold out here. Wait inside for a bit.

979
01:12:23,548 --> 01:12:25,508
I hope they won't get hurt.

980
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:27,844
Hey, don't move, okay?

981
01:12:27,927 --> 01:12:31,305
If you don't, I can hit you
every single time.

982
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:54,871
Are you all right?

983
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:56,914
-Yes.
-We're fine too.

984
01:12:57,248 --> 01:12:58,833
Man Bok.

985
01:12:59,834 --> 01:13:01,335
You startled me.

986
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:04,463
All right. Let's go to the next place!

987
01:13:04,547 --> 01:13:05,673
-All right!
-All right!

988
01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:15,933
Hey, I'm serious! Be careful!

989
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:20,229
Are you sure we won't have to pay
the monthly rent for the next year?

990
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:23,316
You won't need to pay it for two years.

991
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:24,817
So march forward!

992
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:28,321
-Let's go!
-Okay!

993
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:07,860
Captain Ri, we're here!

994
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:42,770
I see that you've made a decision.

995
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:45,856
So I'll make mine.

996
01:15:00,204 --> 01:15:01,747
Hey, hey, hey.

997
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:07,962
Hey, what are you doing?

998
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:41,787
Shoot.

999
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:45,499
Why can't you kill
someone as trivial as him?

1000
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:47,126
You're so soft.

1001
01:16:03,642 --> 01:16:05,019
What?

1002
01:16:06,145 --> 01:16:07,688
What was that gunshot?

1003
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:13,402
What are they doing?

1004
01:16:15,863 --> 01:16:17,448
Hold on.

1005
01:16:19,033 --> 01:16:20,159
Who are they?

1006
01:17:07,748 --> 01:17:08,999
No.

1007
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,960
Don't come this way.

1008
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:49,540
Se-ri?

1009
01:19:15,668 --> 01:19:17,586
They say

1010
01:19:18,337 --> 01:19:21,632
one sees the flashback
of the best moments in their life

1011
01:19:21,966 --> 01:19:25,010
for a moment

1012
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:27,263
before they die.

1013
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:32,476
I think this will be

1014
01:19:34,228 --> 01:19:36,230
one of those moments.

1015
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:45,864
Next year, the year after that,

1016
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:48,284
and even the one after that

1017
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:51,328
will all be good.

1018
01:20:03,173 --> 01:20:05,092
Because I'll be thinking about you.

1019
01:20:06,593 --> 01:20:09,054
I'll be grateful that you were born
into this world.

1020
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:12,558
I'll be grateful

1021
01:20:13,267 --> 01:20:16,186
that the person I love is still breathing.

1022
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:22,776
Jeong Hyeok.

1023
01:20:23,861 --> 01:20:25,029
To be honest,

1024
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:27,781
what you had told me

1025
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:30,409
was enough for me.

1026
01:20:31,869 --> 01:20:33,162
I got to enjoy

1027
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:35,998
the happiness

1028
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:38,500
that was given to me.

1029
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:41,295
Se-ri...

1030
01:20:42,046 --> 01:20:43,339
Se-ri.

1031
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:41,146
No.

1032
01:21:42,022 --> 01:21:43,399
You're wrong.

1033
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:45,442
That wasn't enough.

1034
01:21:47,152 --> 01:21:48,445
I still have

1035
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:50,864
more to say.

1036
01:21:53,033 --> 01:21:55,119
There's something I haven't told you.

1037
01:21:57,287 --> 01:21:58,580
I love you.

1038
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:01,041
I love you, Se-ri.

1039
01:22:06,088 --> 01:22:08,799
Judging from what Man Bok has told me,

1040
01:22:10,509 --> 01:22:12,344
you've crossed the line.

1041
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:16,432
You won't solve this issue
by putting your life on the line.

1042
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:18,559
That's what we're saying.

1043
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:21,311
I'm sorry to all of you.

1044
01:22:21,979 --> 01:22:23,439
But I cannot go.

1045
01:22:23,522 --> 01:22:27,401
-Go first and--
-We just want you to put more on the line.

1046
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:29,778
There's still more.

1047
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:35,784
You have us.

1048
01:22:36,326 --> 01:22:39,246
We're from your troop.

1049
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:42,207
In our current situation,
you're as important as our country for us.

1050
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:44,209
Give us your orders.

1051
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:48,255
-I cannot do that.
-Captain Ri.

1052
01:22:48,338 --> 01:22:49,840
Se-ri has become

1053
01:22:50,799 --> 01:22:52,634
a valuable friend to us as well.

1054
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:55,137
Please give us your orders.

1055
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:04,021
Master Sergeant Pyo.

1056
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:05,439
Yes, sir.

1057
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:06,940
First Lieutenant Park.

1058
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:08,358
Yes, sir.

1059
01:23:08,442 --> 01:23:09,776
Staff Sergeant Kim.

1060
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:11,904
-Yes, sir.
-Private First Class Geum.

1061
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:13,030
Yes, sir.

1062
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:14,865
Do everything in your power

1063
01:23:15,449 --> 01:23:16,825
to protect Se-ri.

1064
01:23:17,451 --> 01:23:18,869
That is all.

1065
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:24,875
I trust you.

1066
01:24:09,336 --> 01:24:10,420
No.

1067
01:24:12,339 --> 01:24:13,882
No.

1068
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:15,509
Please...

1069
01:24:15,926 --> 01:24:16,802
Please...

1070
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:19,304
Please help us.

1071
01:24:30,691 --> 01:24:32,693
