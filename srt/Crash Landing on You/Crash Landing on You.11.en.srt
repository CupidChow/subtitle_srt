1
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,971
ALL CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND BACKGROUND ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:31,258
Ma'am.

3
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:33,844
-Are you heading home now?
-Yes.

4
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,555
-Thank you for your hard work.
-Have a safe trip.

5
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,909
Hey.

6
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,666
What are you doing?

7
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:08,337
-I'm on patrol.
-We'll take care of this area.

8
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,297
Just make sure
the lights in the offices are off.

9
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,803
Who is he? I've never seen him before.

10
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:21,642
He's the Korean Chinese guy
we recently hired as backup.

11
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:23,852
From martial arts to shooting,
he's good at everything.

12
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:24,811
I see.

13
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,271
I'd been looking everywhere for you.

14
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,151
You only said you lived
around Cheongdam-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul.

15
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,822
You didn't tell me the exact address.

16
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:21,618
You know,

17
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:25,288
I don't like dreams like this.

18
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:27,916
When I wake up,

19
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,335
I'll be so sad.

20
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:37,008
Even if you look at me like that,
it doesn't make me happy at all.

21
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,969
But this isn't a dream.

22
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,263
Are you sure?

23
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:43,765
Yes, I am sure.

24
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:10,417
But how did you come here?

25
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,420
And what happened to your face?

26
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,839
Are you hurt?

27
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,093
I'm fine.

28
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:35,025
It's a gold mine dug out
for drilling purposes under Japanese rule.

29
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,485
It's no longer in use.

30
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,321
It looks like we can safely assume

31
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,865
that Cho Cheol Gang went to the South
using this route.

32
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,410
But the thing is, it's very old.

33
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:49,206
And because Cho Cheol Gang
excavated his way to the South,

34
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,500
it can collapse anytime.

35
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,150
To pass through
a 10km-long artificial cave

36
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,945
that's big enough for just one person,

37
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:23,698
it'll take at least 20 hours
without any rest.

38
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,743
And if you arrive at the end safely...

39
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,131
you'll see a natural cave
leading to the ocean.

40
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,359
I can believe everything else,

41
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,446
but not you when you say that you're fine.

42
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,156
I'm really fine.

43
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,034
Nothing happened.

44
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,517
We should get him to do it when he's back.

45
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,354
Why do we have to do this
in the middle of the night?

46
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:21,024
What if the taste changes
because we took our sweet time?

47
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:25,904
Honey.

48
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,864
Come here for a second.

49
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,800
POLICE

50
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,145
I found it!

51
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:15,787
So...

52
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:17,580
What happened?

53
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,959
What are you doing here?

54
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,212
Did you

55
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,965
-defect from the North because of me?
-No.

56
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,051
-Then are you here as a spy?
-No.

57
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:31,928
Then,

58
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,722
are you here for good?

59
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,515
Of course not.

60
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,434
I'm just visiting.

61
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,812
Well, it's not like
you just crossed the Han River.

62
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,816
You can't really "visit" the South
from where you live.

63
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,902
Also, if it's this easy
to come to the South from there,

64
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,155
why was I stuck there
for such a long time?

65
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,742
-It wasn't exactly easy--
-Do your parents know about this?

66
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,494
If your father finds out,
he'll be furious.

67
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,163
What did you tell them?

68
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,124
I'd like to answer your questions,

69
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,210
-so stop asking me more questions.
-Okay.

70
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,014
Cho Cheol Gang.

71
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,059
He's here now.

72
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,602
What?

73
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:24,564
He was supposed to receive
criminal punishment for what he did,

74
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,608
but he disappeared during transport.

75
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,695
And he came here because he's after you.

76
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,405
Me?

77
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,117
So you're saying...

78
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:42,123
you came here because you were afraid
that Cho Cheol Gang might harm me?

79
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,460
Despite all the dangers?
You came here for me?

80
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,378
Well, not just because of you.

81
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,381
He won't stop at attacking you.

82
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:54,761
He'll use you to try to sabotage me,
my father, and my entire family.

83
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,471
I came here to stop that.

84
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,349
Not just to protect you.

85
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:07,065
So if you're only here for a short while,
when do you have to go back?

86
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,400
As soon as I catch him,

87
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,528
even if it's tonight.

88
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,197
Right after you catch him?

89
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,497
Okay, all right.

90
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:27,335
But if I'm his first target,

91
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,380
I guess protecting me
should be your first mission.

92
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,215
And to do that,

93
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,051
you'll have to stay with me.

94
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:36,678
Right by my side.

95
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:42,725
Let's get out of here.

96
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,939
I'm not cold.

97
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,358
That's not why I'm putting this on you.

98
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,944
You see, the South is a scary place.

99
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,655
You're surrounded by security cameras,
dashcams, and phones.

100
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,740
And the fastest internet connection
in the world.

101
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,242
If your face is caught on anything,

102
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,536
it only takes 30 minutes
for it to spread nationwide.

103
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,580
So you have to cover your face.

104
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:07,458
It won't happen,
but you shouldn't be seen.

105
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,421
And our conversations too.

106
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,465
The National Intelligence Service
and the police

107
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:18,386
would go bonkers if they heard us.
It's very dangerous.

108
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,972
I guess we have no choice.

109
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:25,727
Unfortunately, we have to make sure
no one else but I can see you

110
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,898
and no one can listen in
on our conversations,

111
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:33,818
so we'll have to find a confined space

112
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:38,656
where only you and I know and stay there.

113
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:40,199
Let's go.

114
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,201
I'll hide you.

115
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,048
Well...

116
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,009
This is where I live.

117
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,682
Make yourself at home.

118
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,102
I feel comfortable.

119
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,856
Do you want to wash up first?

120
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,028
What's wrong?
I just thought you'd be tired.

121
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,573
Why are you looking at me like that?

122
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,617
That's embarrassing.

123
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,410
Well...

124
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,539
I'll do it later.
You don't need to ask me.

125
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,586
Aren't you hungry? Do you want some food?

126
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,972
-What do you eat?
-Gosh, you scared me.

127
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:51,562
You kept bragging about your money.

128
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,900
How come you have no food at your place?

129
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,029
Well...

130
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,865
Didn't I tell you?

131
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,410
My nickname is Picky Princess.

132
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:09,789
It's so good.

133
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,626
But you're not a picky eater.

134
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:18,339
Regardless of what I'm eating,
I usually never eat more than three bites.

135
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,008
Since the day I met you,

136
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,552
I've never seen you eat
less than three bites of food.

137
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,846
That was a special circumstance, though.

138
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:28,057
I thought I might not
be able to eat again,

139
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,393
so I instinctively ate more to survive.

140
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,229
We can order food.
Tell me what you feel like eating.

141
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,356
Pizza? Chinese food?

142
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,357
Or fried chicken?

143
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:41,112
Why are there
so many chicken restaurants in the South?

144
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,240
So many people eat chicken here.

145
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,327
I wonder how much that is.

146
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:52,457
Who cares? I can't even bring myself
to pull out my wallet.

147
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,837
Come on. What are you guys doing?

148
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,964
Hey, comrade!

149
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,594
"Comrade"? Did you forget
what we learned in the training?

150
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,471
Gosh, people will hear you.

151
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:09,057
Then I'll talk like the people here.

152
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,350
Brother.

153
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,687
Man Bok, just talk casually to us.

154
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,818
Well, okay. Talk.

155
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,947
I personally think that
we should think of drumsticks

156
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,909
as our parents' enemies
and destroy them by eating them all.

157
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,956
But our fund is limited.

158
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,793
It'd be great
if we could find Captain Ri quickly.

159
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,754
But if not, we'll need
quite a bit of money to stay here.

160
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,174
So we should be frugal, don't you think?

161
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,193
Delivery for you!

162
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:06,531
Eat up.

163
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,539
-What is this?
-I heard this is what people do here.

164
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,166
When the host offers you food,

165
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,585
you should offer the host
to take the first bite.

166
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,379
I heard it's part of table manners.

167
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,048
What is this about?

168
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:34,934
What's with that gaze?

169
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,353
I still can't believe it.

170
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,272
The fact that

171
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:43,317
you're sitting by my side at my place
and eating with me.

172
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,032
How are things
between you and your family?

173
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:56,289
Things are great.
I guess you were worried about that.

174
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,959
To tell you the truth,
I was also worried when I was there,

175
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,378
but you were right.

176
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,882
-I was?
-Yes, you were absolutely right.

177
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,010
No matter how much we hate each other,
we're a family after all.

178
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:12,805
We always fought
because we couldn't stand each other,

179
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,599
but when I came back alive,

180
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,727
everyone was so happy to see me again.

181
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,520
So all is good now.

182
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,606
I'm relieved.

183
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,941
Everything's been great with me.

184
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:28,279
I thought it'd be nice to tell you
how well I'm doing,

185
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:32,825
but it's not like
I could e-mail or call you.

186
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,076
But you're here.

187
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,498
I'm so glad
I can tell you in person like this.

188
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,876
So you don't need to worry about me

189
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,212
when you go back.

190
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,851
Don't be so alarmed.

191
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,729
This is the Republic of Korea,
and I'm not a nobody here.

192
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,649
And this building is known
for its tight security.

193
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:13,157
What? What are they doing here
at this hour?

194
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,496
Who are they?

195
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,749
My second oldest brother and his wife.

196
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,668
Why are they here so late?

197
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,712
Eat. They'll ring the doorbell
a few more times and leave.

198
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,387
-Is she out?
-I'm sure she's home.

199
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,222
She's just ignoring us.

200
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,307
I know her key code.

201
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,268
Press it, then.

202
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,817
Are you sure security is tight here?

203
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,612
Just go into the room for now.
Take your jacket.

204
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:54,574
Damn it.

205
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,663
What are you doing?
This is considered trespassing.

206
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,332
Give me a break. I'm your brother.

207
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,252
-Hey, where--
-Why did you block our calls?

208
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,878
Who said you could come in?

209
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,683
Why are you here? What is this about?

210
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,435
Se-ri.

211
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,355
We know everything.

212
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,233
-About what?
-We know where you were

213
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,193
during the time we didn't hear from you.

214
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:35,114
You know what even I don't know?

215
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:38,826
Hey, don't play dumb. I can't stand it.

216
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,287
You were in North Korea.

217
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,581
You're a public figure.

218
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,542
What do you think will happen
if people find out?

219
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,919
"It was an accident.
I don't remember anything."

220
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,381
I guess you can keep giving excuses,
but no one will believe you.

221
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:55,301
I don't understand
what you're trying to say.

222
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,428
I'll put it in simple terms for you.

223
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:01,515
The game is over now.
I've inherited Dad's position,

224
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,559
and I'm the CEO of Queens now.

225
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,811
So you'd better not get cheeky with me.

226
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,773
I know you won't just sit still.

227
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:13,069
But if you try to cook up a ruse
to win Dad over or do anything funny...

228
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:18,240
Burying someone alive
is a piece of cake these days.

229
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,242
Do you get what I'm saying now?

230
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,580
There are many things I can do
to make sure you can never walk around

231
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:25,873
with your head up.

232
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:31,462
Se-hyeong.

233
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:35,257
I still have no idea
what you're talking about,

234
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,718
so please leave,

235
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:39,345
will you?

236
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,807
You're going to keep playing dumb?

237
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,686
Don't assume that we're saying this
without proof.

238
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,439
-We have evidence.
-What do you think?

239
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,900
They're over the moon happy
that you're alive.

240
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,362
Really? Who? My mom? My dad?

241
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,155
All of them, I heard.

242
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,617
Everyone from your parents to brothers
are so happy.

243
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,161
We have other recordings too.

244
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,747
We have photos as well.
There's plenty of evidence.

245
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:12,420
All right.

246
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,131
So according to what you're saying,

247
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,717
I went to North Korea
and met Gu Seung-jun.

248
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,804
And the two of you knew everything.

249
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,724
-That's right.
-But I guess...

250
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,602
you never considered
getting me out of there.

251
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,149
-What?
-Did you want me to live there forever?

252
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:34,734
Or were you

253
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:36,444
hoping that I'd die?

254
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,613
Jeez, what's this girl saying?

255
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,657
Of course, we considered
getting you out of there.

256
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:42,950
But,

257
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:44,910
this is huge.

258
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:48,664
If we aren't careful,
the entire family may get in trouble--

259
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:52,251
I heard there are three types of people
you should never forget.

260
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,503
People who help you when you're stuck.

261
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,630
People who leave you alone
when you're stuck.

262
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,382
And...

263
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,926
people who cornered you
into that situation.

264
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,888
And that's why

265
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:07,349
I'll never forget the two of you.

266
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,226
Are you threatening us or what?

267
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,771
-How dare you try to threaten--
-Honey.

268
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:13,856
Today, we should just leave.

269
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:14,899
Hey.

270
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:17,109
Know your place, okay?

271
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,153
You lucked out and came back alive,

272
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,947
so just be grateful
and don't cause trouble.

273
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,657
This is your last warning.

274
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:05,658
Just...

275
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,495
don't say anything.

276
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,706
I'm too embarrassed.

277
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:15,960
I won't say anything.

278
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,438
This is better.

279
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,441
It's quiet.

280
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,695
And it's warm.

281
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:44,655
This somehow...

282
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,741
makes me less angry.

283
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,411
But I'm angry.

284
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:54,498
I was so angry I almost forgot
my situation and ran out.

285
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:05,009
But...

286
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,262
don't forget

287
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,765
that the person
you should never forget in your life

288
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,102
is not someone you hate
but someone you like.

289
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,105
While keeping someone you hate
in your heart,

290
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,149
your heart

291
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,276
will be scarred and hurt.

292
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,154
It will only be your loss.

293
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:30,367
And I know you hate losing
than anyone else does.

294
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,078
I do.

295
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:38,042
I'm a businesswoman.
Losing is what I hate the most.

296
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:41,295
Then keep only people you like
in your heart.

297
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:45,299
Only then can you eat well and sleep well.

298
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,804
Even if...

299
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,392
that person isn't by my side?

300
00:23:58,854 --> 00:23:59,980
Yes.

301
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:17,956
You're right.

302
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,085
One should eat well and sleep well
to stay healthy.

303
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:24,755
And one should stay healthy
to beat others.

304
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:27,216
Now that I think about it,

305
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,259
that's more profitable.

306
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:31,929
It is profitable.

307
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,946
Do you think South Korea knew
we were coming

308
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,032
and turned all the lights on?

309
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,993
It can't be true, right?

310
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:57,830
Will all those lights stay on
the entire night?

311
00:24:58,414 --> 00:24:59,707
Will they not be turned off?

312
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,960
I didn't know it would be
actually like in the dramas.

313
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,295
I couldn't quite believe it.

314
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:09,633
If it's always bright like this,

315
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:14,638
U Pil would be able to do
his homework every day.

316
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,434
That would be really nice.

317
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,395
I wonder

318
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:24,606
where Captain Ri is now,
among all the places there.

319
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:26,775
I rather wonder

320
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,155
where we will be staying tonight

321
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,407
among all the places there.

322
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,252
CHARCOAL SAUNA

323
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,012
If there's Heaven, this must be it.

324
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:00,684
I wish I could take
my mother here just once.

325
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:04,313
When I saw it in dramas,
I didn't think it would be this good.

326
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:06,398
But it's really nice.

327
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,859
Comrades.

328
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,238
I mean, friends.

329
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:16,492
You're getting too loose about capitalism.

330
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,328
Don't be distracted
by the nice hot feeling.

331
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,038
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

332
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:28,295
Today, we paid a whopping 12,000 won
per person to enter this place.

333
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:31,340
Make sure to save the warmth
and not waste the money

334
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:34,927
so that we can carry out our mission
in the cold wind tomorrow.

335
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,265
By the way,

336
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:43,560
I'm hungry.

337
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:48,690
As I said,

338
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:52,694
we paid a whopping 12,000 won
per person to be sitting here--

339
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,287
How?

340
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,039
I have all the money.

341
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,707
I have no idea.

342
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:09,878
The shop owner just gave them to me
and said she didn't need any cash.

343
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:14,675
Really? She just gave them
to you for free?

344
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:15,634
Yes.

345
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:19,638
She just said I needed to show her this.

346
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,933
Capitalism is very generous.

347
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,226
Gwang Beom,

348
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:27,688
maybe she gave them to you for free
because you are good-looking.

349
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:31,525
Then I should give it a shot too.

350
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:34,319
Let's eat.

351
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:37,698
Thank you for the food.

352
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,366
Be careful. It's hot.

353
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:41,952
Take this.

354
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,392
MEN'S SHOES LOCKER

355
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,352
MEN'S BATH, WOMEN'S BATH

356
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:15,152
We paid 12,000 won per person
for such luxury.

357
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,821
It wasn't that bad a deal.

358
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:19,323
-It wasn't indeed.
-No.

359
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,373
Excuse me.

360
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:29,958
You need to check out the bracelet.

361
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,504
One of you got the scrubbing service.

362
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,341
That would be 137,000 won in total.

363
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,386
Who got scrubbed?

364
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:56,985
You look so beautiful.

365
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,323
Goodness, Wol Suk.

366
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,075
You look so beautiful.

367
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,535
Talk about yourself.

368
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:08,872
Just a little bit of touch,
you can look so sophisticated.

369
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:10,582
You should do this more often.

370
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:14,002
Right? We never doll up,

371
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:17,297
but when we do,
we can be just as pretty as actresses.

372
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:19,424
-That's true.
-Right?

373
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,762
-Oh, my.
-Yeong Ae!

374
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:27,891
-Yeong Ae!
-Look who is here.

375
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:29,101
Goodness.

376
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:33,647
Yeong Ae,

377
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:37,109
you dressed up so nicely all the guys
that see you will get nosebleeds.

378
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,987
Come on. Don't tell me porkies.

379
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,613
-I'm not.
-We are not.

380
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:45,158
I thought spring was walking in
in the middle of the winter.

381
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:46,576
Me too.

382
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,289
By the way,
is the fortune teller that good?

383
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:52,749
She's good.

384
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:55,377
For the last five years,
what she said about my husband's promotion

385
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,837
was all correct.

386
00:29:57,838 --> 00:29:58,797
-Promotion?
-Promotion?

387
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,508
For the last five years,
he failed to get any promotion.

388
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:03,635
She's good.

389
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,022
You didn't bring anyone with you, did you?

390
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,482
No way. Don't worry.

391
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,526
One of us is even keeping watch outside.

392
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:27,868
That means it's all clear.

393
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,787
Two of us were caught this week.

394
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:33,290
I can't sleep at night
because I'm so scared.

395
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:38,003
But you're a good fortune teller.
Can't you see your own future?

396
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:41,298
Come on.

397
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:45,218
She serves a South Korean ghost.

398
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:48,055
So she's not so good at predicting things

399
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:49,973
regarding the control officers and prison.

400
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:51,433
-Is that so?
-Yes.

401
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,978
Instead, regarding money, your children,

402
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:57,439
your husband's promotion, and health,

403
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,233
she's really good.

404
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:01,651
-That's right.
-Of course.

405
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,987
Then...

406
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:09,451
could you tell me what I should do
to make my son study hard?

407
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,620
I really want him to go
to the medical school.

408
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,872
Medical school? Let me see.

409
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,342
I don't hear anything.

410
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,720
As long as the spirit can hear the sound,

411
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:31,390
what we hear doesn't mean anything.

412
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,433
-Of course.
-For sure.

413
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:36,019
If the bell sound gets out,
the control officers will show up.

414
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:37,312
-Of course.
-You're right.

415
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,202
You girls are in trouble.

416
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,454
That's South Korean accent.

417
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,666
Your husband went somewhere far away.

418
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,251
-Goodness.
-Oh, my gosh.

419
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:02,838
He will be in Pyongyang for a month
to carry out a mission.

420
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:06,758
He's not in Pyongyang.
He traveled farther away.

421
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:08,093
-What?
-What?

422
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:10,804
I don't think he can come back.

423
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,681
-What?
-What?

424
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,975
What do you mean?

425
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,935
Why can't he come back?

426
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,605
You have your own problem to worry about.

427
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,107
Me?

428
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,280
There will be a bloodbath in this village.

429
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,698
"Bloodbath"?

430
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,409
I'm scared.

431
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,080
I want something sweet.

432
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:39,749
Here's something sweet.

433
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:48,633
What's up?

434
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,261
What are you doing?

435
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,891
Get off of me! I said get off of me!

436
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,018
-What are you doing?
-Take him.

437
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,769
What on earth are you doing now?

438
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,147
Let go of me!

439
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,695
-What's all this?
-Take him.

440
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,364
Get off of me.

441
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,245
Let go of me!

442
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:23,752
Pack your bags now.

443
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:27,422
What? Pack what?

444
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,633
-Hurry!
-What's up?

445
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:32,052
Cho Cheol Gang had our back,
but he got busted.

446
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,470
Busted? Because of what?

447
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:34,721
Everything.

448
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,182
Even the keeping business got busted.

449
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:38,850
So?

450
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:41,686
There had been an accident
while he was being transported,

451
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,522
and I don't know if he's alive now.

452
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:48,485
What I know for sure is we'll be dead meat
if we get caught here.

453
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:49,736
Dead?

454
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:53,406
What on earth is going on?

455
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,325
It's all because or Ri Jeong Hyeok.

456
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,577
If you had not helped Ri Jeong Hyeok,

457
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:59,996
Cho Cheol Gang would not have been caught.

458
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,290
Are you blaming me again? Is it my fault?

459
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:03,667
It's my fault.

460
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,794
You won't abandon me, will you?

461
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:08,630
Hey, Brother. Don't abandon me.

462
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:10,840
Just pack your things already!

463
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,552
They are already packed.

464
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,055
Mr. Cheon Su Bok.

465
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,018
-Let's go.
-Let go of me.

466
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,062
Let go of me!

467
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,730
Don't come out.

468
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:44,958
Father.

469
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:49,546
I'm truly sorry
I have to inform you of this.

470
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,633
Cho Cheol Gang, the man who disappeared
at the patrol wagon accident,

471
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,760
is the one that killed my brother.

472
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,972
And he's after the woman I love.

473
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:03,184
Now we have the definite evidence
that he escaped to South Korea,

474
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:06,229
I can't just sit back and watch.

475
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:10,483
I can't let him hurt
another person I love the most.

476
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:14,112
If it happens again,

477
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,741
I will never forgive myself
for the rest of my life.

478
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:21,578
There is one month left
until the company switch.

479
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,081
I promise to come back before that.

480
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,375
Please don't worry.

481
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,276
What happened?

482
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,612
Did you hear anything from him?

483
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,282
It's not easy

484
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:01,076
to locate him

485
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:03,411
or contact him.

486
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:09,709
If something happens to Jeong Hyeok too,
I can't live.

487
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:12,420
There's no reason to live.

488
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,548
What an ingrate.

489
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,260
Once they figure out that he went there,

490
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:23,139
my entire family as well as myself
will be done for.

491
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,685
Is that your concern?

492
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:28,436
After all the tears,

493
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,772
your fame comes before your child?

494
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:34,234
Don't you ever let the damn position
cost my son again.

495
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,653
If you do, I will kill myself right away.

496
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,322
Stay in that high position alone
until the day you die.

497
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,412
Goodness, Jeong Hyeok...

498
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:52,419
It's all set now. You said you wanted
to register your fingerprint, right?

499
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:54,087
-Yes.
-Hang on a second.

500
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,009
There you go.

501
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:15,108
See if it works.

502
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,282
It's all set now.

503
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,075
I want to register his too.

504
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,202
Mine?

505
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:28,329
But I'm leaving soon.

506
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,206
Just do it anyway.

507
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,673
I know you're leaving soon,

508
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:42,093
but while you're here,
you have to be hanging out with me.

509
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:44,804
So why don't you change your style a bit?

510
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,932
I don't think that's necessary.

511
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:49,809
Not much. Just a little.

512
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:00,487
What are you doing?

513
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,364
In winter, you need to knock your car
before you get in.

514
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,701
Sometimes, wild animals go into the engine
to avoid the cold weather.

515
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,121
But this is an underground parking lot

516
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,332
and it's not even cold.
There's no wild animal.

517
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,798
Look at you.

518
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,592
Why are you surprised
when you're the one who knocked?

519
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:24,219
I didn't really expect to see one.

520
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:26,679
Because this is an underground parking lot
and it's not cold.

521
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,432
It's great that you did it, though.

522
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:33,478
From now on,
I will knock the car in winter...

523
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:37,440
What's wrong?

524
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,026
What am I going to do?

525
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:44,364
You will be gone soon,

526
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,659
but I will be left here alone

527
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:50,787
and knocking the car every winter.

528
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:52,997
And whenever I do this,

529
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,751
I will be reminded of you,
as you taught me this.

530
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,712
While you stay here,

531
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:04,926
I think you shouldn't do anything.

532
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:09,389
Don't make memories
that will remind me of you.

533
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,351
I will try...

534
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:15,770
to do nothing.

535
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:18,773
Let's go.

536
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,650
It's time to become a South Korean.

537
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,708
Welcome.

538
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:45,425
Try this.

539
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,969
Why should I?
I'm okay with my clothes I'm wearing now.

540
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,596
I'm not okay with it. Come on.

541
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,098
-Please escort him.
-This way, please.

542
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,750
It suits you really well.

543
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,711
You won't need to shorten any part.

544
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:24,088
It looks like it's custom-tailored.

545
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:25,965
Not many people look good in this color.

546
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,468
It looks so perfect on you.

547
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,556
I'm not sure.

548
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:35,808
Is there something else?

549
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,771
How about this one? Try this.

550
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,796
This is yours.

551
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,340
I mean, look at how perfectly it fits.

552
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,717
If you take photos in this,
you might look better

553
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:11,678
than models.

554
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,060
Could you turn around?

555
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:26,901
It doesn't look so nice from the back.

556
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:29,237
Is there something else?

557
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,451
Try this one.

558
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:52,468
It must be hard.
Your husband looks good in anything.

559
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:53,928
"Husband"?

560
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,597
Come on, he's not.

561
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:04,022
Do we look like a married couple?

562
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:06,232
Then I guess he's just
your boyfriend for now.

563
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,526
I'm so jealous.

564
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:13,156
He was looking at you so sweetly earlier.

565
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:15,992
He seemed so sweet.

566
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:17,827
Well...

567
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:19,787
He's not

568
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,707
that sweet all the time.

569
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,502
The ones he tried earlier,

570
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:29,047
-Yes.
-the one he brought now,

571
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:31,716
-this,
-Yes.

572
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:33,926
and this.

573
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,764
And I would like to buy
the shirts in all colors. All of them.

574
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:47,523
-Here.
-Yes.

575
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:48,983
Wait.

576
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:54,197
-What are you doing?
-What do you mean?

577
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:56,991
I told you I was a swallow.

578
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:59,452
And not just a swallow.
I'm a super luxurious swallow.

579
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:02,538
And you are the lucky farmer
who saved its life.

580
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:05,666
Let's start opening your presents
with this black card now.

581
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:08,669
-I'd like to pay all at once.
-Yes, ma'am.

582
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:34,862
Thank you.

583
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,657
Thank you.

584
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,579
Look. Isn't he handsome?

585
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:46,332
-He's so handsome.
-Take a picture of him.

586
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,292
Thank you.

587
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:51,129
Jeong Hyeok, since we're out here,
how about we get your hair done too?

588
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:01,639
What are you doing now?

589
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:02,682
Let's go.

590
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:05,476
Let me wait until the baby comes out.

591
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,397
Thank you.

592
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:25,288
-Ms. Yoon.
-Hey.

593
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:34,797
This is Lee Hyeok, my bodyguard.

594
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:38,176
-What?
-But you hated having bodyguards.

595
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:41,220
-He's a temporary one.
-Temporary, I see.

596
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:46,058
Does the fact that you hired
a personal bodyguard mean

597
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:47,226
it's starting again?

598
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:49,353
-What is?
-Dating.

599
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:55,985
Giving us a heads-up will make it
a lot easier for us to prepare.

600
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:58,905
Is he an athlete or a celebrity?

601
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:00,364
Just give us a general idea.

602
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:03,451
I have no idea what you are talking about.

603
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,328
I will see you later at the meeting.

604
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:06,579
Let's go, Hyeok.

605
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,461
We will be busy, right?

606
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,587
Yes, 100 percent.

607
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:24,013
It's not like
there had been a lot of scandals.

608
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:25,848
I didn't ask.

609
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,768
My life was boring.

610
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:30,895
I had no family to eat with

611
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:33,189
and no friends to hang out with.

612
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:36,233
-That's why I kept seeing others and--
-Started dating.

613
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:38,611
That's not true.

614
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:41,322
Having just one meal with someone
would make news articles

615
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:45,534
and taking a walk by Han River
with someone would be soon talked about.

616
00:45:47,203 --> 00:45:49,288
-Okay.
-But...

617
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:52,333
I don't think I can do that from now on.

618
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:56,003
I have become picky now.

619
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:58,506
Because of you.

620
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,305
Really?

621
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:12,853
This skyscraper really
belongs to that woman?

622
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:14,897
She bragged so much about how rich she is,

623
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:16,774
and it turns out it wasn't all porky.

624
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:20,361
I should have told her
I wanted a 100 million won, not corn.

625
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,155
Let's get in for now.

626
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:27,076
The one who looks the most South Korean
should go first.

627
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,452
-Gwang Beom.
-Yes.

628
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:30,079
Let's get in.

629
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,051
How may I help you?

630
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:47,680
How can I help you?

631
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,642
We would like to meet the comrade...

632
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:55,563
I mean, we would like
to meet the chairwoman.

633
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,815
Did you set up an appointment with her?

634
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:01,110
You can't meet her
if you didn't set up an appointment.

635
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,611
Excuse me.

636
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:08,200
Let us check your identities first

637
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:11,120
and we will help you fill in
the interview application.

638
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,621
Listen.

639
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:20,296
We can come another time. Right?

640
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:22,965
-Brother.
-Of course, Brother.

641
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,851
They shouldn't have noticed, right?

642
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,604
Chi Su, when did you learn
the South Korean dialect?

643
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,939
-Did it sound natural?
-It was perfect.

644
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:40,441
I thought you were a South Korean.

645
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,401
Hey, Ju Meok. You weren't so bad yourself.

646
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:43,736
-Really?
-Yes.

647
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:48,949
Where did you get the necklace?

648
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,910
My husband got it for me.

649
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:52,703
Is that so?

650
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,916
Where did you get this bag?

651
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,293
They aren't even out in stores yet.

652
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,295
A beautiful product like this

653
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:04,548
should be bought as early as possible.

654
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:08,260
So I asked my husband to get one for me.

655
00:48:08,344 --> 00:48:10,304
Is that so?

656
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:17,478
By the way, the shoes look unfamiliar.

657
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:19,146
Oh, these?

658
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:22,024
My husband is so sweet.

659
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:24,235
He would keep buying things like them.

660
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:25,402
I'm a bit tired of it.

661
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:28,781
By the way, what's taking Dan so long?

662
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:30,908
The rumor that her wedding
is delayed again

663
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:33,369
is spread all over Pyongyang.

664
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,704
-Is that so?
-I told you.

665
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:39,542
Didn't I tell you I saw
some woman and Ri Jeong Hyeok

666
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:43,295
looking suspicious in Pyongyang Hotel?

667
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:48,092
Does that mean
that famous Seo Dan was dumped?

668
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:51,178
Famous, my foot.

669
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:53,264
Don't you think, Terrius?

670
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:56,308
Tell me. What's wrong?

671
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:33,137
This stupid dog suddenly pissed on me.

672
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,930
-Clean it with this.
-Gosh, it stinks.

673
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:40,686
How have you been?

674
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,022
Hey.

675
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:46,233
Hey.

676
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,456
Where? Where should I go?

677
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,249
Where should I go?

678
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,672
This is crazy...

679
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:13,552
Dan, why are you so late?

680
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:16,305
It's not like you have a husband
to ask for a permission

681
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,474
or a clingy child.

682
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:23,270
I was worried you might be
too exhausted to come out here.

683
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:26,899
And yet, here you are, all dressed up.

684
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:28,776
I'm relieved.

685
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,362
What do you mean?

686
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,241
Dan.

687
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,952
You don't have to save face
in front of us.

688
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:40,246
Tell us about it.

689
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:45,459
The engagement is as good
as called off, right?

690
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:51,131
Ri Jeong Hyeok is from a powerful family,
but what's the point?

691
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:52,675
-She's right.
-She's right.

692
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:54,927
While all our classmates got married,

693
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,346
you spent all your time
waiting for that man,

694
00:50:57,429 --> 00:51:00,557
and now you've passed
the marriageable age.

695
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:08,274
Of course, marriage is not a big deal.

696
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,443
At home, I have my husband

697
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:15,239
who loves me dearly and only cares
about me. I'm sick and tired of it.

698
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,032
I can't agree more.

699
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:19,952
However, there are more and more people

700
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:22,830
dying alone all over the world these days,

701
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,164
which is horrible.

702
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:25,749
-That's true.
-That's true.

703
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:29,878
I'm just worried
you might end up like that.

704
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:32,756
Jin Sook.

705
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:33,757
Yes?

706
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:36,802
Is Seong Deok doing all right?

707
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,307
He's all right, of course.

708
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:42,933
Good.

709
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:46,478
He used to say he couldn't live without me

710
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:48,272
and he would die if I didn't marry him.

711
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:51,400
So I was worried he might actually die.

712
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:54,445
Luckily, you accepted him
and he's doing all right.

713
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,697
I'm relieved.

714
00:51:58,073 --> 00:51:59,116
Gosh, it's hot.

715
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:01,744
The coffee is really hot.

716
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:09,251
Mr. Cheon was caught too.
I can't go to the airport now.

717
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:12,254
My name might be on the blacklist.

718
00:52:12,755 --> 00:52:15,632
Comrade Operator, could you please

719
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:18,260
let me stay in your place for a while?

720
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:19,845
Hello?

721
00:52:20,012 --> 00:52:20,971
Hello?

722
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:32,441
Hello?

723
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:44,995
Rain? It looks like
it will be raining for quite some time.

724
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:49,833
My husband said
he would come and pick me up.

725
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:53,712
My husband should be here any minute too.

726
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:56,632
Oh, my goodness.

727
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:01,261
Who is that man?

728
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,144
I should get going.

729
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:11,063
Already?

730
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,315
Do you have an umbrella?

731
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,405
Bye.

732
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,410
She's too proud until the end.

733
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:28,872
We all have our husbands to pick us up,

734
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:31,959
but she has to leave alone,
looking pathetic.

735
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,211
-That must be why she left early.
-Indeed.

736
00:53:34,795 --> 00:53:37,923
Hey, that might not be the case.

737
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:39,591
-What?
-Look.

738
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:41,051
Oh, my.

739
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:45,180
-Goodness.
-He's so sweet.

740
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,058
Look at that.

741
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:52,229
-Goodness. Who is that man?
-Oh, my.

742
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,565
-Oh, my.
-Oh, dear.

743
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,359
-This is unbelievable.
-What on earth is going on?

744
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,993
I think I just saved you.

745
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,494
Stop the bullshit.

746
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:12,374
Do you have any sweetmeat in the car?

747
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:14,793
You know that word too?
How do you know that word?

748
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:17,004
How I know that word isn't important.

749
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,380
I guess you're right.

750
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:21,967
What's important is
we need sweets on gloomy days.

751
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,594
Things like chocolate and candy.

752
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,012
-Do you have any?
-No, I don't.

753
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,976
Do you have convenience stores here?

754
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,360
Hey, come here.

755
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:57,419
Hey.

756
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:03,509
Let's eat this together.

757
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:05,761
We will be having
a meeting until late night today.

758
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,556
I will eat with Chairwoman Yoon--

759
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,724
He doesn't know it yet.

760
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,851
She never eats with others.

761
00:55:12,935 --> 00:55:15,145
Apparently, he hasn't heard
anything about the rules.

762
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:16,396
I guess. This is bad.

763
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,774
Ms. Yoon always eats alone.

764
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:21,610
She doesn't like having company
or anyone talking to her.

765
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,612
She doesn't like that kind of color.

766
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:25,113
She hates it.

767
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:26,532
She liked it.

768
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:28,909
No, she doesn't.

769
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:31,787
You know nothing about her.

770
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:34,039
I don't think I know nothing about her.

771
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,166
What's wrong with you?

772
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:39,503
She's very sensitive like a cat.

773
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:42,214
She only eats eggs that are
boiled for 8 minutes and 27 seconds.

774
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:45,217
When she gets eggs
boiled for 8 minutes and 30 seconds,

775
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,260
she says it's too dry.

776
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:48,011
She can sense it right away.

777
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:57,771
You should study her taste well

778
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:00,107
in order to survive longer.

779
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,943
This of it as advice from your seniors
and keep it in mind.

780
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:10,492
Do I not know much about your taste?

781
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:11,868
What do you mean?

782
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,788
Your employees seem to know well.

783
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:16,957
They even know
how you like your eggs done.

784
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:19,751
That's not important.

785
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:24,006
No others know my taste better than you.

786
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:27,759
What's your taste?

787
00:56:29,428 --> 00:56:30,429
You.

788
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:34,141
I told you when we first met.

789
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,226
I said your face was totally my type.

790
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,773
Why do you act like you don't know?

791
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:15,349
Is this supposed to be your place
when you get married?

792
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:18,352
I never imagined
the first man to cross the threshold here

793
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,687
would be you.

794
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:24,316
Right. I didn't see this coming either.

795
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:27,569
You have nowhere to go,
so I'll let you stay here for a few days.

796
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:28,904
You can't stay here for long.

797
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:31,323
I won't. I told you already.

798
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:33,533
I was supposed to take the flight today,

799
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:37,037
but because of some situation,
I need to stay a few more days.

800
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,747
Even if I want to stay longer, I can't.

801
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,208
Don't leave any trace here.

802
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:44,711
You will be only breathing in here.

803
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:46,213
Okay.

804
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:54,262
I will get going.

805
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:56,974
I will take the car.

806
00:57:57,057 --> 00:57:58,934
Turn off all the lights in ten minutes.

807
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:01,269
There might be a random house inspection.

808
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:04,439
Are you leaving just like that?
Aren't you hungry?

809
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:05,649
I'm hungry.

810
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:08,485
Would you like some instant noodles?

811
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:19,705
This is my first time
eating instant noodles alone with a woman.

812
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:21,331
Don't try to read too much into this.

813
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:23,083
I didn't.

814
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:26,837
Instant noodles have a social implication.

815
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:29,756
What implication?

816
00:58:30,549 --> 00:58:32,092
"Would you like some instant noodles?"

817
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:35,846
We don't say this to anyone
in South Korea.

818
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:37,681
I mean, I'm okay,

819
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,307
but if you ever hear other guys

820
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:41,977
say this to you, you have to say,

821
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,146
"No," flatly.

822
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,567
Why should I say no?

823
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:51,903
I like it.

824
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:58,744
What? What is it that you like?

825
00:58:58,827 --> 00:59:02,706
Instant noodles? The man?

826
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:05,333
Or...

827
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:08,545
me?

828
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:23,810
Why did she smile?

829
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:26,271
Am I funny?

830
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:35,363
But I wasn't that funny.

831
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,915
Why does it

832
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:47,834
make me so curious?

833
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:54,633
Fine.

834
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:56,301
I will ask her.

835
00:59:58,386 --> 01:00:01,640
I will just call her like a man.

836
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:05,310
I will ask her why she smiled.
It's as simple as that.

837
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:11,024
The person you have reached
is not available.

838
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:16,113
Did she go to bed?

839
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:18,365
Already?

840
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,535
Maybe she hasn't arrived home yet.

841
01:00:22,661 --> 01:00:24,412
Is that why she doesn't answer?

842
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:29,835
Or did she just ignore my call?

843
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:31,962
Why?

844
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,589
Is she playing hard-to-get?

845
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:39,386
What is it?

846
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:48,687
You haven't seen the missed call yet?

847
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:51,273
And it's so bright already.

848
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,026
Does she get up late?

849
01:00:55,569 --> 01:00:57,445
Let's not be curious.

850
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:02,033
I mean, it's not a big deal.

851
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:06,496
It's because I'm not eating well
these days.

852
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:26,224
-Hello.
-Why did you call me?

853
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:28,768
I did? Did I call you?

854
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:32,105
I didn't know.
It must have been a mistake.

855
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:33,273
Did you

856
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:34,858
call me as soon as you woke up?

857
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:36,318
Then forget it.

858
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:37,903
Wait, wait!

859
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:41,948
Is there something else
you want to talk about?

860
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:45,785
What are you doing today? I mean...

861
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:47,621
What do I do today?

862
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,457
Why do you ask me?

863
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,958
I have no one else to ask.

864
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:53,793
I know no one here.

865
01:01:54,002 --> 01:01:56,421
I have some things I want to ask you.

866
01:01:56,588 --> 01:01:57,589
Should I come to you?

867
01:01:58,173 --> 01:02:00,175
It's a little too far.
I don't have a car either.

868
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:01,301
You took the car.

869
01:02:02,594 --> 01:02:04,346
-So?
-Why don't you come over?

870
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:08,975
Hello?

871
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:11,144
Hello?

872
01:02:13,021 --> 01:02:14,147
Did she hang up?

873
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:16,608
No, she didn't say, "I will hang up."

874
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:18,026
Was it disconnected?

875
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:20,320
Is the reception weak here?

876
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:21,947
What happened?

877
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:24,908
What's wrong with me?

878
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:27,869
Hey, what the hell is wrong with you?

879
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:31,414
I told you to stay by Dan's side
and take care of her!

880
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:32,624
Myeong Eun,

881
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:36,670
why don't you go to my camp
and ask any soldiers there?

882
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:39,089
Ask them if they have
seen me around lately.

883
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:43,093
Since Dan has come back,
I was never in the camp.

884
01:02:43,969 --> 01:02:46,513
Then how could you miss
something like this?

885
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:48,723
The daughter of the owner
of Pyongyang Department Store,

886
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:50,183
Seo Dan's engagement is called off.

887
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:52,602
The delay of her marriage
with Ri Jeong Hyeok,

888
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:54,145
the son of the Director of the GPB,

889
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:56,022
is caused by Seo Dan's affair
with another man.

890
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:57,857
Is this "another man"

891
01:02:58,483 --> 01:02:59,609
the man I saw?

892
01:02:59,693 --> 01:03:02,320
That's what I want you to ask her!

893
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:04,364
Fine. Stop it.

894
01:03:10,704 --> 01:03:15,083
Dan. There's something
I would like to discuss with you.

895
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,961
About what your uncle saw...

896
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:20,422
You tell her.

897
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:25,093
Do you remember
the man I said I saw at the hotel?

898
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:26,845
Comrade Al, that is.

899
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:29,180
Alberto.

900
01:03:31,683 --> 01:03:34,561
-What about him?
-Well...

901
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:39,941
Your mother said she heard some rumor

902
01:03:40,442 --> 01:03:42,444
at a breakfast meeting today.

903
01:03:44,446 --> 01:03:46,573
-You tell her from here.
-You stupid...

904
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:50,702
Well... I heard

905
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:54,748
that when you went to meet
your friends yesterday,

906
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:58,084
some guy came to pick you up with a car.

907
01:03:58,168 --> 01:04:03,548
Is the man Comrade Al that your uncle saw?

908
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:04,924
Mom.

909
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:06,634
Yes? What is it?

910
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:09,679
I'm ready. Tell me.

911
01:04:11,598 --> 01:04:13,391
I need to go somewhere now.

912
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:16,227
Now? Do you want me to come with you?

913
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:19,856
I guess you don't.

914
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:21,983
Bye.

915
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:25,153
It's happening.

916
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:27,197
What? An affair?

917
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:31,534
No, love.
Hey, it's not like Dan was married

918
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:33,578
to Ri Jeong Hyeok.

919
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:35,038
Affair, my foot.

920
01:04:36,456 --> 01:04:38,708
If that's where her heart goes,

921
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:41,086
I will support her.

922
01:04:42,212 --> 01:04:43,546
-Really?
-Yes.

923
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:44,631
Come on.

924
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:46,549
You don't even know who he is!

925
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:49,844
To be blunt, who cares

926
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:52,972
as long as Alberto isn't
a thief or a scammer?

927
01:05:01,106 --> 01:05:02,357
Hello.

928
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:03,900
Come on out.

929
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:06,069
Are you here?

930
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:24,546
What are you looking at?

931
01:05:25,213 --> 01:05:26,089
Come on down.

932
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:28,299
I will go down soon.

933
01:05:28,383 --> 01:05:30,802
Give me ten minutes.
No, give me five minutes.

934
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:32,470
You have three minutes.

935
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:36,975
Mom.

936
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:42,230
Your oldest son is here
with an incredible piece of information.

937
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:44,941
I am tired today. Keep it short.

938
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:49,195
It really is incredible.
How am I going to keep it short?

939
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:52,949
It's about what happened
after Se-ri disappeared

940
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:57,412
and how she came back safely
after a month.

941
01:05:57,495 --> 01:05:59,998
-Se-ri...
-She was in North Korea.

942
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:01,374
Hey.

943
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,085
What did you say?

944
01:06:04,169 --> 01:06:07,046
North Korea.
The country that's on news all the time.

945
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:09,716
He went through hoops
to obtain this information.

946
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:10,925
What are you...

947
01:06:11,009 --> 01:06:13,052
It's too early to be surprised.

948
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:15,054
Do you know what's even more shocking?

949
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:18,600
Yoon Se-hyeong, that jerk, knew.

950
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:19,851
That hyena!

951
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,437
-What?
-Although he knew,

952
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,314
he hid the information.

953
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:27,609
Perhaps he wanted my sister to die
in that frightening place.

954
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:29,694
That's exactly what he wanted.

955
01:06:29,777 --> 01:06:30,778
I am certain of it.

956
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:34,449
How could he go that far
to become an heir?

957
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:40,371
Mom, is it a good idea
to give that heartless bastard

958
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:42,540
such power?

959
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:46,586
-Are you certain about that information?
-Yes, I am.

960
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:50,465
There's a man called Manager Oh.

961
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:54,469
He is Gu Seung-jun's informant in China.

962
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:57,931
I realized that he met up
with Se-hyeong and Sang-a a few times,

963
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:00,892
so I did some digging
and found out about this information.

964
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:04,103
Manager Oh recently came to Seoul.

965
01:07:04,896 --> 01:07:07,148
I don't know what he is scheming.

966
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,026
I think it might be related
to Se-ri's comeback,

967
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:12,153
so I am investigating.

968
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:16,658
Sir.

969
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:19,494
So I heard.

970
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:23,414
This evening? Sure.

971
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:28,086
There are conversations to be had
and calculations to be made.

972
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:30,380
Where should we meet?

973
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:34,050
Watch this.

974
01:07:34,342 --> 01:07:37,428
I was so startled when I first saw it.

975
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:41,349
SUCH A HANDSOME GUY
AND HIS HANDSOME MANNER

976
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:42,433
Who filmed it?

977
01:07:42,517 --> 01:07:44,936
Someone filmed it with a phone
and uploaded it.

978
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:47,730
I told you that you have to be careful.

979
01:07:49,107 --> 01:07:50,567
I didn't know this would happen.

980
01:07:51,526 --> 01:07:54,779
I was careless. I simply held the door.

981
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:56,614
My goodness. People keep posting.

982
01:07:56,698 --> 01:07:59,075
The doorman at the department
has the best manners.

983
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:00,827
He isn't a doorman.
He is just a gentleman.

984
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,036
His legs are miles long.

985
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,913
-A babe magnet.
-What does "Babe magnet" mean?

986
01:08:03,997 --> 01:08:07,458
It means you are handsome.

987
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:11,921
I see. That's what it means.

988
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:15,925
I see the same term here.

989
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:19,887
Are you enjoying this?

990
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:22,682
No.

991
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:24,225
Whatever.

992
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:27,604
What does "G.G.W." mean?

993
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:30,481
I don't know. What does it mean?

994
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:33,985
"God's Gift to Women..."

995
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:39,490
You look so happy.

996
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:41,993
Do you want to sit down and read them?

997
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:43,119
Sure.

998
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,288
No, stay standing up.

999
01:08:59,761 --> 01:09:02,096
Jeong Hyeok, I need to work.

1000
01:09:11,314 --> 01:09:12,649
You have a phone?

1001
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:14,859
When did you get it?

1002
01:09:15,443 --> 01:09:18,112
Besides, who is calling you here?

1003
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:20,239
Give me a second.

1004
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:28,039
Did you make an appointment
with Cho Cheol Gang?

1005
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:29,540
At which location?

1006
01:09:40,468 --> 01:09:42,762
I need to go somewhere this evening.

1007
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:45,181
Where?

1008
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:50,019
Did you find out where Cho Cheol Gang is?

1009
01:09:51,312 --> 01:09:52,605
Not yet.

1010
01:09:53,481 --> 01:09:56,025
He made an appointment with a broker,
so I want to go and check.

1011
01:09:57,527 --> 01:09:59,654
-I will drive you. Let's go together.
-No.

1012
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,573
It could be dangerous.

1013
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:05,284
You are in Seoul, not Pyongyang.

1014
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:08,621
You shouldn't go around by yourself.

1015
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:11,624
I know it could be dangerous.

1016
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:15,211
That's precisely why
I can't bring you with me.

1017
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:19,882
If I catch him there,
I might leave this place right away

1018
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:23,386
tonight.

1019
01:10:24,595 --> 01:10:25,722
Right away?

1020
01:10:27,098 --> 01:10:29,267
Won't I get to see your face again?

1021
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:33,229
I won't have time for that.

1022
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:40,236
Then again,

1023
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:43,573
you don't know either
how the situation will unfold.

1024
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:46,409
I understand.

1025
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:51,414
Still,

1026
01:10:55,418 --> 01:10:56,461
I want to

1027
01:10:57,712 --> 01:10:58,880
hear your voice

1028
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:02,717
if I won't get to see you again.

1029
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:09,432
Give me your cellphone.

1030
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:16,814
This is my number.

1031
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:20,693
I downloaded an app

1032
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:23,196
that shows each other's location...

1033
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:26,574
just in case.

1034
01:14:09,028 --> 01:14:12,448
YOON SE-RI

1035
01:14:34,595 --> 01:14:36,013
He will be okay, right?

1036
01:14:40,518 --> 01:14:41,811
Are you okay?

1037
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:44,271
Tell me if it's difficult to find
your way back.

1038
01:14:44,355 --> 01:14:45,731
I will come and get you.

1039
01:16:58,906 --> 01:17:00,407
What is Animal Farm doing?

1040
01:17:01,325 --> 01:17:03,994
It should cover a story on me
since I am a big animal lover.

1041
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:07,057
CALL

1042
01:18:18,277 --> 01:18:20,946
YOON SE-RI'S CURRENT LOCATION
SE-RI'S CHOICE

1043
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:52,663
Don't come.

1044
01:20:12,057 --> 01:20:15,019
-Why didn't you pick up...
-Ri Jeong Hyeok.

1045
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:16,937
It's good

1046
01:20:18,022 --> 01:20:20,107
to see you in South Korea.

1047
01:20:20,607 --> 01:20:23,444
I didn't think you would actually come.
I am impressed.

1048
01:20:23,527 --> 01:20:25,571
Why do you have this phone?

1049
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:29,700
I am with Yoon Se-ri right now.

1050
01:20:32,119 --> 01:20:35,998
You know that neither one of us
can call the police, right?

1051
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:38,417
I can't wait long.

1052
01:20:39,585 --> 01:20:41,670
Stay on the phone and come now.

1053
01:21:10,157 --> 01:21:13,452
-Where are you?
-You don't need to know.

1054
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:15,329
I have my eyes on you.

1055
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:19,083
Raise the other hand, too.

1056
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:28,258
If you try something funny,
I will put a bullet in this woman's head.

1057
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:31,303
Look ahead and walk.

1058
01:21:31,387 --> 01:21:33,889
If you touch a hair on her head,

1059
01:21:34,598 --> 01:21:36,225
I will kill you.

1060
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:41,647
Sure. Say what you want to say
since this is your last chance.

1061
01:21:54,618 --> 01:21:56,245
Cho Cheol Gang!

1062
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:58,288
Stop bullshitting!

1063
01:21:59,873 --> 01:22:01,333
Jeong Hyeok, run away.

1064
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:03,127
He's lying.

1065
01:22:03,252 --> 01:22:04,503
He has a gun.

1066
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:11,802
I'm okay, so run away.

1067
01:23:51,610 --> 01:23:54,363
7 YEARS AGO

1068
01:24:43,662 --> 01:24:46,623
Sweets. Sweets. I need some sweetmeat.

1069
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:01,138
It's tasty.

1070
01:25:01,388 --> 01:25:04,224
It improves your mood
when you are angry or depressed.

1071
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:08,437
I see that you aren't Korean.

1072
01:25:28,415 --> 01:25:30,083
He could do much better.

1073
01:26:19,049 --> 01:26:23,178
You said you'd go to Cheongdam-dong
and look for Se-ri's house.

1074
01:26:23,261 --> 01:26:24,304
Stop right there.

1075
01:26:24,388 --> 01:26:28,183
It's a lot harder to meet these two
than I thought.

1076
01:26:28,266 --> 01:26:30,435
-Did Dan not come home last night?
-My goodness.

1077
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:34,523
Did you think I had no idea
what kind of person you were down South?

1078
01:26:34,606 --> 01:26:37,943
No one will say anything about our looks
now that we dressed up.

1079
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:40,445
And I have a little surprise

1080
01:26:40,529 --> 01:26:42,155
for you.

1081
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:46,034
I need to bring her back there
to verify something.

1082
01:26:46,118 --> 01:26:48,995
I just want to stay here with you.

1083
01:26:49,329 --> 01:26:51,873
