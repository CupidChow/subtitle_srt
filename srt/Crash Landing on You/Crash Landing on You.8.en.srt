1
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,970
ALL CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND BACKGROUND ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,513
YOON SE-RI HASN'T BEEN SEEN IN PUBLIC

3
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,558
A SOURCE CLOSE TO HER SAYS
SHE WAS LOST IN A PARAGLIDING ACCIDENT

4
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:01,978
Tell me.

5
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,148
Did you know

6
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,941
about her identity?

7
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,277
I did.

8
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,572
What is a woman from South Korea
doing here?

9
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,324
It started with an accident.

10
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,077
And what came next was a coincidence.

11
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,665
-She will go back soon.
-Is that why you've been hiding her?

12
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,292
Yes.

13
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,547
You might end up losing everything
trying to hide her.

14
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,008
It means

15
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,178
she might even kill you.

16
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:36,679
Would you

17
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,182
not mind it?

18
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,061
To be honest,

19
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,315
I don't want to be killed.

20
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,609
Who would want to die?

21
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,694
But...

22
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,114
I just have no choice.

23
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,908
What do you mean?

24
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:58,618
I've already failed

25
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:03,706
to protect someone I cared the most
and ended up losing the person.

26
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,097
That damn accident...

27
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,891
It would've been better to die.

28
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:24,894
So?

29
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,356
I have to

30
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,108
send her back home safely.

31
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:34,028
Even if something happens
to me along the way,

32
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,865
I just think I can't help it.

33
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,700
Do you not mind

34
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,494
even if you die?

35
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,079
Do you not mind?

36
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,291
Even if something happens
to him because of you?

37
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,043
He got shot.

38
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,513
And today, the military
barged in, didn't they?

39
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,317
After guns and soldiers...

40
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,569
You never know
what will happen to him next.

41
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:15,987
And you still don't care?

42
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,115
Are you threatening me now?

43
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,909
This isn't a threat, but a fact.

44
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,121
You're a smart woman, Se-ri.

45
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:27,707
Think carefully.

46
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,877
If you feel grateful or sorry to him,

47
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,421
or by any possibility,

48
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,423
if you like him,

49
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,510
you should just disappear now.

50
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,137
You know it.

51
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,224
You want to contact him when you
don't know how things are going there?

52
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,352
Will you add fuel to the fire?

53
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,693
Let's be rational here.

54
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,201
You've just been lucky.

55
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,995
If anything goes wrong,

56
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,207
all the people
who've been hiding and helping you

57
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,084
might end up in trouble.

58
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,338
Please let me go.

59
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,298
I have to leave now.

60
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:20,969
Did you say you want to protect her
without caring about anything?

61
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,180
I feel the same way.

62
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:26,557
I, too,

63
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,853
will do anything to protect my fiancé.

64
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,314
I can never let you go there

65
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,943
to get yourself killed.

66
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:40,947
I'm warning you.

67
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,574
Don't do anything you're going to regret.

68
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,880
Hey, honey.

69
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,383
Getting off work is not the deal here.

70
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:04,721
I never know when the director's son
would want to use a phone again.

71
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:10,393
You've always wanted to go to Pyongyang.

72
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:14,939
I wouldn't get a second chance
to get on his good side like this.

73
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:18,276
Who is it?

74
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,532
-How may I help you?
-I remember you saying

75
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:28,286
that I can use everything
in the hospital as if they're mine.

76
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,873
Sure thing. Please help yourself.

77
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:33,916
Please take care.

78
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:36,961
Please drive safely.

79
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:41,215
EMERGENCY ROOM

80
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,636
PARAMEDIC

81
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,277
SEARCH ROUTE

82
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:09,035
The second you got involved,
his life must've started to fall apart.

83
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,716
STATE SECURITY DEPARTMENT 110

84
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,969
And it must've gone off the rails already.

85
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,061
I bet he's going on a way
he's never been before.

86
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,161
Where do you think is the end of it?

87
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,678
What do you think will be there?

88
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,566
Aren't you afraid?

89
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,122
EPISODE 8

90
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,501
What if Se-ri got kidnapped?

91
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,045
You saw her get on it voluntarily.

92
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:48,843
If she's known him
since she was in South Korea,

93
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,052
does it mean

94
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,346
he's her boyfriend or something?

95
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,432
It's not like that.

96
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:58,436
When the officials from the State Security
Department barged in yesterday,

97
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,771
I guess she tried to hide for my sake.

98
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,107
If that's the case,
she could've called you

99
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,859
and told you what it was all about.

100
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,115
Captain Ri,

101
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,076
I got your phone fixed.

102
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,787
PYONGYANG

103
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,125
What? Is it Se-ri?

104
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,293
Is it her?

105
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:26,631
It's me.

106
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,257
Who do you think I am?

107
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:30,927
Were you waiting for Se-ri's call?

108
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,011
This is Gu Seung-jun.

109
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,555
I know you're with Se-ri.

110
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,641
Where are you? I'll be there.

111
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,478
I knew you'd want to look around for her
when you're sick in bed.

112
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,729
That's why I'm calling you.

113
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,941
I shouldn't have called you
if you knew about it.

114
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,651
I asked you where you are.

115
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,529
Se-ri is with me, and she's doing fine.

116
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,156
She's safe and comfortable.

117
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,242
So stop looking for her.

118
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,952
I'll take care of the rest.

119
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,496
That's what Se-ri wants.

120
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,832
Okay.

121
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,710
Let me just hear her voice
to make sure she's okay.

122
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,256
Hello? Hello?

123
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,384
What's wrong?

124
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,761
-He hung up on him.
-Who is she with?

125
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,847
Isn't it obvious? It must be her boyfriend
from South Korea.

126
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,812
The phone is turned off
or is not in service.

127
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,313
The phone is turned off?

128
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,190
Don't even ask. It's off.

129
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,943
Why isn't Se-ri calling you?

130
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,487
She has no face to call him,

131
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,490
so she asked her boyfriend
to make a call instead.

132
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,367
Do you want me to call him again?

133
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,577
Why would he?

134
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,913
Now that she got back
together with his boyfriend,

135
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,541
she just wants to forget
all about the past.

136
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:44,500
That damn wench.

137
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,588
-This is a great thing for us.
-He's not her boyfriend.

138
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,090
That's not true.

139
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,134
You don't know anything.

140
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,555
You're not supposed
to shoot your mouth off like that.

141
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,309
-Back in South Korea, they were just...
-That's not true.

142
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,644
They broke off their engagement.
He's not her boyfriend.

143
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:07,857
Broke off their engagement?
Does that mean he was her fiancé?

144
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,568
I knew it.

145
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:13,613
I thought there was
something going on between them.

146
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,990
That's not true. There's nothing going on
between those two.

147
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:19,118
Don't you know what "break off" means?
It means they split up.

148
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,454
They are nothing but strangers.

149
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:24,123
Why are you yelling at me?

150
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,791
I'm not yelling at you.

151
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,086
Your habit of badmouthing
have always bothered me.

152
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,130
I'm just telling you to break it off.

153
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,591
Who says I yelled at you?

154
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,469
Who is it?

155
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,931
I'm from the next room,
and you're being too loud.

156
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,224
Will you please keep quiet?

157
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,102
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

158
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,689
RI JEONG HYEOK

159
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:49,815
Ri Jeong Hyeok?

160
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:52,943
Nice to meet you.

161
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:54,779
Do you know me?

162
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:58,240
Where's the pretty girl from South Korea?

163
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,911
I heard a guy named Ri Jeong Hyeok
is her UF.

164
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:05,623
-I heard he's quite the babe magnet.
-UF? Babe magnet? What's that?

165
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,793
Ju Meok, translate it for me.

166
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,588
It's the latest popular slang
in South Korea.

167
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,882
U stands for ultimate.

168
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,967
F stands for favorite.

169
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,387
Therefore, saying someone is their UF

170
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,098
means that person
is their ultimate favorite.

171
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,015
Hold on.

172
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:26,102
Are you telling us porkies
just because we don't know things?

173
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,019
No.

174
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,397
That is what UF means.

175
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,149
As for babe magnet,

176
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:35,027
it means that she is sinking
into your undeniable charm

177
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,613
and she can't escape,
for her legs have already gotten soft

178
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,115
like a salted cabbage.

179
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,658
That's what it means.

180
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,744
I was really curious about you.

181
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,205
Now that I see you in the flesh,
I get what she meant.

182
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,331
I totally agree.

183
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,000
Hey, you have no right
to agree or disagree.

184
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,962
Go ahead and talk as much as you want.

185
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,965
Since you're her UF, I'll let this slide.

186
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,428
What?

187
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,683
Are you smiling now?

188
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,685
No. I'm not.

189
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,398
I'll look into Se-ri's issue.

190
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,484
You guys may get back to work.

191
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,278
Thank you for coming today.

192
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:19,780
-Okay.
-Yes.

193
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,741
-Sure.
-Take care.

194
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,674
Was he shot in the head or what?

195
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:43,679
He yells and smiles at the same time.
What's wrong with him?

196
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,474
Could it be that he has bipolar disorder?

197
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,850
A major one.

198
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,562
I must say a gun is really scary.

199
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:56,692
THE GREATEST HAPPINESS OF ALL

200
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,197
Put it near the window.

201
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,449
-Okay.
-Turn it around.

202
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,868
-Put it over there.
-Will you hurry?

203
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:06,827
My gosh.

204
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,370
Just turn it over.

205
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,206
The sunlight is coming in this way.

206
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,416
-My goodness.
-There.

207
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,667
This is actually not bad.

208
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,424
Why do you seem so depressed
on your moving day?

209
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:22,635
I'm fine.

210
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,261
It can happen.

211
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,057
People do a lot of thinking
before their wedding.

212
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,058
Is that it?

213
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,186
I wasn't like that.

214
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,272
My wife, too.

215
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,485
She got cold feet
about a month before the wedding.

216
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,529
What? Why?

217
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,239
She said she liked someone else.

218
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,991
Is that so?

219
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,911
It got me thinking
about all sorts of things.

220
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,122
Shall I go to her parents and beg?

221
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,917
Shall I find that damn jerk she likes

222
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,710
and break his legs in half?

223
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,629
I was willing to go that far.

224
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,423
What do you think I did?

225
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,801
My gosh, it's not a drama from down South.

226
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,511
Why do you stop talking like that?

227
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:06,679
What did you do?

228
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:07,763
"Go."

229
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,599
"You should go to him
if you like him that much."

230
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,811
"I will wish for your happiness," I said.

231
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,604
And?

232
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,274
She came back in three days
and apologized in tears.

233
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,234
So we got married.

234
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,572
She should've left you
when she had the chance.

235
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,116
Mi Hyang just made things
worse for herself.

236
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,994
I know. She's so unfortunate.

237
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,746
I mean, come on!

238
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,708
I have a headache.
I'll go get some fresh air.

239
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,131
Is something going on?

240
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,549
Did they have a fight?

241
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,014
I heard it would snow a lot tomorrow.

242
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,515
It's freezing already...

243
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,398
-Who is he?
-Well...

244
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:04,153
He's a butler who manages this place
and give tours in the neighborhood.

245
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,030
Mr. Cheon.

246
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,574
I'm his butler, Cheon.

247
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,496
What are you going to do?

248
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,707
Why did you bring her here?

249
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,377
You said I'm just a fraud,
so I shouldn't act like a decent guy.

250
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,879
I guess you're right about that.

251
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,632
Damn it. Since when did you
start listening to me?

252
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:25,633
Also,

253
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:29,094
I know our trade is illegal,
but there should be some business ethics.

254
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,972
You made a promise
with Lieutenant Commander Cho Cheol Gang.

255
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,515
Mr. Cheon.

256
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,311
If Cho Cheol Gang is involved,
he gets half the commission.

257
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,188
Without him, you can get all of it.

258
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,564
What will you do?

259
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,982
I'm just saying...

260
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,736
You should've shared your plan with me.

261
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,488
What do you want me to do?

262
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,616
What we need to do first

263
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,244
is separate Se-ri from the guy
named Ri Jeong Hyeok.

264
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,705
If we don't stop Ri Jeong Hyeok,

265
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,083
he will send Se-ri back
to South Korea one way or the other.

266
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,459
We should stop him then.

267
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:12,805
PARAGLIDING ACCIDENT

268
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,181
Do you know this woman?

269
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:17,434
I saw you having coffee
with her at a hotel before.

270
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,019
Don't try to lie to me.

271
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,479
Why would I lie to you?

272
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,899
I know this woman. I know her very well.

273
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,609
She doesn't belong to Division 11.

274
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:29,154
And she sneaked in here from South Korea.

275
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,407
Is that right?

276
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,951
It's not that she sneaked in.
There was an accident.

277
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,577
That doesn't matter.

278
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,163
This is what I'm going to say
to report her.

279
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,373
Will you report her?

280
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,043
If you do, your fiancé will be in trouble.

281
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:46,171
Do you think I'm afraid of that?

282
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,091
I don't care if he gets
in trouble or even die.

283
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,927
Now that I got the facts straight,
I should get going.

284
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,053
Wait.

285
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,642
I know what you mean.

286
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,562
But let's cooperate before you report it.

287
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:05,899
I bet you want to separate
Yoon Se-ri from Ri Jeong Hyeok.

288
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,360
-That's what I want too, comrade. So--
-Do you think

289
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,613
we're real comrades
now that you called me that a few times?

290
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,288
I mean, we should
put our personal feelings aside

291
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,166
and calm ourselves down
to think rationally.

292
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,917
There's one simple way.

293
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:32,176
Five, four, three, two, one.

294
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,598
A simple way?

295
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,517
Let me hear what it is.

296
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,564
Are you doing this yourself?

297
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:49,860
This is the least that should be done
to win him over.

298
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,906
I should probably start
talking about Pyongyang tomorrow.

299
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,700
Can I come to Pyongyang with you?

300
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,202
Me too.

301
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,332
All right. Let's all go to Pyongyang.

302
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,875
-Yes!
-How nice.

303
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,002
You didn't eat, did you?

304
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,257
-Where is he?
-Did you not know?

305
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,926
He just left the hospital.

306
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,428
He said he'd get treated
at the military hospital.

307
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,307
-Sir.
-My gosh, Director.

308
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,643
-Then what about Pyongyang?
-That's not the problem now.

309
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:27,773
JANAM AREA ELECTRICAL SUBSTATION

310
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,030
Captain Ri.

311
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,367
What brings you here
on a cold day like this?

312
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,160
Like I said before on the phone,

313
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:43,539
I have an urgent favor to ask of you.

314
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,624
Sure. You can ask anything.

315
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,584
If it weren't for you,

316
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,295
my youngest kid would've died
before getting surgery.

317
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,548
I have to return your favor.

318
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,924
Thank you.

319
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,845
I think there's a secret villa
in Mount Janam.

320
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,805
I can't search the address
and find the place.

321
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:03,016
So you want to detect electric power
to find the place.

322
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,601
That's right.

323
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:08,021
Special buildings like villas
have a special extra power line

324
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,190
along with the power line
that goes in other buildings.

325
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,901
They do it in case of a blackout.

326
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,362
And in this area, there are

327
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:20,409
three special power lines,
number 12, 13, and 30.

328
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,246
If one of them is connected to
a secret guard post,

329
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:29,793
I bet it is number 30
which goes down to the woods.

330
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,389
Are these bugging devices?

331
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:28,268
All the rooms in this hotel
have those devices installed.

332
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,491
You didn't know, did you?

333
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,411
I had no idea.

334
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,495
What's all this?

335
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:29,830
They are bugging devices.

336
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,333
When I was in Pyongyang,
I saw them installed in hotel rooms.

337
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,710
We should be careful.

338
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,962
This place is a kind of accommodations.

339
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,131
-Like a fancy vacation home.
-You're right.

340
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:42,259
Do you want me to check your room as well?

341
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,552
It's okay.

342
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,096
How do you know stuff like this, Se-ri?

343
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,391
Me?

344
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,519
Someone told me.

345
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,147
Do you want to go get some rest?

346
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,398
No.

347
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,276
Now that we're all here,
we should have a meeting.

348
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:05,073
All right. Tell me about your plans first.

349
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,035
How will you send me back
as soon as possible?

350
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,120
My family said

351
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,498
they will find a way to bring me back
secretly and safely.

352
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,751
There must be a plan.

353
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,587
Is there a route you have in mind?

354
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,089
By land, sea, or air?

355
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,634
Yes, Mr. Cheon. Speak.

356
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,263
This is confidential.

357
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,183
There's a deal called boat-to-boat.

358
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,976
-Boat what?
-Boat-to-boat.

359
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,437
It's two boats meeting
on international waters.

360
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,439
You take a small boat
and meet with a bigger one.

361
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,982
But we can't try it for a while.

362
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,108
Why not?

363
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,151
Did you not know?

364
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,196
There was a sea control order.

365
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,616
The new Chief Coast Guard
is really strict.

366
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,368
He wouldn't even take phone cards.

367
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,161
They wouldn't?

368
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,079
What?

369
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:53,872
Is that all you have?

370
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:56,458
-I already know the stuff.
-Se-ri.

371
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,836
I'm not going to get you out of here
in a dangerous way like that.

372
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,880
-Then what?
-I'll let you

373
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:05,300
fly comfortably back home
in business class

374
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,386
without taking any risks.

375
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,513
So how?

376
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:12,516
I guess you forgot.
I have another name, Alberto Gu.

377
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,227
I'm a foreigner with a British passport.

378
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,145
-So?
-I'll make you become like me.

379
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,772
So how?

380
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:19,773
You should marry me.

381
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:21,983
Alberto.

382
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:24,152
Are you insane?

383
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,363
We should register our marriage first.

384
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,616
Then we can get your passport
issued by the embassy.

385
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,202
You're not Yoon Se-ri from South Korea.

386
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,956
You will get on a plane with me
as Alberto Gu's wife.

387
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,374
That makes sense.

388
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:38,375
No, it doesn't.

389
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,919
A fake marriage with you?

390
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,879
This is what I went out for today.

391
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,881
The documents

392
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,883
are almost ready.

393
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,927
And this is

394
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,555
what your family wants.

395
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,528
I saw smoke coming out of the chimney.

396
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:08,780
Who are you?

397
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,159
Are you subordinates of Captain Ri?

398
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,787
Please help yourselves.

399
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,831
And have some drinks.

400
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,040
We can't drink.

401
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,294
They were just getting
the house ready for Captain Ri

402
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,671
under my lead as the chief officer.

403
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,339
So what?

404
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:29,134
I'm Captain Ri's future mother-in-law.

405
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,135
Don't worry about it.

406
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:33,305
Gosh, we can't do this.

407
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,556
Here. Have a drink.

408
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,101
It's okay. All right.

409
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,979
-I'll drink this.
-Okay.

410
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:44,774
I know Captain Ri
is a little inflexible and stubborn.

411
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,360
Now that you bring it up,

412
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,362
I'll tell you the truth.

413
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:52,657
Yes. He's a little like that.

414
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,117
I see.

415
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:58,163
He's a man of principle
which makes him attractive.

416
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:00,749
I guess he's popular with the ladies.

417
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,711
I think he knows it already.

418
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:07,964
That's why he pretends to be cold-hearted.

419
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:09,758
Master Sergeant Pyo.

420
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:10,759
Yes?

421
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:14,304
It's not like I'm making things up.

422
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:19,351
I don't like to drink with many people.

423
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:23,438
Master Sergeant Pyo.
Why don't you drink all night with me?

424
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:27,817
Gosh, I'm not supposed to do this.

425
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:43,917
Yes.

426
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,005
It's Christmas Eve.
We should have a party.

427
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:50,674
Come on down in an hour.

428
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,592
Okay.

429
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,014
Today is Christmas Eve.

430
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,229
It's snowing.

431
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,382
Se-ri. You like bouillabaisse, right?

432
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,092
And Sauvignon Blanc.

433
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,557
You know, when it comes
to dishes with clams,

434
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:25,518
I only eat bouillabaisse.

435
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:33,777
All right. Have some soju.

436
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,279
I'm in a tight spot.

437
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:40,742
I only drink Sauvignon Blanc
when I eat seafood.

438
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,208
Did you put sugar in this, Ju Meok?

439
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,104
Have a seat.

440
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:12,565
Thanks.

441
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:26,663
Let's drink.

442
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:40,760
How is it?

443
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,930
It's not bad. It's a little bitter though.

444
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:45,515
Is it?

445
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,017
I told them to bring a good one.

446
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,228
Shall I open another bottle?

447
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:52,605
It's okay. I don't feel like drinking.

448
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,945
About what we discussed earlier.

449
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,698
I know it's just on paper,

450
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,825
but I think we should do it right.

451
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:08,079
I'm not sure if I could get you
a wedding dress or wedding photos,

452
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,039
but it's not a wedding without

453
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,042
a wedding ring, is it?

454
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,419
What is this?

455
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,755
I know this is funny.

456
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,507
But we have wine and candles here.

457
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,010
I'm proposing to you now.

458
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,679
We split up seven years ago,

459
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,848
but we're back together
after all the complications.

460
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:30,143
Don't sound so serious.

461
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:33,646
It feels like we're
getting married for real.

462
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,023
Can't it be real?

463
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:39,402
I know you have feelings
for someone else now.

464
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:44,449
In an abnormal situation like this,
it's only natural for you to do so.

465
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,659
You were lonely and scared.

466
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,536
You had no one to count on.

467
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,664
But those emotions aren't real.

468
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,459
They'll be gone once you leave here.

469
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,003
They're fake.

470
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:07,931
So forget all about it

471
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,685
and marry me.

472
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,296
SWITCH BOX

473
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,602
What was that?

474
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,980
I heard there's no blackout in this place.

475
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,607
What's going on?

476
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,526
Mr. Cheon.

477
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,570
Mr. Cheon?

478
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,907
Call the substation.

479
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,201
I'll go check if there's a problem
with the electric pole.

480
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,327
Yes, sir.

481
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,024
What is he doing there?

482
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,656
He's crazy.

483
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,200
He should be in the hospital.

484
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,888
What will you do out there?

485
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,934
What? Will you go with him?

486
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:19,145
Will you live with him in North Korea?

487
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,063
Or...

488
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:22,482
Will you bring him to Seoul?

489
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,400
What are you going to do?

490
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,988
It's frustrating to ask you questions
where there's no answer.

491
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:30,990
This isn't right, Se-ri.

492
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:33,034
Don't open the door.

493
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:39,457
Do you think
he can really send you back home?

494
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,042
He kept failing.

495
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,835
Don't talk about him that way.

496
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,088
He did the best he could.

497
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,923
And I chose not to go at the last minute.

498
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,134
We're going to come up with another way.

499
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,552
Okay.

500
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,847
Let's say that you two somehow
concocted a plan.

501
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,308
What about the consequence?

502
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,103
Who'll pay for it?

503
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:02,105
What consequence?

504
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:03,606
We're in North Korea.

505
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,693
Your safe return to Korea means

506
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,320
that Ri Jeong Hyeok's safety
won't be guaranteed.

507
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,408
What makes you so sure of that?

508
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:18,079
I'm sure you know a woman named Seo Dan.
She's Ri Jeong Hyeok's fiancée.

509
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,708
How do you know that woman?

510
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,042
That woman figured it out.

511
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:26,254
She figured out your identity, Se-ri.

512
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,424
She said she wouldn't let Ri Jeong Hyeok

513
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:34,262
go out of his way
to give you shelter and protect you.

514
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,764
She said she'd expose you.
If she does, Ri Jeong Hyeok...

515
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,434
He will die here.

516
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,228
He'll die.

517
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:48,234
Everything will be okay
if you get through this and let him go.

518
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,362
Everything will go back in place.

519
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,449
You, back to where you belong.

520
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,162
And him, back to where he belongs.

521
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,326
What

522
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,745
are you doing here now?

523
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:43,831
Are you hurt?

524
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,084
You're

525
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,586
in no place to worry about others.

526
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,880
This is ridiculous.

527
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:55,176
Do you think a gunshot wound is a joke?
Did you not hear your doctor?

528
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:58,554
He said you had to be careful
for two to four weeks.

529
00:34:58,638 --> 00:34:59,931
Why did you come here

530
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:03,226
at this hour when it's freezing out here?
What on earth are you doing here?

531
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,186
Must you ask?

532
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:07,605
I came for you.

533
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,816
I figured you'd be waiting for me.

534
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,197
Sorry to disappoint you,

535
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,825
but I didn't wait for you.

536
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,203
Let me go back to Seoul.

537
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,664
I must go back,
so I can move on with my life.

538
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,876
-I'll find another way soon.
-But you didn't.

539
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,170
Your plans kept failing.
How could I trust you?

540
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:36,008
Seung-jun has a plan.

541
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,760
We'll register our marriage.

542
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,179
And I get a passport as a foreigner.

543
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:42,807
I can get out of here safely, then.

544
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,976
He just proposed to me.

545
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:52,525
That's what I'll do.

546
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,527
So,

547
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,697
it will be better
if we don't see each other again.

548
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,826
"We"...

549
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,911
I know I said it, but it's stupid.

550
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:05,872
There's no "us".

551
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,207
We're nothing.

552
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,377
Even being together like this
is a violation of the law.

553
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,506
I'm really sick of this place.

554
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,466
I desperately want to get out of here.

555
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:19,886
So don't try to stop me.

556
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,514
Coming all the way here
to take me with you

557
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,725
makes me really uncomfortable,
and I don't like it.

558
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:36,694
Do you mean it?

559
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,163
I mean it.

560
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:51,918
I understand.

561
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,091
I got it,

562
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:02,887
so don't cry.

563
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:36,921
It's all right.

564
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,131
Go back to your places.

565
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,514
Let's go back in.

566
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,267
Go back inside without me.

567
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,102
I want to be alone.

568
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,146
Okay.

569
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:58,150
It's cold outside.
Don't stay out too long.

570
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,483
It's freezing cold.

571
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,986
It's so cold.

572
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,365
He's all by himself.

573
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,494
What if he passes out on his way back?

574
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,248
What if then?

575
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:57,585
Oh, gosh. This is driving me crazy.

576
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,776
What should I do?

577
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:32,912
Se-ri!

578
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,538
Se-ri!

579
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:39,877
What...

580
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,551
Where did he go?

581
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,597
It hasn't been that long. Where is he?

582
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,637
Get in the car for now.

583
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,226
I'll give you a ride.

584
00:40:56,871 --> 00:41:00,458
Let go of me. I didn't come for this.

585
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:17,683
Gosh, Se-ri.

586
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,227
No way. How could she leave with the car?

587
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,147
You acted as if you had the best plan.

588
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,732
How could you let her betray you?

589
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:25,649
Do what?

590
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,360
We have one more problem.

591
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,112
What problem?

592
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,575
I only followed after you

593
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,286
because I was worried that you might

594
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:39,914
freeze to death in that condition.

595
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,417
That was my only intention coming here.

596
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:47,922
Okay.

597
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:53,219
I'll leave after I drop you off
at your house.

598
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,679
Nothing has changed between us.

599
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,017
I meant everything I said earlier.

600
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,395
And we'll go our separate ways
starting now.

601
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:17,701
I think the car Se-ri drove

602
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,578
should be out of gas by now.

603
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:25,584
Actually, I told them to bring gas
along with other supplies.

604
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,420
But she had to drive that car.
This is awful.

605
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:32,383
Goodness. The two of them
will freeze to death in this snowstorm.

606
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:44,061
I don't think it will stop snowing
anytime soon.

607
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,316
Then, what should we do?

608
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,196
There are no houses nearby.

609
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,699
There's a school not far from here.

610
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,951
We'll be able to start a fire there.

611
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:00,828
Let's go there.

612
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,493
It was hard to set up the appointment.

613
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,120
Only someone with my connections

614
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:46,123
could get you a meeting with Military
Director of the Central Committee.

615
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:47,583
By the way,

616
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:50,252
the Military Director
of the Central Committee has enough power

617
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:53,297
to go up against Director
of the General Political Bureau, right?

618
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,632
Listen to yourself.

619
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,925
Director of the General Political Bureau
is a setting sun.

620
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,594
But the Military Director is a rising sun.

621
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:01,430
If you don't want to get burnt
by the setting and rising sun,

622
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:03,807
make no mistakes and do it right.
Do you understand?

623
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,309
Don't worry.

624
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:09,313
Why do you think
Military Director agreed to meet with you?

625
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:11,523
The setting sun has to go down quickly,

626
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,484
but it's refusing to go down.

627
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:16,695
So the rising sun
is full of spite right now.

628
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:19,198
Military Director
is in dire need of an excuse

629
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:21,158
to oust the General Political
Bureau Director.

630
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:24,286
If you give him the right intel,

631
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,413
the table might turn.

632
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,123
Hey, if this goes well,

633
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:30,626
don't forget that I helped you. Okay?

634
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:03,909
So let me get this straight.

635
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,286
The son of the General Political
Bureau Director

636
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:10,916
is protecting an unidentified woman
from South Korea?

637
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,251
That is correct, sir.

638
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:15,003
And that woman belongs to Division 11

639
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,589
and is under special supervision.
And this hasn't been confirmed?

640
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,591
It's not that it wasn't confirmed.

641
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,468
It cannot be confirmed.

642
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,053
It has to be indicted

643
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,848
by the State Security Department
as an official investigation

644
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:29,476
in order to check the identity
of individual in Division 11.

645
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,186
As it is only a suspicion,

646
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,063
her identity cannot be confirmed.

647
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,231
On top of that,

648
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:37,234
this individual is connected to
the General Political Bureau Director,

649
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:38,277
it's more difficult.

650
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:42,156
So why did you come to me?

651
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:46,785
If you can get it approved by the General,

652
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:48,495
everything will be simple.

653
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:56,587
Making her a South Korean spy
will be the easiest.

654
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,298
Even the Director
of the General Political Bureau

655
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:01,717
won't be able to survive this.

656
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:05,053
I have a question.

657
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:09,266
Are you telling me
that old fox had no idea

658
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:10,768
what his son had been up to?

659
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:12,728
If he knew,

660
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:15,939
he would have definitely done
something about it.

661
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,525
You can't see
what's right in front of you.

662
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:21,570
Even the smartest man

663
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:25,949
fails to spot it
when his son is lying to him.

664
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,873
If I ask the General
for the approval myself,

665
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:35,542
I'll be putting my career
on the line as well.

666
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:41,632
For me to do that,
I must be certain that she's alive.

667
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:46,011
Bring that South Korean woman
to me at once.

668
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,263
Okay, I will.

669
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:04,196
Yes, Lieutenant Commander Cho.
Captain Ri hasn't come back home.

670
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:09,076
His officers did come
by his house in the evening.

671
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,244
Is that so?

672
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:13,038
It seems it's been a while
since he got discharged.

673
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:15,290
Why isn't he at home? Where did he go?

674
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:16,750
Okay.

675
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,628
If Captain Ri or that woman
come back home,

676
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:20,921
report to me immediately.

677
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,005
Yes, sir.

678
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:26,051
There. This is the part.

679
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:33,892
Captain Ri asked me
if he could watch the footage yesterday.

680
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:36,645
And he wrote down the plate number.

681
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:40,941
That bastard.

682
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,903
Given today's weather,
we can't go out to look for them.

683
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:46,446
After observing them together,

684
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:49,575
I don't think this will be simple.

685
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,743
Are you there, Ms. Seo?

686
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:54,454
I'm listening.

687
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:59,293
This time, I need you to make a move.

688
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:33,035
Will you really do it?

689
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:35,829
Do what?

690
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,414
Marry him.

691
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,794
It's just on paper. Why not?

692
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,798
Even so, marriage isn't a joke.

693
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:49,301
And the situation we are in
isn't a joke, either.

694
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:57,225
Anyway, I don't think
that's how people should get married.

695
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,019
Look who's talking.

696
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:03,190
I heard that your fiancée, whom
you'll soon marry, found out about me.

697
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:05,609
Did you know that?

698
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:07,527
Yes.

699
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,322
What if she reports us? What happens then?

700
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:15,744
Does it mean that you two will
break off the engagement?

701
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:20,040
Are you worried that
my engagement might be broken?

702
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,629
I'm worried that your life might be.

703
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:29,591
Your life here

704
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:32,511
might be shattered because of me.

705
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,057
I don't like that.

706
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:53,156
Is Ms. Seo Dan your first love?

707
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:56,994
Did you two go to the same middle school?

708
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:00,622
No.

709
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,834
We didn't know each other
when we were in school.

710
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:05,502
Then, who is it?

711
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,297
I'm asking about your first love.

712
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:10,799
Who is it?

713
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:22,310
No wonder.

714
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,772
You do look like the forever-single type.

715
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:31,987
I'm not sure what you mean by that,

716
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:34,406
but it sounds very insulting.

717
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:35,907
Yes.

718
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:37,784
That's probably right.

719
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:40,454
Well, that word

720
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:42,914
is a bit insulting.

721
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:25,665
Man Bok.

722
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,585
Why are you drinking so late at night?

723
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:30,796
Did I wake you up?

724
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,673
Go back to sleep.

725
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:42,557
Is it because you're worried

726
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:44,476
about Captain Ri?

727
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:46,895
How do you know that?

728
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:49,731
I've been the wife
of the Rat for ten years.

729
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:51,566
Why wouldn't I know that?

730
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,401
Is that so?

731
00:51:56,404 --> 00:52:00,867
Man Bok, you are just fulfilling your duty
given by our country.

732
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,537
Even if something happens to him,

733
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,997
that won't be your fault.

734
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,332
Honey.

735
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:17,551
Do you remember Captain Ri Mu Hyeok?

736
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:19,636
Of course.

737
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:22,389
He was very good to our family.

738
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:25,183
I...

739
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,269
let that man die.

740
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:31,148
Well, your mission said--

741
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:32,357
And

742
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,570
his younger brother
is Captain Ri Jeong Hyeok.

743
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,322
Really?

744
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:44,411
If something happened
to Captain Ri Jeong Hyeok, too,

745
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:48,790
I don't think I could live with it.

746
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:53,670
I let the men who treated me
like a human being die,

747
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:58,300
and I have to stay loyal to the man
who doesn't treat me like a human being.

748
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,886
If that's my mission
given by our country...

749
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:05,432
If that's my life,

750
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,145
don't you think that's too cruel?

751
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:56,149
You have a fever.

752
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,700
Seeing how you're sleeping
in this position,

753
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,869
you're obviously a soldier.

754
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:58,753
Be safe.

755
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:00,714
You too.

756
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:03,383
All right. You're going to be late.
Go on, then.

757
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:10,015
This is for you.

758
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:15,145
What? Where did you get the money?

759
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:17,981
I bought this with the prize money
I received during that competition.

760
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:20,817
You should've gotten something
for yourself instead.

761
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:23,695
I heard that the trees
at the outpost are so thick

762
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:25,071
that sunlight can't get through.

763
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,531
You should keep track of time.

764
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:29,326
Still, I don't need one
that's this expensive.

765
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:30,785
Just try it on.

766
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:34,122
Go on.

767
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:43,089
It sure looks good.

768
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:46,593
Thanks, Jeong Hyeok.

769
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:47,969
Don't say that.

770
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,055
I'm the one who's always grateful.

771
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:54,309
All right. You'll be late. Go on.

772
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:21,836
Mu Hyeok.

773
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:26,091
Mu Hyeok!

774
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:35,683
Are you okay?

775
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:43,066
This won't do.

776
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:45,235
We should go back home or to the hospital.

777
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:48,780
The sun's out, and it has stopped snowing.
Let's go, okay?

778
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:01,501
Hi.

779
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:05,880
Sit down.

780
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:10,885
Dan, what is it?

781
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:15,640
There's something I must tell you.

782
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:25,191
Why aren't they here yet?

783
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:27,902
I requested a car,

784
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:31,614
but I think they're having trouble
getting here due to the snow.

785
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,992
Damn it.

786
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,662
There it is.

787
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:39,873
I don't think that's it.

788
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:41,207
What is that?

789
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:42,500
Who are they?

790
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:43,918
Why are they here?

791
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:48,006
-Why are there so many of them?
-Search this instant.

792
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:49,382
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

793
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:52,844
-Hold on.
-What is it?

794
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:54,137
-What's going on?
-Excuse me.

795
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:55,555
What's wrong?

796
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:57,765
Is this because of Se-ri?

797
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:59,934
She's not here.

798
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:10,320
You shouldn't treat me this way.

799
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:12,363
I'm a guest.

800
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:14,949
You should be at my service!

801
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,875
Fine. Do as you please.

802
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:25,835
You want my money, right?

803
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:28,546
But you won't get any.

804
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:32,425
Listen up, you South Korean scaredy-cat.
I'm not interested in money.

805
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:36,095
I just needed things that I could only get
through money.

806
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:38,014
For example,

807
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:40,350
I want the power

808
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:43,978
to be able to kill whoever and wherever.

809
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:51,402
But I don't need such power to kill you.

810
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:54,030
People think you're dead in South Korea.

811
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,865
So even if I killed you here and now,

812
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:57,534
no one would know.

813
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,416
Where is Yoon Se-ri?

814
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:32,527
There's no way I could've said all that.

815
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:34,779
Do you really not remember?

816
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:36,531
How much

817
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:39,409
did I tell her?

818
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:42,036
Everything. You told her everything.

819
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:45,081
What will happen to Captain Ri?

820
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:48,334
He'll be reviled by both families.

821
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,461
The wedding will fall through as well.

822
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:54,424
Wouldn't that put Se-ri in danger?

823
00:59:57,051 --> 01:00:00,346
She tortured me with alcohol,
and I gave in.

824
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:03,182
She tortured you, my foot.

825
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:05,310
You even told her to write it all down.

826
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:08,938
Gosh, you were so active and enthusiastic.

827
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:10,982
Do you really not remember anything?

828
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:14,402
Hey, that woman looked at me and thought,

829
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:18,323
"He looks like he's in the highest rank,

830
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:21,200
so he must have
all the high-level information."

831
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:22,744
She was determined to target me,

832
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:25,079
so what could I have done?

833
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:29,250
You probably looked the easiest among us.

834
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:34,964
Come on, now.

835
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:38,926
If you want to succeed, you should let go
of what happened in the past.

836
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,512
Focus on handling the problem
that's right in front of you first.

837
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:42,764
You're right.

838
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:47,435
This is what I think.

839
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:49,646
I was tortured yesterday

840
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:51,981
and spilled a bit,

841
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:54,442
just a tiny bit of the truth.

842
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:58,279
But if Captain Ri
doesn't find out about it,

843
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:00,156
I think everything will be fine.

844
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:01,616
What are you saying?

845
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:04,369
I mean, please don't tell him about this.

846
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:09,540
Comrades.

847
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:11,292
Comrades.

848
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,795
Aren't we comrades?

849
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:15,463
Ju Meok. Eun Dong.

850
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:27,058
Where did you go so early in the morning?

851
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:30,645
Where were you yesterday
when you were getting drunk?

852
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,607
Frankly speaking, I sensed that
something was off

853
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:38,319
between you and Jeong Hyeok,

854
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:39,904
so I went out.

855
01:01:39,987 --> 01:01:42,115
I called the hospital,

856
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:43,658
but they said he had been discharged.

857
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:45,284
So I thought he went home.

858
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,162
Mom.

859
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,665
Hey, hear me out first.

860
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:55,461
I went to his place, but he wasn't there.
Only his men were.

861
01:01:55,545 --> 01:02:00,049
One of them seemed like a loudmouth.

862
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:03,052
So I tried to make him spill.

863
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:04,554
And?

864
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:08,266
What did he tell you?

865
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:12,061
I heard it. I heard it all.

866
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,481
Heard what?

867
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:18,609
I don't remember.

868
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:21,946
That's absurd.

869
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:25,366
A swallow from the South?

870
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:26,951
Out of three meals,

871
01:02:27,034 --> 01:02:29,620
two of them have meat dishes?

872
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:33,750
The hair smells like flowers?

873
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:35,710
Flowers?

874
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:37,962
I really did hear everything.

875
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:42,258
It was something extremely shocking.

876
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:46,429
But I can't, for the life of me,
remember why I was so shocked.

877
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:48,556
I also decided to do something.

878
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:51,350
But I just can't remember...

879
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:54,103
what it was.

880
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,487
What is this on your wrist?

881
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:04,155
What?

882
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,490
Oh, right.

883
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:08,659
I wrote down the main points here
so that I wouldn't forget.

884
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:11,245
"Swallow from the South."

885
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:15,041
Aren't all swallows from there?

886
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:19,462
You wrote down such nonsense.

887
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:23,633
"Out of three meals,
two of them have meat dishes"?

888
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:25,593
Are there swallows that eat meat?

889
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:29,764
-I don't know.
-"Elas" what?

890
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:31,891
"The hair smells like flowers"?

891
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:35,978
Darn it. I bet military codes
are easier to decipher than this.

892
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:39,023
Mom.

893
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:41,776
What are you so curious about?

894
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:48,491
I want to know

895
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:51,536
if you

896
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:54,914
and your fiancé have any problems.

897
01:03:56,707 --> 01:03:57,792
I want to know...

898
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:03,840
if you are happy.

899
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:07,468
I want to know if he loves you.

900
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:11,347
These are what I'm most curious about.

901
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:20,273
Mom.

902
01:04:20,898 --> 01:04:22,817
Don't you worry.

903
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:26,487
No matter what happens,
I'm going to marry him

904
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:29,991
and live happily ever after.

905
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:53,764
Come on. Let's go back to the hospital.

906
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:57,351
I'll be fine after taking medication
and going to bed.

907
01:04:58,269 --> 01:04:59,937
You always say that.

908
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:11,365
Where are you going?

909
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:12,617
I'm not going anywhere.

910
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:17,288
I mean, I'll go eventually.

911
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:19,206
But right now, you're sick.

912
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:23,502
And it's Christmas.

913
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:34,472
So focus on getting some rest
and recovering.

914
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:49,195
Hello, sir.

915
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:53,532
Have Jeong Hyeok and Se-ri
returned home together?

916
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,621
No, sir. No one's home yet.

917
01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:00,498
Report immediately if anything comes up.

918
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:01,499
Yes, sir.

919
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:10,216
-Let's go to the military housing.
-Yes, sir!

920
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:14,637
PARADISE FOR THE PEOPLE

921
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:19,141
Since winter break has started
for the kids, it'll get noisy.

922
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:23,396
Just thinking about cooking
three meals a day

923
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,606
-gives me goosebumps.
-You can say that again.

924
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,191
-Mom.
-Mom.

925
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:29,610
-They're here.
-Hello.

926
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:31,070
-Hi.
-Mom.

927
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:35,241
Before returning to your homes,

928
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:37,201
show us your exam results.

929
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:39,286
You took the final exams, right?

930
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:42,039
-Oh, right.
-I aced mine.

931
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:46,419
I see. Good job.

932
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:50,172
I only got a few questions wrong.

933
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:51,424
Really? Let me see.

934
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:53,968
Let's see. All right.

935
01:06:54,051 --> 01:06:55,970
Goodness, you're going to succeed in life!

936
01:06:56,053 --> 01:06:57,596
You excel at everything!

937
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:58,639
Great job!

938
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:02,643
Ho Yeong, let me see yours.

939
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:06,063
Mom,

940
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:08,691
you'll be very embarrassed.

941
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:09,900
Will it be okay?

942
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:11,902
You little brat.

943
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,989
Did you come in last again?

944
01:07:15,072 --> 01:07:16,866
You little prick!

945
01:07:16,949 --> 01:07:18,451
Wol Suk.

946
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:21,746
You need to help your kids
with their studies.

947
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:25,708
When it comes to slow-learners like him,
they need more attention.

948
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,921
I heard Nam Sik has a tutor.

949
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:32,006
Yes.

950
01:07:32,089 --> 01:07:33,799
She's from Kim Il Sung University.

951
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:36,927
-Really?
-Is that true?

952
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:40,347
Yes. Her name is Kim Ju Yeong.

953
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:43,809
She's well known in Kaesong,
and I've hired her.

954
01:07:44,685 --> 01:07:47,772
Do you think
she could teach Ho Yeong as well?

955
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:49,398
I'm sorry, but no.

956
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:52,151
She only teaches one student every year.

957
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:55,404
And one of them is Nam Sik?

958
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:58,324
Mom!

959
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:00,493
Nam Sik!

960
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:03,204
It seems like you're set to study medicine
at Kim Il Sung University.

961
01:08:03,287 --> 01:08:06,540
When it comes to knowing
a lot of information

962
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:09,251
and putting things into action,
you're the best.

963
01:08:10,002 --> 01:08:12,588
So what's your score?

964
01:08:14,381 --> 01:08:17,093
I think I aced it.

965
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:19,345
Really? Goodness.

966
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:22,640
Your tutor said it'd take some time,
but that was quick!

967
01:08:22,723 --> 01:08:25,309
She sure is talented!

968
01:08:25,392 --> 01:08:26,977
Let me see.

969
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:31,398
KAESONG ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
FINAL EXAM, ETHICS

970
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:34,485
KAESONG ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
FINAL EXAM, ETHICS

971
01:08:34,568 --> 01:08:37,488
Mom, don't look at the scores separately.

972
01:08:37,571 --> 01:08:39,240
Look at the total sum.

973
01:08:39,323 --> 01:08:42,284
It's exactly 100.

974
01:08:43,828 --> 01:08:45,788
-Let's go.
-Let's go home too.

975
01:08:45,871 --> 01:08:47,206
Let's go eat.

976
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:48,374
Let's eat. Good boy.

977
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:56,257
Where are you going?

978
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:59,301
Ms. Kim will be teaching
an advanced class today--

979
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:01,470
You little punk!

980
01:09:01,846 --> 01:09:04,140
Where's that stick? Where is it?

981
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:05,224
Don't do it!

982
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:07,810
Don't go, you prick! Come here!

983
01:09:07,893 --> 01:09:10,521
Stop right there!
You need a good beating to wake up!

984
01:09:10,604 --> 01:09:12,690
Come over here!

985
01:09:12,857 --> 01:09:14,441
Look who's here.

986
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:16,193
Sam Suk.

987
01:09:25,452 --> 01:09:26,453
So...

988
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:31,125
Did you come back
after finding something out?

989
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:32,459
What?

990
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:34,628
His fiancée moved here yesterday.

991
01:09:37,464 --> 01:09:38,299
I see.

992
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:42,052
She brought a huge hanging TV,

993
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:44,972
high-tech washing machine,
talking rice cooker,

994
01:09:45,055 --> 01:09:46,765
and what else?

995
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:48,225
What is it?

996
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:50,519
Right! The bed was huge!

997
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:53,189
I've never seen such a big bed before.

998
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:54,815
It was this big.

999
01:09:55,816 --> 01:09:58,110
That's how newlyweds' houses look like.

1000
01:09:58,194 --> 01:09:59,320
I understand.

1001
01:09:59,403 --> 01:10:01,322
I just came back temporarily.

1002
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:03,991
I just stopped by.

1003
01:10:04,074 --> 01:10:05,284
But since I'm here,

1004
01:10:05,492 --> 01:10:08,495
I wanted to get you guys gifts
as a thank you.

1005
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:10,456
Gifts?

1006
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:11,582
Gifts?

1007
01:10:11,665 --> 01:10:15,753
But you don't have any money, do you?

1008
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:17,671
She's right.

1009
01:10:17,963 --> 01:10:20,216
You're the poorest one here.

1010
01:10:29,099 --> 01:10:32,102
This isn't just any diamond.

1011
01:10:32,186 --> 01:10:34,563
This is a level one,
three-carat VVS diamond.

1012
01:10:36,857 --> 01:10:39,443
You'll know immediately
once you shine light on it.

1013
01:10:40,027 --> 01:10:41,654
It'll reflect the light very clearly.

1014
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:43,864
This round brilliant cut diamond

1015
01:10:43,948 --> 01:10:45,824
will look like dancing raindrops.

1016
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:50,120
The rest of the ring is made of
high-purity 18k white gold,

1017
01:10:50,204 --> 01:10:51,956
but I don't need to tell you that, do I?

1018
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:54,083
Right.

1019
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:56,252
What she said is true.

1020
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:57,503
I can vouch for her.

1021
01:10:58,796 --> 01:11:00,923
Yeong Ae is very sophisticated.

1022
01:11:01,006 --> 01:11:03,342
She wouldn't just vouch for anyone.

1023
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:07,263
Goodness, it sparkles magnificently,
doesn't it?

1024
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:09,431
That's a given.

1025
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:12,893
All right, then.
Shall we begin the bargaining?

1026
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:16,480
We'll start with 5,000,000 won.

1027
01:11:17,398 --> 01:11:18,691
What?

1028
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:21,777
I'll raise it 100,000 won more
every time you say that.

1029
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:23,237
5,100,000 won.

1030
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,321
5,100,000 won?

1031
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:26,115
5,200,000 won.

1032
01:11:26,198 --> 01:11:27,116
5,200,000 won?

1033
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:35,291
This is all I have.

1034
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:36,834
It's probably around

1035
01:11:36,917 --> 01:11:39,378
140,000 won.

1036
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:41,380
I can't buy that. I have no money.

1037
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:43,882
-I'll give you a discount.
-Who'd buy that from me?

1038
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:46,135
Like I've told you before,

1039
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:48,846
I only accept items
such as thick leather jackets

1040
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:50,222
or hair.

1041
01:11:51,223 --> 01:11:53,684
Bring me clothes

1042
01:11:53,767 --> 01:11:55,936
or something you can eat.

1043
01:11:59,189 --> 01:12:00,816
Look here.

1044
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,694
Let's be more flexible, shall we?

1045
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:07,281
There's a long story behind this.

1046
01:12:07,364 --> 01:12:09,742
Yes. Excuse me.

1047
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:23,547
Then how about we exchange
everything you have here with this ring?

1048
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:24,673
Everything?

1049
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:51,075
By the way, what did you tell him?

1050
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:53,911
Oh, I didn't say much.

1051
01:12:53,994 --> 01:12:55,913
You don't need to worry about that.

1052
01:12:55,996 --> 01:12:57,956
She got dumped.

1053
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:01,794
She's not sane right now.

1054
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:03,796
Take the ring.

1055
01:13:04,171 --> 01:13:05,547
She won't be able to take it back.

1056
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:22,898
This is Se-ri one. This is Se-ri one.
If someone hears me--

1057
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:24,733
It's not her?

1058
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:27,528
This isn't Chairwoman Yoon Se-ri's voice?

1059
01:13:27,611 --> 01:13:30,072
No. Her brother and his wife confirmed it.

1060
01:13:30,155 --> 01:13:30,989
They're certain.

1061
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:33,492
Shouldn't you do a voice-print?

1062
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:35,119
We already did.

1063
01:13:35,452 --> 01:13:38,247
But they're having a difficult time
since the sound is too vague.

1064
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:41,667
Also, she's already been announced dead.

1065
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:44,169
Didn't you watch the news two days ago?

1066
01:13:47,631 --> 01:13:51,718
This is Se-ri one. This is Se-ri one.
If someone hears me--

1067
01:13:52,177 --> 01:13:54,263
See? I got goosebumps
and an allergic reaction.

1068
01:13:54,346 --> 01:13:56,014
My body remembers her voice.

1069
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,559
If your body can remember it,

1070
01:13:58,642 --> 01:14:00,185
why can't her family?

1071
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:08,819
The siblings don't really get along.

1072
01:14:08,902 --> 01:14:10,529
Her brother called her once,

1073
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:13,323
and she blocked his number.

1074
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:15,159
-Why?
-You see,

1075
01:14:15,659 --> 01:14:18,871
it's impossible for people like us
to understand conglomerate families.

1076
01:14:19,246 --> 01:14:21,707
I've witnessed it all.

1077
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:25,252
They value shares over sibling bonds
and stocks over their children.

1078
01:14:25,335 --> 01:14:26,670
But still...

1079
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:29,339
Her parents may think otherwise.

1080
01:14:30,048 --> 01:14:31,300
Let's visit her mother.

1081
01:14:31,383 --> 01:14:32,718
She gave birth to her.

1082
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:35,012
She'll definitely recognize
her daughter's voice.

1083
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:37,806
She's not the birth mother.

1084
01:14:39,224 --> 01:14:42,227
I found out not too long ago.

1085
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:44,188
Then how about the chairman?

1086
01:14:44,271 --> 01:14:46,273
He's her biological father, right?

1087
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:48,358
You've finally gone insane.

1088
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:51,111
How could we possibly meet him?

1089
01:15:01,288 --> 01:15:03,207
He's here.

1090
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:08,170
Chairman Yoon.

1091
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:10,631
-Chairman Yoon?
-Chairman Yoon.

1092
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:12,090
Chairman Yoon!

1093
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:21,183
Hey, I already saw your faces.

1094
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:24,311
Come here. I said, come here.

1095
01:15:24,811 --> 01:15:26,980
-Are you talking to us?
-Just come here already.

1096
01:15:34,404 --> 01:15:35,531
Why are you here?

1097
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,533
We were passing by.

1098
01:15:38,283 --> 01:15:39,868
You were passing by?

1099
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:43,705
You were passing by this VIP parking lot?

1100
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:46,166
What's going on?

1101
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:50,546
It's nothing, Father.
They manage this parking lot.

1102
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:52,089
-You should go in first.
-Is that so?

1103
01:15:54,174 --> 01:15:55,425
Sir, I have something to say!

1104
01:15:55,592 --> 01:15:57,928
Just go inside.
You don't need to worry about them.

1105
01:15:58,011 --> 01:15:59,638
They were asking for some money.

1106
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:01,348
I can take care of it. Go in first.

1107
01:16:06,353 --> 01:16:11,108
-Sir! Chairwoman Yoon is alive!
-Get rid of him.

1108
01:16:17,447 --> 01:16:20,576
That hurts! Hold on!

1109
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:21,994
Sir!

1110
01:16:22,703 --> 01:16:24,454
Chairman Yoon!

1111
01:16:25,497 --> 01:16:26,415
What's wrong with him?

1112
01:16:26,498 --> 01:16:27,666
What are you doing? Hurry up!

1113
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:30,210
Chairwoman Yoon is alive!

1114
01:16:30,294 --> 01:16:34,339
My allergic reaction is proof!

1115
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:35,716
He's telling the truth!

1116
01:16:35,799 --> 01:16:38,677
I heard her voice!

1117
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:39,928
You better brace yourselves.

1118
01:16:40,012 --> 01:16:41,930
You'll be seeing my lawyer tomorrow.

1119
01:16:42,889 --> 01:16:43,974
Sir!

1120
01:16:44,057 --> 01:16:45,267
Sir!

1121
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:58,280
It really hurts!

1122
01:16:58,363 --> 01:17:00,449
-Why are you doing this?
-Let me go!

1123
01:17:00,532 --> 01:17:02,868
Let me go!

1124
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:04,202
Let me go!

1125
01:18:50,642 --> 01:18:51,643
Hello?

1126
01:18:51,893 --> 01:18:53,186
It's me.

1127
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:54,563
Where are you?

1128
01:18:54,938 --> 01:18:56,398
Why have you called me?

1129
01:18:56,481 --> 01:18:59,151
By the way, who's phone is this?

1130
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:02,571
I'm leaving now.

1131
01:19:04,114 --> 01:19:05,115
To where?

1132
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:06,825
Come on.

1133
01:19:07,534 --> 01:19:11,079
I told you already that I'll be leaving
with Gu Seung-jun.

1134
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:12,831
You'll be leaving right now?

1135
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:13,957
Yes.

1136
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:16,501
It turned out that way.

1137
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,712
I'm leaving sooner than expected.

1138
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:21,047
Where are you right now? I'll be there.

1139
01:19:21,631 --> 01:19:25,719
No, I've already left in a car.

1140
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:29,681
I'm sorry I didn't even have the chance
to say goodbye.

1141
01:19:30,056 --> 01:19:34,019
But we've already said our goodbyes
many times before.

1142
01:19:34,144 --> 01:19:35,937
We don't need to say it again.

1143
01:19:36,521 --> 01:19:37,355
You're wrong.

1144
01:19:39,316 --> 01:19:40,525
I know we've said it

1145
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:43,028
many times before, but we still need
to say our last goodbyes.

1146
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:45,781
We do need to say it again.

1147
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:48,200
So tell me where you are right now.

1148
01:19:48,325 --> 01:19:50,577
You're unreasonable.

1149
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:53,872
I've already left.

1150
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:56,666
It just turned out that way.

1151
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:59,211
So stop asking where I am

1152
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:02,088
or saying that you'll come to see me.

1153
01:20:02,172 --> 01:20:03,590
Se-ri, please!

1154
01:20:04,090 --> 01:20:05,592
Just one minute!

1155
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:08,178
I don't care if you're far away.
I'll be there.

1156
01:20:08,261 --> 01:20:09,387
So please wait.

1157
01:20:10,430 --> 01:20:11,431
I'll be there soon!

1158
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:13,308
Goodbye.

1159
01:20:15,352 --> 01:20:16,603
Be safe.

1160
01:20:17,187 --> 01:20:19,147
I hope you have a good wedding.

1161
01:20:19,773 --> 01:20:21,691
I hope you have a lovely family.

1162
01:20:23,235 --> 01:20:24,444
Be happy.

1163
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:26,738
Live a long,

1164
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,573
happy life.

1165
01:20:30,534 --> 01:20:32,327
Forget about

1166
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:34,329
our time together.

1167
01:20:36,623 --> 01:20:37,457
Make sure

1168
01:20:38,458 --> 01:20:39,584
you do that.

1169
01:20:43,797 --> 01:20:45,257
Don't hang up!

1170
01:20:49,177 --> 01:20:50,470
Listen to me.

1171
01:20:51,721 --> 01:20:54,266
Tell me what you see. I can find you.

1172
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:55,934
Jeong Hyeok.

1173
01:20:59,604 --> 01:21:00,647
I love you.

1174
01:23:21,579 --> 01:23:23,373
1 YEAR AGO

1175
01:23:41,975 --> 01:23:44,060
RA-HA, DADDY'S SORRY. MERRY CHRISTMAS

1176
01:23:48,732 --> 01:23:51,985
Mr. Hong, where's the marketing plan
for next year's Lunar New Year?

1177
01:23:52,068 --> 01:23:54,320
I think I asked you to print it out again.

1178
01:23:55,822 --> 01:23:56,823
What's wrong?

1179
01:23:57,782 --> 01:23:59,409
Isn't this too harsh, ma'am?

1180
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:02,579
It's Christmas Eve and 10:00 p.m. at that.

1181
01:24:02,662 --> 01:24:04,831
I think this is too much.

1182
01:24:04,914 --> 01:24:07,333
Are you Christian, Mr. Hong?

1183
01:24:07,417 --> 01:24:08,960
-No.
-Then

1184
01:24:09,544 --> 01:24:11,171
why is someone else's birthday important?

1185
01:24:17,761 --> 01:24:20,180
Let's be real.
It's someone else's birthday.

1186
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:23,099
So why would you go out of your way

1187
01:24:23,183 --> 01:24:26,728
to decorate a tree?

1188
01:24:28,146 --> 01:24:31,941
Why would you bother to write a card?

1189
01:24:42,952 --> 01:24:45,997
I mean, why would you give gifts?

1190
01:24:47,248 --> 01:24:48,625
Is it their birthdays?

1191
01:24:48,708 --> 01:24:52,462
Isn't it ridiculous?

1192
01:24:52,587 --> 01:24:53,922
Don't you think so?

1193
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:57,801
They're all idiots.

1194
01:25:01,596 --> 01:25:02,680
Life

1195
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:05,225
is full of surprises.

1196
01:25:06,059 --> 01:25:09,729
You can't be sure of anything in life.

1197
01:25:32,669 --> 01:25:35,296
I miss you, Jeong Hyeok.

1198
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:37,966
She's dead. You won't ever find her.

1199
01:25:38,049 --> 01:25:40,343
Whom did you ask for help
to make me regret my actions?

1200
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:43,805
-Wake up!
-Hey, look at that.

1201
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:46,975
Are you saying Sam Suk is from the South?

1202
01:25:48,101 --> 01:25:49,769
This is an urgent investigation request.

1203
01:25:49,853 --> 01:25:51,896
Didn't Jeong Hyeok visit you?

1204
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:55,400
You're hiding that woman
and risking our family's safety!

1205
01:25:55,483 --> 01:25:57,152
If something happens to her,

1206
01:25:57,735 --> 01:25:59,904
I'll be living in hell
until the day I die.
