1
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,971
ALL CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND BACKGROUND ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,307
Walk towards that tree.

3
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:00,936
That's the entrance
of the South Korean search team.

4
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,607
The search team will do a round
in the morning,

5
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:07,025
so ask them for help.

6
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,238
By any chance,

7
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:16,201
can you walk me there?

8
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,290
I can't take a single step

9
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,083
over this line.

10
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,636
Don't forget to keep your eyes
on the rocks.

11
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,270
Jeong Hyeok,

12
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:46,148
don't forget about me.

13
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,483
I won't.

14
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:52,613
How would I forget about a woman
who fell from the sky?

15
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,991
I didn't fall from the sky.

16
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,159
I descended.

17
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,495
Sure.

18
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:09,796
I will get going now.

19
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:55,926
A single step

20
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,429
should be okay.

21
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:47,227
EPISODE 10

22
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,313
MAY SHE REST IN PEACE

23
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,359
REST IN PEACE

24
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,487
Did you hear that our company will be
acquired by Queens Group?

25
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,239
It's a big company. Isn't it good?

26
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,491
But what about the personnel reform?

27
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,327
You're right.

28
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,664
Why did she die all of a sudden
and cause all this mess?

29
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,514
Wait.

30
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,225
What's wrong with the picture?

31
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,186
Who picked it?

32
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,690
Let me take a look at this.

33
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,277
I should see who prayed
for the repose of my soul

34
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,696
and who didn't.

35
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:41,782
Who are you?

36
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,871
-What?
-My gosh.

37
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,331
-What's going on?
-What?

38
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,416
-It's her.
-She's back.

39
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,001
-My goodness.
-What's going on?

40
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,711
Go ahead and spread the news.

41
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,088
That Yoon Se-ri is back.

42
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,425
She's back alive.

43
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:03,678
I apologize to those
who were shocked because of me.

44
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,265
And I feel bad for those who were happy

45
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:08,934
that I was dead.

46
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,562
I'm back alive.

47
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:13,772
This is amazing.

48
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,442
To thank you all
and commemorate my comeback,

49
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:21,988
all the products of Se-ri's Choice
will go on sale at half price

50
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,908
for a week starting from today.

51
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,576
-Seriously?
-Awesome.

52
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,745
-I can't believe this.
-As you might know,

53
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:32,624
Se-ri's Choice has never
offered discounts since its founding.

54
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,294
Please enjoy our premium products

55
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,422
with a special offer like never before.

56
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,645
I'm sorry that I've caused...

57
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,105
You sound too confident, honey.

58
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,153
I'm sorry to have worried you...

59
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,406
That sounds too timid.

60
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,324
You just sound like a criminal.

61
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,327
From now on...

62
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,872
-Gosh, I don't know. I can't do this.
-Yes, you can.

63
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,083
You're charged with assault.

64
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,128
You should look polite and kind

65
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:21,590
to make people believe
that you wouldn't do such a thing.

66
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:23,550
Just try it again.

67
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:30,140
Damn it! I can't do this.
I'm not doing it.

68
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:34,686
Honey. Listen, Se-jun.
You have to be on the photo line.

69
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,896
There's a statute
of limitations on a crime.

70
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,982
But it's not like that
when it comes to photos.

71
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,817
It lasts forever.

72
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,069
Okay.

73
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,490
Now that you've sat down,
let's spray your bald spots black, okay?

74
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,409
This is bad.

75
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,245
Stress can cause hair loss.

76
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,872
Don't be stressed out.

77
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,959
Yoon Se-hyeong, that jerk
will giggle and everything.

78
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,919
It just hurts my pride so bad.

79
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,921
That idiot embezzled from the company

80
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,215
and got swindled,
but he still got away with it.

81
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,635
I'm the only one who got prosecuted.

82
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,512
Why is the world being like this to me?

83
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:12,432
Is this our unlucky year?

84
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,809
Things would've been better
if it was Se-ri.

85
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,436
To be honest, she's competent.

86
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,064
But it's just Se-hyeong and me.

87
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,440
And I'm not picked?

88
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,317
MR. HWANG

89
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,116
Hello? What?

90
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,660
Who?

91
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,244
Who's back?

92
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,580
AIRCRAFT-RELATED

93
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,474
You said she didn't die.

94
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,518
You said you were sure.

95
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,813
You said you even met
Chairman Jeung-pyeong.

96
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,191
You said there are
two absolute truths in the world.

97
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,444
That house prices in Seoul never fall
and that Yoon Se-ri is alive.

98
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,239
You said those two things
are absolutely true.

99
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:11,908
Just say something.

100
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,034
I'm sorry.

101
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:16,579
Why can't you keep your head up?
Why don't you raise your head

102
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,206
and talk back to me like you did before?

103
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,168
Go on, say something.
Is your mouth locked?

104
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,878
-What's the passcode?
-I'm sorry.

105
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,089
Did you change the passcode? Is it 1234?

106
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,507
Say something.

107
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,843
My gosh.

108
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,598
Ms. Yoon.

109
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,810
Ms. Yoon!

110
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,316
The topic of this emergency board meeting

111
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,403
is about the change of CEO
and major shareholders.

112
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:54,576
You must've been worried about the company

113
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,536
in an extremely precarious situation.

114
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,622
We should take this as a chance
to turn lemons into lemonade.

115
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,374
From now on, Queens Group

116
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,711
will be taking over Se-ri's Choice.

117
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,423
Of course,

118
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,717
we will be giving the executives

119
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,011
better treatments accordingly.

120
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,513
I believe

121
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,974
it will be exceptionally good.

122
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,939
Su-chan, I'm busy now. What's the matter?

123
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,400
What?

124
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:38,453
Mr. Hong.

125
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,624
I feel itchy. It is her.

126
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,836
It's really her.

127
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,631
You're really her.

128
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:53,218
I have a lot of things to say
and bones to pick with you.

129
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:57,972
But, anyway, it's so good
to see you again.

130
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,894
Where have you been?

131
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,107
We've been looking all over for you.

132
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:09,567
What?

133
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,111
Well...

134
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,947
Did you really look around for me?

135
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,658
Are you serious?

136
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:21,746
My gosh.

137
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,165
You look much better though.

138
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,125
No...

139
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,710
That's not true.

140
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:31,881
We will take a show of hands then.

141
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:35,385
Those in favor of changing the CEO.

142
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,521
-What? Who is she?
-Ms. Yoon?

143
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,356
-Gosh, Ms. Yoon.
-How...

144
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,275
Ms. Yoon, is it you?

145
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,861
Would it feel like this

146
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:55,196
if I walked out of the coffin

147
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,573
at my funeral?

148
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,035
Who offered how much
funeral donation at my funeral,

149
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:05,540
and who talked badly of me
beside my coffin.

150
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,460
I feel like I found it all out.

151
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,674
Those who just raised your hands.

152
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,388
I'll pretend it didn't happen.

153
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:23,182
So please go ahead and get back to work.

154
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,234
Sang-a.

155
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,362
What on earth happened--

156
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,949
You chose a Japanese restaurant
for our first family dinner.

157
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,576
I thought,

158
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:45,538
"She sure likes eating things raw,
she must be impatient and greedy."

159
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,541
I'm sorry,

160
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,128
but I can't let you
eat my company raw like that.

161
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,005
Because I'm back.

162
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,605
The autumn sky is high and cloudless

163
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:16,361
The bright moon

164
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,906
is our sincere heart

165
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:28,081
Splendid rivers and mountains
Filled with Roses of Sharon

166
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:34,796
Great Koreans, to the Great Korean way,
Always stay true

167
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,547
Do you remember it all?

168
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,551
Hey, we hear the song when the sun
comes up and goes down every day.

169
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:41,552
How can I not?

170
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,515
I can't be sure, but I guess

171
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,559
even people from South Korea
wouldn't know the whole lyrics.

172
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:53,356
With this spirit and mind

173
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,775
What's wrong with him?
People might hear us.

174
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,820
Who'd hear it? Captain Ri isn't here.

175
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,615
By the way, where's Captain Ri?

176
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,578
I don't know.

177
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,541
He hasn't been sleeping too well lately.

178
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,543
And he hasn't been eating well.

179
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,713
He's seriously lovesick.

180
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,684
I heard what this is.

181
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,061
Someone offered prayers with water.

182
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,443
Pyo Chi Su told me earlier.

183
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:42,405
There lived a mother with a son
who went to war 60 years ago here.

184
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:44,323
I know that.

185
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:49,912
I wonder

186
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,750
if the mother met her son.

187
00:13:58,588 --> 00:13:59,922
If I

188
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,467
await desperately with prayers,

189
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,262
will I be able to meet

190
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,681
someone I miss?

191
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,229
You do it to live.

192
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:22,236
If you give up on waiting,
the pain of loss will kill you.

193
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,739
That's why you wait.

194
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,508
Are you the guy from the market?

195
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,261
Yes, it's me.

196
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,890
How did you get in here?

197
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,184
Did you get a pass
from the State Security Department?

198
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,772
I know one of the chief guards

199
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:41,649
smuggled military supplies.

200
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,068
I made a deal with it to get in here.

201
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,656
I listen to others all day,

202
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,575
so I know a lot of secrets.

203
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:54,245
Who meets whom, what lies they tell,

204
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,373
and what their weaknesses are.

205
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:58,624
So you eavesdrop on people.

206
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,211
They call me the Rat.

207
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,593
Since I was 17, I've always listened
to what others say.

208
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,678
So I never got to talk
about myself to others.

209
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,389
But a few years ago,

210
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,809
I met someone who listened to me
for the first time.

211
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,231
He even got me a birthday gift.

212
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:29,113
This wallet you got back for me.

213
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,805
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

214
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,099
I WISH YOU AND YOUR FAMILY GOOD LUCK

215
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,851
RI MU HYEOK

216
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:00,895
Do you know

217
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:03,231
my brother?

218
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,614
10 YEARS AGO

219
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,874
Doctor, please take look at my baby.

220
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,251
Did you not see how things are?

221
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,836
There's a plague called swine flu.

222
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,047
We've run out of medicine,
so we can't do anything.

223
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,132
If you get the medicine,
I can help inject it.

224
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,885
I bought this in the marketplace.

225
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,889
This is fake. It's just glue.

226
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,517
There's no place you can find
the medicine at a time like this.

227
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,727
Unless it's from the military hospital.

228
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,402
His fever wouldn't break.

229
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:51,279
Oh no.

230
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,323
It's all right. My gosh.

231
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,659
Man Bok.

232
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:06,877
I got the medicine.

233
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:09,255
I brought a nurse too. Don't worry.

234
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,526
I know this isn't enough
for the medicine, but...

235
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,122
Please take this.

236
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,541
It's for my son's life.

237
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:51,964
Okay. I'll take it.

238
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,008
This is enough.

239
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:55,926
Thank you.

240
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:59,055
Thank you so much.

241
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:06,646
Are you telling me
to tap Captain Ri Mu Hyeok?

242
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,398
You heard me. Why do you ask again?

243
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,360
I thought he was your close friend.

244
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:17,114
That's none of your business.

245
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,784
About your mother.

246
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,079
She got caught trying to cross the border
for her business.

247
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,122
She might be sent to a concentration camp.

248
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:26,624
What?

249
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:32,004
She's old. Do you think she can
make it through the winter there?

250
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,173
I heard she has tuberculosis.

251
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,346
I'll do something to get her out.

252
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,182
You just make sure to do as you're told.

253
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,311
But...

254
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:49,897
Otherwise,

255
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:55,152
you might lose your mother just like that.

256
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:56,737
Are you going to be okay?

257
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,538
Cheol Gang already got way out of line.

258
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,332
He wouldn't even listen to me.

259
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,836
Tomb robberies and drug trafficking.

260
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,964
He even killed someone
to cover up his corruption.

261
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,800
He'll be sent to
the Trial Bureau in Pyongyang.

262
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,803
Did you secure evidence?

263
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,393
I got the list of people who turned
a blind eye to his crime for money.

264
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:32,606
I also found out
where the money came from.

265
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,612
I'll take one with me.

266
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,032
And just in case,

267
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,868
the other will be...

268
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,037
You mean in the watch?

269
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:48,539
Yes.

270
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,135
They are leaving.

271
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,483
They just passed the inspection
at the second guard post.

272
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,318
The vehicle is

273
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,780
approaching the corner in Bongdeok.

274
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,992
They are going over the last speed bump.

275
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:53,020
You're home late.

276
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,606
It's your birthday,
but you didn't have a birthday dinner.

277
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,149
I made some meat soup for you.

278
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:02,488
Captain Ri Mu Hyeok was here
to see you earlier today.

279
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:06,200
He brought some meat
because it's your birthday.

280
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,285
He said he would go
to Pyongyang for some business.

281
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:15,042
And this.

282
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,595
Isn't it a wallet?

283
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,688
Money?

284
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,278
Man Bok, there's a letter in it.

285
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,414
Man Bok.

286
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:55,374
Happy birthday.

287
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,963
They say a good wallet
will bring you good luck.

288
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,925
Man-bok, you are a good friend.

289
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:07,386
I wish you and your family good luck.

290
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,431
I am headed to Pyongyang
for some business.

291
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,225
Let's have a drink when I come back.

292
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:14,560
Ri Mu Hyeok.

293
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:44,006
I WISH YOU AND YOUR FAMILY GOOD LUCK

294
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,800
LET'S HAVE A DRINK WHEN I COME BACK

295
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:48,677
Why are you

296
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,972
telling me all this now?

297
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,977
I've regretted it for a long time,
but nothing changed.

298
00:23:58,312 --> 00:23:59,730
To get over it,

299
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:04,568
I kept telling myself I had no choice,
but it didn't help.

300
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,448
Every time I woke up in the morning
and go to sleep at night,

301
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,368
I felt sorry

302
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,496
for what I did

303
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,332
to him.

304
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:21,960
And...

305
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,591
I really missed him.

306
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,803
He was my only friend.

307
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:52,032
I want to pay for what I did.

308
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,081
I don't care what will happen to me.

309
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,750
Please keep my family safe.

310
00:25:58,307 --> 00:25:59,808
My younger brother.

311
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:02,311
He's studying in Switzerland.

312
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,896
Is that so?

313
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:06,273
He's a piano prodigy.

314
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,817
He's studying on a scholarship.

315
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,320
He recently had a recital,

316
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,822
and I heard he received
a standing ovation.

317
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,827
My brother, Jeong Hyeok
wrote a song for me.

318
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:21,955
He said he'd play it once he comes back.

319
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:24,583
Do you like it?

320
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,627
Yes. I like it a lot.

321
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:29,338
I feel really happy

322
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,673
when I think of him.

323
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:34,843
Mu Hyeok.

324
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,529
I'm sorry.

325
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:58,450
I'm really sorry.

326
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,411
I want him

327
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,498
to be happy.

328
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,451
Gosh, it's so cold.

329
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,595
What is this?

330
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,016
KNOWLEDGE IS LIGHT
IGNORANCE IS DARKNESS!

331
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:09,062
Where are you from?

332
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:12,357
-Where are you from?
-Where are you from?

333
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:13,817
Are you saying

334
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,570
Sam Suk is from the South?

335
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:17,738
Yes.

336
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:22,284
So it means Sam Suk isn't really Sam Suk.

337
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,869
She's Yoon Se-ri.

338
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,246
Yoon Se-ri?

339
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:29,958
That's right.

340
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,669
We saw it in the marketplace, didn't we?

341
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:36,173
The high-quality products
from down South. Se-ri's Choice.

342
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,884
Sam Suk is that Se-ri, Yoon Se-ri!

343
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:45,015
The Se-ri's Choice with the dewy
and rich facial cream?

344
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,183
Yes.

345
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,228
The Se-ri's Choice with the skin toner
that minimize pores?

346
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,896
-Yes.
-That's right.

347
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:53,899
It's the Se-ri's Choice
with the facial essence for moist skin.

348
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,485
My goodness. What on earth happened?

349
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,820
Why on earth would Yoon Se-ri be here

350
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:01,240
pretending to be Sam Suk?

351
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:06,078
Look. It says she had
an unexpected accident.

352
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,496
I mean,

353
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:11,667
why did she have to come clean
to us before she left?

354
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,295
I guess this is the reason.

355
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:19,633
"Guys, I'm sorry that I have lied to you."

356
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:21,301
Did she say that?

357
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:26,848
Yes. "Yeong Ae, Wol Suk,
Myeong Sun, and Ok Geum."

358
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,100
That's what it says.

359
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,351
My name comes first, right?

360
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,436
Yes. She mentioned your name first.

361
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:36,483
"Thank you for believing
the stories I have told you,

362
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:41,488
relating to the stories,
and chatting with me.

363
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,616
It was a huge comfort.

364
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,160
I have to leave now,

365
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:53,417
but I wanted to tell you guys
about my real name.

366
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:56,670
I had to tell you a lot of lies,

367
00:29:57,254 --> 00:30:01,091
but my heart for you guys was sincere."

368
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,427
-Gosh.
-Oh my...

369
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:07,597
It must've been tough
and scary for Sam Suk.

370
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,226
She got into an accident
and was left in a strange place all alone.

371
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,479
She must've been afraid

372
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:16,940
that she might get caught.

373
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:21,236
Someone is inside there.

374
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,406
Come out.

375
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,325
You're right.

376
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:30,329
She always tried to look brave,

377
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:31,872
but she's actually timid.

378
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,875
She's faint-hearted.

379
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:39,004
I thought she had no manners at first,

380
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,715
but she wasn't like that.

381
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:42,966
Let's have DP and beer.

382
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,093
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

383
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,846
I pick the Goodbye Style.

384
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,940
I wonder if she went back safely.

385
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:04,154
It's been two weeks since she left.

386
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,073
And she hasn't come back.

387
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:09,951
I bet she went back well.

388
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:11,578
Or she died.

389
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,706
-It should be either one of the two.
-My goodness.

390
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:17,542
What do we do?

391
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,088
YEONG AE, WOL SUK, MYEONG SUN, AND OK GEUM

392
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:27,052
How are you doing?

393
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:30,305
-How are you doing?
-How are you doing?

394
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,875
A kite?

395
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,453
Se-ri.

396
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,622
I can't believe this it's you.

397
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:39,666
When I prayed for you every morning,

398
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:43,044
I thought perhaps,
I was asking for a miracle.

399
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:45,881
This is such a miracle!

400
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,346
Where and how have you been?

401
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:56,933
Look at your skin. It's rough.
We must do something about it.

402
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,561
Let's go to my esthetician tomorrow.

403
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,979
You should take my slot.

404
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,356
It's really hard to book
an appointment there, you know.

405
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:08,195
-Hye-ji.
-Yes. It's me.

406
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:14,868
Hold on. It's stuck on my finger. Wait.
It's stuck there. Hold on a second.

407
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,663
Did you go into my dressing room?

408
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:22,250
No. I didn't want to go,
but Mother wanted to go.

409
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,877
How did you get into my house?

410
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,253
Mother opened it.

411
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,755
She knew the passcode.

412
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,568
I'm sorry, Mom.

413
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,529
What do you mean?

414
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,532
Did you hope

415
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,243
that I would come back?

416
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,457
When my company's stock price
bottomed out,

417
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:06,086
a lot of people bought
a lot of stocks dirty cheap.

418
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,923
Among them, Sang-a bought
the largest number of stocks.

419
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:11,633
And you were

420
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,719
next in line.

421
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:17,931
-That was--
-I grew that company all on my own.

422
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,725
It doesn't belong to your kids.
It belongs to me.

423
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:24,938
Did you want to take
my company away from me, too?

424
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:26,898
-Se-ri.
-Right.

425
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,526
Because you thought I was dead?

426
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:31,820
Okay.

427
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:33,863
Yes, it's understandable.

428
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,366
It's understandable, but...

429
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,661
you liked it, didn't you?

430
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:45,792
You thought I was dead

431
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:47,961
and you liked it, didn't you?

432
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:50,964
That's why

433
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,216
I said I was sorry.

434
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:56,261
I'm sorry I came back alive

435
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,638
and hurt your feelings.

436
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:06,605
Why isn't Mom joining us?

437
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:11,026
Your mother said
that she had an upset stomach.

438
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:15,155
That's understandable.
All of us are still pretty shocked.

439
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:17,240
I feel nauseous, you know.

440
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:20,493
When did you find out
that she was alive, Dad?

441
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:24,247
Why is that important?

442
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:25,582
It was that time, right?

443
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,584
Was it about two weeks ago?

444
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,045
You went on a business trip
for three or four days

445
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,296
and you didn't come back home.

446
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:34,132
Well, that's not important.
Let's not talk about--

447
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,759
Yes, it was probably then.

448
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,719
It was when I was in hospital.

449
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,512
Hospital? Why?

450
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:42,098
Were you in the hospital the whole time
after the accident?

451
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:44,184
Is that why you couldn't contact us?

452
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:45,644
I don't remember.

453
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,479
You don't remember?

454
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:51,232
What? Is that amnesia?
I've never seen it for real.

455
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,027
Well, is it?

456
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,196
You don't remember anything at all?

457
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,324
No, that's not the case.

458
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,454
I do remember some parts.

459
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,251
-I want you to take over my position.
-"I want you to take over my position."

460
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,545
Right.

461
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:15,298
Yes, I remember only up to that point.
I remember it clearly.

462
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,384
As if it happened yesterday.

463
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:19,844
Father.

464
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:23,306
Given what has happened recently,
why don't you reconsider

465
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,183
everything regarding your successor?

466
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,309
Hye-ji.

467
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,938
Hear me out. It doesn't matter
even if there's a full house or a flush,

468
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,981
the game resets in the case of a bust.

469
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:33,608
How nice.

470
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:34,651
Nobody changed a bit.

471
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:39,781
No matter how hungry, I am,
I stop feeling hungry once I get home.

472
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:42,492
I'll get going.

473
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:58,258
I don't have to worry and anticipate
when there will be a blackout.

474
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:01,344
No one will barge into my house
for a random house inspection.

475
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:06,099
This is so nice. This is how I ought
to feel at home. Yes, indeed.

476
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:13,106
This is it.

477
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:15,191
Yes, this is it.

478
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:20,947
I need to be able to stretch my legs
completely when I'm taking a bath.

479
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:23,616
Since hot water is always available,

480
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,577
I don't have to heat the water
in a cauldron.

481
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:28,580
Goodness.

482
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,707
I can't believe you, Se-ri.

483
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:34,919
Gosh, talking about cauldrons and such?

484
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:37,964
Hey, you're in Seoul. Get a grip.

485
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,342
Wait.

486
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:48,641
I bet my skin went
through ten years' worth of aging.

487
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:53,938
I must go back to my old self.
I used to be young and rich.

488
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,691
I have to be both, not just rich.

489
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:58,610
I must become young again.

490
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,832
I will bring everything back
to its right place.

491
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,419
It's going back now.

492
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:21,466
This is it.

493
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,303
A bed has to be as big as a soccer field

494
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,972
and soft and cushiony.

495
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,516
Right, Jeong Hyeok...

496
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,826
JANUARY 7, TUESDAY, 2:13 A.M.

497

00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,564

00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,153

503
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,514
INCIDENT REPORT

504
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,141
REPORTER: CAPTAIN RI MU HYEOK

505
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:26,693
Hey.

506
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,570
Let me see your ID.

507
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,332
RODONG SINMUN

508
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:56,973
What just happened?

509
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:05,815
Alberto. I was actually going to call you.

510
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:07,692
Uncle.

511
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:11,654
This is my friend from my studies abroad.
Alberto Gu.

512
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:13,906
Is that so?

513
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:19,787
Alberto is a diplomat.

514
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:22,373
I see. It's nice to meet you.
Alberto, was it?

515
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,294
What's going on here?

516
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,130
We received a report that there were
some suspicious behaviors.

517
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,757
We were going to check his identity.

518
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,717
But there's no need for that
now that we know

519
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,010
he's a friend of your niece.

520
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:34,969
Of course.

521
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,888
He's Dan's friend from abroad.

522
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:40,683
If she can vouch for him,
his identity must be legitimate.

523
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,902
Were you really going to call me?

524
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,195
You said that earlier.

525
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:56,199
Well, I didn't really mean that.

526
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,201
No. You can't do that.

527
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:01,204
Considering what you owe me
and how many favors I've given you,

528
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,498
you can't say that without meaning it.

529
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,291
What do I owe you?

530
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,710
I doubt you can deny that.

531
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:09,420
Do you really want me to be this petty?

532
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,800
I couldn't drive because I drank that day.

533
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:16,969
Your house was 2km away from the hotel.

534
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:19,472
I had to carry you on my back
because you were totally wasted.

535
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:22,266
But you kept telling me

536
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,102
that I should come sleep over.

537
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:26,604
I did?

538
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:30,650
"You can sleep over."

539
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,401
Don't you remember that?

540
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:38,157
Even if I consume alcohol,
people can't really tell that I'm drunk.

541
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:40,451
Even when I'm drunk,
my behaviors are pretty decent.

542
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,995
I must have made a mistake
as I drank too much that day--

543
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:44,705
Drunk behaviors
are either decent or awful.

544
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,457
There's no middle ground such as "pretty."

545
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:49,418
I mean, could you really call
rolling on the street and yelling at me

546
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:51,796
-to stay the night decent--
-Anyway,

547
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,464
let's call it even.

548
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,843
Didn't I just help you out today?

549
00:43:57,844 --> 00:43:59,762
Well, yes. Let's call it even.

550
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:04,183
By the way, are you still
pushing forward with that?

551
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:06,727
Your wedding.

552
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,814
I heard that Mr. Ri went
into the demilitarized zone.

553
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,316
Doesn't it mean
he can't come out for a while?

554
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,402
I didn't tell you about that.

555
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:17,613
Don't you remember?

556
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,491
You got drunk and told me everything.

557
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:22,952
I didn't know about that
when I was drinking that night.

558
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,163
Really?

559
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:28,249
Are you sure? Then, where did I hear this?

560
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,584
Did I dream?

561
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:40,928
Did Jeong Hyeok tell you that?

562
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:57,904
I'm out of shape. I need to work out.

563
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:05,745
Yes, it's me.

564
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:09,749
I'm going to send Se-ri
to the South tomorrow.

565
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:14,128
-What?
-You said Se-ri's family in South Korea

566
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:16,130
knew where Se-ri was and that they were

567
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,840
waiting for her to come back.

568
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:19,884
Is that all true?

569
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,136
Do you trust me?

570
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,181
You're the only person I can trust now.

571
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:29,602
What if they don't want her to come back?

572
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:31,562
You won't send her back?

573
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,273
No, that's not it.

574
00:45:35,024 --> 00:45:36,275
I want to know.

575
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:39,695
Well, not everyone in her family knows.

576
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:42,490
One of Se-ri's brothers
knows about her situation.

577
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,867
He wasn't so happy to hear she was alive.

578
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:47,161
To be honest,
he doesn't want her to come back.

579
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:50,247
Once Se-ri comes back,
he's going to lose his position to Se-ri.

580
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:53,668
What do you say? Even if
she goes back, it won't be pretty for her.

581
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:54,835
Why don't we keep her here?

582
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,715
That's nonsense.

583
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,468
She belongs there.

584
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:04,553
And she wants to go back.

585
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:07,348
I must send her back.

586
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:11,477
Gosh, so what? You should do that, then.

587
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,396
Why did you call me?

588
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:18,150
I need your help.

589
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:20,194
What? Why would I...

590
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,446
No. I don't need to know why.

591
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:25,116
I'll pretend that I didn't hear this.
I'll hang up.

592
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,327
I'm hanging up.

593
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:30,371
I heard that you were her old friend.

594
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:33,124
We've known each other for long,
but we're not close.

595
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,459
I text her on the New Year's Day,
Christmas, or birthdays,

596
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:37,712
but she has never replied
to my texts even with an emoji.

597
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:38,713
She never replies.

598
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,756
More than anything,

599
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,591
she humiliated me.

600
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:43,759
She broke off the engagement

601
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:45,261
few weeks before our wedding.

602
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,179
Given our history, why would I help her?

603
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:49,515
What the heck do you want me to do?

604
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,104
Have you lost your mind?

605
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:57,606
Keep a close eye on the surroundings.

606
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:58,607
Yes, sir!

607
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:09,076
This is so annoying. What am I doing here?

608
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:12,663
If Se-ri goes back to Seoul,
Se-hyeong is going to throw a fit.

609
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:14,206
Come on.

610
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,624
Should I just bolt?

611
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,752
No. Should I?

612
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:21,464
Gosh, no.
A man never goes back on his word.

613
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:24,133
He never goes back,
but maybe it's okay to break it!

614
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,763
That's all right.

615
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,767
Gosh, this is so annoying.

616
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:36,270
So the cars only came in.

617
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,689
-And no cars left the premises?
-Yes, sir.

618
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:40,816
Inspect the leaving cars thoroughly.

619
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,611
If an unknown woman is in the car,

620
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:44,987
report to me.

621
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,656
-Understood?
-Yes, sir.

622
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:10,638
Let's go.

623
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,311
Now.

624
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:18,455
Be calm.

625
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,125
Please show me your ID.

626
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:22,543
Right.

627
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:42,188
Taedong River.

628
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:05,669
What is he saying?

629
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:09,632
Turn the car around. Car, out.

630
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:12,301
-Okay. Thank you.
-The river...

631
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:35,282
Thank you, Seung-jun.

632
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:36,909
Whatever.

633
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:41,789
I'm sorry I ran away
with the car that day.

634
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,666
I thought you were a car racer.

635
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,042
Your cornering was awesome.

636
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:50,422
Actually, when I met you in Korea,
I thought you were a con...

637
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:52,049
A thug...

638
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:56,470
I only thought of you
as a very intelligent man,

639
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:59,056
and also an immature person

640
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,892
for not using your intelligence
for the right cause.

641
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:05,688
But once I got to know you,
I thought you were a really nice guy.

642
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,106
You're loyal, too.

643
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:10,901
You think so?

644
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:12,361
-Yes.
-What about the ring?

645
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:14,113
What?

646
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:17,241
A nice and loyal guy like me
gave you a ring.

647
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,285
Where's the engagement ring?

648
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,336
Did you sell it?

649
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,131
No, I didn't sell it.

650
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,967
I left it somewhere temporarily.

651
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,135
Where?

652
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,929
-A pawn shop in the marketplace.
-What?

653
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:40,597
I urgently needed some cash.

654
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:43,392
I wanted to buy a present for Jeong Hyeok,

655
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:44,852
but I didn't have any money here.

656
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,355
I lost your present immediately
after buying it that day, though.

657
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:50,983
It was a really nice vintage watch.

658
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,068
It's okay.

659
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:55,738
I'm glad that you're not hurt.

660
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:00,367
Can both of you get off my car?

661
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,205
It's raining.

662
00:52:09,418 --> 00:52:11,795
OUTSKIRTS OF KAESONG

663
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:31,732
15KM TO THE FRONT LINE

664
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:06,975
Thank you.

665
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,545
I dropped them off there,
and we parted ways.

666
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:37,464
I don't know

667
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:40,217
what happened to them after that.

668
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:44,179
So are you saying

669
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:49,852
that Jeong Hyuk volunteered
to go to the outpost

670
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:52,938
just because of that woman?

671
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,024
You're right.

672
00:53:58,152 --> 00:54:00,195
He risked everything for her.

673
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:06,410
Do you know why I helped them?

674
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:10,831
I wanted you to quickly end your yearning
for your first love.

675
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:14,334
What?

676
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:17,212
You shouldn't yearn for your first love
for too long.

677
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,590
It's not good to drag on with anything.

678
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:22,050
Whether it be people or love.

679
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:23,886
Love from afar for a brief moment.

680
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,430
That's the best for everyone.

681
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:28,640
It's clean and beautiful.

682
00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:31,560
Helping them won't get rid of the love

683
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,562
I have for him.

684
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,272
Jeong Hyeok risked his life

685
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,774
and went to the outpost to protect Se-ri.

686
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:40,319
Doesn't that count as game over?

687
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:44,406
You should end it if you see its end.

688
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,369
Don't be ridiculous.

689
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:51,622
If it ends just because you see the end,

690
00:54:52,164 --> 00:54:55,167
-it isn't love.
-Don't be ridiculous.

691
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,127
You're waiting for someone.

692
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:59,254
But even you think that you're pathetic.

693
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:01,507
Then that's not love.

694
00:55:03,926 --> 00:55:05,093
It's an obsession.

695
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:11,183
The love you once had
has changed and is now rotting.

696
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:15,562
You should throw it away.

697
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:25,364
About that man you met at the hotel,

698
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:30,661
did he have thick eyebrows, pale skin,

699
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:34,164
was tall, and skinny?

700
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:36,708
Did he look like that?

701
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,168
Yes.

702
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:41,588
Is he the same man
who carried Dan home last time?

703
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:47,511
I was too perturbed about that

704
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:49,930
and was looking at this.

705
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,850
Femme fatale.

706
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:56,728
"Someone who looks so charming
that they bring upon disaster

707
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:58,480
to those around them."

708
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:02,025
With such a face,
she doesn't need all this wealth.

709
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:05,904
And with all this wealth,
she doesn't need such a face.

710
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:08,615
But Dan has both.

711
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:11,702
It's a given
that men are chasing after her.

712
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:17,457
I think you're slightly exaggerating.

713
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:19,293
What do you know?

714
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:23,338
Look. This is what I thought was odd.

715
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:27,092
Even after she heard that Jeong Hyeok
was suddenly sent to the outpost,

716
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:30,804
she didn't seem to feel
upset about it at all.

717
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:34,891
It's Jeong Hyeok's loss, for all I care.

718
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:40,272
How should I persuade her?

719
00:56:41,273 --> 00:56:44,901
You seem a bit happy though, Myeong Eun.

720
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:47,446
Hey, don't be ridiculous.

721
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:50,449
Their wedding may fall through.
I'm worried sick.

722
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:53,744
But then again,

723
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:56,038
if they're destined to break up,

724
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:59,583
she should dump him first before he does.

725
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:02,127
Come on, no one's dumping anybody.

726
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:08,508
Hello?

727
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:10,302
Yes.

728
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:11,637
What is it?

729
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,513
COURT OF DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC
OF KOREA

730
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:14,723
Since this trial

731
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:18,685
is a trial that's being held
under special circumstances,

732
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:21,396
we've excluded the jury

733
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:24,024
that is normally included
in a regular trial.

734
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:28,403
For this trial, there will only be
prosecutors and lawyers.

735
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:31,698
-Prosecutor.
-Yes, Your Honor.

736
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:33,450
Please give your statement.

737
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:38,705
Cho Cheol Gang, the defendant,
has murdered 11 individuals

738
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:40,999
through six disguised accidents
including the one

739
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:42,751
at the Jeonseung-dong intersection
in 2011.

740
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:46,338
In addition, he abused his authority
and committed countless crimes

741
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:48,465
such as stealing
and selling cultural heritage

742
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:52,344
and drug trafficking.

743
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:55,347
As for the evidence,
please refer to the submitted material.

744
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:57,349
EVIDENCE, EVIDENCE 2

745
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:00,519
How did you get these documents?

746
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:03,689
Captain Ri Jeong Hyeok
of Civilian Police Battalion reported it.

747
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:07,609
Please come to the witness stand.

748
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:16,910
How did you get these documents?

749
00:58:19,955 --> 00:58:21,957
The late Captain Ri Mu Hyeok,

750
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,334
who was one of the victims

751
00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:27,045
and also my older brother, had it.

752
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:28,213
Your Honor.

753
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,382
He is trying to slander me

754
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:33,552
by saying that I killed and disguised
their deaths as accidents.

755
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:36,638
I don't even know the truck drivers.

756
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:39,016
Is that true?

757
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,564
See?

758
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,150
They were pure accidents.

759
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:56,241
The trucks the accidents
had high-strength special plating,

760
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:59,745
or ceramic composite armor.
This is the material used to make it.

761
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:08,045
This high-strength,
ceramic composite armor was used

762
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:09,588
for tanks and other armored vehicles.

763
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:12,132
It was originally used in Russia.

764
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:14,634
But they have now prohibited
the exportation of this material.

765
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:18,430
But this material was found
at the Engineer Brigade.

766
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:22,225
It was smuggled through the bridgehead
between Khasan and the Tumen River.

767
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:25,729
We also found the equipment used

768
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:28,356
to attach this material to the bumpers
at the Engineer Brigade.

769
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,986
Is there proof

770
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,947
that the defendant is involved in this?

771
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:39,951
If you look at the file, during that week,
a large sum's worth of transaction

772
00:59:40,035 --> 00:59:42,329
had been made
by the Soojung Trading Company

773
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:45,290
of State Security Department
to a Russian account.

774
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:47,459
The owner of the account
was a member of the mafia.

775
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,211
He was arrested by the Russian government

776
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:51,421
for smuggling large amounts
of special steel.

777
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:53,423
This is all a fabrication, Your Honor!

778
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:58,345
That man gave shelter
to a South Korean spy.

779
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:01,932
When I confronted him, he lied
and said that she was from Division 11.

780
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:02,849
Order.

781
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:04,976
Now that I found out about it,

782
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:08,063
he is trying to fabricate evidence
to get rid of me.

783
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:10,482
Summon the Chief
of Inspection Department as a witness!

784
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:12,359
That is unrelated to this case.

785
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:13,485
It'll be dismissed.

786
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:15,821
-Your Honor!
-I'll give my final verdict.

787
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:16,947
Your Honor!

788
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,741
According to Article 60 of Criminal Law,

789
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:22,661
Cho Cheol Gang, the defendant,
is found guilty of terror crimes.

790
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:26,289
According to Article 116,
he's found guilty of smuggling.

791
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:28,792
According to Article 198,

792
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:31,086
he's found guilty of stealing
cultural heritage.

793
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:34,214
He's found guilty for carrying out
and ordering a countless number of crimes.

794
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:37,509
Therefore, the court will confiscate

795
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:40,428
the defendant's property.

796
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:42,681
He'll be stripped
of his rights as a citizen

797
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:44,266
of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea.

798
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:47,686
He will be isolated from society

799
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:49,688
and will be given

800
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:51,398
a life sentence,

801
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:55,318
undergoing physical labor
until the day he dies.

802
01:00:56,778 --> 01:01:00,115
He will have no right to file an appeal.

803
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:01,241
Case closed.

804
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:11,626
Ri Jeong Hyeok!

805
01:01:13,712 --> 01:01:15,714
There's one thing you've missed.

806
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,270
Because of that,

807
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:33,899
that bitch will die

808
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:37,360
at all costs.

809
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:23,365
What did I miss?

810
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:48,640
TOTAL NUMBER OF COMPOSITE CERAMIC ARMOR

811
01:02:50,642 --> 01:02:52,811
There's a difference in the amount
of smuggled steel

812
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:55,939
and the composite ceramic armor
that we've confiscated.

813
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,650
They couldn't have disposed
the materials that cost them

814
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,443
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

815
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:02,279
Does that mean there is more
than one place

816
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:03,738
where they produce special armor?

817
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:05,198
If that's the case...

818
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:10,537
Destination.
The cave at the entrance of Mount Mandal.

819
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:13,873
Target vehicle. Pyongyang 0758-3617.

820
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:14,958
Go.

821
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:29,597
What is that?

822
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:34,352
What is that?

823
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:38,773
Those assholes.

824
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:46,239
Hey, hey. Go back. Go back this instant!

825
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:48,825
Hurry up!

826
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:42,253
I'm sure it was a planned attack.

827
01:04:43,463 --> 01:04:44,464
I agree.

828
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:48,176
Many high officials have received bribes

829
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:49,844
from Cho Cheol Gang.

830
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:51,679
They probably thought it was best

831
01:04:51,763 --> 01:04:54,391
to kill him
before things got out of control.

832
01:04:54,766 --> 01:04:56,601
There were five individuals in that car,

833
01:04:56,935 --> 01:04:58,645
but only four bodies were found.

834
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:00,980
The scene was a complete mess.

835
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:02,524
I'm sure they'll find it soon.

836
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:06,444
The body could've flown out
during the collision.

837
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:11,533
There's a possibility
that those on his side

838
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:13,159
caused the accident.

839
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:15,161
Stop making inferences.

840
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:17,038
Just look at the facts.

841
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:18,998
He got what he deserved.

842
01:05:19,082 --> 01:05:23,336
He died the same way
he murdered his victims.

843
01:05:26,131 --> 01:05:27,966
NO MERCY TO THOSE WHO INVADE OUR COUNTRY

844
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:49,571
DAUGHTER OF QUEENS GROUP
AND CEO OF SE-RI'S CHOICE IS DEAD

845
01:06:06,421 --> 01:06:09,382
-Captain Ri of--
-Have you received my gift?

846
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:11,759
You seem surprised.

847
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:15,305
I'm not like your weak brother.

848
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:17,724
You can't get rid of me that easily.

849
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:21,936
I swear on my brother's name.

850
01:06:23,021 --> 01:06:25,106
I will catch you at all costs

851
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:27,775
and make you live a life
that's worse than death itself.

852
01:06:27,942 --> 01:06:28,943
Is that so?

853
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:30,862
What a pity.

854
01:06:31,613 --> 01:06:33,031
Before you do that,

855
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:37,410
I'm going to head down South
to kill that woman.

856
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:39,871
Come catch me if you want.

857
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:42,540
I'll see you later.

858
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:22,789
THE HOLY BIBLE

859
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:38,346
Let's finish this and leave.

860
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:40,014
I need to attend a prayer meeting.

861
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:42,308
There are so many things
I am grateful for.

862
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:46,312
Is Ms. Yoon healthy and well?

863
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:48,940
She's not suffering from any illnesses
or injuries, is she?

864
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:53,611
No, but she seems a bit strange.

865
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:55,446
What do you mean?

866
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:59,367
-Look at this part.
-What about this?

867
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:01,786
-This one, too?
-There's one here as well.

868
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,629
Take a break every now and then.

869
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:17,594
-What's wrong with that?
-She's never said such a thing

870
01:08:18,052 --> 01:08:20,471
ever since I joined the company.

871
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:24,809
Her motto was,
"You can sleep when you die."

872
01:08:24,892 --> 01:08:25,852
I see.

873
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,855
And last weekend,
she suddenly wanted to go

874
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:31,608
to Mount Bukhan.

875
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:36,446
Ma'am, we should head back now.

876
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:41,326
Mr. Hong, look at that field of reeds.

877
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:44,120
Don't you see someone moving?

878
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:47,624
I'm not sure.

879
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:49,667
Look closely.

880
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:54,505
I did, but I'm still not sure.

881
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:57,216
I was just being honest, but then...

882
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:03,389
she started crying.

883
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:06,184
Ma'am, what's wrong?

884
01:09:06,726 --> 01:09:08,728
Just tell me if I did something wrong.

885
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:10,480
I'll do my best to correct my mistakes.

886
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:12,940
Don't do this to me.

887
01:09:16,194 --> 01:09:17,236
No.

888
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:23,534
You should take a break
every now and then.

889
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:29,540
I liked her better before.

890
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:31,542
She's become even more frightening.

891
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:34,921
DRAFT FOR THE UPCOMING INTERIOR

892
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:43,554
DELIGHTFUL COOKING

893
01:09:43,638 --> 01:09:44,639
WHITE, DARK, AND GRAY

894
01:10:33,354 --> 01:10:34,647
Ma'am.

895
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:38,735
-Are you heading home now?
-Yes. Thank you for your hard work.

896
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:40,027
Have a safe trip.

897
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:08,097
Man Bok.

898
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:13,227
Someone's waiting for you outside.

899
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:30,912
Good job.

900
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:34,415
Don't say things that you don't mean.

901
01:11:34,499 --> 01:11:35,917
Why would you do that?

902
01:11:37,502 --> 01:11:38,669
What is this?

903
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:46,594
-Wait...
-What's going on?

904
01:13:31,032 --> 01:13:32,575
I wonder

905
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:34,744
which one is love.

906
01:13:36,203 --> 01:13:40,625
hoping that you're worrying about me
like I am for you

907
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:45,129
and wishing that you're pining for me
like I do for you.

908
01:13:46,339 --> 01:13:47,882
Is this love?

909
01:14:04,357 --> 01:14:06,734
Or, on the other hand,

910
01:14:07,401 --> 01:14:09,820
is it wishing that you
won't be worried about me,

911
01:14:10,905 --> 01:14:14,241
that you'll forget about me
and all the moments we've shared?

912
01:14:15,826 --> 01:14:17,536
Is that love?

913
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:22,333
If it's neither,

914
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:24,919
is it love

915
01:14:25,836 --> 01:14:28,297
that I'm willing

916
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:31,926
to go through everything

917
01:14:33,427 --> 01:14:35,054
from the very beginning

918
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:38,724
just so that I can meet you once again?

919
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:56,093
I'd been looking everywhere for you.

920
01:15:57,094 --> 01:16:00,014
You only said you lived
around Cheongdam-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul.

921
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:03,350
You didn't tell me the exact address.

922
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,751
My son,

923
01:17:11,335 --> 01:17:13,754
who's also your captain
and a fellow soldier,

924
01:17:16,173 --> 01:17:17,383
has gone down South.

925
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:21,387
This is top secret.

926
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:26,600
I'd like to ask the five men
that he trusted the most

927
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:30,688
and Jung Man Bok,

928
01:17:30,771 --> 01:17:33,524
who offered decisive help in finding out
why my late son had died,

929
01:17:34,233 --> 01:17:35,526
for a favor

930
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:37,987
as Jeong Hyeok's father.

931
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:39,989
Bring him

932
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:42,199
back.

933
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:52,668
PAJU, A PEACEFUL CITY
OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA

934
01:17:52,751 --> 01:17:57,256
MILITARY NORTH KOREAN TRACK TEAM

935
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:01,302
There are so many cars.

936
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:05,097
Look at these punks.

937
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:10,352
They knew we were coming,
so they gathered all the cars

938
01:18:10,436 --> 01:18:12,438
for us to see.

939
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:25,201
-Hello!
-Welcome!

940
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:27,286
-Welcome!
-Hello!

941
01:18:29,997 --> 01:18:31,457
They're here!

942
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:33,125
They're coming out.

943
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:34,210
They're coming out.

944
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,630
-Here they come.
-Welcome!

945
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:39,840
Please look over here!

946
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:43,052
-Please look over here!
-How do you feel?

947
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:45,179
-How do you feel?
-Over here!

948
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:47,681
-Please look over here!
-Over here!

949
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:56,148
The closing ceremony
for this competition will be in two weeks.

950
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:59,735
You must carry out your mission
and return by then.

951
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:02,112
If you fail,

952
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:03,739
I can't help you.

953
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:05,241
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

954
01:19:15,668 --> 01:19:17,544
What did you get?

955
01:19:17,628 --> 01:19:19,964
I didn't know what to get,

956
01:19:20,047 --> 01:19:22,841
so I got the one with the biggest lid.

957
01:19:24,468 --> 01:19:25,678
And you?

958
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:29,932
"Carbonara?"

959
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:31,183
"Car..."

960
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:33,018
What kind of name is that?

961
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:34,812
Mine is jjajang ramyeon.

962
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:38,232
Every time I watched their dramas,
I always craved jjajangmyeon.

963
01:19:38,524 --> 01:19:40,067
I'm sure this is a similar one.

964
01:19:41,819 --> 01:19:43,654
This country is amazing.

965
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:45,823
Look at how many kinds
of noodles they got!

966
01:19:46,323 --> 01:19:47,574
Wake up!

967
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,619
You shouldn't be deceived by the variety.

968
01:19:50,703 --> 01:19:51,829
Think about it.

969
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:55,291
Why would they have so many noodles
if they had enough rice?

970
01:19:55,582 --> 01:19:58,585
It's all because they lack rice...

971
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:04,300
Gosh, that's hot! So hot! It's hot!

972
01:20:04,383 --> 01:20:06,844
It's so hot! Gosh!

973
01:20:17,021 --> 01:20:18,856
Look at all this rice.

974
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:29,450
It's a worldwide military festival.

975
01:20:29,533 --> 01:20:31,994
This year's Military World Games
is held in our country

976
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:35,205
and the North Korean team
has finally made it as well.

977
01:20:35,414 --> 01:20:38,083
A total of 173 North Korean members
have joined,

978
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:40,502
including the athletes,
executives, judges,

979
01:20:40,586 --> 01:20:42,212
and the medical team.

980
01:20:42,296 --> 01:20:44,798
-The North Korean team left Pyongyang
-Have some.

981
01:20:44,882 --> 01:20:47,009
overland instead of by sea.

982
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:50,888
This is a meaningful event since it'll be

983
01:20:50,971 --> 01:20:52,348
-a peaceful competition
-Try some.

984
01:20:52,431 --> 01:20:53,307
among the soldiers.

985
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:55,934
-Okay.
-Through this competition, they'll be able

986
01:20:56,018 --> 01:20:58,979
to share a bond instead of just competing
against each other.

987
01:20:59,063 --> 01:21:02,608
A total of 7,300 athletes
will put down their weapons,

988
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:04,068
arm themselves with sportsmanship,

989
01:21:04,151 --> 01:21:06,403
and have a fierce,
two-week long competition.

990
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:09,698
-This is TVN News...
-Where are we headed next?

991
01:21:18,999 --> 01:21:20,376
Don't stand out.

992
01:21:20,751 --> 01:21:23,003
Blend in with the crowd.

993
01:21:23,087 --> 01:21:25,005
You're the one who stands out the most.

994
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:28,133
Loosen up

995
01:21:28,217 --> 01:21:30,010
if you really want to blend in.

996
01:21:35,766 --> 01:21:37,017
March forward.

997
01:21:39,144 --> 01:21:40,521
Don't look back.

998
01:21:44,191 --> 01:21:45,025
Halt.

999
01:21:45,692 --> 01:21:47,277
How long has it been since you came?

1000
01:21:47,361 --> 01:21:49,363
It's been two days.

1001
01:21:49,446 --> 01:21:51,782
It's obvious that you haven't received
any help from Hanawon.

1002
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:53,742
Are you sent from Division 11?
For a mission?

1003
01:21:53,826 --> 01:21:55,119
No.

1004
01:21:55,202 --> 01:21:57,871
We need to bring someone back home.

1005
01:21:59,289 --> 01:22:01,083
That won't be easy.

1006
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:04,545
But who are you?

1007
01:22:17,683 --> 01:22:18,684
SHINSUNG RESTAURANT

1008
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:24,356
You see,

1009
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:28,610
I came here long before you did.

1010
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:31,071
But I haven't received any orders yet

1011
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:33,657
and have been waiting all along.

1012
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:36,368
That's who I am.

1013
01:22:37,911 --> 01:22:40,497
You look just like one of them.

1014
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:43,834
I'm guessing you've settled in.

1015
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:46,044
Well...

1016
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,672
This place is habitable as well.

1017
01:22:49,256 --> 01:22:50,674
So don't be afraid.

1018
01:22:50,841 --> 01:22:53,844
Dong-gu,
why aren't you delivering the food?

1019
01:22:55,929 --> 01:22:58,849
I'll go deliver it. Really.

1020
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:02,102
-Hurry up.
-I will. Really.

1021
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:10,527
I'll give you a gift.

1022
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,572
This job will pay you an hourly wage
of 9,690 won

1023
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:17,534
which is 1,100 won more
than the minimum wage of 8,590 won.

1024
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:20,704
It is also an awesome job
where you can eat

1025
01:23:20,787 --> 01:23:23,332
all the jjajangmyeon, jjamppong,
and fried dumplings you wish.

1026
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:25,834
Since no one cares about this job,

1027
01:23:25,918 --> 01:23:28,712
your disguise will be safe.

1028
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:30,964
I'll hand this job over to you.

1029
01:23:31,048 --> 01:23:31,882
SHINSUNG RESTAURANT

1030
01:23:35,719 --> 01:23:36,970
Good luck.

1031
01:23:40,349 --> 01:23:43,560
-Dong-gu, where are you going?
-They have it.

1032
01:23:44,353 --> 01:23:46,104
Where are you going, you punk?

1033
01:23:48,315 --> 01:23:49,608
Hey!

1034
01:23:51,401 --> 01:23:52,653
Come here!

1035
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:03,121
