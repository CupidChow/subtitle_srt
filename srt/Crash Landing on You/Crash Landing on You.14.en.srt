1
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,970
ALL CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND BACKGROUND ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,668
Se-ri?

3
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,252
No one has shown up yet.

4
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,379
I can't reach anyone either.

5
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:59,173
Maybe something has happened.

6
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,550
What should I do?

7
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,471
We must leave any minute.

8
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,937
The patient got a gunshot on the chest.
She got a bag of IV.

9
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:13,896
-A gunshot?
-Yes.

10
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,106
-To the operation room!
-Yes.

11
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,232
How long has it been?

12
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,943
The transportation took 11 minutes
and we have performed CPR.

13
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,279
Check the vital signs.

14
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,281
Set the IV line
and a complete blood count.

15
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,992
Blood pressure, 60 over 40.
Saturation, 80.

16
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,411
The patient's blood pressure is low,
so use both lines.

17
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:29,829
Prepare blood.

18
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,582
It seems the gunshot caused
tension pneumothorax and hemothorax.

19
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,084
We will need a chest tube intubation.

20
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,503
Get the blood transfusion set ready
and request an X-ray.

21
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,546
Yes, doctor.

22
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,840
Are you her guardian?

23
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,675
Yes.

24
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,343
The situation is very bad.

25
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,179
The gunshot caused tension pneumothorax,

26
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,972
and we will insert a chest tube
right away.

27
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,016
And after that, we will remove the bullet.

28
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,565
I had a brother.

29
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:02,028
After losing him, I had a hard time.

30
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,406
So I made a decision.

31
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,411
I told myself I would live a life
where I don't have to lose anyone.

32
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,291
I told myself I wouldn't live a fun life.

33
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,297
I told myself I would live a life

34
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,093
where I don't dream of the future.

35
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,266
Ever since then,

36
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,187
I've never had a comfortable sleep,

37
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,147
I've never made jokes,

38
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,025
I've never played the piano,

39
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,280
and I've never loved anyone.

40
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,578
Until you crash landed into my world

41
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:55,081
one day.

42
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,377
That's how I have lived.

43
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,896
Se-ri, are you all right?

44
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,607
But now, I have changed.

45
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,862
Even if I have to worry
about losing you every day,

46
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,408
I want to have you in my life.

47
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:36,080
Even if it breaks my heart
because it's a dream that can't come true,

48
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,585
I'd like to sincerely dream of the future.

49
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,297
So

50
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,302
please live.

51
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,170
Please live

52
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,257
and listen to my words.

53
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,137
I still have stories

54
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,641
that I haven't

55
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,560
told you yet.

56
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,371
No one got on the bus? None of them?

57
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:01,874
Yes, sir.
The bus waited for two more hours,

58
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,876
but no one came.

59
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:06,254
We couldn't reach them either.

60
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:10,299
Once the Military Department
finds this out,

61
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,926
things will get serious.

62
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,719
Who knows

63
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,055
about this?

64
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:20,893
So far, the sergeant dispatched
and I are the only one who know, sir.

65
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,021
The State Security Department
and the Military Department

66
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,898
will give rearmament lectures

67
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,359
and speeches regarding
the Military World Games.

68
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,361
-Be prepared for it.
-Yes, sir.

69
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:35,074
The problem is the Military Director.

70
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:38,035
He seems to be connected
with Cho Cheol Gang.

71
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,288
We need plans for later.

72
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:46,252
What should I do when the ones that went
to bring him are not even coming.

73
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,929
This is driving me crazy.
Why hasn't she waken up yet?

74
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,601
Maybe they're out of blood.

75
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:05,062
Se-ri was losing a lot of blood.

76
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,275
My blood type is O.

77
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,487
Didn't she say her blood type was O?

78
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,824
If they need more blood,
I can give her mine.

79
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:19,535
Captain Ri has the same blood type too.

80
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,663
If they needed more blood,
he would have given his blood already.

81
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:26,417
South Korean hospitals have enough blood,
so that must not be the case.

82
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:33,132
Then why is she not waking up?
It's already been three days!

83
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,345
What if

84
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,680
something bad

85
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,390
happened?

86
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,560
Se-ri.

87
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:57,782
By the way, I gave you my card
so that you could splurge,

88
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,533
but you didn't spend much.

89
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:03,037
So I prepared a gift for each of you.

90
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,374
You know, I own a fashion company.

91
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,709
I wanted to give you
a suit of clothes each.

92
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,921
I roughly measured you with my eye,

93
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,130
so hopefully they fit you.

94
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,174
Just a second.

95
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,639
She didn't have to.

96
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,563
Fine clothes do make a man.

97
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,565
You all look gorgeous.

98
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:37,321
We never dress up,

99
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:40,616
but when we do,
we can look just as nice as Seoul people.

100
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:46,497
Well, I see why people
ask directions to you.

101
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,541
You look like you're from Seoul.

102
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,792
I know, right?

103
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,922
Maybe Eun Dong's is a little small.

104
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,759
It's not.
It fits me perfectly and it's warm.

105
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,594
I love it.

106
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,142
I feel like I'm a freeloader.

107
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:07,810
I feel bad.

108
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,562
Don't say that.

109
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:13,941
You took risks and made a hard decision.
You don't know how thankful I am for that.

110
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,902
It's nothing compared to what I did.

111
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,612
I saw U Pil once,

112
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,240
and he said that his father told him

113
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,160
to be nice to his friends.

114
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:28,372
But I told him he shouldn't.

115
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,834
I told him the world isn't that beautiful.

116
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:35,880
I told him to hit others
before he gets hit.

117
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,882
Although I said that,

118
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:42,595
I wished U Pil's father was right

119
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,222
deep down.

120
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,731
I wish the world becomes

121
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,568
a beautiful place.

122
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,530
Then at least

123
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,409
we can talk to each other
from time to time.

124
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,420
TAEHEUNG HOSPITAL

125
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,381
So they were shooting guns

126
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,883
and the car just ran in?

127
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,302
Yes, that's what I heard.

128
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,304
Could it be an unintended acceleration?

129
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:28,516
Normal people would run away
in such a dangerous situation.

130
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,100
That's what I'm saying.

131
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,645
If she wanted to escape,
there were many ways behind.

132
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,022
Why did she have to rush into that
of all places?

133
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,608
You're right. And right at the moment
the bullet was coming.

134
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:41,487
She basically ran into the scene
in order to stop the bullet.

135
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,906
But she wouldn't do that.

136
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,492
-She would never do that.
-Never.

137
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:50,204
Is that the person Ms. Yoon Se-ri saved?

138
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,626
No, it's not him.

139
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,003
What are you doing here?

140
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:01,840
I mean, she barely managed
to come back in one piece. And now...

141
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,680
Whoever that bastard is, please catch him.

142
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,265
Please, sir.

143
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,058
-We apologize.
-Sir.

144
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,226
-What's wrong?
-Come on.

145
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,269
Where's the witness?

146
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:16,522
I will bring him. Get up!

147
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,607
-Please, sir.
-Let go of him.

148
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,858
Go home! Follow me.

149
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,042
PATIENT YOON SE-RI

150
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:47,887
Hello.

151
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,138
Hello.

152
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,681
Wait.

153
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,560
Who is that man?

154
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,646
He's Ms. Yoon's personal bodyguard.

155
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,901
Oh, my. Personal bodyguard?
Does he provide escort service?

156
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,569
Something like that, yes.

157
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,821
-Which agency is he from?
-What?

158
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,865
-Do you have the number?
-Pardon?

159
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,158
So there's a guy?

160
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,284
Yes.

161
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,204
Send me the résumé of that man.

162
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,873
What?

163
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,458
Why his résumé?

164
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,419
When I ask you to do something,
just do it.

165
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,421
Don't ask me back.

166
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,923
Yes, ma'am.

167
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,468
I will only answer then.

168
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:31,931
Ms. Yoon has his résumé,
so I don't have it.

169
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,557
And even if I do,

170
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,602
I can't give it to you
without Ms. Yoon's permission.

171
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,020
Now, if you'll excuse me.

172
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:44,193
Se-ri's Choice has an eye
for good employees.

173
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,906
We would like to ask you
for a statement as a witness.

174
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,450
A firearm accident in the middle of Seoul
is not common.

175
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,912
We are analyzing the video footage,

176
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,749
but your statement might help us
catch the criminal.

177
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,377
May I see your ID first?

178
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,476
OVERSEAS KOREAN RESIDENT CARD

179
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:19,979
You're Chinese.

180
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,942
Was there a report on another person
who got a gunshot?

181
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,112
No, there wasn't.

182
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,405
Then did you

183
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,575
take a look into the unauthorized
medical facilities near the scene?

184
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,452
Pardon?

185
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,205
The criminal also got a gunshot.

186
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,874
He can't get treatments
from regular hospitals,

187
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,043
so he must be using such facilities.

188
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,805
Is he all right?

189
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,559
You told me to remove the bullet,
and I did it.

190
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,644
Just make sure to pay the money all right.

191
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:04,898
Of course. I'm paying with cash
at the end of the month.

192
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,115
Goodness.

193
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,577
How does it feel
to be given a second life?

194
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,246
Why did you save me?

195
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,831
Well, because

196
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,168
I can't let my client die

197
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,420
before I get the rest of the money.

198
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:31,258
And of course you have to pay
for the surgery today.

199
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,597
Capitalism saved my life.

200
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,682
I guess you can say that.

201
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,101
Now pay what you have to pay

202
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,896
and go back to where you were
and do your business.

203
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,522
You can't be here.

204
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:49,193
If you die here,
things will get complicated,

205
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,070
which will put me in big trouble.

206
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,198
What about Yoon Se-ri?

207
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,117
What happened to her?

208
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,420
I think we should fire the bodyguard
standing at the door.

209
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,506
Why all of a sudden?

210
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,674
We can't trust him with this.

211
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,385
He was at the scene

212
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,263
and the police investigation
seems to be still ongoing.

213
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,016
It just doesn't feel right.

214
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:25,312
She's right.
We should have fired him already.

215
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,982
I was so alarmed
that it didn't come to my mind.

216
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,073
Well, this is awkward.

217
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,117
I'm so sorry.

218
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,371
Ms. Yoon is like that,
so there's nothing we can do.

219
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:45,374
I mean, since when did they
worry about Ms. Yoon so much?

220
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,878
They said you seemed suspicious
and they couldn't trust you.

221
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,089
They want to hire a bodyguard themselves.

222
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,716
To me, they are the most suspicious one.

223
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,513
Hey, you. Stop crying.
You're making this worse.

224
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,832
PARADISE FOR THE PEOPLE

225
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,503
Mother. Father is coming.

226
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,427
Honey.

227
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,559
I told you!

228
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:48,353
I told you Cho Cheol Gang,
that bastard has weird eyes

229
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,022
so you should stay away from him!

230
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,525
I'm sorry. It's all my bad.

231
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,445
I told you.

232
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,530
I told you Nam Sik got
the dumb brain from you

233
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,157
so you should not use your brain.

234
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,910
She's right about that.

235
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,495
I got the best score
when I guessed the answers,

236
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:06,747
not when I used my brain.

237
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,290
-You idiot.
-Ouch!

238
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:10,751
Fine.

239
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:15,297
I will never use my brain and be nice.

240
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,883
Come here.

241
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,933
Catch it!

242
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,935
You damn thing!

243
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,895
Oh, my goodness!

244
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,356
Come here!

245
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,732
This way. Oh, my.

246
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,609
You damn thing. Where are you going?

247
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,569
Where are you going?

248
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:47,412
Oh, my.

249
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,581
-How do I look?
-Young Ae,

250
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:54,211
you indeed have
an amazing sense of balance.

251
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,883
You are not any less fancy
than the owner of the department store,

252
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,594
and yet you don't look too arrogant.

253
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,931
That outfit shows perfect amount

254
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,892
of politeness and fashion sense.

255
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,519
-Right?
-Yes.

256
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:13,188
Young Ae, try this.

257
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,314
Okay.

258
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,610
It's perfectly seasoned.

259
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,028
Good.

260
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,573
By the way, I told you

261
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:27,703
that today, you should watch out
for what comes out of your mouth,

262
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,289
not what goes into your mouth.

263
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,252
Don't worry.

264
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,880
If I get drunk
and say something stupid today,

265
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,841
I will certainly shave my head.

266
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,301
I will shave your head myself.

267
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,802
Sure.

268
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,762
Ms. Go is coming.

269
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,473
-Oh, my.
-Come on in!

270
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,267
Welcome!

271
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,020
You are here!

272
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,521
Goodness.

273
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:59,151
What a feast of fresh local food.

274
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:05,490
They should go well
with the champagne I brought.

275
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,826
Oh, my. But it's so rare.

276
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,703
What's champagne?

277
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,246
What is this?

278
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,957
It must be something good.

279
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,131
Next time,
I will bring champagne glasses too.

280
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,758
All right. Now...

281
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,969
-Let's drink!
-Let's drink!

282
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,480
It's sweet.

283
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:39,232
-Goodness, it's just like water.
-It tastes so good.

284
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:45,072
I don't know how to repay your kindness.

285
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,240
Don't say that.

286
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:50,911
You are Jeong Hyeok's neighbors,
and it means you are like him to me.

287
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:53,997
I would like to do whatever I can do
to help you.

288
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:56,458
So we are basically one!

289
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,002
Of course!

290
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:10,472
My, that sounds great.

291
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,099
It does.

292
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:19,523
Since you were so successful in Pyongyang,

293
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:24,361
I thought you would be
scary like a tiger and loud.

294
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,489
Come on, Wol Suk. What are you saying?

295
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,950
Just keep eating.

296
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:34,204
It's okay. This is supposed to be
a chill dinner.

297
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:42,045
I thought you would be
scary like a tiger and loud.

298
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:47,384
Although you're a little bit loud,
you're not that scary.

299
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,099
I guess I am a bit loud.

300
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,058
Yes.

301
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:58,019
No, that's not what she means.

302
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:02,524
Ms. Go is a good person.

303
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,526
Oh, come on.

304
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:08,238
The marriage is called off.

305
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:11,199
It wouldn't have been easy for you
to help us like this.

306
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,201
What's wrong with you?

307
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,828
What?

308
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:17,873
Am I the bad person again?
I know you all think the same.

309
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,792
You said the man from Europe
didn't seem to be her nephew--

310
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,128
Why are you pinching me?

311
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,922
Oh, that's what you're talking about.

312
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:29,050
Comrade Al is certainly my nephew.

313
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:32,846
Come on. It is a revenge affair!

314
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,222
Why are you pinching me?

315
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,811
Oh, my. She's too drunk.

316
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,271
Take her.

317
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,231
-Wol Suk, let's go home.
-I'm fine.

318
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,442
You had too much drink. Come here.

319
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,194
-Why?
-You're too drunk. Let's go.

320
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,696
-What are you doing? I'm sober.
-Come on!

321
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,114
Seriously!

322
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,824
You all said that.

323
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:58,413
You said the guy from Europe would
make a better couple with her daughter.

324
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,831
Wol Suk!

325
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:00,790
Let go of me!

326
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,500
-Stop.
-Yes.

327
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,755
Say what you just said again.

328
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:12,552
The guy from Europe would make
a better couple with your daughter.

329
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,888
No. Before that.

330
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:19,851
I'm sober?

331
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:22,771
No. Even before that.

332
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,273
Revenge affair?

333
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:31,196
"Revenge affair," you mean by...

334
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,115
Jeong Hyeok

335
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,910
had an affair?

336
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,121
Is that what you are saying?

337
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,000
Wait.

338
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:47,712
Young Ae, what did I just say?

339
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,215
Where am I?

340
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:52,676
Who am I?

341
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:58,348
Jeong Hyeok had an affair?

342
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,601
With whom?

343
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,899
She ran on the minefield,

344
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,276
but the mines wouldn't explode.

345
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:12,904
I shot my gun, but I missed her.

346
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:17,742
She said she's a swallow from the South.

347
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,369
She's out of her mind.

348
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:22,539
She would tell me lies

349
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:25,917
like she had two meat dishes a day
in South Korea.

350
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,878
She said she was a picky eater,
but she ate so well.

351
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:31,172
The only good thing about having her

352
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,050
is the shampoo that makes
the top of your head smell like flowers.

353
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,552
What are you doing?

354
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,429
Write it down.

355
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,559
It's a long-standing promise.

356
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,185
We should keep it.

357
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:50,358
Why do you seem so depressed
on your moving day?

358
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:52,652
I'm fine.

359
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,279
Mom.

360
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,406
Don't you worry.

361
00:26:56,906 --> 00:27:00,410
No matter what happens,
I'm going to marry him

362
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,455
and live happily ever after.

363
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,673
Mom. Why wouldn't you pick up your phone?

364
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,178
Hey.

365
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:22,140
Have you ever seen me

366
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:24,434
getting phone calls while drinking?

367
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,188
Hold me.

368
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:30,899
Okay.

369
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,068
My sweetheart.

370
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,321
Let's get in.

371
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,033
Why did you drink so much?

372
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,539
Dan.

373
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,208
Yes.

374
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,461
What is it?

375
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,296
Do you want to say something?

376
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:55,924
You...

377
00:27:57,092 --> 00:28:01,096
I want you not to worry about me
and be happy.

378
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,139
What are you saying, all of a sudden?

379
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:04,766
Of course,

380
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:11,314
I will say things that I'm supposed to say
to you as your mother.

381
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,400
However,

382
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:19,072
don't listen to me too much.

383
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:22,575
Do what you want

384
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:25,787
and live a happy life.

385
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:28,665
That's what I'm saying.

386
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,212
Why are you sleeping here?

387
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:35,380
Go to the bedroom.

388
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,298
I'm worried

389
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:42,053
that you end up living

390
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,305
an unhappy life

391
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:49,602
after I die.

392
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:57,026
I'm worried that I was wrong.

393
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,863
I'm so scared

394
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,491
that might happen.

395
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,646
TAEHEUNG HOSPITAL

396
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:37,776
I will send my security team here.

397
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:41,237
Hey, I have a security team too.

398
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,406
One of them is a judo champion and--

399
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,074
Shooting.

400
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,496
There's a shooting bronze medalist too.

401
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,372
My guys used to work for the Blue House.

402
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:55,543
We will take care of Se-ri's caregivers,
bodyguards, and everything.

403
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:57,420
So you can just...

404
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,174
Oh, my. She moved.

405
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,051
She just moved.

406
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,105
Oh, my.

407
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,274
-She opened her eyes.
-She opened her eyes.

408
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,901
-Oh, my goodness.
-I see her pupils.

409
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:24,739
Someone please call the teacher...
I mean the doctor.

410
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,242
-She woke up.
-Yes, sir.

411
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:30,495
My goodness. Are you all right?

412
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,331
A gunshot in South Korea?

413
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:34,791
Is this Hollywood or what?

414
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,292
Tell me about it.

415
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:47,887
What?

416
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,181
-Okay.
-What is she saying?

417
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:51,683
Okay.

418
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,434
Buzz off.

419
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,562
What? What did you say?

420
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,402
I want all of you to buzz off.

421
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,071
She says, "Buzz off."

422
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:07,907
She wants all of us to buzz off.

423
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:16,541
She's totally fine.

424
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:19,210
Look at how bitchy she still is.
She's fine.

425
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,087
I heard Se-ri woke up.

426
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,591
Yes, she did.
And she told all of us to buzz off.

427
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,176
She's looking for someone.

428
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,729
Seriously?

429
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,940
You're my bodyguard.

430
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:45,028
How could you leave me
without my permission?

431
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:49,198
You told me to be within your sight.

432
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,368
You said as long as I stay
within your sight,

433
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,997
I would be safe.

434
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:58,833
Come back now.

435
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,169
I miss you.

436
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,046
I'm coming.

437
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,674
I'm coming now.

438
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,534
So we should wait and see...

439
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,244
Wait.

440
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:37,622
-Hey!
-But...

441
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,151
Why did you

442
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,948
jump into such a dangerous scene?

443
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,410
You have no fear, don't you?

444
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,871
You could have actually died.

445
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,334
What if you actually died?

446
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,128
How am I supposed to live then?

447
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,798
Don't be ridiculous.

448
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,301
You make it sound like

449
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,470
I'm the only one who did that.

450
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:38,850
You did the same.

451
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:43,229
You almost died for me.

452
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:44,814
This is different.

453
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,942
It's not different.

454
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,945
You said I was your bodyguard.

455
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:55,074
You said I was supposed to protect you.

456
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:57,827
Seriously?

457
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,622
It was really hard

458
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:05,001
for me to wake up.

459
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:08,087
And you keep

460
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,257
saying nonsense.

461
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,677
Will you keep being angry at me?

462
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,222
I love you.

463
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,741
I was really scared

464
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,703
I wouldn't be able to tell you this.

465
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,544
I was scared too.

466
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,923
I had a long dream,

467
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,094
but I...

468
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,973
couldn't find you there.

469
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:46,269
I wanted to wake up from it so badly.

470
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,545
What's wrong?

471
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,388
What?

472
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:36,527
Se-ri, I was so worried about you.

473
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,282
She can't hug you like that yet.

474
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:43,159
Shake hands with her instead.

475
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,577
Oh, okay.

476
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:53,085
I just saw you give her a hug.

477
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,671
Was it a piece of wood or what?

478
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,301
Fine.

479
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,637
I'm glad to see you again.

480
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,105
Are you fine now?

481
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,901
I'm not quite fine.

482
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,740
We can't do this. You should lie down.

483
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,700
Wait outside, everyone.

484
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,661
No, it's okay.

485
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:33,251
By the way, how did you guys get here?

486
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,961
I didn't give you a call.

487
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:44,178
I'm sorry.

488
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,183
Gosh.

489
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,437
Se-ri was here flat-footed.

490
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:56,399
And you couldn't
get into the hospital room.

491
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:59,860
I was just afraid
something might happen to her.

492
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,990
This is the VIP room with high security.

493
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:09,245
And there will be special personnel
and articles in the ward.

494
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:11,038
We will pay special attention as well.

495
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,415
Thank you.

496
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,420
PATIENT YOON SE-RI

497
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:31,809
Then why is she not waking up?
It's already been three days!

498
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:33,561
What if

499
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:36,063
something bad

500
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:37,732
happened?

501
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,483
Se-ri.

502
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,199
The surgery went well.

503
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,578
The bullet went through her lungs
without external injuries.

504
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,164
Fortunately, she only got a pneumothorax.

505
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,344
-Thank you!
-Man Bok!

506
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:09,430
She's getting better
thanks to the highly qualified doctors

507
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,141
and the up-to-date surgical equipment.

508
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:15,603
It's been brought about
by Chairman Yoon's lavish investment.

509
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,063
Wait.

510
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:22,777
Apparently, Se-ri's father
is the chairman of this hospital.

511
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:29,241
Gosh, their second
daughter-in-law is so mean.

512
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,829
Damn it.
Their second son is so nasty as well.

513
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,247
Why?

514
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,582
Just give me that.

515
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,503
-Are you hearing anything?
-Gosh.

516
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:41,754
Wait.

517
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,964
Chairman Yoon is talking.

518
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:49,095
"What have you done?

519
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,765
Yoon Se-hyeong, are you sure
it wasn't your doing?"

520
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,101
And his second son answers.

521
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,937
"Why don't you believe me?

522
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:00,689
Is it even true that I'm your son?"

523
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:04,110
-That ungrateful punk.
-My gosh.

524
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,653
Just give him a blow.

525
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,196
That's right.

526
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,407
There you go. Good.

527
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:19,083
-What?
-Why?

528
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,459
-She's up.
-What?

529
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,753
-Yes!
-Finally!

530
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,970
-We have to go.
-Hurry.

531
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,305
-Let's go.
-My goodness.

532
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,309
So...

533
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:42,606
you've been tapping the room
while I was unconscious?

534
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:53,576
I think this has something you must hear.

535
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,286
Make sure to listen to it.

536
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:07,673
Dan. I'm sorry.

537
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,342
Don't cry--

538
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,824
I will wait on the bridge until you come.

539
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:35,701
Please come right away.

540
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,329
If I wait for too long,
I might get arrested.

541
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,876
What a nut.

542
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,633
Why is he being like this to me?

543
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:52,468
This is ridiculous.

544
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,268
Is he out of his mind?

545
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,994
He's so annoying.

546
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,593
What are you doing here at this hour?

547
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,554
You weren't answering my calls.

548
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,390
Have you lost your mind?

549
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,225
Things are no joke in Pyongyang.

550
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:44,436
People from the State Security Department
are looking for you.

551
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,313
That's what I was afraid of, but...

552
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,567
I was more worried about you.

553
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,361
Ri Jeong Hyeok.

554
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,739
You cried when he went
to Yoon Se-ri. Actually,

555
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,367
I'm an accomplice in this.

556
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:02,329
Just think that I'm Ri Jeong Hyeok
and punch me.

557
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,874
It might make you feel better.

558
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:06,792
If I think

559
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,920
you're Ri Jeong Hyeok,

560
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:11,714
I can't punch you.

561
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:16,343
What kind of woman would feel better
after punching a guy she likes?

562
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,137
What if...

563
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,308
you just think I'm me?

564
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,397
So don't get cute with me.

565
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:31,650
Gosh, that was strong.

566
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,236
And it makes you attractive.

567
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:37,698
Can't you be serious even for a second?

568
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,575
I'm serious now.

569
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,456
Is it true?

570
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,083
What?

571
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,085
You said...

572
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:54,632
I'm attractive.

573
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,468
You're such a fool, Dan.

574
00:43:58,552 --> 00:43:59,803
Do you really think

575
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:03,015
Ri Jeong Hyeok left
because you're not attractive?

576
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,850
It's not like that.

577
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,187
But after he left,

578
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:11,148
I started to wonder if that was the case.

579
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,566
I told you before.

580
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:15,819
I'm not going to lie to you ever again.

581
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:19,907
So you have to listen carefully to me.

582
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,451
First of all,

583
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:25,412
you're pretty.

584
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,499
And?

585
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,502
You look good
with your hair loose or tied up.

586
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:36,256
Even if you suddenly come out
without makeup on,

587
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:38,342
you look like a goddess.

588
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:43,097
And you seemed so charismatic
when you saved me.

589
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,015
You were so cool.

590
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:54,983
And?

591
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:57,861
You're coy, haughty, and unfriendly,
but I just can't hate you.

592
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,238
To be honest, you even...

593
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,533
look cute.

594
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:06,829
You make me wonder
what the guy you care for is like.

595
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:09,206
I even feel jealous.

596
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:12,835
And you make me want to become

597
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,671
a better man.

598
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:18,966
You're so amazing
that you make me feel that way.

599
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,094
You are an amazing woman.

600
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,934
When you cry like this, my mind

601
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,228
just goes blank.

602
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:33,522
I can't think of anything.

603
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:36,108
It drives me crazy.

604
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,321
Do you want more?

605
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,489
No.

606
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,404
Se-ri.

607
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:28,285
While you were gone, I kept on praying.

608
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:31,497
Once you were sent home,

609
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:35,209
I was going to tell you
what I'd been meaning to say.

610
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:37,920
But I missed my chance again.

611
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:42,758
Is that why I'm being punished now?

612
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:47,137
Since I met you

613
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:49,681
when you were less than a month old,

614
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:51,266
there has

615
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:55,771
never been a moment
when you didn't love me as your mom.

616
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:00,484
But I have

617
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:06,907
never accepted the love you gave me.

618
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:15,457
And...

619
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:18,335
that day...

620
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:28,845
Mom?

621
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:34,726
Mom, where are we going?

622
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:37,813
I told you.

623
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:40,399
We're going to watch the sunrise alone.

624
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:42,442
Only you and me without my brothers?

625
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:46,488
You were excited to go on a trip
alone with me for the first time.

626
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:50,242
But I abandoned you.

627
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:58,375
Until you passed out

628
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:02,379
after a long wait,

629
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,506
I didn't go back there.

630
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:08,135
Hey. Wake up.

631
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,636
-Is she all right?
-Honey, call 911.

632
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,887
-Just call 911.
-Okay.

633
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:13,974
Hey, kid. Wake up.

634
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:15,851
Back then,

635
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,938
I didn't want to live anymore.

636
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:20,981
Se-ri!

637
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,524
That's why I went there.

638
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:29,406
When I realized what I'd done
and came back,

639
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,409
you weren't there.

640
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:36,872
I'm sorry.

641
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,674
I'm so sorry.

642
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:55,265
The reason I've been through hell

643
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:59,394
wasn't because of you. It was my fault.

644
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,151
I guess I wanted

645
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:09,738
to torment myself by hating you

646
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:12,866
when you loved me so much.

647
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,472
Mom.

648
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,516
Don't cry.

649
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,976
I'll protect you.

650
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:42,396
Can you please

651
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:44,856
come back again this once?

652
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:49,736
I'll tell you that I'm sorry.

653
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:54,574
I'll say thank you.

654
00:49:56,535 --> 00:50:00,163
Every time you came back,

655
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:07,546
I was so happy.

656
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:10,424
I want to tell you that.

657
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,256
Are you done crying?

658
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:53,508
Yes.

659
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:58,221
I'm just frustrated.

660
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,016
Now that I have the surgical scar,

661
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,810
I won't be able to wear a bikini.

662
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:08,064
Then you don't have to wear a bikini.

663
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:13,612
But it's not that simple.

664
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:16,031
The scar is

665
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,617
about this big.

666
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:22,954
I'm sorry, but I can't
even call it a scar.

667
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:27,292
It should be about this big.

668
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,921
What's that? Is it a sword-cut?

669
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,174
How many stitches did they give you?

670
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,383
Fourteen stitches.

671
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:39,471
The grave robbers I met at the outpost
line flourished a sword at me.

672
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:43,225
I got the stitches without anesthesia.

673
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:46,728
My gosh. Even without anesthesia?

674
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,315
It must've hurt.

675
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:52,609
You're amazing.

676
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:55,529
It's no big deal.

677
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:07,582
You saw this earlier.

678
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:09,209
I was shot the other day.

679
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:11,461
Right. I saw that.

680
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:14,089
Did it hurt a lot?

681
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:16,883
Now I know because I've been there.

682
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,593
A gunshot wound is no joke.

683
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:22,013
Oh, right. There's one more on my back.

684
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:26,643
I got ripped by a steel post
during the first training.

685
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:29,354
Oh no. It's huge.

686
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:35,318
There's one on top of my head
if you look closely.

687
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:38,905
Oh, there's one.

688
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:43,368
It must've hurt a lot, Jeong Hyeok.

689
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,454
There was a time

690
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,710
I got injured here too.

691
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:53,670
Here?

692
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,424
I don't see a scar here though.

693
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:20,739
-It smells so good.
-I'm sure the owner of the restaurant

694
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:22,657
thinks I'm from Seoul...

695
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:25,493
What's going on?

696
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,956
-It's not what you think.
-Gosh.

697
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,876
Se-ri, you just woke up.

698
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:35,587
You can't take off his shirt
like that already.

699
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:38,506
-I didn't unbutton his shirt.
-And I didn't do that either.

700
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:43,678
Then why is your shirt unbuttoned?

701
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,558
Do you want us to eat outside?

702
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:52,020
No. You guys can eat in here.

703
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,950
You can't eat yet.

704
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:08,286
I'm not sure if we can do this to you.

705
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,913
It's okay.

706
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:12,540
I'm the one who told you to buy it.

707
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,626
Watching you enjoy it

708
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:16,670
will make me feel full.

709
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:19,339
All right then.

710
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:22,926
Let's eat for Se-ri's quick recovery.

711
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,970
-For Se-ri.
-For Se-ri.

712
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:27,138
UNDERGROUND TUNNEL
NEAR THE CAVE FOR PICKLED SHRIMP

713
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:36,439
The underground tunnel found
around a cave for pickled shrimp

714
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:37,899
has the shape of an initial tunnel,

715
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:40,151
but it is similar in shape to the ones

716
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:42,070
of the North Korean infiltrators.

717
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:43,947
It's only the size that's different.

718
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:46,324
It has the arch shape
of North Korea's tunnels.

719
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:50,787
And it is assumed to be connected
to the abandoned mine in North Korea.

720
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,080
BADGE FOUND IN THE TUNNEL

721
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:53,832
This is a badge found in the tunnel.

722
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,960
The distance between the cave and the mine

723
00:54:57,043 --> 00:55:00,672
is estimated to be about 9 to 12km.

724
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:02,590
Since the tunnel is very narrow,

725
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:03,633
they must've crawled

726
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,844
all the way through instead of walking.

727
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:09,764
It is estimated to have taken
at least 12 to 24 hours.

728
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,102
They crawled

729
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:16,438
through the narrow tunnel
for over 12 hours?

730
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:18,898
There's no other explanation.

731
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:21,026
One thing worth noting is that

732
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:23,069
there are two suspects

733
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,196
who infiltrated through this tunnel,
not one.

734
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,698
DISTANCE 9 TO 12 KMS

735
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:30,368
This is the guy who supposedly
infiltrated on January 18.

736
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:32,996
And a week later,

737
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:36,875
another suspect seems to have infiltrated.

738
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:39,544
Now we are investigating if they are
involved in the recent shooting

739
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:40,962
at Yoon Se-ri.

740
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,734
You can't spring up like that.

741
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,697
How should I sit up then?

742
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,368
Lying on your back,

743
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,996
breathe in gently.

744
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:43,001
And you should sit up
while exhaling slowly.

745
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:46,087
Don't forget to hold my hand.

746
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:50,300
Like this?

747
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:53,803
Captain Ri, we haven't eaten yet.

748
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:57,015
You injured your lungs,
so you should be very careful.

749
00:57:57,098 --> 00:58:00,101
If you just sit up as you like,
you might hurt your diaphragm.

750
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:05,273
I see. It might be dangerous
for my diaphragm.

751
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:06,649
It is dangerous.

752
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,526
What about some spicy beef soup?

753
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,778
We should eat something spicy
when you feel nauseated.

754
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:13,907
-I'll have spicy fish stew.
-Fish stew sounds good.

755
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,493
Do it again.

756
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:22,165
I'll go heat it up.

757
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:24,125
What are you doing, Jeong Hyeok?

758
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:25,585
It's juice.

759
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,462
I want to drink something cold.

760
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:30,381
If you drink something cold with
a gunshot wound, it might cause ischemia.

761
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:31,758
It's common sense.

762
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:34,594
Since when it became common sense?

763
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:36,513
Since Heo Jun.

764
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:39,057
You can find it in Donguibogam.

765
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,900
Let me push the button for you.

766
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,280
-Which channel?
-Channel 20.

767
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:05,041
Let me turn it.

768
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:15,510
Let me open it.

769
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:16,678
Captain Ri.

770
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,138
Just so you know,

771
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:22,183
we are still here.

772
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:25,061
If the lid was too heavy for her,

773
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:27,897
he should've taken the sleep
out of her eyes since it's too heavy.

774
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:29,524
You have something on your eye.

775
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:31,192
He's doing it.

776
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,619
I guess I've lived far too long.

777
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:43,955
I just can't believe what I'm watching.

778
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:48,626
Captain Ri looks only at Se-ri
like a racehorse.

779
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:51,170
He doesn't even care about others.

780
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:59,178
Let me take something good.
I want to go home.

781
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:25,830
Yes, it's me.

782
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:29,667
Yoon Se-ri of Se-ri's Choice.
I just caught her new man.

783
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:33,463
"Yoon Se-ri rose from the dead."

784
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:37,133
Honey, take a look at this. My goodness.

785
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:39,510
She's unbelievable indeed.

786
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:41,429
I know. It's unbelievable.

787
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:43,514
How could she date someone
even when she's ill?

788
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:46,100
That doesn't matter. I mean his back.

789
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:47,060
Look at this.

790
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:50,229
It's so broad that she can't even
have her arms around it.

791
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,856
It's amazing.

792
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:53,066
My gosh.

793
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:00,782
This back seems somewhat familiar.

794
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:03,910
The close guard.

795
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:04,827
Gosh, Mother.

796
01:01:05,703 --> 01:01:06,704
Is he her bodyguard?

797
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:10,041
I knew it. I was right about that.

798
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:11,584
I thought he seemed strange.

799
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:14,462
"He's just her bodyguard.
But why does he look so sad?

800
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:17,965
Even her family is doing fine."
That's what I said. Mother.

801
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:23,763
It's a good thing that Man Bok
blocked the window right away.

802
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:26,307
I know. It's good

803
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:28,976
that they didn't catch the crucial moment.

804
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:32,188
The crucial moment?

805
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:34,565
Was there something else?

806
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:37,068
Don't imagine anything.
It's nothing like that.

807
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,236
"Nothing like that?"

808
01:01:40,988 --> 01:01:42,031
It's not like that.

809
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:45,993
And this picture.
Depending on one's point of view,

810
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:49,122
it might not be a big deal.

811
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:50,581
I'm a patient now.

812
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:54,001
What if I say I was trying
to endure the pain leaning on him?

813
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:56,421
YOON SE-RI'S DATE IN THE WARD

814
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:59,257
You don't seem to be enduring the pain

815
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,092
since you're smiling broadly.

816
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:03,886
Well...

817
01:02:05,012 --> 01:02:08,224
Shall I say it was
a medically necessary gesture?

818
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:12,937
That doesn't sound right.

819
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:16,107
Gosh, look at the most searched words.

820
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:19,485
"Yoon Se-ri's patient gown.
Yoon Se-ri's bodyguard."

821
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,404
"The bodyguard, the movie?"

822
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:28,327
I guess people are curious
about your face, Jeong Hyeok.

823
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:31,622
I understand.
You look amazing from the back.

824
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:37,420
The picture came out great.

825
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:42,633
-What do you mean?
-I guess this paparazzo knows something.

826
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:44,719
He took the picture with good details.

827
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:47,221
It shows your broad shoulder line.

828
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:50,391
And the two of us look pretty together.

829
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:52,477
I like this picture.

830
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,271
I'm pretty sure

831
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:58,816
she hurt something else when she was shot.

832
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,026
YOON SE-RI'S DATE IN THE WARD

833
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:03,821
I don't know.
I don't think they were hugging.

834
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:07,283
It seems more like
that she was leaning on him

835
01:03:07,366 --> 01:03:08,951
to endure her pain.

836
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:10,828
Does she look happy?

837
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:14,332
Actually, Ms. Yoon smiles a lot

838
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:15,583
when she's in pain.

839
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:18,211
No. It's not that she has a disease.

840
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:19,962
Is the guy...

841
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:22,673
her bodyguard?

842
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:25,176
Gosh, what am I supposed to say?

843
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:27,720
Sir, I'll call you back.

844
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,555
Mr. Lee Hyeok. Come here.

845
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:34,685
I didn't think you were like that.

846
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:39,690
It turns out you are
a very ambitious young man.

847
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:41,943
-What?
-Hey.

848
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:44,070
Why are you being like this to him?

849
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:47,240
Please understand him.
He's suffering from the heavy workload.

850
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,699
I can't let this slide.

851
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:50,868
I have to say what I have to say.

852
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:53,204
Gosh.

853
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:00,795
-What?
-I'm afraid you can't go in.

854
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:05,967
Is it you? The guy
from the article about Se-ri?

855
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:09,178
Now that you got photographed with Se-ri,

856
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,722
you feel like you're on top of the world.

857
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:13,808
Come and get rid of him.

858
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:25,653
Hey!

859
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:26,946
What just...

860
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:29,824
What do you think you are doing now?

861
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:32,869
This is my sister's room.

862
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:36,414
I'm here to ask my sister something.

863
01:04:36,497 --> 01:04:37,915
How dare you try...

864
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:39,208
Move over.

865
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:45,214
Hey, let go of it.

866
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:47,133
I said let go.

867
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:49,051
Do you have a death wish?

868
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:53,347
I was told to prohibit her family
from entering the room.

869
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:55,600
That's what Ms. Yoon Se-ri ordered.

870
01:04:57,685 --> 01:04:58,769
Okay. Just let go of it.

871
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:01,272
I'm not going in. Get off me.

872
01:05:08,529 --> 01:05:10,615
You jerk.

873
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:12,909
You wait and see.
I'll make you regret this.

874
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:16,078
Damn it. Get lost.

875
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:24,128
So you were saying?

876
01:05:24,962 --> 01:05:28,549
Was I? I just wanted to say

877
01:05:29,383 --> 01:05:33,304
that I'm very happy for you two.

878
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:34,722
Thank you.

879
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:38,392
-Bye.
-Bye.

880
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:44,774
So he's very scary indeed.

881
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:46,442
I knew it the whole time.

882
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:48,152
He will do something huge.

883
01:05:51,238 --> 01:05:52,907
Military Director.

884
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:57,203
As I planned, Ri Jeong Hyeok
has come to South Korea.

885
01:05:57,703 --> 01:05:59,455
I'm sending you the evidence.

886
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:04,293
I will come back soon with Yoon Se-ri

887
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:06,587
and destroy Director Ri

888
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:11,217
so you can take his position.

889
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:16,347
NIS, FRONT GATE

890
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:18,808
ENTRANCE OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE

891
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:21,686
YOON SE-RI IS CAUGHT ON A DATE

892
01:06:30,736 --> 01:06:32,321
I heard the surgery went well.

893
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:35,574
Yes. She's recovering from her surgery.

894
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:38,077
I'm glad to hear that.

895
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:41,414
Apparently, there was recently
an attempted kidnapping

896
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:44,875
of Ms. Yoon Se-ri in the underground
parking lot of her company.

897
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:46,377
Did you know about it?

898
01:06:47,753 --> 01:06:50,047
I had no idea.

899
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:52,341
But all the CCTV footage
from the situation room

900
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:55,094
was deleted in accordance
with Ms. Yoon's instructions.

901
01:06:55,302 --> 01:06:58,514
So we got the dashcam footage
from a car parked nearby.

902
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:08,065
Have you seen this guy before?

903
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:15,740
I'm not sure.

904
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:18,534
I don't think I've seen him before.

905
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:19,785
We cross-checked him

906
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:22,455
with the investigation squad
and intelligence squad for North Korea,

907
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:26,208
and he turned out to be the guy
who infiltrated through the tunnel.

908
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:27,793
What do you mean?

909
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:29,795
It seems they came from North Korea

910
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:31,881
to go after Ms. Yoon Se-ri.

911
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:36,635
Further investigation
on Ms. Yoon will be needed.

912
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:03,746
So you are Se-ri's bodyguard.

913
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:06,540
-Yes.
-And...

914
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:09,919
how long have you two been dating?

915
01:08:17,968 --> 01:08:19,053
Well...

916
01:08:19,136 --> 01:08:21,347
Se-ri's mother seems to be

917
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,474
quite hard to deal with.

918
01:08:23,557 --> 01:08:26,102
I've seen scenes like this
in South Korean dramas a lot.

919
01:08:26,727 --> 01:08:27,561
Really?

920
01:08:27,978 --> 01:08:29,230
I told you about this before.

921
01:08:29,814 --> 01:08:32,566
When South Korean parents meet up
with their children's lovers,

922
01:08:33,692 --> 01:08:35,444
Usually one of these two scenarios
plays out.

923
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:37,404
They throw water at their faces or--

924
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:43,244
Gosh.

925
01:08:43,994 --> 01:08:45,913
Or they give an envelope, full of money.

926
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:49,917
They say,
"Take this and stay away from her."

927
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,544
Then, the significant others would say,

928
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:54,839
"My gosh. Is that what you think of me?

929
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:57,341
No, I won't take this money."

930
01:08:57,424 --> 01:09:00,386
Why wouldn't they take the money?

931
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:03,597
Right? It also puzzles me
why they wouldn't take the money.

932
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:05,307
I think it's okay to take it.

933
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:08,894
I hope Captain Ri takes the money.

934
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:09,937
I agree.

935
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:14,358
Se-ri's mother is taking something out.

936
01:09:19,363 --> 01:09:20,197
HAN JEONG-YEON

937
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:23,033
She's always been alone.

938
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:25,161
Although I'm her mother,

939
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:30,124
I'm not in her corner.

940
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:43,637
I want you to stay by her side.

941
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:47,850
I think that would be good for her.

942
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:52,313
If there's something I need to know
about Se-ri...

943
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:54,273
or if you need my help,

944
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:57,067
please call me at this number.

945
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:00,654
Why

946
01:10:02,489 --> 01:10:04,074
can't you stay by her side?

947
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:09,830
If you're by her side,

948
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:14,668
she would also like that.

949
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:38,275
Please spare me a moment from you.

950
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:41,195
You didn't call ahead. What is this about?

951
01:10:41,278 --> 01:10:44,073
He came to investigate your case.

952
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:48,494
He told me that the culprit
of the shooting incident...

953
01:10:50,537 --> 01:10:53,499
is suspected to be a North Korean man.

954
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,209
Se-ri,

955
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,087
do you know anything about that?

956
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:02,967
Do you

957
01:11:03,884 --> 01:11:05,302
know the man?

958
01:11:09,974 --> 01:11:11,600
If I know the culprit,

959
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:16,981
will you be able to catch him?

960
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:18,732
Does it mean you know him?

961
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:20,109
I asked you first

962
01:11:20,484 --> 01:11:21,568
if you could catch him.

963
01:11:21,652 --> 01:11:22,820
Director Ri.

964
01:11:23,487 --> 01:11:27,199
I have received some strange photos.

965
01:11:34,039 --> 01:11:36,000
Were you aware

966
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:40,587
that your son was in Seoul?

967
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,556
If I send these photos

968
01:11:50,931 --> 01:11:54,351
over to to the General,
what do you think will happen?

969
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:58,272
Only a fool would realize his end
after witnessing it.

970
01:11:58,355 --> 01:12:02,443
Well, I'm sure
you're nothing like that fool.

971
01:12:03,193 --> 01:12:04,403
What's your point?

972
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:09,491
You should retire quietly.

973
01:12:10,075 --> 01:12:14,371
Using your health as an excuse
won't raise any suspicions.

974
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:19,376
If you do, I will bury everything myself.

975
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:23,047
You know that once the sun rises,
it must go down.

976
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:25,799
I do not wish
to force you out of your seat.

977
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:30,179
You should make the decision yourself,
Director Ri.

978
01:12:38,228 --> 01:12:40,314
Why did you want to see us?

979
01:12:41,273 --> 01:12:42,941
There was something

980
01:12:44,151 --> 01:12:46,153
I wanted to share it with everyone.

981
01:12:48,989 --> 01:12:52,284
I think I have a lead that will
solve the shooting incident

982
01:12:55,579 --> 01:12:57,206
right here.

983
01:13:05,506 --> 01:13:06,632
What did her doctor say?

984
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:08,634
Her condition isn't that bad.

985
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:10,677
Damn it.

986
01:13:10,844 --> 01:13:12,346
Does it mean Se-ri will survive again?

987
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:15,432
-I know.
-Dad, this is--

988
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:17,267
How could you handle this so poorly?

989
01:13:17,851 --> 01:13:19,520
This looks very suspicious.

990
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:22,815
What will you do when she wakes up
and finds out everything?

991
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:26,777
It was you who dragged that man,
Cho Cheol Gang, into our plan.

992
01:13:27,277 --> 01:13:29,154
I clearly said
I didn't want to be part of it.

993
01:13:29,613 --> 01:13:33,158
I was waiting for that man
to do all the dirty work.

994
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:34,535
But you got impatient,

995
01:13:34,618 --> 01:13:37,246
met with him, and caused this mess.

996
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:40,374
If we let him be,
he would have taken care of this.

997
01:13:40,457 --> 01:13:41,917
Why were you in such a hurry?

998
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,168
Whatever.

999
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:45,754
Besides, there's no evidence
that we ordered him to do that.

1000
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:47,005
I paid him in cash.

1001
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,715
And my account and call history are clean.

1002
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:50,050
There's no evidence.

1003
01:13:57,599 --> 01:13:59,977
Oh, my gosh. Did you really...

1004
01:14:00,477 --> 01:14:01,645
No way.

1005
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:04,064
Se-hyeong.

1006
01:14:05,232 --> 01:14:06,942
-Dad.
-Starting today,

1007
01:14:07,025 --> 01:14:09,069
you will resign from your position
at Queens Group.

1008
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:13,824
At an emergency shareholders' meeting,
we'll select a new president.

1009
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:19,079
And starting now,
I will not consider you my son anymore.

1010
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:20,664
Stay out of my sight.

1011
01:14:20,747 --> 01:14:21,790
Forever.

1012
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:26,545
Dad, this whole thing was planned

1013
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:28,922
by my wife.

1014
01:14:31,049 --> 01:14:33,177
Why don't you say something?

1015
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:36,346
Damn it.

1016
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:42,102
Fine. Bluntly put, you weren't
exactly a good father, either.

1017
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:46,190
If you were going to let me take over,
you should've done that sooner.

1018
01:14:46,273 --> 01:14:49,109
Then, this wouldn't have happened.
Seriously. Think about that.

1019
01:14:49,193 --> 01:14:51,278
-Stop it, Se-hyeong.
-But you held onto

1020
01:14:51,361 --> 01:14:53,572
your position and tried to see
which one of us was better.

1021
01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:58,118
Because you made us compete,
you caused this whole thing to happen!

1022
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:07,836
Mom.

1023
01:15:13,592 --> 01:15:17,221
The police and the NIS are working
together to solve this case.

1024
01:15:18,263 --> 01:15:19,932
I would like to ask for your cooperation.

1025
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:24,436
You must explain to us
to whom and why you gave cash

1026
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:28,649
and how you know the man
named Cho Cheol Gang.

1027
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:36,823
Military Director,

1028
01:15:37,824 --> 01:15:38,992
were you not aware?

1029
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:40,786
What do you mean?

1030
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:42,204
I was the one

1031
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:44,081
who sent my son to Seoul.

1032
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:48,085
Goodness, Director Ri.

1033
01:15:49,753 --> 01:15:51,213
If you don't believe me,

1034
01:15:51,296 --> 01:15:54,716
ask the Director of Reconnaissance
General Bureau Park Seong Guk.

1035
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:57,094
Director Park mobilized my son

1036
01:15:57,511 --> 01:15:59,221
in an operation to bring a wealthy woman

1037
01:15:59,304 --> 01:16:01,306
from South Korea to our country.

1038
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:04,184
An operation to bring
a wealthy woman here?

1039
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:11,275
YOON SE-RI RETURNS TO BUSINESS

1040
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:12,985
It's the woman in the photo.

1041
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:15,862
She's very well-off in the South.

1042
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:18,198
I'm sure you're well-aware

1043
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:22,119
our military is in bad shape
due to the economic blockade.

1044
01:16:22,202 --> 01:16:25,205
And now, we have a chance to bring

1045
01:16:25,289 --> 01:16:27,916
a lot of money from the South to our side.

1046
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,585
I couldn't pass up the opportunity.

1047
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:32,588
As it is a classified operation
at the Reconnaissance General Bureau,

1048
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:36,091
we couldn't give you a heads-up.
I hope you can understand.

1049
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:38,176
My son will return soon.

1050
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:40,637
You can investigate him further
if you wish.

1051
01:16:41,888 --> 01:16:44,683
When will your son return?

1052
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:47,811
He will be back in a week.

1053
01:16:48,478 --> 01:16:50,897
The Military World Games
ended not so long ago.

1054
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:53,483
Our national team returned home,

1055
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:55,485
but the soldier dispatched to the field

1056
01:16:56,069 --> 01:16:58,363
stayed behind to negotiate the terms
for the next game.

1057
01:16:59,573 --> 01:17:01,199
He will return with the soldier.

1058
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,327
I see.

1059
01:17:05,203 --> 01:17:08,290
I do not believe that you are lying

1060
01:17:08,373 --> 01:17:11,001
about a matter as important as this

1061
01:17:11,835 --> 01:17:14,087
because if everything
you told me is a lie,

1062
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:19,301
resigning will not make this go away.

1063
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:52,376
FOUND THE HUNTING DOG'S HIDEOUT

1064
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:00,842
SWEET SEO DAN

1065
01:18:20,445 --> 01:18:21,488
You two, go up the stairs.

1066
01:18:21,571 --> 01:18:22,781
And you two, come with me.

1067
01:18:40,424 --> 01:18:41,633
Who are you?

1068
01:18:42,759 --> 01:18:43,635
Wait.

1069
01:18:44,344 --> 01:18:45,387
Who are you?

1070
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:49,766
I see.

1071
01:18:52,352 --> 01:18:53,353
Okay.

1072
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:03,780
I'm sorry. I had one too many drinks.

1073
01:19:31,683 --> 01:19:32,684
Damn it!

1074
01:19:38,231 --> 01:19:39,316
Gu Seung-jun.

1075
01:19:41,318 --> 01:19:42,861
So this is where you end up.

1076
01:19:44,237 --> 01:19:45,572
But why am I

1077
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:48,658
thinking about that woman right now?

1078
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:40,919
Hey.

1079
01:20:41,962 --> 01:20:44,589
So did you instruct them as I told you?

1080
01:20:48,802 --> 01:20:50,053
U Pil, let's go eat.

1081
01:20:51,096 --> 01:20:52,305
Yes, Mom.

1082
01:20:54,057 --> 01:20:56,434
-Did you have fun playing ddakji?
-Yes.

1083
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:01,064
Are you Hyeon Myeong Sun,
the wife of Jung Man Bok?

1084
01:21:03,108 --> 01:21:06,194
Yes. I am. What is this about?

1085
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:07,946
You must come with us.

1086
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:13,910
Your husband was
in a big car accident in Pyongyang.

1087
01:21:15,078 --> 01:21:16,162
What?

1088
01:21:16,663 --> 01:21:18,081
How will you clean this up?

1089
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:21,960
Where are you hiding after creating
this awful mess? What are you doing now?

1090
01:21:25,338 --> 01:21:26,590
What?

1091
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:28,925
Who's from North Korea?

1092
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:31,094
Ri Jeong Hyeok?

1093
01:21:32,804 --> 01:21:33,930
Who's that?

1094
01:21:39,436 --> 01:21:40,896
I'll take care of it now.

1095
01:21:46,776 --> 01:21:49,070
I have something important to tell you.

1096
01:21:59,539 --> 01:22:00,582
Who's inside?

1097
01:22:00,665 --> 01:22:02,667
Se-ri's family is still in the room.

1098
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:05,337
You are not to leave her side.

1099
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:07,130
Are you going somewhere?

1100
01:22:07,714 --> 01:22:10,133
Even if I'm late,

1101
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:12,135
you cannot leave her alone.

1102
01:22:13,219 --> 01:22:14,095
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

1103
01:22:17,891 --> 01:22:18,975
If...

1104
01:22:23,438 --> 01:22:24,940
I am very late...

1105
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:31,571
It's only a big if, but if that happens,

1106
01:22:33,323 --> 01:22:34,491
you must return.

1107
01:22:39,037 --> 01:22:40,997
You have your family waiting for you.

1108
01:22:42,916 --> 01:22:44,376
Captain Ri.

1109
01:22:47,921 --> 01:22:49,047
Captain Ri.

1110
01:23:28,962 --> 01:23:31,089
I'm requesting medical teams to prepare

1111
01:23:31,172 --> 01:23:32,757
for any possible shoot-outs.

1112
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:33,842
Yes, sir.

1113
01:23:33,925 --> 01:23:36,177
We're going up against
the elite soldiers from North Korea,

1114
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:38,346
so we'll try to arrest them
as quickly as possible.

1115
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:40,974
But if we fail to do so,
to stop this from escalating,

1116
01:23:42,225 --> 01:23:44,352
you are allowed to kill them in combat.
This is all.

1117
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:45,437
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

1118
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:18,470
They must've gotten the wind of it.
They're getting ready to move.

1119
01:24:32,275 --> 01:24:33,651
Damn it!

1120
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:31,543
What?

1121
01:25:32,377 --> 01:25:33,962
Are you going to kill me?

1122
01:25:34,045 --> 01:25:36,840
You might be able to kill me,

1123
01:25:37,173 --> 01:25:39,843
but the moment you do,
you're as good as dead.

1124
01:25:41,678 --> 01:25:43,179
Thanks to your father,

1125
01:25:43,263 --> 01:25:45,557
you've never faced a hardship
in your life.

1126
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:49,310
But now, you won't have your father
to protect you anymore.

1127
01:25:49,769 --> 01:25:52,397
He'll lose everything because of you.

1128
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:56,359
Cho Cheol Gang, you're not
the only one with nothing to lose.

1129
01:25:57,193 --> 01:25:59,237
I'm also risking everything I have.

1130
01:26:04,284 --> 01:26:05,577
Put down your weapons!

1131
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:10,039
If you leave your weapons and follow us,
your sentencing can be mitigated.

1132
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:13,001
Let me repeat.

1133
01:26:13,501 --> 01:26:14,752
Put down your weapons!

1134
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:21,593
The universe was on your side
when you were born,

1135
01:26:21,676 --> 01:26:23,636
but it looks like it's on my side now.

1136
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:25,555
Put down your gun now.

1137
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:28,474
Someone like you can never shoot me.

1138
01:27:02,759 --> 01:27:03,927
Let me repeat.

1139
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:05,762
Put down your weapons!

1140
01:27:06,262 --> 01:27:08,139
If you shoot, we'll fire.

1141
01:28:05,029 --> 01:28:07,991
Listen to this when you can't sleep.

1142
01:28:09,242 --> 01:28:11,327
When did he put this here?

1143
01:28:18,042 --> 01:28:19,168
Se-ri.

1144
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:21,796
You're having trouble sleeping again?

1145
01:28:25,258 --> 01:28:26,342
Yes.

1146
01:28:28,511 --> 01:28:31,472
I guess I can't go to sleep now

1147
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:34,559
if you're not by my side.

1148
01:28:41,899 --> 01:28:43,109
SLEEPING PILL

1149
01:28:50,283 --> 01:28:51,617
You have a lot of medications.

1150
01:29:16,225 --> 01:29:18,728
Don't take medication
when you can't sleep.

1151
01:29:19,145 --> 01:29:21,397
How about listening to this piece instead?

1152
01:29:23,066 --> 01:29:26,152
You said that after hearing this piece,
you wanted to live again.

1153
01:29:28,237 --> 01:29:30,531
What you told me
brought comfort to my past.

1154
01:29:38,539 --> 01:29:39,540
I feel

1155
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:42,210
like I to want to live again.

1156
01:29:43,503 --> 01:29:44,379
So

1157
01:29:45,838 --> 01:29:49,425
how about we live today
as if we will meet the next day?

1158
01:30:17,578 --> 01:30:19,872
Make sure you eat
and get a good night's sleep.

1159
01:30:20,706 --> 01:30:23,084
How about we go on with our days,

1160
01:30:24,127 --> 01:30:25,044
pretend

1161
01:30:25,837 --> 01:30:28,172
that we can meet again the next day,

1162
01:30:29,882 --> 01:30:31,717
and live a happy life?

1163
01:30:32,009 --> 01:30:33,052
HOW TO COOK NOODLES

1164
01:30:54,866 --> 01:30:58,911
And when living your life becomes fun
and you become happy,

1165
01:30:59,245 --> 01:31:01,414
even if you forget about me one day,

1166
01:31:03,207 --> 01:31:04,208
I...

1167
01:31:06,752 --> 01:31:08,254
will be okay.
