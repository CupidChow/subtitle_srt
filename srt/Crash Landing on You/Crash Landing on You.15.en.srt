1
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,971
ALL CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND BACKGROUND ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,236
Damn it!

3
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:14,616
Gu Seung-jun.

4
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:17,744
So this is where you end up.

5
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,791
But why am I

6
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,627
thinking about that woman right now?

7
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,303
Director Ri is handling this
more smoothly than expected.

8
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,263
We provided photos,

9
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:21,224
but he made an excuse that it was
an operation to bring Yoon Se-ri over.

10
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,685
Director Ri guaranteed

11
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:26,271
that Ri Jeong Hyeok
will return in a matter of few days.

12
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,774
Get rid of Ri Jeong Hyeok down there.

13
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,735
If you fail to remove Ri Jeong Hyeok,

14
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,488
there's no point for you
to return as well.

15
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,085
Put down your weapons!

16
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,796
If you leave your weapons and follow us,

17
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,548
your sentencing can be mitigated.

18
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:41,012
Let me repeat. Put down your weapons!

19
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,731
The universe was on your side
when you were born,

20
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,941
but it looks like it's on my side now.

21
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,693
Put down your gun now.

22
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,696
Someone like you can never shoot me.

23
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,469
Let me repeat. Put down your weapons!

24
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,930
If you shoot, we'll fire.

25
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,860
What is it? Can't make up your mind?

26
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:38,987
If you shoot me,

27
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,323
you'll be dead, too.

28
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,116
That's right.

29
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,412
A man of noble birth such as you
can't be killed in a dump like this.

30
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,787
You can't go back now.

31
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,290
I sent them everything.

32
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,253
The evidence

33
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,632
that proves
how you were with that bitch here.

34
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,052
If you go back,

35
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,639
your parents will be executed.

36
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,311
Why do you think

37
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,481
your father chose

38
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,736
not to get to the bottom
of your brother's murder?

39
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,409
It's because he knew

40
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,747
he would find himself once he found out
what caused his son's death.

41
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,543
That's why he buried it.

42
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,713
With that said,

43
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,341
I bet your father

44
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,679
wants you to die here.

45
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:37,022
You and I are in the same boat.

46
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,026
You have no place to return to.

47
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,613
Even if you go back to the North

48
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,034
or get arrested here,

49
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:53,788
your parents will end up
facing death either way.

50
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,754
So

51
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,636
let us leave together.

52
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,023
Toss it now!

53
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:06,653
Put the gun down!

54
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,322
EPISODE 15

55
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:52,824
You look deep in thought.

56
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,035
I was just wondering

57
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,038
if it was raining in our village, too.

58
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,542
You must be thinking about your family.

59
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,342
It's pouring even more.

60
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,263
Where did Jeong Hyeok go?
Why hasn't he still come back?

61
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:22,145
The phone has been turned off.

62
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,230
His phone is off, too.

63
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:42,874
Shave it.

64
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,961
-Do you really want to be bald?
-Yes.

65
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:52,092
I don't care if you shave your head
or not. Do it at your house.

66
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,344
Why are you doing this
at my house at this hour?

67
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,639
I would like to do the deed

68
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,726
in a place of the disaster
to reflect ourselves.

69
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,770
-Unbelievable.
-Okay.

70
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:05,897
I'll do it now.

71
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,281
Mother!

72
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,408
We have a problem. Please come out!

73
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,704
Let me ask my friend
to look after my son and I'll go.

74
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,207
You can just take me.
Please let my son stay.

75
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,835
I said no to that. Get in the car. Now.

76
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,839
My mother and I will not go with you!

77
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,591
-You little brat!
-Stop!

78
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:41,015
I need you to put your hand down.

79
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:45,854
What's that?

80
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,817
I was doing my laundry.

81
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:56,156
I'm the wife of the Senior Colonel
in the Civilian Police Battalion.

82
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,160
Well, I was digging up plants.

83
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,621
My name is Na Wol Suk,
the chief of the people's unit here.

84
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,166
I couldn't just look away

85
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,918
when outside visitors
didn't report to me first

86
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:12,755
and are trying to take our neighbors

87
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,717
against their will. Isn't that right?

88
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,718
That's right.

89
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:23,683
My name is Ryu Jeong Min.
I'm from the State Security Department.

90
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,604
"State Security Department"?

91
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:31,733
Is that so?

92
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,277
In that case,

93
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,530
send my regards to Ma Yeong Seop,

94
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,824
the director
of the State Security Department.

95
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,826
We are very close.

96
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,541
Sure. I will do so.

97
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:50,668
All right. Let's go.

98
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:54,255
By the way, Ma Yeong Seop is my brother.

99
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,758
He's not the director.

100
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,636
Did they just lie to us?

101
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,471
-Who are you?
-Darn you.

102
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,889
Can someone work

103
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,475
at the State Security Department
without knowing his boss's name?

104
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,893
-You're right.
-No way.

105
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,856
Myeong Sun, why are you just
standing there? Come here with U Pil.

106
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,316
-Come here.
-Come.

107
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,567
-Move.
-Come here.

108
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,698
Get lost when you have the chance.

109
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:24,953
If you don't,
I'll bring the Senior Colonel myself

110
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:29,207
and make you pay for impersonating agents
from the State Security Department.

111
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,628
Get lost!

112
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,338
Get out of here.

113
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,632
Who the heck are you?

114
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,762
-Those bastards.
-Well done.

115
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,396
What just happened?

116
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,730
No idea.

117
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,358
You haven't heard from your husband
from Pyongyang.

118
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,360
Who are those men?

119
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:00,571
Myeong Sun, you and your son
should stay with us for the time being.

120
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:03,574
There's no safer place than my house
in this village. Got it?

121
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,661
Thank you.

122
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,331
Let's go. Let me fix you a meal first.

123
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,000
Let's go.

124
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,584
Get up. Stand up.

125
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:14,752
U Pil, don't cry.

126
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,129
-Goodness.
-Don't cry.

127
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,506
I can't believe what just happened.
Let's go inside.

128
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,592
Let's go. Let's go back in. Hurry.

129
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,977
What are you doing here?
I looked everywhere for you.

130
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,896
It's all over now because of you.

131
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,651
It's not over yet.
We still have a card left.

132
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:40,737
What card?

133
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,781
It turns out your sister is pretty bold.

134
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:48,202
She brought people she stayed with
in North Korea all the way here.

135
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:49,662
What?

136
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,040
Those guys who were with her bodyguard.

137
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,960
I just talked to Cho Cheol Gang
on the phone.

138
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,841
HOT BEVERAGES

139
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,804
What's this?

140
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:08,890
It's a beverage vending machine.

141
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,642
If you want a drink, I'll get you a drink.

142
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:17,023
Does it mean warm milk
will come out of this thing?

143
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:22,153
Is there a place for a kettle
to boil milk inside?

144
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:26,032
Do you seriously think
there's a kettle inside this machine?

145
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:27,909
Then...

146
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:32,872
When you insert a coin
and place your order,

147
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,166
a person inside this machine

148
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:38,378
will heat the drink and serve it.

149
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:39,420
Seriously?

150
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,006
That's true.

151
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:46,469
Now, do you finally see
how scary capitalism can be?

152
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:51,557
You have to stay in that small space
day and night and serve drinks to people.

153
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,559
That must be so exhausting.

154
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,645
Gosh, this isn't...

155
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,940
So tell me. Do you want warm milk?

156
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,362
No. I won't drink it.

157
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:09,117
It must be hard working
in that small space, to begin with.

158
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,369
I don't want to pile on to that.

159
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,457
Have a good day.

160
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,720
Hey, run! Run!

161
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:33,558
Why are you running?

162
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,066
Who are you?

163
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,027
Ms. Yoon, are you well?

164
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,863
What is this about?

165
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,871
Hold on. I can explain.

166
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,498
We must question them first. Let's go.

167
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,087
We'll be fine. You just stay here.

168
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:04,338
Don't come for us.

169
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,013
PATIENT YOON SE-RI

170
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,940
They'll find us any minute.

171
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:24,525
What should we do?

172
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:28,154
I'm sure you've heard about
the State Security Department here.

173
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,782
Once you go in there,
you cannot come out alive.

174
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:35,077
I heard about the place
when I was up North.

175
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:39,582
From what I heard,
they pull our nails before they begin.

176
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:42,627
And they neither give you
a grain of rice nor a drop of water.

177
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,753
Hey.

178
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,382
I'll be fine if I die here
since all my parents passed away.

179
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,510
But it's not the same for you.

180
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,346
Geum Eun Dong, the breadwinner.

181
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,265
Shouldn't you go back
and see your mother and siblings?

182
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,896
Kim Ju Meok. Your father sent us

183
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:05,983
a lot of potatoes and corns,
so we take good care of you.

184
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,152
Shouldn't you be a nice son
and help him later?

185
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,238
But...

186
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,951
I'll go out and lure them somewhere else.

187
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,663
-You need to run away, then.
-I can't do that.

188
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,123
-Master Sergeant Pyo.
-I won't hear of it.

189
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,084
Stay safe.

190
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,211
Master Sergeant Pyo!

191
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,685
Come on!

192
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,147
-Isn't that a dead end?
-Yes.

193
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,192
You just stand here.

194
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,528
When he comes back, get him.

195
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,155
The rest of you are with me. Let's go in.

196
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,425
-Wait!
-Have you gone mad?

197
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,093
You're not well to be out here!

198
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,512
It's too soon for you to move around.

199
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,472
What if it worsens your condition?

200
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:22,268
Take me with you.
I can explain everything.

201
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,520
This all happened because of me.

202
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:26,606
You can question me first.

203
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:30,401
We will. We will schedule
a meeting with you, too.

204
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,862
Your doctor said
you couldn't be discharged yet.

205
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,156
No, I'm all right.

206
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:36,866
I'll go with them.

207
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,286
Hey! Your doctor said no!

208
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,039
Who are you to go against your doctor?

209
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,541
-Wait!
-Go back there and stay in bed.

210
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,502
-Make sure to take your medication!
-Wait.

211
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:49,837
Calm down.

212
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:54,091
They didn't do anything wrong.

213
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,177
It's all because of me.

214
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,180
No. It's not because of you.

215
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:01,599
It's all right.

216
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,518
-What am I going to do?
-You'll be okay.

217
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,646
What should I do?

218
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,281
UNSTABLE

219
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,562
Give it to me.

220
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,401
Give you what?

221
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,779
To prepare for a situation like this,

222
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,281
they must've given you some kind of poison

223
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,617
that will kill me instantly

224
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,577
once I pop it in my mouth.

225
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:07,123
As if. They didn't even give us guns.

226
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,458
So you don't have a plan?

227
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:14,046
Do you remember
what that guy from Division 11 told us?

228
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,048
This place is habitable as well.

229
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,509
So don't be afraid.

230
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:21,846
So let's not be afraid. Okay?

231
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:25,141
Hey, don't you remember
the condition he was in?

232
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:26,726
Dong-gu.

233
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,271
They have it.

234
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:33,816
Hey!

235
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,570
Imagine what he must have been through
to turn out like that.

236
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,950
It makes me think
he must have been severely tortured

237
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,162
by something painful
like the electric shock.

238
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,914
That's my opinion.

239
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,166
-What?
-What?

240
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:51,959
We'll face electric torture.

241
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,420
-Oh, no. What will I do?
-Electric...

242
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,681
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE

243
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:14,356
Starting now,

244
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,902
you will put on the shoes,
provided our organization.

245
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,783
You will each take a box
placed in front of you

246
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:26,702
and follow me.

247
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,010
COLLECTED BELONGINGS CONFIRMATION

Height, 180. Weight, 64.

00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,822
Wait, wait, wait!

254
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,661
Next.

255
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,397
I knew this would come.
Do whatever you have to do.

256
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:39,567
I, Pyo Chi Su, will not breathe a word.

257
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,402
Okay, Mr. Pyo Chi Su.

258
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,863
Please relax and answer the questions.

259
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,657
First, we will test...

260
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,951
I will not say a single word.

261
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:53,956
You will be only wasting electricity.

262
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,626
If you are going to kill me,
just kill me now.

263
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,546
I don't want to beg for my life.

264
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,590
Mr. Pyo, you seem very nervous now.

265
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,633
"Nervous"?

266
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,597
This lame torture
does not scare me at all!

267
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,391
No way!

268
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:14,268
Wait, wait.

269
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,646
I think you're lying now.

270
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,775
This machine detects lies.

271
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:23,944
What?

272
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:28,866
There's a machine that does that?

273
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,910
You have been yelling so much.
Aren't you hungry?

274
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:35,122
How about we let you eat something
and start over when you feel less tense?

275
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,540
I'm fine.

276
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,376
I'm not hungry.

277
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:53,682
Master Sergeant Pyo.

278
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,062
Hey. Are you okay?

279
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:01,940
Yes. They said we can bring
more food if we want.

280
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:05,319
Are you here for food or what?

281
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,572
I'm sorry.

282
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:12,242
They say the way to a man's heart
is through his stomach.

283
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:16,121
They think we will tell them secrets
when we are well-fed.

284
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,748
They already know about everything.

285
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:20,626
About what?

286
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:25,631
They even knew about my hometown.

287
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:34,223
This is your hometown, right?

288
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,476
It is! It's my hometown!

289
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:42,690
That's the school I went to.

290
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:44,983
Next to that is Azalea Hill.

291
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,945
In spring,
the hill gets covered with azaleas.

292
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,322
And I live right next to it.

293
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:54,159
-This?
-Yes! This is my house.

294
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:57,371
Can I see my mother too?

295
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:01,166
I want to see my mother too.

296
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,212
I wonder how they found my place.
They're really good.

297
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:10,384
Why did they show your hometown to you?

298
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,387
I'm not sure,

299
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,973
but there was
no electrical torture whatsoever.

300
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:17,808
They were kind.

301
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,144
They are playing a mind game.

302
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,104
Stay strong.

303
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:30,154
By the way,
do you think Captain Ri is here too?

304
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:46,295
I don't think he will say anything now.

305
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,047
You said he had not eaten anything.

306
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:50,966
Let him get some sleep for now.

307
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:53,719
By the way,

308
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:57,055
do you think it's true that he is the son
of the Director of the GPB?

309
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,266
If it is, this is a really big deal.

310
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,853
If North Korea finds this out,
it will create quite a stir there.

311
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,022
We will need to do some investigations.

312
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,944
By the way, Sir. Doesn't he look too calm?

313
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:14,323
-Could he be up to something?
-Up to what?

314
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:18,327
You know, something like that.
For the sake of his parents in the North

315
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:23,415
and to avoid anything that might work
against Se-ri and people who helped him,

316
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,251
he seems to want
to take all the responsibility.

317
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:28,545
I can see that from his eyes.

318
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,840
-Are you a psychic or something?
-Let's say I'm experienced.

319
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:33,467
Experienced, my foot.

320
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,724
The NIS? All of them?

321
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:43,811
We are yet to grasp the whole situation,

322
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:46,480
but Captain Ri was certainly arrested.

323
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:53,320
I think we have reached the point
where we can't stop it.

324
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,616
Jeong Hyeok...

325
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,873
Is he safe at least?

326
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,961
Yes, Sir. Cho Cheol Gang
was found dead at the scene,

327
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,797
but Captain Ri is safe.

328
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:14,842
I see.

329
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:16,510
I will try to get more information

330
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:18,929
through the secret channel in the South.

331
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:22,558
But just in case,

332
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,519
I want you to be prepared, Sir.

333
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:37,823
There are so many of you.
How did you know I was a good fighter?

334
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,742
Mr. Cheon. I know we have been
apart for some time,

335
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:43,412
-but how could forget our friendship?
-Will you be quiet?

336
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,746
Do you know how worried I was

337
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,498
when the State Security Department
took you?

338
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:49,626
How much did you get paid for this?
How much am I?

339
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,004
Tell me how much I am.

340
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:58,802
Shut up.

341
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:07,102
We need to travel for a few more days
to get to China's border.

342
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,980
It's late now,
so let's stay near the market tonight.

343
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,608
Let's do that.

344
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,574
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

345
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,202
We are almost there, Honey.
We are almost there.

346
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,662
I know.

347
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:28,665
When Se-hyeong, that punk,
became the president,

348
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,376
I opened three bottles of wine, right?

349
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,378
Three bottles of wine
and two bottles of whiskey.

350
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,173
We mixed them
and we had a horrible hangover.

351
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,550
Right. We should never mix
different liquors.

352
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:39,927
It feels like that was yesterday.

353
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,845
I had no idea
Yoon Se-ri would come back to life

354
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:44,890
and remove Se-hyeong just like that.

355
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,309
Tell me about it. Cheers.

356
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,187
Cheers.

357
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,147
What is it?

358
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,399
But why do I feel weird?

359
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:59,404
I have the feeling

360
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:02,074
-that it isn't over yet.
-You're right.

361
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:05,410
Your father should be calling you out
and say,

362
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:08,789
"Se-jun, you are the best.

363
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:13,669
Why was it so hard

364
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:17,256
to get back to you?"

365
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:20,217
"Now I realized

366
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:23,845
I can't leave you

367
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:29,226
until the day I die, Se-jun."

368
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,602
He should be saying that by now.

369
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:33,563
Why is he so quiet?

370
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:36,066
Maybe your phone is
on airplane mode. Check it.

371
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:39,736
No, it's not. You scared me.

372
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,491
Father.

373
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:47,953
Until now,
the kind of scandals rich families had

374
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,371
were bribery, embezzlement,

375
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:52,040
assault, gambling, and drugs.

376
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:55,335
But Se-ri's case is
about the National Security Law.

377
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:58,088
This is a whole different issue.

378
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,798
Gu Seung-jun is coming soon,

379
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,426
-and when he comes--
-I'm sorry,

380
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,971
but I don't want to discuss
my family issue

381
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,389
with someone who isn't my family.

382
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,808
Get out of my house now.

383
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:13,895
The bodyguard that was involved
in the scandal with Se-ri was a spy.

384
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:17,983
-That crazy wench.
-We don't know the whole story yet.

385
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,986
We know you are very upset at us now.

386
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,571
And we don't want to defend ourselves.

387
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:26,700
However, you should be dispassionate
about this matter.

388
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:30,495
If we try to save Se-ri, we will all fall.

389
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,459
I'm in my old age

390
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:39,296
and seeing you makes me realize
that I have wasted my life.

391
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,174
You guys worry about your own future.

392
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,218
Father.

393
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,346
Don't.

394
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:52,476
Gu Seung-jun will come.

395
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,937
Once he's here,
we will have a lot of stories to make.

396
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,524
Unbelievable.

397
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:02,527
A spy? Seriously?

398
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:04,571
Are they trying to kill us or something?

399
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:08,450
Hye-ji, could you please be quiet?
My head hurts.

400
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,494
I'm sorry.

401
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:13,997
I mean, the second the world finds out
about what they did,

402
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:16,750
they will have to hang
their heads in shame.

403
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,836
Do they take pills or something?
They are no ordinary.

404
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,672
They are trying to show that
they didn't instigate murder or abduction

405
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:26,301
but they are only patriots
who tried to attack a spy.

406
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:29,221
That's the scenario they have written.

407
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,890
And they said
they would bring Gu Seung-jun.

408
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:33,683
By the way,

409
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:37,729
did he really escape to North Korea
and was hiding there?

410
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,234
How did you meet him there?

411
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,778
Is it destiny?

412
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,322
It's not destiny.

413
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:49,032
It's a coincidence.

414
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:52,744
Did you say

415
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,455
they would bring Gu Seung-jun?

416
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:57,207
Was he caught?

417
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:40,333
Tie me up.

418
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:53,346
Can I really do that?

419
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,947
Come and have a look.

420
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,951
Excuse me.

421
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:18,205
Where can I take a cab?

422
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:21,917
There are no cabs here.
You have to go to the train station.

423
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:28,006
I probably can't call taxis here. Dang it.

-I don't have parents

438
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,139
They're gone.

439
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:07,897
You...

440
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:10,942
You're like me.

441
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:13,778
Pardon?

442
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:17,657
I also don't have parents and siblings.

443
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,828
I don't have anyone
who will mourn my death.

444
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:37,510
Don't let others take it

445
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,679
and don't lose it.

446
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,140
Do you think you can do it?

447
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:48,021
That's for saving my life.

448
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:51,524
Get some food for you and your sibling.

449

PAWNSHOP

450
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:21,763
A nice and loyal guy like me
gave you a ring.

451
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,264
Where's the engagement ring?

452
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,560
Did you sell it?

453
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,271
No, I didn't sell it.

454
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,233
I left it somewhere temporarily.

455
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:35,694
-Where?
-A pawn shop in the marketplace.

456

PAWNSHOP

457
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:02,512
The phone is either turned off or out
of the service area and cannot be reached.

458
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:13,022
We analyzed Ri Jeong Hyeok's GPS record
in his phone

459
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:14,274
and figured out where he went.

RI JEONG HYEOK'S GPS ANALYSIS

461
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,194
Among the footages of the CCTVs,

462
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:19,904
we have sorted out useful files.

463

CCTV FOOTAGE

464
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,952
What is he doing?
Is he a doorkeeper or what?

465
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,121
This video clip created
some buzz recently.

466
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,957
It's titled, "A Gorgeous Man's Manner
at a Department Store in Gangnam."

467
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,626
It's vied 35,020 times
and got 3,200 comments--

468
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,837
This isn't what I meant.

469
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,018
He seems very nimble.

470
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:54,105
He's the Captain of the Special Forces.
We should not underestimate him.

471
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:57,150
Imagine he used his nimble body
for other purposes.

472
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,320
-Do you have anything else?
-Yes, Sir.

473
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:06,868
What is he doing?

474
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:08,995
Is he exchanging secret messages?

475
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:11,206
Is there something inside?

476
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:12,707
Is it a leaflet?

477
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:23,802
Hey, show me something else.

478
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:36,064
Are we deciding the candidates
for the Good Deed Award?

479
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,441
Why did you choose
only the footages like that?

480
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,485
They are all we've got.

481
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:03,758
From now on, you must be honest with us.

482
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,635
Mr. Ri Jeong Hyeok.

483
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,224
Why did you illegally trespassed
on the Republic of Korea?

484
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:20,608
In order to persuade Yoon Se-ri

485
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:24,112
and take her back to my country.

486
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:25,613
Why?

487
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,366
I was aware of the fact that the woman

488
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,411
who fell in our land
was from a rich family here.

489
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:34,247
I tried to convince her
to stay in our country,

490
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,748
but I failed. That's why.

491
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:41,754
What about your men?

492
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,674
My men have nothing to do
with this matter.

493
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:47,510
They came to participate
in the Military World Games

494
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:50,597
and I involved them in this
so they can't go back.

495
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:52,056
And why is that?

496
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:57,478
Because it was hard
to convince Yoon Se-ri by myself.

497
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:03,359
You meant to bring her back to North Korea
with the help of your subordinates?

498
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,528
That is correct.

499
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:10,533
But the whole thing was my idea.
My subordinates are innocent.

500
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:16,706
Mr. Ri Jeong Hyeok.
It's nice that you tell me everything,

501
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:20,710
but do you know what punishment you'll get
when this turns out to be true?

502
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:26,299
You told me to tell you the truth.

503
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,259
That's what I'm doing now.

504
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:38,061
That's...

505
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,105
That's not true.

506
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,025
He's lying.

507
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:45,777
Why do you think so?

508
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:49,197
Because he has never convinced me
to stay there.

509
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:52,909
The whole time,

510
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:58,122
he did his best to send me back home.

511
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:00,833
I'm going to make you a member
of the national team that participates

512
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:02,293
an international track competition.

513
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:04,337
What did you say?

514
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,839
Then you can go to Europe by airplane.

515
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,591
The moment you leave here,

516
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:11,177
I hope you will forget everything
about this place and me

517
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:15,431
go back to the life you have been living
and stay healthy there.

518
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,477
Just pretend that you had a nightmare.

519
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,025
He didn't need to

520
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:28,277
nor was obligated to,

521
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:33,658
but he risked his life to protect me.

522
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,369
Listen to me carefully.

523
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:40,039
Tomorrow,

524
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,166
you will go back home.

525
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:45,169
He has never tried to persuade me

526
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:48,172
nor take advantage of me.

527
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:50,925
As I said,

528
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:54,929
Cho Cheol Gang came from North Korea
to kill me

529
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,598
and Ri Jeong Hyeok

530
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,978
came here to catch Cho Cheol Gang,
the man who committed crime

531
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:04,105
and escaped.

532
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:08,735
And I'm the one who hid him.

533
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,619
Se-ri.

534
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:20,705
I have to

535
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,207
send him back home safely too.

536
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,128
As for the rest of the matter...

537
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:30,506
I will deal with it myself here,

538
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:34,719
even if it means
I have to get a punishment.

539
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,263
The two are saying
completely different things.

540
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:39,891
Given the situation,
what Yoon Se-ri said seems more likely.

541
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,060
No hostage would get shot
for their kidnapper.

542
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:46,105
He might have deliberately lied
not to cause any trouble

543
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:47,607
to Yoon Se-ri.

544
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,817
What do the five guys say?

545
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,617
Captain Ri must have said something.

546
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:00,620
His answer is my answer.

547
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:03,206
How many did you interview before me?

548
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:07,293
You're asking me this because you didn't
hear the answer from others, right?

549
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,714
I can't say it either.

550
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,058
Excuse me, Mr. Park?

551
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:28,606
Is our Captain Ri here too?

552
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,945
Is he all right?

553
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:36,739
Excuse me, Mr. Kim.
I'm the one who asked a question.

554
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:38,866
I'm just really curious, okay?

555
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,662
He's alive, right?

556
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:45,289
In South Korean dramas,

557
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:48,334
this is the moment where
the main character gets hurt or dies.

558
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:51,254
So I'm worried.

559
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,589
As I keep saying,
you're wasting your time.

560
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:56,592
More than 90 percent of my body weight
is the weight of my mouth.

561
00:43:56,926 --> 00:43:59,762
I'm saying my heavy mouth
never opens to tell secrets.

562
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,351
They refuse to testify.

563
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:09,272
As Ri Jeong Hyeok and Yoon Se-ri's
testimonies are conflicting,

564
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,650
a face-to-face interview
will be the only way.

565
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:27,915
I told you I don't want
a face-to-face interview.

566
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,127
Your story and my story are different.

567
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,254
Of course they need further investigation.

568
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,923
This was going to happen anyway.

569
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:39,927
Is it okay to be just the two of us?

570
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:43,014
We both know what the question is.

571
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,351
Sure.

572
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:49,937
You will be recorded, by the way.

573
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,571
Will you keep standing?

574
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:02,742
Have a seat. I'm tired.

575
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:36,025
Jeong Hyeok.

576
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:41,364
Look at me.

577
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:49,330
Please look at me.

578
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,175
I know

579
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:04,011
why you are being like this now.

580
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,264
It's because of me.

581
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:10,351
Because once things get revealed,

582
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:12,603
it might put me in trouble.

583
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:15,314
Because once people learn about this,

584
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,650
it might make things hard for me.

585
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,652
So you're trying to take the fall.

586
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,278
That's not it.

587
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,198
Then what is it?

588
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:30,830
Listen.

589
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:34,041
As you probably already know,

590
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:37,336
my father is the Director of the GPB
of the DPRK.

591
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:40,589
I'm not just anyone in there.

592
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:42,842
Do you think someone like that

593
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:47,013
would really help you and hide you
for personal reasons?

594
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,891
How naive you are.

595
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:54,687
I wouldn't have done it

596
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:57,648
if you had not told me
about your background.

597
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,027
You had quite an impressive background,

598
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,695
which gave me a reason.

599
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,241
A reason to use you.

600
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:12,872
You aren't a good liar. So stop lying.

601
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:15,791
Well,

602
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:20,087
we did spend some time together after all.

603
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:24,383
So I wouldn't say
I was untruthful the whole time.

604
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,261
I did get attached to you too.

605
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:31,015
That's why we are having
this conversation now.

606
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,810
This is the least I can do to respect
the time we have spent together.

607
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:38,898
Jeong Hyeok.

608
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:48,407
I came here to use you,
a woman who accidentally fell on DPRK.

609
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:50,951
I got something on you
and I held you hostage--

610
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:52,870
Because you hid me there,

611
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,747
I hid you here too.

612
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,541
I did it because I wanted to do it.
I wasn't a hostage.

613
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,627
You didn't...

614
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,881
use me.

615
00:48:07,343 --> 00:48:08,677
A person who tried to use me

616
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:12,056
wouldn't get a gunshot for me

617
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,059
or come all the way down here

618
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,770
to protect me at the risk of his life.

619
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:19,230
Don't get it wrong.

620
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,190
I never came here to protect you.

621
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:29,198
Cho Cheol Gang killed my brother

622
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,200
and I came to take revenge on him.

623
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:32,618
So...

624
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,746
I want you to stop kidding yourself.

625
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:40,501
Jeong Hyeok.

626
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:43,087
Are you giving up your own life?

627
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,713
Are you going to give up everything?

628
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:46,132
Don't you want to go home?

629
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:50,553
If you keep

630
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:53,139
trying to take all the blame,

631
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,809
you will actually become a criminal.

632
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,479
Do you know what that means?

633
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:04,775
Se-ri.

634
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,031
Rather than giving up my whole life,

635
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,619
seeing you now bothers me more.

636
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:24,587
So leave now. Please.

637
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,443
Jeong Hyeok.

638
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:50,446
This must be tough for you.

639
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:53,073
This is very tough for me.

640
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:37,451
Se-ri!

641
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:39,578
Is anybody here? Se-ri!

642
00:50:39,662 --> 00:50:42,373
Se-ri! Please help.

643
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:43,958
-Se-ri, wake up.
-Let me carry her.

644
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,709
-Wake up, Se-ri.
-Be careful.

645
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:49,880
Se-ri!

646
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,729
Why did you have to be so harsh on her?

647
00:51:05,813 --> 00:51:08,607
That ill person forced herself
to come here.

648
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:11,944
She passed out
and was carried out on someone's back.

649
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:18,325
This is why I said she was
not healthy enough yet for an interview.

650
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:19,868
But she kept saying she was fine.

651
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:21,745
Mr. Ri, where are you going?

652
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:37,988
It's blood poisoning.

653
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:40,908
Because of the gunshot wound,
her immunity level was low.

654
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:43,202
And the severe stress seems to have caused

655
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:45,162
the blood infection.

656
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:47,831
Her body temperature went over 39Â°C,

657
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,500
which led to loss of consciousness.

658
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:52,795
To stop the infection from spreading,
we gave her strong antibiotics.

659
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,922
Will she be okay
when she gets the treatment?

660
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:57,716
I'm not sure. Blood poisoning has

661
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,511
over 40 percent of the mortality rate.

662
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:03,972
Early intensive treatment is crucial.

663
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:06,600
We will have to wait and see
until tomorrow.

664
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,519
I see.

665
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:44,388
Did you hear anything
from your husband yet?

666
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:48,058
No, not yet.

667
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:53,856
Why do things like this keep happening?

668
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:55,441
It's upsetting.

669
00:53:56,733 --> 00:54:00,988
Now I think of it,
that fortune teller was good indeed.

670
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,656
The one who serves a South Korean spirit.

671
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:04,616
You're right.

672
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:07,327
How about we go and see her again?

673
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:09,121
That place was shut down.

674
00:54:09,288 --> 00:54:10,581
-What?
-What?

675
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:14,460
Last week, she got caught
and arrested by the control officers.

676
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:15,961
-Oh, my.
-How?

677
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:20,674
The wife of an officer of the
State Security Department went to see her

678
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,551
and she happened to find

679
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:24,720
her husband's affair.

680
00:54:25,304 --> 00:54:26,597
That asshole.

681
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,224
Goodness. She's good.

682
00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:31,143
Why would she tell that?

683
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:33,896
After getting nagged by his wife,

684
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:36,231
the officer seems to have taken
bloody revenge.

685
00:54:36,315 --> 00:54:40,194
She's really good,
but I guess she can't see her own future.

686
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:41,236
I guess you're right.

687
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:45,240
The bloodbath she mentioned earlier

688
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:47,326
must be over now, right?

689
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:50,162
It must be. What else can happen now?

690
00:54:52,331 --> 00:54:53,999
-Mother!
-I'm hungry.

691
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:55,584
-Hey.
-Come outside.

692
00:54:57,503 --> 00:55:00,339
-Hey.
-I'm home.

693
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:02,674
Hey, guys.

694
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:05,052
Look who's here.

695
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:07,262
It's Comrade Nephew from Europe.

696
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:08,931
Yes.

697
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:10,849
How did you...

698
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:14,645
I was just passing by

699
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:17,105
and the children looked hungry.

700
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:21,485
I saw the smoke coming out of the chimney
and smelled rice too.

701
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:26,949
I was right. You were cooking rice.

702
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:31,662
I'm not saying I want rice.

703
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:34,540
Can I charge my phone?

704
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,834
Oh, my. Come on in.

705
00:55:37,918 --> 00:55:39,419
Let's have dinner together.

706
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,755
Can I? Thank you.

707
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:55,769
Have some water.

708
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:57,563
Thank you.

709
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,899
Would you like to have more rice?

710
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:01,942
Is that okay with you?

711
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,443
Of course.

712
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:05,904
It's nothing compared
to the big favor you've done for us.

713
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:14,997
Here.

714
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,707
Thank you.

715
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:23,005
By the way, do North Korean speak
South Korean dialect

716
00:56:23,422 --> 00:56:25,215
in Europe like you?

717
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:27,467
What?

718
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,554
Right. Most of them do.

719
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:33,849
Because we sometimes have to
keep our identities secret.

720
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,976
I see.

721
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:39,062
This kimchi is really tasty.

722
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:41,940
It tastes refreshing, right?

723
00:56:42,024 --> 00:56:43,233
Yes.

724
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:44,776
Here. Eat up.

725
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,403
Thank you.

726
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:51,533
Slow down.
It's not like someone is coming after you.

727
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,704
Right. Slowly.

728
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:05,213
It's not, is it?

729
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,716
Excuse me?

730
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:08,884
Is someone after you?

731
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:11,803
Of course not.

732
00:57:17,726 --> 00:57:19,478
All right. Let's eat.

733
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,813
Okay. Eat up.

734
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:36,703
Hello?

735
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:41,124
Why was your phone off the whole day?

736
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:42,292
I ran out of battery.

737
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:44,086
And why is the house so messy?

738
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:45,545
What happened...

739
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:48,006
Where are you now?

740
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:52,177
Where?

741
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,532
What are you doing here?

742
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:15,701
With all the lights off.

743
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:17,953
If I turn the lights on,
I might get caught.

744
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:21,748
This is the only place I found to hide.

745
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,127
You could have looked for a candle.

746
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,108
I'm in the house

747
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:50,652
of the man I was engaged to.

748
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:52,612
Right.

749
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:55,323
And the owner is not even here.

750
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:58,952
I'm sure Jeong Hyeok will understand.

751
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:01,747
I have done so much for him.

752
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:04,249
I got him a broker
and a South Korean phone.

753
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:07,210
If you think of it, I'm being chased now

754
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:09,504
because I helped him.

755
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:11,381
Who are the people

756
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:13,550
that are after you?

757
00:59:14,176 --> 00:59:16,636
They are the people Se-ri's brother sent.

758
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:18,764
Chinese gangsters.

759
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,850
I can't believe

760
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:25,062
those punks are doing that here.

761
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:30,776
-Let's go to Pyongyang with me and--
-I don't want to trouble you.

762
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:35,030
I have my plans, so don't worry.

763
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:39,743
What nonsense are you talking about?

764
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:42,204
Jeong Hyeok had another woman?

765
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:48,543
I will make him pay for this.

766
00:59:48,794 --> 00:59:52,172
He will never be able to live
in Pyongyang.

767
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:54,966
How dare he cheat on my daughter.

768
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:58,261
Didn't you say this the other day?

769
00:59:58,345 --> 00:59:59,846
Hey, it's not like

770
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:02,474
Dan was married to Ri Jeong Hyeok.

771
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:04,017
Affair, my foot.

772
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:05,769
You said they are not married yet,

773
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:08,021
so it's not an affair, but just love.

774
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:13,151
Hey. You have a lot of bad traits

775
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:16,905
but the worst is that you remember
useless things for so long.

776
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:20,450
Do you know that?

777
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:24,913
And that woman

778
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:27,124
came from South Korea.

779
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:29,334
-This isn't just a small deal.
-Myeong Eun,

780
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,545
if you think about it,

781
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:34,089
Comrade Al also came from South Korea.

782
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:38,552
We are not completely innocent either.
Don't you think that's a double standard?

783
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:42,097
I had no idea

784
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:45,225
the 10 years of waiting would
end up in a double affair.

785
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:46,726
And now,

786
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:50,272
the Comrade Al seems
to be leaving soon as well.

787
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:54,317
-He's leaving?
-Yes.

788
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:56,278
I have done some research,

789
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:58,905
and I found out that he bought
a flight ticket to Europe.

790
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:03,201
It's probably for the best
that we let him go.

791
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:09,374
You're leaving?

792
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:12,836
My original plan was to keep
a low profile here for at least 10 years.

793
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:16,089
But now I'm busted

794
01:01:16,298 --> 01:01:17,757
and being chased.

795
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:20,343
I can't stay here for long anyway.

796
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:25,765
Fortunately, the surveillance of
State Security Department is loose now.

797
01:01:25,974 --> 01:01:27,309
And I managed to buy a ticket.

798
01:01:28,852 --> 01:01:30,353
This is a good chance to leave.

799
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,274
When?

800
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,067
Tomorrow.

801
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:41,781
I'm just about to leave the country,
and I got caught by those punks.

802
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:43,533
I could have been in serious trouble.

803
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:46,369
If I have to be chased,
I want to be chased in my area.

804
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:48,330
I can't do that here.

805
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,043
I see.

806
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:57,672
I'm sorry to ask you this,
but can you send me off to the airport?

807
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:02,886
Well, I guess I can do that.

808
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:08,016
Thank you. And...

809
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:11,728
thank you for everything, Dan.

810
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:19,194
That's okay.

811
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:22,489
You're so cool, as always.

812
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:26,243
You could have stopped me as a joke.

813
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:28,495
Why would I say such a joke?

814
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:30,497
That's meaningless.

815
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:34,376
You're right.

816
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:37,045
But somehow

817
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,382
I would like to hear that joke.

818
01:02:41,341 --> 01:02:42,717
Those meaningless words.

819
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,033
What is it?

820
01:03:07,242 --> 01:03:08,868
I have been trying my best

821
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:12,455
to live a good life.

822
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:16,543
Without knowing where I was headed,

823
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:21,047
I have been running out of breath.

824
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:23,967
But in the end,

825
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:29,597
I'm at the bottom.

826
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:45,613
I know a man like me

827
01:03:46,865 --> 01:03:48,783
should not do this

828
01:03:50,702 --> 01:03:53,747
to a woman like you, Dan.

829
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,002
Still,

830
01:04:00,462 --> 01:04:01,713
I wanted to give it to you.

831
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:21,107
I am sorry.

832
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:26,905
This is the ring I gave Yoon Se-ri.

833
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:33,203
You picked it and said that it's pretty.

834
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:36,790
This is the ring.

835
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:41,878
It was the best I could do for now.

836
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:45,924
Later on,

837
01:04:47,342 --> 01:04:48,426
if I visit you

838
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:51,930
when I am

839
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:55,100
doing better...

840
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:59,604
And if

841
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,315
you are

842
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:04,901
still single...

843
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:09,864
Then please give me

844
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:13,785
a chance.

845
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:18,415
Stop talking nonsense.

846
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:37,100
I like you, Dan.

847
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:41,312
Because I like you,

848
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:44,732
I will keep in mind where I am going.

849
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:50,238
I will live that way.

850
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,412
I will do that from now on.

851
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:11,676
They are still the best soldiers

852
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:13,386
from Special Forces at the front line.

853
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:16,181
We need thorough information
on what they did here.

854
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:26,524
All of them were using
Yoon Se-ri's credit card.

855
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,819
Was it extorted from
or given by Yoon Se-ri

856
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:31,613
for concealment?

857
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:34,157
We need to figure that out.

858
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,993
Let's look at the details.

859
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:38,995
Nine dollars at an internet cafe.

860
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:40,121
I believe it was

861
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:42,624
their major hideout
for gathering information.

862
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:44,584
That's good. The details of their visit?

863
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:45,960
They are below.

864
01:06:46,878 --> 01:06:49,881
European Champion Clubs' Cup
Gold Package, 4,900 won.

865
01:06:50,465 --> 01:06:53,468
European Champion Clubs' Cup
Diamond Package, 3,600 won.

866
01:06:54,385 --> 01:06:55,678
What are these?

867
01:06:55,762 --> 01:06:57,055
Game items.

868
01:06:57,138 --> 01:06:58,515
Come on! Come on!

869
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:05,063
Upon checking,

870
01:07:05,647 --> 01:07:07,941
I found out
that Diamond Package is cheaper

871
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:11,110
since they received a 20 percent discount

872
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:12,904
for purchasing Gold Package.

873
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:14,113
Save it.

874
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:17,867
Dada, 900 won. 35 times.

875
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:20,537
-What is this?
-It's the cost of downloading videos.

876
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:22,789
What kind of videos?

877
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:25,416
Winter Sonata, Mr. Duke,

878
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,794
Second 20s, The Suspicious Housekeeper...

879
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:30,380
Seeing as how Choi Ji-woo is the lead
in all of those dramas...

880
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,473
He is a fan of Choi Ji-woo.

881
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:42,475
Should I keep looking?

882
01:07:43,685 --> 01:07:44,811
Forget it.

883
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:46,521
Okay.

884
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:49,274
They also spent 2,000 won at a C.K.

885
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:50,650
What's C.K.?

886
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,026
Coin karaoke.

887
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:54,779
They spent 3,520 won
at a convenience store.

888
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:57,865
They bought a hot bar and ramyeon.

889
01:07:57,949 --> 01:07:59,284
And 5,800 won at Shark Tteokbokki.

890
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:02,412
Listen, are any transactions
over 10,000 won?

891
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:04,455
Just in case,

892
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:07,083
I am looking for the connections
between the stores.

893
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:09,919
Don't. Don't look for connections.
Why would you do that?

894
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:11,671
After having a hot bar and ramyeon,

895
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:14,257
they ate tteokbokki
since they were still hungry.

896
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:15,883
Right.

897
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:19,887
What is up with them?

898
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:22,307
Why

899
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:25,977
are their spendings so trivial?

900
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:28,104
Enter.

901
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:31,482
Is it done?

902
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:32,859
It's done.

903
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:35,445
Sir, the data has been restored.

904
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:51,878
Take a look.

905
01:08:52,462 --> 01:08:54,922
This laptop was found at the scene
of Cho Cheol Gang's death.

906
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:57,008
We restored his emails.

907
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,428
It was difficult to get the password,
but we did it in the end.

908
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:04,432
Doesn't the email make it clear

909
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:07,310
why Cho Cheol Gang shot at you

910
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:09,187
even though he knew he would die?

911
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:12,106
That man

912
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:15,568
had nowhere to go in the end.

913
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:19,656
He could neither go back nor stay here.

914
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:22,283
He didn't want to die alone either.

915
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:25,787
You can't go back now.

916
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:29,248
I sent them everything.

917
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:31,709
The evidence

918
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:35,797
that proves
how you were with that bitch here.

919
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:38,925
If you go back,

920
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:42,512
your parents will be executed.

921
01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:48,643
It seems like

922
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:51,479
your father told everyone
that you will return in a few days.

923
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:55,525
Why don't you stop worrying
about your father

924
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:04,242
and be more honest, Mr. Ri Jeong Hyeok?

925
01:10:10,123 --> 01:10:11,374
What is it?

926
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:16,504
Yoon Se-ri.

927
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:20,258
How is she?

928
01:10:20,591 --> 01:10:22,176
She is in an intensive care unit.

929
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:25,888
She got sepsis
as an after-effect of surgery.

930
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:29,934
Why did you treat her so harshly

931
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:32,311
if you can't stand it yourself?

932
01:10:58,796 --> 01:11:00,131
Thank you.

933
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:03,384
I will get going now.

934
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:10,099
Stay healthy.

935
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:17,482
Don't get sick.

936
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:45,570
Comrade Gu Seung-jun.

937
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:47,989
If you don't come to us right now,

938
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:50,700
we will take this woman with us.

939
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:52,827
Let go of me!

940
01:12:55,746 --> 01:12:59,083
You are barking up the wrong tree.

941
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:01,210
I have nothing to do with that woman.

942
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:04,463
I don't care if you take her or not.

943
01:13:04,547 --> 01:13:06,132
Is that so?

944
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:09,510
Then you don't care if we kill her or not.

945
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:11,971
I don't care.

946
01:13:12,263 --> 01:13:15,057
Then let's talk again after we kill her.

947
01:13:15,558 --> 01:13:16,684
Hold on.

948
01:13:18,686 --> 01:13:20,730
Why would you kill an innocent woman?

949
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:22,940
Her family is powerful.

950
01:13:23,024 --> 01:13:25,985
You will get wiped out
if you lay a finger on her.

951
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:29,780
We aren't afraid of such things.

952
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:32,074
You have an hour.

953
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:34,619
Come to the address in the text.

954
01:13:34,702 --> 01:13:36,454
Otherwise, this woman dies.

955
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:39,123
If you bring help, this woman dies.

956
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:40,708
I am sure you know as much.

957
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:44,795
Hello? Hello?

958
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:07,735
Hang up another IV fluid bag

959
01:14:07,818 --> 01:14:09,612
and check her vital signs again.

960
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:12,531
Ms. Yoon. Ms. Yoon.

961
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:20,539
I had a dream.

962
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:32,134
Chairwoman Yoon,
the next item on your schedule is

963
01:14:32,218 --> 01:14:34,053
the final test of the extreme sportswear.

964
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:36,764
Will you really do it yourself?

965
01:14:37,848 --> 01:14:39,016
I mean paragliding.

966
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:41,477
SE-RI'S CHOICE SPORTSWEAR

967
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:44,021
In my dream,

968
01:14:44,605 --> 01:14:48,359
I went back to the day of the accident.

969
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:49,902
Chairwoman Yoon?

970
01:15:19,724 --> 01:15:21,642
In my dream,

971
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:25,229
I knew everything.

972
01:15:26,063 --> 01:15:27,857
I knew

973
01:15:28,274 --> 01:15:30,276
what kind of an accident I would have

974
01:15:31,068 --> 01:15:33,362
and where I would crash land.

975
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:35,656
I knew who I would meet

976
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:39,869
and what scary and difficult experiences
I would have.

977
01:15:40,995 --> 01:15:42,371
I also knew

978
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:45,624
this day would come in the end.

979
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:47,710
I knew everything.

980
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:49,420
What?

981
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:51,589
Okay.

982
01:15:56,594 --> 01:15:57,970
Yoon Se-ri

983
01:15:59,346 --> 01:16:00,681
is in a critical condition.

984
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:13,611
WAITING ROOM

985
01:16:54,902 --> 01:16:55,986
BOARDING TIME 11:30 A.M.

986
01:18:00,885 --> 01:18:02,553
Stay still.

987
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:19,653
Gu Seung-jun!

988
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:26,452
Seo Dan, don't worry.

989
01:18:27,161 --> 01:18:29,747
I learned clay target shooting
in South Korea.

990
01:18:56,190 --> 01:18:57,566
Gu Seung-jun!

991
01:19:10,537 --> 01:19:11,956
I was wrong.

992
01:19:13,123 --> 01:19:14,667
When I die,

993
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:18,212
there is someone who cries for me.

994
01:19:19,213 --> 01:19:21,006
The fact you are that person

995
01:19:22,216 --> 01:19:25,427
makes me sad and happy.

996
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:37,982
At the end of that long dream,

997
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:41,944
I finally made a choice.

998
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:07,970
The wind is quite strong though.

999
01:20:08,053 --> 01:20:10,472
We've checked the weather forecast,
but will you be all right?

1000
01:20:10,556 --> 01:20:13,058
Mr. Hong. Why does the wind blow?

1001
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:15,144
Well, I'm not sure.

1002
01:20:17,396 --> 01:20:18,897
It's blowing to move on.

1003
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,529
It's blowing to move on,

1004
01:20:26,613 --> 01:20:28,741
not to stay.

1005
01:20:30,951 --> 01:20:32,995
The wind needs to keep moving

1006
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:35,748
for me to fly.

1007
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:40,002
In order to meet you,

1008
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:43,297
I made a choice
to relive all of those moments

1009
01:20:44,298 --> 01:20:46,300
from the very start.

1010
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:49,928
Inject Epinephrine through the IV line.

1011
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:51,430
Yes, Doctor.

1012
01:20:52,473 --> 01:20:54,391
Even if I turn back time

1013
01:20:55,142 --> 01:20:56,685
100 times...

1014
01:20:57,436 --> 01:20:59,396
If I can turn back time...

1015
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:01,732
If only I can do that,

1016
01:21:02,483 --> 01:21:04,610
I wouldn't meet you.

1017
01:21:04,985 --> 01:21:06,695
You wouldn't get to know me.

1018
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:10,991
Then you would be safe and happy.

1019
01:21:11,825 --> 01:21:13,327
If only I can do that...

1020
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:15,996
I would meet you again.

1021
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:18,415
I would get to know you

1022
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:20,667
and fall in love.

1023
01:21:21,585 --> 01:21:24,421
I knew that I would make

1024
01:21:25,756 --> 01:21:27,299
that dangerous and sad choice.

1025
01:21:27,383 --> 01:21:29,051
AMBULANCE

1026
01:21:35,265 --> 01:21:38,769
If one of us must die

1027
01:21:39,186 --> 01:21:41,271
while the other lives on...

1028
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:45,609
If that's fate,

1029
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:48,487
it's only right

1030
01:21:48,862 --> 01:21:52,324
that I die and you live on.

1031
01:21:54,368 --> 01:21:55,994
It's only right.

1032
01:22:04,253 --> 01:22:05,879
I was happy

1033
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:10,551
to make that choice, Ri Jeong Hyeok.

1034
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:25,417
Is that all?

1035
01:23:26,335 --> 01:23:29,004
Oh, psychologists analyzed

1036
01:23:29,087 --> 01:23:30,839
Ri Jeong Hyeok's behavioral patterns

1037
01:23:30,923 --> 01:23:32,382
towards Yoon Se-ri.

1038
01:23:32,508 --> 01:23:34,051
The results are in.

1039
01:23:34,134 --> 01:23:35,135
Okay.

1040
01:23:35,219 --> 01:23:36,470
Here.

1041
01:23:40,807 --> 01:23:43,477
As you can see,
when Ri Jeong Hyeok is with Yoon Se-ri,

1042
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:44,853
the center of his torso

1043
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:47,272
faces Yoon Se-ri 90 percent of times.

1044
01:23:48,982 --> 01:23:53,362
Ri Jeong Hyeok mirrored her gestures
without thinking many times.

1045
01:24:00,953 --> 01:24:02,454
When men came near her,

1046
01:24:02,538 --> 01:24:04,998
he blocked her attention and movements

1047
01:24:05,082 --> 01:24:06,416
repeatedly.

1048
01:24:10,212 --> 01:24:12,130
An expert of psychology,
Professor Oh Hyeong-sim,

1049
01:24:12,214 --> 01:24:14,091
analyzed that these are
the common behaviors

1050
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:18,804
-of a man who is in love. These--
-You need an analysis to see that?

1051
01:24:19,972 --> 01:24:21,765
It's as clear as day.

1052
01:24:23,392 --> 01:24:24,685
For goodness' sake.

1053
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:13,108
