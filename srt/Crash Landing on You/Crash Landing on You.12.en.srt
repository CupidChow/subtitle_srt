00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,970
ALL CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND BACKGROUND ARE FICTITIOUS

PARKING MANAGEMENT OFFICE

3
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,651
PARKING MANAGEMENT OFFICE

4
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,079
No.

PARKING MANAGEMENT OFFICE

00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:32,402
RI JEONG HYEOK

7
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,659
Why aren't you answering my calls?

8
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,035
Ri Jeong Hyeok.

9
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,580
It's good

10
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,207
to see you in South Korea.

11
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,961
I didn't think you would actually come.
I am impressed.

12
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,633
I am with Yoon Se-ri right now.

13
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:01,097
You know that
neither one of us can call the police.

14
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,224
I can't wait long.

15
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,268
Stay on the phone and come now.

16
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:05,245
If you try something funny,
I will put a bullet in this woman's head.

17
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,332
Look ahead and walk.

18
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,503
If you touch a hair on her head,

19
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,797
I will kill you.

20
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,009
LIGHT CONTROL PANEL

21
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,739
Hey, Cho Cheol Gang!

22
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,700
Enough telling porky.

23
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,495
He's lying,

24
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,580
and he has a gun.

25
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,458
I'm okay, so run away.

26
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,170
Why is the light off?

27
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,797
I know. Is the building blacked out?

28
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,217
We should go down.
Where's the machine room?

29
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,719
The machine room?

30
00:05:56,272 --> 00:06:00,943
Make sure to investigate
how he got to join our security team.

31
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,405
And restaff the night shift team

32
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,824
so the same thing never happens again.

33
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,451
No.

34
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,703
You don't have to report to the police.

35
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,664
Send me the CCTV footage.

36
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:16,334
Make sure it doesn't leak.

37
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,171
Oh, right. Did you find my phone?

38
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:23,007
I did, but it seems
to have been run over by a car.

39
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,176
It's damaged,
so I don't think you can use it.

40
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,553
Okay. Let's talk more about it tomorrow.

41
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,014
How is it?

42
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:33,726
It's nothing serious.
It's just a slight cut.

43
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,437
I took care of it.

44
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,147
By the way, who is he?

45
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,775
Well, he's just...

46
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,444
Anyway, thank you for doing this.

47
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,572
I guess you know what I'm about to say.

48
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,075
Please make sure to keep it a secret.

49
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,003
So there's a guy?

50
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:02,672
Yes.

51
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,225
Good. She's dumber than I thought.

52
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,269
Dating at a time like this?

53
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,603
But...

54
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:21,232
why did she get him treated at her place
instead of a hospital?

55
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,568
Has Se-ri ever

56
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,237
taken her date home before?

57
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,837
It's not been long
since you got shot in the shoulder.

58
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,423
And now you're stabbed?

59
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,801
It's just a graze.
You don't have to do this--

60
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:49,886
No.

61
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,597
I have to do this.

62
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:54,682
And...

63
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:58,686
I just can't believe
Cho Cheol Gang, that crazy jerk

64
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:02,398
got a job in my company
with a fake ID to do things like this.

65
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,150
I just can't forgive him.

66
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:07,528
I couldn't do anything up in North,
but things are different here.

67
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,371
You protected me.

68
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:19,749
It must've been terrifying.

69
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,084
You're grateful, aren't you?

70
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,045
Then...

71
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:28,674
don't go anywhere
until the wound heals up.

72
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,094
Only until it heals.

73
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,305
Just promise me this.

74
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,682
Once it heals,

75
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,228
even if you disappear into the blue,

76
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,359
I'll just accept it.

77
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,703
In Gangsan-ri, Cheorwon-gun,
Gangwon Province,

78
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,622
an underground tunnel was found
around a cave

79
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,624
where pickled shrimp is kept in.

80
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,626
According to the first investigation,

81
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,670
the tunnel is assumed

82
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:08,714
to be connected to the abandoned mine

83
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,926
in Jeungsan-ri, Cheorwon-gun,
Gangwon Privince in North Korea

84
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,845
which is 9,296 meters away from the cave.

85
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,848
For the development purpose...

86
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,183
Welcome.

87
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,952
Ms. Yoon, are you sure it'll be okay?
This place is a little...

88
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:39,537
Don't worry.

89
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,163
I'm a woman

90
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,249
who has

91
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,543
gone through

92
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,838
hell

93
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,133
and high water.

94
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,845
And Seoul is my turf.

95
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:35,885
Hello.

96
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:41,641
Tenants of Unit 25-1, 25-2, and 25-3.

97
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:46,395
As you've probably hard,
I've acquired the ownership

98
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,065
of the buildings you are living in
as of today.

99
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,361
-What?
-What did she say?

100
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,362
She looks pretty.

101
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:57,948
And I have

102
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:01,577
a little surprise for you.

103
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,412
A week ago,

104
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:07,625
a bunch of gentlemen from around here
who are fluent in both Korean and Chinese

105
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,877
got in a fight
with a peculiarly handsome gentleman.

106
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,255
I believe you all are
well aware of the incident.

107
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:15,508
We don't know.

108
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,635
What are you trying to say?

109
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,428
You don't know?

110
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:23,015
How can you not know about it
there were knives flying around?

111
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,184
Chinese?

112
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,936
How does she speak Chinese?

113
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,814
I'm waiting for tip-offs about the people.

114
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,816
About who is behind it.

115
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,820
The one person who gets me
the conclusive evidence

116
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:39,365
won't have to pay the monthly rents
and maintenance fees

117
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,200
from now on.

118
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,203
-Seriously?
-Is it free?

119
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,454
And...

120
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,296
Take a close look at the picture.

121
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,217
The person who finds out this guy
will be rewarded.

122
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:03,514
The sooner, the bigger
the money you can get.

123
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,269
-Who is he?
-Bye.

124
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:09,812
Have you seen this guy?

125
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:10,938
No.

126
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:11,981
Where can we find him?

127
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,316
Hey, brother.

128
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,777
-Help me look for a guy.
-I'll give you a photo.

129
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,614
That was impressive.

130
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:23,409
You didn't even seem intimidated.

131
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,453
I always pay back.

132
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,913
Whether it's kindness or grudge.

133
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,583
Speaking of which,

134
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,461
about your friend you talked about

135
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,087
who takes care of my insurance.

136
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,381
You mean Su-chan?

137
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,555
I'm so happy for her.

138
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,729
We won't exercise the right to indemnity,

139
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:55,232
but we couldn't take your name
off the layoff list.

140
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,695
Now that Ms. Yoon Se-ri is alive,
I thought it would be okay.

141
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,740
But the people above want
to do it as planned.

142
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,617
What can I do?

143
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:06,869
I should do as I'm told.

144
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:08,412
I'm sorry.

145
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,337
Hello, Mr. Park Su-chan.

146
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,256
Do you not know me?

147
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,427
I'm the Ewa Wisniewska of Korea,

148
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,680
Yoon Se-ri.

149
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:35,064
I heard what you had done for me
while I was gone.

150
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,827
We should search around the DMZ.

151
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:53,082
Chang-sik, look into these materials.
It's too soon to give up.

152
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,044
Let's see if there are more
deserted islands in the West Sea.

153
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,672
There must be more. Ms. Yoon is alive.

154
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,632
I'm a complete stranger to you.

155
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,303
I know you wanted me to come back alive

156
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,846
more than anyone else.

157
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:13,435
No, it's nothing.
I just did it for my sake.

158
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,230
I didn't come here
to express my gratitude to you.

159
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:21,026
While I was missing, you made an average

160
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,947
of 37 calls a day to Mr. Hong.

161
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,659
Well. Yes. I had things to tell him.

162
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:31,620
And you sent hundreds
of text messages and emails.

163
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,831
I had some materials to send him.

164
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,750
The obsession made you find it out.

165
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:38,878
Se-ri one's voice.

166
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,839
This is Se-ri one. This is Se-ri one.

167
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,801
Did you hear that? What do you think?
Do you think it's her voice?

168
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,012
Yes, I think it's her voice.

169
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,638
Right? It's her voice, right?

170
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,558
Right. I was really happy back then.

171
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,352
I admire the obsession.

172
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,645
So I was thinking

173
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,649
-about offering you a job.
-What?

174
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,736
I know you are doing well
in your current job now.

175
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,947
No, it's not like that.

176
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,741
Actually I just got fired--

177
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,743
I'll give you three times your salary.

178
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,539
With a lot of incentives.
What do you think?

179
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,834
I'd love that, Ms. Yoon.

180
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,254
Thank you, Ms. Yoon.

181
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,007
I should thank you, Mr. Park Su-chan.

182
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:41,023
You can make coffee with this here
instead of a cauldron.

NO ENTRY

184

He reached her a lot quicker
than I thought.

00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:02,438
Hunting Dog got a job at Se-ri's Choice
through the security subcontractor.

189
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:06,275
The CEO of NVD Security was
once the target of his keeping business.

190
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,986
Cho Cheol Gang harbored criminals

191
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,697
from South Korea
and other countries for money.

192
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,408
And now he's receiving their help here.

193
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,661
He is cleverer and more tenacious
than I thought.

194
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,913
Now that he knows I'm here,

195
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,874
he won't make any rash actions.

196
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,959
But he'll soon come up with another way.

00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,620
Let's talk about today's achievements.

201
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,288
-Okay.
-Okay.

202
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,082
I'll go first.

203
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:09,129
Today, in order to find out
how Ms. Yoon Se-ri is doing...

204
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,302
-Why don't we eat meat?
-I love meat.

205
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:16,970
Rice with stir-fried pork?

206
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:21,058
I lied in wait at Yoon Se-ri's office
where she often shows up

207
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,476
trying to collect news.

208
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,771
Gosh, it's really shocking.

209
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:29,399
I know. I'm really curious
what is going to happen.

210
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,443
Gosh, let's go.

211
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,413
Listening in on people's conversations,

212
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,250
I got a lot of useful inside information

213
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,129
that only the company officials
would know.

214
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,676
Ms. Yoon, I think you've changed a lot.

215
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:56,969
What? What do you mean?

216
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,721
You used to eat alone all the time.

217
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,102
I realized I have a better appetite
when I eat with others.

218
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,520
I didn't know that before.

219
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:14,111
By the way, Ms. Yoon.
Who are you texting this whole time?

220
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,405
Could it be that

221
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,198
you're dating?

222
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,367
No.

223
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,036
-I see.
-I see.

224
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,290
You're not.

225
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,584
How silly of me
to say something like that.

226
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,877
Of course you're not.

227
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,797
Mr. No from the marketing team

228
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,716
and Ms. Yang from the overseas sales team

229
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,218
turned out to be dating.

230
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,053
-What?
-What?

231
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:44,099
But Mr. No's wife sent an anonymous letter
to the company.

232
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,435
Is Mr. No married?

233
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,436
Yes.

234
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,690
So the soap operas aren't so absurd.

235
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,068
Is that what you found out?

236
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,738
And it wasn't that simple.

237
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:01,700
It turns out Ms. Yang wasn't
the only woman Mr. No has been dating.

238
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,452
My goodness.

239
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,580
So I made a list.

240
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:13,962
I guess Mr. No's wife has had enough.

241
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,215
-I agree.
-Me too.

242
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,508
Why were you listening to all that?

243
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,720
It has nothing to do with Yoon Se-ri.

244
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:26,225
I thought they might talk about her
at the end of the conversation.

245
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,602
So I couldn't leave the place.

246
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,814
So you've been talking for quite long,

247
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:36,276
but you ended up with nothing.
Is that what you're saying?

248
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:41,490
What about you, Chi Su?
What is it you have achieved?

249
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,002
Is it money?

250
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,256
I went to Gangnam,
the heart of capitalism,

251
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,758
and extorted money from our enemies.

252
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,177
You said you'd go to Cheongdam-dong

253
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,554
and look for Se-ri's house.

254
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,808
That's like looking
for a needle in a haystack.

255
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:12,771
So I came up with a plan
to narrow things down.

256
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:13,814
What plan?

257
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:18,902
Yoon Se-ri always said she eats meat

258
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,113
for two meals out of three a day.

259
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:25,284
Meat refers to that of land animals,
so it's either beef, pork or chicken.

260
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,576
-Yes.
-That's right.

261
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:31,331
So I decided to go with chicken

262
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:36,128
and wait around the most famous
chicken restaurant in the neighborhood.

263
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:41,591
Gosh,

264
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:45,429
it does smell amazing.

265
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,854
I was just standing there.

266
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,857
But someone gave me his car key.

267
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,527
I guess that's because
I give off a reliable impression.

268
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,945
Valet parking?

269
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,573
-Valet...
-Keep the change.

270
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,033
Wait...

271
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,328
Hello. Please park my car.

272
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,539
You are the valet, aren't you?

273
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,666
Here you go.

274
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,189
Who are you?

275
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,734
So there was a misunderstanding.

276
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:43,195
The valet didn't come to work today,

277
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,197
so I was surprised
that someone was parking.

278
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,240
I'm sorry.

279
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:52,871
Actually, we're short of hands today.
So I was looking for someone.

280
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,915
Do you drive a motorcycle?

281
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:56,833
A motorcycle?

282
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,421
I learned it as I started walking.

283
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,547
So?

284
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,133
Did you deliver chickens?

285
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,511
Think about it.

286
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:11,014
Delivering chickens door to door,

287
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:15,977
I might end up Se-ri's place
since she's crazy about meat.

288
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,270
Gosh.

289
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:21,399
So what? Did you get to deliver
chicken to Se-ri's place?

290
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:28,782
I delivered chickens
to a lot of places today.

291
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:30,617
-Yeong-bae.
-Yes.

292
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:34,371
Half fried and half seasoned
to Building 1, Unit 203, Gaenari Mansion.

293
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:35,622
Okay.

294
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,339
The first day isn't easy, is it?

295
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:46,716
You can eat this and get some rest
until the next order.

296
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:50,470
Okay. Thank you.

297
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,663
EVERYTHING IS GOOD AT BBQ CHICKEN

298
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,718
Let me take a break for just one minute.

299
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,948
So did you find her place or not?

300
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,242
I guess

301
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,745
she ate beef today.

302
00:24:56,828 --> 00:25:01,249
But I think she might eat chicken
at least once in three days.

303
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,627
So you got nothing just like me.

304
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:11,051
You two said you would
carry out your duty in an Internet cafe,

305
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,803
South Korea's storehouse of information.

306
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,139
Ju Meok, how did it go?

307
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,767
Since this is our first day,

308
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,311
we focused on understanding
the circumstances and systems.

309
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:24,731
We also tried to analyze
the sentiment of South Koreans

310
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,983
-to find out their feelings.
-You watched dramas.

311
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:30,487
Yes.

312
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:37,035
Oh no.

313
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:40,288
No, Dae-gil. My goodness.

314
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,583
You can't die like this.

315
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,170
Gosh.

316
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,934

00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,697

00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,600
PLEASE ESCAPE DANGER ZONE

329
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:35,195
I won't let this slide, Desperate Effort.

330
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,325
Jeong Hyeok.

331
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:45,705
Where are you going?

332
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,375
Well...

333
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,086
I need to go meet someone.

334
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,755
Why? Are you going to...

335
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:55,840
No.

336
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,760
Anyway, you can't go out.

337
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,012
The cut hasn't healed yet.

338
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,264
It's too dangerous to go out.

339
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:07,143
Isn't Exit Three of Cheongdam Station
close from here?

340
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,854
It is close, but...

341
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:14,025
He's not dangerous.
I just need to give him a good talking.

342
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,403
Hang on.

343
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:21,074
I think I got a text message earlier.

344
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:24,244
You purchased an item in a game?

345
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:29,207
I'll be out for a moment then.

346
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:30,917
It will take about 15 minutes.

347
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,796
Stop right there.

348
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,681
You played a video game?

349
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,851
You told me to use
the computer when I'm bored.

350
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:49,936
Yes, I did.

351
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,646
But...

352
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,275
You're a level four wizard already?

353
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:58,737
Actually I'm distinguished
in many different spheres.

354
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,448
Once I got the hang of it,
I couldn't stop myself.

355
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:07,454
You bought a lot of items.

356
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,373
I'm a wizard, you know.

357
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:13,418
To rule the battlefield
and accumulate experience points,

358
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:16,713
environmental and combo buffs are a must.

359
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:20,175
Also, to patrol the battle area
and survive in pit fights,

360
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,010
I needed some guardians as well.

361
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,722
Farming dungeons
just wasn't enough, time-wise.

362
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:31,060
Anyway, it was an arduous battle.

363
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,270
I see.

364
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:36,816
Then you should get some rest
after such a tiring battle.

365
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,734
Where are you going?

366
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,326
"Let's MF?"

367
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,580
What does that mean, Jeong Hyeok?

368
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:55,126
I also didn't know what it stands for,
so I looked it up.

369
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,254
It means "Let's meet up and fight."

370
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:04,219
So are you going out to meet up
the player and fight now?

371
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,221
At Exit Three of Cheongdam Station?

372
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,680
It's not like that.

373
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,974
He hurts other people's feelings
with violent words

374
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:11,976
and shows threatening behaviors.

375
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,813
I need to give him a good scolding
and teach him a lesson.

376
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,231
Take off your jacket.

377
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:25,782
Sit.

378
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,542
He must be waiting for me now.

379
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,594
CHEONGDAM STATION

380
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:57,355
I knew it.

381
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:01,109
Tomato Cultivator is a coward.

382
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:05,572
CHEONGDAM STATION

383
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,460
I set the computer in kids' mode.

384
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:22,839
You can't access to gaming sites
and adult sites.

385
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:25,800
From today, you can use
the Internet only two hours a day.

386
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:30,638
Excessive gaming can be very dangerous
to a competitive guy like you, you know.

387
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,433
Gosh, this is just too much.

388
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,767
No, it's not.

389
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,061
-Yes, it is.
-No, it isn't.

390
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,230
I told you to collect information,

391
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:42,859
but you just had some fight with a guy
named Tomato Cultivator or something?

392
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:44,944
I'm sorry.

393
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,362
My gosh.

394
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:48,114
What about you, Gwang Beom?

395
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:51,743
I was going to look around
the neighborhood in Cheongdam-dong.

396
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,622
But I ran into unexpected difficulties.

397
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,248
What's wrong?

398
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:00,001
Every time I took a step,
people approached me...

399
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,588
and gave me stuff like this.

400
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,340
What are these?

401
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:07,967
SN?

402
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:10,553
YJ?

403
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,263
JYB?

404
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,015
What codes are these?

405
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,351
What did they say giving this to you?

406
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,980
Do you belong to any agency?

407
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:24,817
You are the person we were looking for.

408
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,904
The person they were looking for?

409
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,365
Are they from the NIS?

410
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,867
Gwang Beom, did you blow your cover?

411
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:37,413
I don't look like a foreigner, so I can
mingle freely with South Koreans anywhere.

412
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:41,459
But I guess you have a bit
of up North about you.

413
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,336
I'm sorry.

414
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,759
Make sure to wear a mask
and drop your eyes

415
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,761
when you go out.

416
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:52,762
Okay.

417
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:55,515
I knew it wouldn't be easy,
but it's a lot harder

418
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,809
to meet these two than I thought.

419
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,268
I agree.

420
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,896
It's not easy at all.

421
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,274
Our budget's running low, too.

422
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,947
We got the news from
Lieutenant Commander Cho.

423
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,616
He says he saw
Ri Jeong Hyeok in South Korea.

424
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,411
He will soon contact Yoon Se-ri's family

425
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:20,039
and bring her here
to reveal the whole thing.

426
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:24,752
You know what? If something goes wrong,

427
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,963
I might end up getting implicated
in the matter.

428
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:32,176
I'm sure Director of the General Political
Bureau is aware of this situation.

429
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:37,515
Don't make any rash moves
before things become clearer.

430
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:38,433
Yes, sir.

431
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,402
AL

432
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:54,490
Why are you still up?

433
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,075
Dan.

434
00:33:57,243 --> 00:34:00,329
There's been no electricity here
the whole day.

435
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:01,456
That's good.

436
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,667
It must be dark there.
Just keep quiet and go to sleep.

437
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:09,255
It's really cold here, and I'm sick.

438
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:11,549
I can't even charge my phone,
so the battery--

439
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,107
Darn it.

440
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,654
If it's a lie, I'll make him regret this.

441
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:06,771
Gu Seung-jun?

442
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,064
Yes?

443
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:11,275
-My goodness. What's...
-Gosh.

444
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,406
What are you doing here?

445
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,743
What does it look like? I'm dying here.

446
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:23,996
My eyes are sore.

447
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:39,011
I can't believe this. I can see my breath.

448
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,462
Get up.

449
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,637
No, it's cold.

450
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,395
You can't hit a patient.

451
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,112
Did you cook porridge for me?

452
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:40,239
Thank you.

453
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:50,082
If you looked around a bit,
you could have found a furnace

454
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,667
and firewood.

455
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:55,296
Who would have thought there would be
a furnace at an apartment?

456
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:04,597
Gosh, this porridge is something else.

457
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,682
Is it

458
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,392
that good?

459
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,311
It's so salty.

460
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,397
No, it's fine.

461
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,817
I might look like
I've been well-off all my life,

462
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:21,697
but I have a story you cannot listen to
without shedding tears.

463
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:26,244
This porridge reminds me of the days
I lived on salty porridge.

464
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,663
Is that one of your porkies again?

465
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,083
-What?
-Did you think I had no idea

466
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,253
what kind of person you were down South?

467
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,757
Why do you want to read this?

468
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,008
Well,

469
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,135
to kill some time.

470
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:46,013
After Se-ri broke off the engagement
with you,

471
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:49,225
you ran away with the overseas fund from
her second-oldest brother's company.

472
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:52,603
A British businessman, Gu.

473
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,564
That's you, isn't it?

474
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:59,568
Goodness, you're good
at gathering information, too.

475
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,571
You are indeed the perfect woman.

476
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:05,700
If you're also trying to con me,
quit dreaming.

477
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,160
I didn't dream about that.

478
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,578
When I tasted this,

479
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:14,542
I was truly reminded of the old days

480
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,962
and the last dinner I had

481
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,047
with my family.

482
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:24,802
My father was conned
by someone he trusted,

483
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:26,595
so he lost his company.

484
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:29,348
And we ended up emigrating to the UK.

485
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,516
I had

486
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,145
the hardest time with the local food.

487
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:38,232
Nothing tasted good,
and we didn't have much money.

488
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,569
One day, for dinner,

489
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,405
we ate porridge

490
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,283
with just salt in it.

491
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:51,120
And was that the last dinner
you had with your family?

492
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:56,167
My father passed away shortly after,
and my mother remarried.

493
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,086
And I went to a boarding school.

494
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:02,590
You saw what happened to your dad
when he was conned.

495
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,968
Why did you con other people?

496
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:07,636
I want to say

497
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,848
that I was taking my revenge.

498
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,062
Then,

499
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:20,983
the people responsible
for ruining your father's business

500
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,861
is Se-ri's family?

501
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:26,447
Right.

502
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,532
So

503
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:31,369
I wanted to put everything
back to its place.

504
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:35,581
At first, I wanted to be his son-in-law,

505
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:40,378
so I could penetrate into my enemy camp
like the Trojan Horse.

506
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,630
I won't fall for you.

507
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,049
I can see everything.

508
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:49,428
You're just laying the groundwork now
for a bigger purpose.

509
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:53,140
It looks like you want to marry me
so you can have it all.

510
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,518
And I don't think it will happen.

511
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,729
I grew up in a tough family,

512
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,564
so I have very sharp eyes.

513
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:04,360
Take some pocket money
from my brother and wrap it up.

514
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,988
I failed because Se-ri was too smart.

515
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:13,077
But his brothers were not as smart,
so I had a shot.

516
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:18,499
Her second-oldest brother
was especially greedy.

517
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,544
Winning greedy people

518
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,921
is the easiest in the world.

519
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,507
At first,

520
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:30,594
I thought that getting back the money
my dad lost including the interest

521
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,806
would be a proper revenge.

522
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:34,890
Go on.

523
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:38,769
Since my dad was conned,
it's only fair to take my revenge,

524
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:41,564
but for some reason, it didn't feel good.

525
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,191
It only gave me a headache.

526
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,111
Someone once told me

527
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:51,240
that becoming happy is true revenge.

528
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,826
So wouldn't giving back all of the money

529
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,872
and living a happy life
without any burdens

530
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,624
be my true revenge, Ms. Seo?

531
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,251
Who told you such nonsense?

532
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:07,339
If someone made me cry,

533
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:11,343
I should make that person bleed in tears.
That's true revenge.

534
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,012
You are awesome indeed.

535
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:16,182
When will you take your revenge
if you lounge around like a weakling?

536
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:19,268
You should focus
on getting your energy back,

537
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:22,521
so you can go back to South Korea
and ruin her family down to the ground!

538
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:27,234
Are you telling me that I should take
my revenge or that you will?

539
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,153
Hey.

540
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,783
What? That's alcohol.

541
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,119
Wait. No!

542
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,180
Jeong Hyeok,
what are you doing there all by yourself?

543
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,728
Do you want one?

544
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:06,732
Sure. But I don't want a beer.
I want something else.

545
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,115
I'm getting drunk.

546
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,119
Are you drunk?

547
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,372
Totally.

548
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:24,959
I'm glad.

549
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:27,586
You're glad?

550
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,672
If you're really drunk,

551
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,967
I would like to say something.

552
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:37,179
Like what? What do you want to say?

553
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,430
That I'm pretty?

554
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:40,558
No.

555
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:43,394
How could you be so firm
even when you're drunk?

556
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:44,728
Then, what?

557
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,108
That I

558
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,403
don't want to go back.

559
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:57,116
I don't want to go back.

560
00:42:58,617 --> 00:42:59,994
I just want

561
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,122
to stay here with you.

562
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:08,919
I think I'm about to sober up.

563
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:11,213
What?

564
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,007
But you can't.

565
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,472
I didn't sober up.

566
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:22,891
Keep going.

567
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,353
I'm totally drunk right now.

568
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:30,399
When I sober up from this,
I won't be able to remember a thing.

569
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:32,151
So

570
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:36,071
just tell me everything
you want to tell me.

571
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:40,868
I want

572
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:46,332
to marry you here

573
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,960
and have a child who takes after you, too.

574
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:52,755
I like girls.

575
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,426
I like

576
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:58,636
twins.

577
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:02,890
What? Twins? I'm about to sober up again.

578
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,225
I hope you won't.

579
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,145
Okay.

580
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,272
Keep going.

581
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:14,109
What else do you want to do with me?

582
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:20,908
I'll play

583
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,204
the piano again.

584
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:29,291
You should.

585
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,794
You must.

586
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,213
I'll organize a piano concert for you.

587
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:37,549
Given your talent,
you can perform at Seoul Arts Center.

588
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:40,761
Hold on.

589
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:43,514
Should I just buy Seoul Arts Center?

590
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,058
I think I'll be able to buy it.

591
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:47,976
You're really drunk.

592
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,937
I'm totally drunk.

593
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,731
I don't think
I'll never sober up from this.

594
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:56,610
I want to see you

595
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,572
with gray hair

596
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:03,575
and wrinkles.

597
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,453
You growing old.

598
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,499
You'll still be pretty, right?

599
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:17,423
Of course.

600
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,968
I'm going to grow old very slowly.

601
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:23,512
If you want to see that,

602
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:27,724
you'll have to stay by my side
for a very long time.

603
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:32,813
I should.

604
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,318
Jeong Hyeok,

605
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:42,448
you can stay by my side
for a very long time,

606
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:45,826
but you shouldn't drink with other people.

607
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,453
What?

608
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:50,372
I found you way more attractive
when you're drunk.

609
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:53,459
The thought of other women
seeing you drunk like this

610
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:57,463
will make me so insecure
that I won't be able to sleep soundly.

611
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,382
Let's settle
that you'll only drink at home.

612
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,093
Let's do that.

613
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,636
You'll only drink at home, okay?

614
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:07,931
Promise me.

615
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,727
Stamp on it.

616
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,646
Copied and laminated.

617
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:43,926
Dan.

618
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:53,977
Did Dan not come home last night?

619
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:58,857
Gosh, my head hurts.

620
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,068
Goodness.

621
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:12,454
She was so determined
to finish the bottle yesterday.

622
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,707
How can she sleep this soundly

623
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,377
next to a con man?

624
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:20,796
Just how reckless is she?

625
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,539
The person you have reached
is not available.

626
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:56,707
She's not answering?

627
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,337
Myeong Seok.

628
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:04,214
Yes. Go on.

629
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:06,008
In my life,

630
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:10,220
I have never fully experienced
your influence as a one-star general.

631
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,806
This is your chance.

632
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:14,850
Show me a glimpse of your power.

633
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:15,767
What?

634
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:17,519
How?

635
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:24,318
Find out everything you know
about that guy, Alberto.

636
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,237
Okay.

637
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,448
You got it.

638
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:40,292
By the way, shouldn't we
go visit her at least once?

639
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:47,799
It's been several days that
Ms. Ma stopped coming outside her house.

640
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,137
What's your plan?

641
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:56,391
What if we visit a wife
whose husband has been arrested

642
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:57,976
and get the short end of the stick?

643
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:04,691
You have a point. We don't know
when the rest of the family

644
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,526
might get arrested.

645
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:08,445
It is dangerous to visit her.

646
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:12,866
Even so, I haven't seen her
for several days.

647
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:16,495
I don't even know if she has
enough firewood or food at her house.

648
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:21,917
Listen up.

649
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:27,756
The State Security Department
is watching them like a hawk.

650
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,801
If you visit her at her house

651
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:34,012
and get arrested along with the family,

652
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:36,973
I cannot help you as the group leader.

653
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:40,686
So you should behave yourselves.

654
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,312
-Okay.
-Okay.

655
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:12,092
Are you ready?

656
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:18,640
Jeong Hyeok, you look dashing today.

657
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:22,269
You said there was a big event today.

658
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:24,563
And there will be a big crowd.

659
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:28,984
Right. So that's why
I need my bodyguard glued to me.

660
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:36,074
Wait. This is the watch.

661
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:37,576
What watch?

662
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:40,454
I told you about this watch.

663
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,789
There was a really nice men's watch
at the pawnshop.

664
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,207
Are you listening to me?

665
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,919
People here don't listen to me.

666
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:50,881
I lost your present immediately
after buying it that day, though.

667
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:53,467
It was a really nice vintage watch.

668
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,469
Was this the watch you were talking about?

669
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:56,928
Yes.

670
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:59,681
Where did you get this watch?

671
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,850
I can't believe this.

672
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:08,940
You also saved me without realizing it.

673
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,067
I did?

674
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:16,531
Did I save you like how you saved me?

675
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:19,034
You did.

676
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:28,668
ANOTHER CHOICE FROM SE-RI'S CHOICE

677
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,378
SE-RI'S CHOICE DEBUTS AT AN EXHIBIT HALL

678
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:31,963
This is

679
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:36,635
our golden opportunity, since Se-ri

680
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,805
will show up at this event no matter what.

681
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,850
But what if we go without a plan
and get kicked out just like last time?

682
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:48,939
Don't you think we should dress up
like South Korean men?

683
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,821
KITCHEN AND BATH: HOME AND LIVING

684
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:11,044
It's been a while
since I spoke in front of a crowd.

685
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:12,087
So I'm nervous.

686
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:14,798
How do I look?

687
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:18,093
-You look splendid.
-Really?

688
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:21,012
You don't look nervous at all.

689
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,932
Don't worry. Just talk to them.

690
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,309
All right, everyone.

691
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:28,562
To commence today's event,

692
00:52:29,145 --> 00:52:32,858
I present the lady of Se-ri's Choice
who returned to us miraculously.

693
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:36,403
I give you Chairwoman Yoon Se-ri.

694
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,006
We have been preparing to launch

695
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:59,134
Interior Choice by Se-ri's Choice
for a long time.

696
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,636
And now, it has finally begun.

697
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,181
I would like to thank everyone
who came here

698
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:07,684
to celebrate this with me.

699
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:09,769
I'm sure my disappearance

700
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:12,606
must have made you feel uncomfortable.

701
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,608
I will work harder

702
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:16,735
as much as I have caused you to worry.

703
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:20,822
Thanks to you,
our company was able to grow

704
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,782
and make a lot of money.

705
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:27,162
So I sent you all a present.

706
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:30,498
Now.

707
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:40,675
It's a special bonus.

708
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:43,178
Thank you for your hard work.

709
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:55,774
All right. Let's open the shop

710
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,859
and start selling.

711
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:59,235
-Yes!
-Yes!

712
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:00,820
I'll work hard!

713
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:39,859
No one will say anything about our looks
now that we dressed up.

714
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,903
We just need to watch our language here.

715
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:44,990
Down here south,
rich people often say this.

716
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:49,160
"How much? How much do you need?"

717
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:50,620
Really?

718
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:54,082
So I just need to be tenacious
in asking the prices, right?

719
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:55,166
Yes.

720
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,670
That doesn't sound that hard.

721
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:02,382
March forward.

722
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:07,804
How much is this?

723
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:10,807
It's 3,710,000 won.

724
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:17,647
If that's the price for the table,
a long sofa, and a chair,

725
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:19,733
it's reasonable.

726
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,151
That's the price for one chair.

727
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:25,947
I see.

728
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:27,907
But it's still reasonable.

729
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:30,160
This is the last one we have in stock.

730
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,870
Would you like to buy it?

731
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:34,122
Sure. I ought to.

732
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:39,461
Before I make a decision,
I would like to meet with the chairwoman

733
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:41,379
of this company.

734
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,882
-Pardon?
-I just had

735
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:46,176
a few questions about the product.

736
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:48,762
You can ask me those questions.

737
00:55:57,645 --> 00:55:59,439
I'd like to buy this.

738
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:02,233
I see. The console table?

739
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:04,319
No, this table.

740
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:06,571
That's the console table, sir.

741
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:10,492
No, listen to me.

742
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:14,788
I want to buy this, that,
and stuff over there, too.

743
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:17,373
How much would it cost for me
to buy everything in here?

744
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:20,877
For people like me, time is gold.

745
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,588
Trying to choose a piece of furniture
would be a waste of time.

746
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:24,714
-Right.
-Right.

747
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:27,008
You'll buy everything in here?

748
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:29,636
Well, for me to buy everything in here,

749
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,888
it will be faster
if I talk to the owner, right?

750
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:35,225
Negotiating on the price
will be faster that way.

751
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:39,062
No, talking to us will be faster.

752
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:48,404
It's them, right?

753
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:53,409
Right. They kept asking me
that they wanted to see the chairwoman.

754
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,495
Something is definitely off about them.

755
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:58,748
I heard from the headquarters

756
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:01,960
that she was almost attacked
by a stalker a few days ago.

757
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:05,755
-Are they--
-Should we call the security--

758
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:07,966
Sir.

759
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:10,510
How many I help you?

760
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:12,595
I don't need help.

761
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:28,945
-I just eavesdropped.
-Gosh.

762
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:30,697
Our operation has been compromised.

763
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:31,948
Let's get out of here.

764
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:33,700
What? Why?

765
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,744
That's the security guard
we saw the other day.

766
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:38,580
If he reports us...

767
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:40,623
Hey, let's get out of here for now.

768
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:48,047
Eun Dong. Where is Eun Dong?

769
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:50,425
Where did Eun Dong go? Look for Eun Dong.

770
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:51,885
Eun Dong.

771
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:55,180
Gosh, that punk. Why is he
sleeping there? Wake him up now.

772
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,682
-Hey, wake up! Wake up!
-That punk.

773
00:57:57,765 --> 00:57:59,142
We're about to get arrested!

774
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:01,019
Come out of there now.

775
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:03,229
Come out here.

776
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,898
Hey, Eun Dong!

777
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:06,191
-Hey, wake up.
-Hey.

778
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:08,359
Eun Dong, we're about
to get arrested here.

779
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:11,696
Come out of there. Come out now.

780
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:13,364
We might get arrested.

781
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:14,741
Come out!

782
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:16,659
Let's go.

783
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:17,952
Let's go.

784
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:20,747
Let's go. Eun Dong. Hurry.

785
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:26,920
Over there. There.

786
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:29,464
Excuse me! Wait!

787
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:36,846
Excuse me!

788
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:39,933
Excuse me.

789
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:51,152
Sir! Your shoes!

790
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:52,737
You forgot your... Damn it.

791
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:08,962
He's not chasing us anymore.

792
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:13,258
I knew it. They catch on really quickly.

793
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:16,803
How did he single us out
and chase after us like that?

794
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,096
Exactly.

795
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:22,600
I freaked out because of Eun Dong.

796
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,312
What happened to your shoes?

797
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:30,775
Oh, no. I was in such a hurry back there.
I forgot them.

798
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:33,278
You should've been careful.
It's freezing out here.

799
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:34,445
Sit down.

800
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:39,033
Why on earth
were you sleeping on that bed?

801
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,285
Was sleeping our mission?

802
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:41,953
I'm sorry.

803
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:46,040
I have never been on such
a comfortable bed before so I...

804
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:47,166
That's enough.

805
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:49,252
It's not like he wanted to sleep there.

806
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:53,131
He was just exhausted.

807
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:01,556
-Wear these.
-No, thank you. I'm fine.

808
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:03,057
You punk.

809
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:06,894
What if you injure your feet?

810
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:09,731
We can't even go to a hospital, you know?

811
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:11,024
Wear them.

812
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:13,776
I'm sorry.

813
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:48,895
Captain Ri!

814
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:03,117
Why in the world did you come

815
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:05,995
all the way here?

816
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:08,247
How did you come here?

817
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:11,918
-Captain Ri.
-Captain Ri.

818
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:31,020
Did you see my bodyguard?

819
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:33,272
I saw him a while ago.

820
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:37,944
Where in the world is he
when he should be right by your side?

821
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:39,570
I'll chew him out.

822
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:41,447
That's unnecessary.

823
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,957
Se-ri, you should've told me
if you were going

824
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,292
through something like that.

825
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:54,669
I'm hurt.

826
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:55,962
Aren't we family?

827
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:58,464
I don't know what you're talking about,
and I'm busy right now.

828
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,509
North Korea?

829
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:06,139
Is it true that Se-hyeong tried
to stop you from coming back?

830
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:09,016
Of course, it's true.

831
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:11,227
How could he call himself a human being?

832
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,980
Where did you hear that?

833
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:16,566
That's not important right now.

834
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:20,278
What's important is that
we need to join hands.

835
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:24,407
It's two on one now.
Let's destroy his family.

836
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:26,075
Is that why you're here?

837
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:29,537
Listen carefully.

838
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:33,166
Mom decided to support me.

839
01:02:36,377 --> 01:02:38,296
So you should come to our side.

840
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:41,090
And unblock my number too.
I'm your brother, you know.

841
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:42,717
Is that so?

842
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:45,136
Then how about

843
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:48,055
Then how about you and Mom join forces,

844
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:50,057
oust Se-hyeong,

845
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:52,769
and support me?

846
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:55,605
I was supposed to take over the company.

847
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:56,522
What?

848
01:02:57,482 --> 01:02:59,859
I'm willing to give up my vested rights
as the eldest son

849
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:02,653
and tackle this issue with you
side by side.

850
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:04,238
Stop being selfish.

851
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:06,783
Then tell me where you heard
what you've just told me.

852
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:09,494
Just tell her, honey.

853
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,871
Manager Oh told me.

854
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:14,373
He used to be Seung-jun's henchman.

855
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:17,794
I found out that he had been meeting
Se-hyeong several times.

856
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,879
So I made him spill.

857
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:23,591
By the way, he's a bit suspicious.

858
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:26,928
Recently, he purchased
a 50-pyeong apartment in Gangnam

859
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:29,847
-without a loan.
-Isn't it obvious who gave him that money?

860
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:32,350
Find out who gave it to him and why

861
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:33,893
and let me know.

862
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:36,187
-Me?
-Yes, you.

863
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:37,939
I'm a bit busy, so I should go.

864
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:43,694
Who is she to order me around?

865
01:03:44,403 --> 01:03:47,907
But she told you to let her know
once you found out.

866
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:49,784
Right.

867
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:52,119
That means she's going to unblock you.

868
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:54,914
She agreed to join hands with us.

869
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:56,874
Is that it?

870
01:03:57,917 --> 01:04:00,545
Great job. You did well.

871
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:03,548
YOUNGLIM INTERIOR DESIGN AND FURNITURE

YOUNGLIM CORPORATION

873
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,927
Jeong Hyeok, where are you?

874
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:11,472
What?

875
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:27,154
Se-ri!

876
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:30,867
No way. What's going on?

877
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:32,660
How could this be?

878
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:34,912
You shouldn't be here.

879
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:36,122
We missed you.

880
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:43,588
I could barely recognize you.

881
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:45,882
Chi Su, come here.

882
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:49,010
Don't embarrass me like this.

883
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:54,181
Gwang Beom, you too.

884
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:56,767
You're looking even more handsome.

885
01:04:59,937 --> 01:05:01,105
Are you all doing well?

886
01:05:01,188 --> 01:05:02,481
-Yes.
-Yes.

887
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:05,443
I've missed you terribly.

888
01:05:05,526 --> 01:05:06,777
-Me too.
-We've missed you too.

889
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:08,613
-Really?
-Not me.

890
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:10,823
What's wrong with your hair?

891
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:12,283
-Seriously.
-Everyone else likes it.

892
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:13,409
My gosh.

893
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:17,455
All right, now.

894
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:19,749
You guys can chat later.

895
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:23,753
Right, this is...

896
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:26,005
My name is Jung Man Bok.

897
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:28,758
Hello. It's nice to meet you.

898
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:30,968
I've seen you several times at the village

899
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:32,803
and heard your voice as well.

900
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:34,805
You know me?

901
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:36,641
Yes, you're Picky Princess.

902
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:40,895
Did you guys tell him?

903
01:05:40,978 --> 01:05:45,900
You know the saying,
"Walls have ears and the doors have eyes"?

904
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:49,946
Well, you could say
he is the wall and the door.

905
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:59,163
This is my house.

906
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:05,795
-What?
-Wow.

907
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:08,506
This capitalistic country
has bizarre doorknobs as well.

908
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:10,341
It looks nice to me.

909
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:12,593
Wow.

910
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:15,680
Don't be deceived by such elegance.

911
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:22,353
Come on in.

912
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:28,734
Wow.

913
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:33,990
What are you doing?

914
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:37,868
I'm checking for any wiretaps.

915
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:40,371
There are none.

916
01:06:40,454 --> 01:06:41,998
How do you know?

917
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:44,375
-This isn't even your house.
-What do you mean?

918
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:46,752
Of course, this is my house.

919
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:50,089
Are you saying you live alone
in this gigantic house?

920
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:53,884
-How many rooms are there?
-There are five, and I use all of them.

921
01:06:56,595 --> 01:06:59,056
Five rooms all to yourself?

922
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:02,393
-What do you use them for?
-One is my bedroom, the other my study,

923
01:07:02,476 --> 01:07:04,061
and the rest are my exercise room,

924
01:07:04,145 --> 01:07:06,522
a guest room, and a vacant room. Happy?

925
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:11,027
You're quite quick-witted.
I'll give you that.

926
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:21,620
I can't get over how you're provided

927
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:24,206
with warm water all the time.

928
01:07:25,499 --> 01:07:28,586
I'm the most amazed
by the endless amount of electricity.

929
01:07:28,669 --> 01:07:31,839
It's impressive how the floor is warm
despite no furnaces around.

930
01:07:31,922 --> 01:07:33,090
-You're right.
-I agree.

931
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:36,010
Gosh, this place is fascinating.

932
01:07:50,524 --> 01:07:51,859
Mother.

933
01:07:56,822 --> 01:07:58,032
Goodness.

934
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:00,659
Did you make this?

935
01:08:01,368 --> 01:08:03,871
You should eat and gain energy.

936
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:07,041
You're right.

937
01:08:07,124 --> 01:08:09,710
The world isn't over.

938
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:12,088
Let's eat.

939
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:15,800
Mother.

940
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:19,887
Will we have to leave this village?

941
01:08:22,723 --> 01:08:23,891
Don't say such a thing.

942
01:08:25,017 --> 01:08:28,729
We don't know what will happen
to your father just yet.

943
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:33,067
Then why did you forbid me
from hanging out with my friends?

944
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:44,537
Stay here.

945
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:52,294
-Who is it?
-Yeong Ae.

946
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:02,888
Why are you here?

947
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:05,099
This is for you.

948
01:09:07,351 --> 01:09:08,269
Goodness.

949
01:09:08,727 --> 01:09:11,897
We have plenty of food.

950
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:14,692
We're doing fine.
You should take them back.

951
01:09:14,775 --> 01:09:16,152
But still--

952
01:09:18,737 --> 01:09:20,114
Yeong Ae.

953
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:25,578
You like fermented bread, right?

954
01:09:25,911 --> 01:09:27,705
Goodness.

955
01:09:27,788 --> 01:09:29,123
When did you come here?

956
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:30,416
Just now.

957
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:33,878
You're so stupidly bold.

958
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:36,255
You could get punished for being here.

959
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:37,423
Leave this instant!

960
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:44,346
Eat well.

961
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,432
You need energy to hang in there.

962
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:48,392
She's right.

963
01:09:50,644 --> 01:09:52,897
Didn't you hear me?

964
01:09:53,314 --> 01:09:55,441
I told you to leave.

965
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:56,567
Go!

966
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:58,485
Go! Go!

967
01:09:58,569 --> 01:09:59,445
Yeong Ae.

968
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:02,740
You came out just in time.

969
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:07,703
I thought you'd need more firewood,

970
01:10:07,786 --> 01:10:09,455
so I brought some.

971
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:12,416
If you want to stay healthy, your room

972
01:10:12,499 --> 01:10:13,584
needs to be warm...

973
01:10:21,258 --> 01:10:24,470
Goodness, you just won't listen, will you?

974
01:10:27,514 --> 01:10:30,184
It's dangerous for you to be here!

975
01:10:30,684 --> 01:10:33,938
Leave right now if you don't want
to be punished!

976
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:37,441
Yeong Ae.

977
01:10:37,524 --> 01:10:40,402
You need to stay strong.

978
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:42,655
-Don't cry.
-Don't cry.

979
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,866
-Yeong Ae, don't cry.
-Don't cry.

980
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:47,826
Don't cry.

981
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:55,626
Eat up.

982
01:11:01,465 --> 01:11:04,343
Chi Su, is it good?

983
01:11:05,552 --> 01:11:07,680
Do you think I'm enjoying this?

984
01:11:08,305 --> 01:11:12,851
-Then?
-You emptied out Captain Ri's storage,

985
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:17,481
so I'm doing the same.

986
01:11:18,232 --> 01:11:21,860
You'll be starving in your later years.

987
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:24,989
Sure. Continue on with your mission.

988
01:11:25,155 --> 01:11:26,407
If you want me to become broke,

989
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:29,118
you'll need to consume
all the beef in this country.

990
01:11:29,201 --> 01:11:31,870
You're still telling porkies, aren't you?

991
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:33,914
I'm not.

992
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:38,294
Why aren't you eating?

993
01:11:39,336 --> 01:11:41,171
Eat up.

994
01:11:42,339 --> 01:11:45,259
It must've been extremely difficult
to come all the way here.

995
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:47,928
Just thinking about it breaks my heart.

996
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,601
I'm sorry to say this.

997
01:11:55,185 --> 01:11:57,396
We're the ones who suffered,

998
01:11:57,479 --> 01:12:00,649
but why is she getting the most meat?

999
01:12:07,531 --> 01:12:09,575
You can get your meat yourselves.

1000
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:11,452
He can give it to whomever he wants.

1001
01:12:11,535 --> 01:12:16,081
In the South, they call people like him

1002
01:12:17,207 --> 01:12:18,292
"Loverboy."

1003
01:12:20,127 --> 01:12:23,213
Ju Meok, you know everything, don't you?

1004
01:12:23,922 --> 01:12:25,090
"Loverboy"?

1005
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:27,885
Is that like a grocery boy
or a newspaper boy?

1006
01:12:27,968 --> 01:12:31,472
You could say that since these boys
are all good at what they're named after.

1007
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:37,311
Then again, crossing the border
just because of a woman

1008
01:12:37,394 --> 01:12:41,982
is an insane act that is worth
going down in history.

1009
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:45,819
That's not it.

1010
01:12:46,403 --> 01:12:49,490
Didn't I explain everything that happened
in a very logical manner?

1011
01:12:49,573 --> 01:12:50,741
He's right.

1012
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:54,578
In that sense,
Captain Ri is second to none.

1013
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:57,247
You're the best.

1014
01:12:58,415 --> 01:13:01,085
You're right.

1015
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:04,630
You're the best.

1016
01:13:08,008 --> 01:13:10,344
-Have some more.
-I'm full.

1017
01:13:14,723 --> 01:13:15,974
Captain Ri.

1018
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:19,228
We're running out of time.

1019
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:23,107
Your father told us to bring you back

1020
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:25,025
as soon as possible.

1021
01:13:25,776 --> 01:13:29,571
We need to leave as soon as
the Military World Games ends.

1022
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:32,533
Your father made sure

1023
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:35,119
that we'd come home safely.

1024
01:13:35,202 --> 01:13:37,663
Didn't you hear everything that I said?

1025
01:13:38,288 --> 01:13:42,209
Cheol Gang may abduct Se-ri
and bring her back to the North.

1026
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:45,129
He may attack my father and me.

1027
01:13:46,296 --> 01:13:50,175
How will we catch him
when we don't even know where he is?

1028
01:13:51,135 --> 01:13:53,387
You're running out of time.

1029
01:13:54,555 --> 01:13:55,889
Se-ri

1030
01:13:56,682 --> 01:14:00,477
has a high social status
and many people on her side.

1031
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:03,063
She'll be fine here.

1032
01:14:34,761 --> 01:14:36,680
There's a Jewish proverb that says,

1033
01:14:37,264 --> 01:14:41,351
"A rich man has heirs but no sons."

1034
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:46,440
They never eat with us
unless it's regarding money.

1035
01:14:47,357 --> 01:14:48,442
Do you have any other soup?

1036
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:50,986
It's Se-ri's birthday today.

1037
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:54,907
Since when did you care?

1038
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:00,537
You knew, didn't you?

1039
01:15:01,705 --> 01:15:02,706
About what?

1040
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:06,877
That Se-ri was in North Korea.

1041
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:08,378
Hey!

1042
01:15:11,715 --> 01:15:13,926
You didn't go overseas
on a business trip last time.

1043
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:16,094
You were taking care of that matter,
weren't you?

1044
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:18,597
NAME OF INDIVIDUAL: YOON SE-RI

1045
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:23,727
ADDRESS: GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL

1046
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:31,235
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE INDIVIDUAL: FATHER

1047
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:37,699
Where did you hear that?

1048
01:15:38,283 --> 01:15:40,327
Why didn't you tell me?

1049
01:15:40,994 --> 01:15:42,329
Did you think

1050
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:47,251
I'd use it against your daughter
and give her a hard time or something?

1051
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:51,922
I can't say no.

1052
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:55,509
Did you also know

1053
01:15:56,927 --> 01:15:58,011
that Se-hyeong

1054
01:15:59,012 --> 01:16:00,931
knew she was there

1055
01:16:01,014 --> 01:16:03,934
and hired some men to stop her
from returning?

1056
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:07,604
This is Se-ri one. This is Se-ri one.

1057
01:16:10,857 --> 01:16:12,985
The police said

1058
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:18,448
he told them that this wasn't her voice.

1059
01:16:18,532 --> 01:16:22,035
He even refused to get the voice analyzed.

1060
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:25,330
We received countless reports on her
after the news broke out.

1061
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:27,416
They claimed to have spotted her.

1062
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:29,835
They claimed to have footages
and voice recordings of her.

1063
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:32,045
When I went to check them,

1064
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:34,214
they were all fake.
I'm sure this one is too.

1065
01:16:34,298 --> 01:16:35,299
It's a scam.

1066
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:36,383
-No, sir.
-No, sir.

1067
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:40,387
A close associate of Se-ri's
provided a copy of her voice,

1068
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:42,973
and this man, who was in charge
of her insurance,

1069
01:16:43,056 --> 01:16:44,891
faked this for his sake.

1070
01:16:44,975 --> 01:16:47,311
-Sir, that's not--
-Father!

1071
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:53,108
Are you going to believe these men
whom you've never met

1072
01:16:53,817 --> 01:16:56,361
or me, your son?

1073
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:01,116
Are you serious?

1074
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:02,951
Did Se-hyeong

1075
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:05,704
really try to stop her from returning?

1076
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:12,252
Are you leaving already?

1077
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:18,675
I have a breakfast meeting.

1078
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:22,596
Are the others still asleep?

1079
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:24,723
They must've been exhausted.

1080
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:29,269
You should stay with them today.

1081
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:32,439
-I have something to say--
-Oh, right.

1082
01:17:32,522 --> 01:17:34,983
How is your wound?

1083
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:37,319
It's fine.

1084
01:17:37,402 --> 01:17:39,363
It wasn't serious, to begin with.

1085
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:41,573
I see.

1086
01:17:42,699 --> 01:17:43,784
I'm relieved.

1087
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:48,830
You kept your promise.

1088
01:17:51,416 --> 01:17:54,378
You stayed here
until your wound healed up.

1089
01:17:54,711 --> 01:17:56,129
You didn't leave.

1090
01:18:02,135 --> 01:18:05,722
From now on, even if you suddenly vanish,

1091
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:08,183
I won't be startled.

1092
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:11,395
I won't feel hurt.

1093
01:18:12,896 --> 01:18:14,690
I won't wait for you.

1094
01:18:15,732 --> 01:18:17,067
So don't worry about me.

1095
01:18:20,654 --> 01:18:21,738
Goodbye.

1096
01:18:48,265 --> 01:18:51,101
For this season, the "Rock Chic Look"
is the style we're aiming to launch.

1097
01:18:51,184 --> 01:18:53,270
It's a tough and rebellious rock style,

1098
01:18:53,353 --> 01:18:56,398
that goes hand in hand with
leather jackets and metal accessories...

1099
01:19:49,367 --> 01:19:50,702
What is it?

1100
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:52,871
I need to go out right now.

1101
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:54,456
You met Se-jun, didn't you?

1102
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:59,294
I'm sure you've heard.

1103
01:20:04,966 --> 01:20:05,926
About what?

1104
01:20:06,009 --> 01:20:07,385
About what Se-hyeong did.

1105
01:20:08,345 --> 01:20:10,013
Listen carefully.

1106
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:13,099
Mom decided to support me.

1107
01:20:14,434 --> 01:20:17,145
I'm not going to let this slide.

1108
01:20:17,521 --> 01:20:18,563
So--

1109
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:20,899
For me?

1110
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:24,820
Or for your eldest son Se-Jun?

1111
01:20:25,445 --> 01:20:27,697
-Se-ri...
-You need to be sure.

1112
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:30,283
Because

1113
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:32,327
it may sound like

1114
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:34,913
you're my biological mom.

1115
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:38,333
You won't believe anything I say.

1116
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:40,669
But it's not like that--

1117
01:20:40,752 --> 01:20:42,337
You're right. I don't believe you.

1118
01:20:45,423 --> 01:20:46,550
You never came back.

1119
01:21:08,196 --> 01:21:09,030
Se-ri.

1120
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:13,451
Do you want to wait here
while I get something warm to drink?

1121
01:21:14,035 --> 01:21:15,287
Okay.

1122
01:21:24,379 --> 01:21:25,463
Mom.

1123
01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:49,237
Don't fall asleep.

1124
01:21:50,488 --> 01:21:51,948
Mom will be here soon.

1125
01:21:59,205 --> 01:22:00,874
She'll be here by the time I reach 100.

1126
01:22:03,084 --> 01:22:04,210
One.

1127
01:22:06,129 --> 01:22:07,130
Two.

1128
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:10,342
Three.

1129
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:13,511
Four.

1130
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:17,349
Ninety-eight.

1131
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:20,477
Ninety-nine.

1132
01:22:30,862 --> 01:22:31,947
One.

1133
01:22:34,032 --> 01:22:35,033
Two.

1134
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:37,786
Three.

1135
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,081
Four.

1136
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:45,627
Ever since that day,

1137
01:22:46,711 --> 01:22:49,089
-there's a chilling night sea in my heart.
-Hey.

1138
01:22:49,255 --> 01:22:52,300
-Hey, wake up.
-And the sun never shines

1139
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:54,469
on that sea.

1140
01:22:57,263 --> 01:22:59,182
No matter how many times I counted,

1141
01:23:00,016 --> 01:23:01,768
the sun never showed up.

1142
01:23:03,103 --> 01:23:05,146
And you never came back.

1143
01:23:06,189 --> 01:23:09,776
Ever since then,
one thought lingered in my mind.

1144
01:23:11,444 --> 01:23:13,071
"Why did I come to this world

1145
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:16,116
and turn my mom's life into a living hell?

1146
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:20,912
It would've been better
had I not been born.

1147
01:23:22,956 --> 01:23:24,249
I feel sorry...

1148
01:23:28,628 --> 01:23:30,171
for breathing."

1149
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:36,845
Okay.

1150
01:23:40,598 --> 01:23:41,599
You don't have to

1151
01:23:43,893 --> 01:23:46,771
believe everything that I say.

1152
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:49,441
Don't you visit me on my birthday
ever again.

1153
01:23:49,524 --> 01:23:50,567
It's the worst.

1154
01:24:13,673 --> 01:24:16,092
You see,

1155
01:24:16,176 --> 01:24:20,138
I feel the proudest regarding my job

1156
01:24:21,181 --> 01:24:24,434
when I can connect those
who have similar needs.

1157
01:24:24,517 --> 01:24:25,560
We have

1158
01:24:26,144 --> 01:24:27,479
similar needs?

1159
01:24:27,562 --> 01:24:28,438
Definitely.

1160
01:24:29,022 --> 01:24:32,317
From what I see, your respective needs

1161
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,277
are different yet similar.

1162
01:24:34,694 --> 01:24:37,739
For instance, you two

1163
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:40,116
want Yoon Se-ri gone.

1164
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:42,786
And this gentleman here needs

1165
01:24:43,453 --> 01:24:44,746
Yoon Se-ri to come to him.

1166
01:24:44,829 --> 01:24:47,290
You need her to come to you?

1167
01:24:47,373 --> 01:24:48,833
What does that mean?

1168
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:51,252
Are you going to bring her
back to the North or something?

1169
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:54,631
Do you need to know that?

1170
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:58,051
Aren't you happy as long as she's gone?

1171
01:24:58,134 --> 01:24:59,928
What's with his attitude?

1172
01:25:00,011 --> 01:25:01,971
Of course, I should know.

1173
01:25:02,055 --> 01:25:03,348
Will she be safe

1174
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:05,100
back there?

1175
01:25:05,183 --> 01:25:07,393
I need to bring her back there

1176
01:25:07,477 --> 01:25:09,187
to verify something.

1177
01:25:09,771 --> 01:25:11,940
Thanks to her, I've lost many things.

1178
01:25:12,023 --> 01:25:13,608
I need to retrieve them.

1179
01:25:14,192 --> 01:25:15,735
But I can't

1180
01:25:16,444 --> 01:25:18,279
guarantee her safety.

1181
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:22,951
Isn't that what you want?

1182
01:25:23,034 --> 01:25:24,786
I'll be getting rid
of your future troubles.

1183
01:25:24,869 --> 01:25:26,412
Hold on.

1184
01:25:27,872 --> 01:25:29,082
"Getting rid of"?

1185
01:25:32,335 --> 01:25:33,586
This is too much.

1186
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:35,839
He's a dangerous man.

1187
01:25:36,339 --> 01:25:38,174
Are you determined to ruin my life?

1188
01:25:38,758 --> 01:25:40,802
How dare you introduce me
to someone like him?

1189
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:43,471
I'll pretend like this rendezvous
never happened.

1190
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:45,807
He and I never met, okay?

1191
01:25:45,890 --> 01:25:46,808
Sir...

1192
01:25:46,933 --> 01:25:48,184
Sir...

1193
01:25:48,268 --> 01:25:49,227
Darn it.

1194
01:25:52,063 --> 01:25:53,022
By the way,

1195
01:25:54,482 --> 01:25:56,109
you'll need some money

1196
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:59,404
to carry out your plan.

1197
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:06,202
You'll need a lot of information as well.

1198
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:15,503
Do you know

1199
01:26:16,379 --> 01:26:17,630
where she lives?

1200
01:27:00,882 --> 01:27:01,925
Then...

1201
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:06,512
don't go anywhere
until the wound heals up.

1202
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:09,807
Only until it heals.

1203
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:11,935
Just promise me this.

1204
01:27:13,061 --> 01:27:14,354
Once it heals,

1205
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:18,066
even if you disappear into the blue,

1206
01:27:22,487 --> 01:27:24,197
I'll just accept it.

1207
01:27:34,165 --> 01:27:35,541
Jeong Hyeok.

1208
01:27:47,136 --> 01:27:48,513
Jeong Hyeok.

1209
01:28:00,942 --> 01:28:02,151
Did you leave?

1210
01:28:07,573 --> 01:28:08,741
Did you?

1211
01:28:12,912 --> 01:28:14,038
This soon?

1212
01:29:25,109 --> 01:29:28,363
Didn't you say
this was how they celebrated?

1213
01:29:28,905 --> 01:29:30,823
They all seemed to like it.

1214
01:29:30,907 --> 01:29:34,077
Se-ri, today is your birthday, right?

1215
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:35,578
Congratulations.

1216
01:29:36,329 --> 01:29:37,497
Congratulations.

1217
01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:39,624
Congratulations, woman.

1218
01:30:18,371 --> 01:30:19,747
Se-ri.

1219
01:30:21,999 --> 01:30:23,334
Don't come near me.

1220
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:26,129
I look like a mess right now.

1221
01:30:27,421 --> 01:30:28,548
I'm sorry.

1222
01:30:29,048 --> 01:30:30,800
We startled you on your birthday.

1223
01:30:31,551 --> 01:30:32,593
That's not it.

1224
01:30:34,637 --> 01:30:36,097
I wasn't startled.

1225
01:30:40,518 --> 01:30:42,228
I was scared.

1226
01:30:44,605 --> 01:30:46,149
From now on,

1227
01:30:47,859 --> 01:30:50,236
I'd remember this day on my birthday.

1228
01:30:50,319 --> 01:30:52,071
I'd remember this good day.

1229
01:31:02,415 --> 01:31:04,292
I told you not to come.

1230
01:31:05,042 --> 01:31:07,253
I don't want you to see my face.

1231
01:31:30,109 --> 01:31:31,068
Next year,

1232
01:31:31,861 --> 01:31:33,237
the year after that,

1233
01:31:35,156 --> 01:31:36,657
and even the one after that

1234
01:31:38,367 --> 01:31:39,827
will all be good.

1235
01:31:41,954 --> 01:31:44,123
Because I'll be thinking about you.

1236
01:31:46,375 --> 01:31:48,711
I'll be grateful that you were born
into this world.

1237
01:31:51,797 --> 01:31:53,007
I'll be grateful

1238
01:31:54,217 --> 01:31:57,637
that the person I love is still breathing.

1239
01:32:00,431 --> 01:32:01,974
That's why your birthday

1240
01:32:03,142 --> 01:32:04,685
will always be a good day.

1241
01:32:52,692 --> 01:32:53,859
DEFEATED

1242
01:33:16,007 --> 01:33:19,343
I won't let this slide, Desperate Effort.

1243
01:33:37,361 --> 01:33:38,571
Today

1244
01:33:39,405 --> 01:33:40,698
is February 2.

1245
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:42,658
It's my birthday.

1246
01:33:43,409 --> 01:33:44,410
And...

1247
01:33:46,078 --> 01:33:47,246
I am on top

1248
01:33:48,748 --> 01:33:50,041
of a bridge

1249
01:33:50,583 --> 01:33:51,751
in Sigriswil.

1250
01:33:53,627 --> 01:33:55,171
I have no regrets.

1251
01:33:56,213 --> 01:33:57,214
Dad,

1252
01:33:58,215 --> 01:33:59,467
Se-jun,

1253
01:34:00,509 --> 01:34:01,427
Se-hyeong,

1254
01:34:02,595 --> 01:34:05,139
and Mom.

1255
01:34:06,932 --> 01:34:08,976
I'm going far away.

1256
01:34:10,061 --> 01:34:12,271
Don't live too happily, though.

1257
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:14,940
Every now and then,

1258
01:34:16,609 --> 01:34:18,277
do think of me.

1259
01:34:22,823 --> 01:34:23,741
What?

1260
01:34:47,264 --> 01:34:48,933
He could do much better.

1261
01:34:50,184 --> 01:34:51,477
See?

1262
01:34:53,437 --> 01:34:54,939
It wasn't a coincidence.

1263
01:34:56,065 --> 01:34:57,525
It was fate.

1264
01:35:10,204 --> 01:35:11,330
Jeong Hyeok.

1265
01:35:14,208 --> 01:35:15,418
Where are you going?

1266
01:35:17,044 --> 01:35:18,629
Well...

1267
01:35:18,754 --> 01:35:20,881
I need to go meet someone.

1268
01:35:27,012 --> 01:35:29,306
You know, they were just flings.

1269
01:35:30,224 --> 01:35:33,018
Gosh, is Little Hyeoky getting jealous?

1270
01:35:33,894 --> 01:35:36,939
Did Dan not tell you
and spent the night out?

1271
01:35:37,022 --> 01:35:39,275
We're nothing like what you think, Mom.

1272
01:35:39,358 --> 01:35:43,362
It's just me. I have fallen for Dan.

1273
01:35:43,988 --> 01:35:46,198
All you have to do is answer my questions.

1274
01:35:46,282 --> 01:35:50,077
Do you mean that I may take her
or get rid of her as I please?

1275
01:35:51,036 --> 01:35:53,539
So we're saying goodbye again
just like we always do.

1276
01:35:53,622 --> 01:35:56,959
I am going to remember you
no matter what happens.
