It's not that.

where did you get your armor?

82
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,790
The government distributed them.

83
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,220
And where does the government get it from?

84
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:16,680

How can you clothe and feed yourself?

91
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:30,860
Without merchants,

92
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,720
how could you be here showing off?

93
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,310
If you despise merchants so much,

94
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,909

00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,190
What I'm saying is,

the economy is the foundation of society.

109
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,030

113
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,950
Do you know the relief these merchants feel

114

when they don't lose money for a month?

115
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,670
Never mind.

116
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,250
You wouldn't understand.

117
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,480
I just want to say

118
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,790
the people you're blocking aren't

they're supporting the needs of thousands in Changqing.

121
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,550
Can you take responsibility for that?

122
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,110
Exactly!

Wasn't she the one who offered the first incense

I've been carried home by a woman.

151
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,950
Better to be carried by a woman

152
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,620
than crawling in yourself.

153
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,060
Let me see.

Of course.

Of course you are.

Pull out the arrow for me.

00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,500
If you don't pull it out soon, it will hurt my meridians.

194
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,470
The later you pull it out, the sooner I die.

195
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,950
My life is in your hands now.

196
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,320
You can't die.

197
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:42,990
Hurry.

198
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:15,120
Lu Zizheng, you can't die in my hands.

199
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,250
If you die, I won't live either.

200
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,680
Are we that close?

201
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,500
This is no time

202
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,500
for jokes.

203
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,420
Why do you always

204
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,380
provoke me?

205
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,540
You've lost so much blood.

206
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,840
You need to replenish.

207
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,150
What?

208
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,330
What do you want to eat?

209
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,190
Beef noodles.

210
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:39,940
No scallion.

211
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,090
I'll make it for you.

212
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,940
[Duan]

213
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,580
Duan.

214
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:02,820
My lady,

215
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,910
when did you know how to make noodles?

216
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,530
Is it hard to make noodles?

217
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:07,450
Yes.

218
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,260
No one else in Gu Residence can make it except for Da.

219
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:10,790
Dongxi.

220
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,790
Get me some blood.

221
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,870
What blood?

222
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,110
Any kind.

223
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,090
My lady, why do you need blood?

224
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,390
I...

225
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:18,910
I...

226
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:22,270
I've been reading recipe lately.

227
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,080
I want to make a bloody tofu.

228
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,340
Okay.

229
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,080
Here, Dongxi.

230
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,510
You can eat here.

231
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,850
Go back to your room when you're done.

232
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,650
Don't come out unless I call you.

233
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,010
Yes, my lady.

234
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:43,980
Butler.

235
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,150
Why are you standing so far away?

236
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,990
What can I do for you, my lady?

237
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,470
Nothing.

238
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,480
I just saw you passing by.

239
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,520
If there's nothing,

240
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,040
I'll be going.

241
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,230
Wait.

242
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,120
Come here.

243
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,440
Do you have a problem with me?

244
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,940
I wouldn't dare.

245
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,650
What are you wearing

246
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,280
on your hand and neck?

247
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,630
This...

248
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,340
This is...

249
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,200
Do you dare

250
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,440
to put down that peach wood sword?

251
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,740
No, I can't do that.

252
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,030
This is a family heirloom.

253
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,360
I heard as soon as I came back to life,

254
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,380
you wanted to get a Taoist priest trying to kill me.

255
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,780
If I were a monster,

256
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,130
I would eat you first.

257
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,220
My lady, please spare my life.

258
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,570
Don't kneel yet.

259
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,300
Give me the key to the cellar.

260
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,930
What's wrong with the wine cellar?

261
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:38,730
Nothing.

262
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,470
Just let me hold onto the key for now.

263
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,530
If anyone wants wine, they can ask me.

264
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:44,870
Here.

265
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,060
And take this bowl of noodles to the master.

266
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,470
Tell him I made it myself.

267
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:50,610
Yes, my lady.

268
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:52,910
Just one bowl.

269
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,960
Okay.

270
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,350
Lu Zizheng.

271
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,370
How's your injury?

272
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,190
When the pharmacy opens tomorrow,

273
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,720
I'll get you some medicine.

274
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:18,660
Miss Gu,

275
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,430
your noodles are so delicious.

276
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:26,540
[Wine]

277
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,590
Are you crazy?

278
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,270
It's not your first time eating it.

279
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,000
It's okay.

280
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,540
A bowl of these noodles is all I need in life.

281
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:32,960
Lu Zizheng.

282
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:33,940
Tell me,

283
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,410
how did you get here?

284
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,740
Lu Zizheng?

285
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,280
What do you mean by 'get here'?

286
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,710
Don't hit me.

287
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,190
I haven't recovered yet.

288
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:46,930
Oh right,

289
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,390
when we used to swim,

290
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,840
I never saw your scar.

291
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,060
How did you get it?

292
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:53,770
Miss Gu,

293
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,460
what is swim?

294
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,160
What did you call me?

295
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,730
Miss Gu.

296
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,630
What else do you know?

297
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:04,900
Miss Gu,

298
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:05,910
I also know

299
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,940
you're the daughter of the vice president of Changqing Chamber of Commerce.

300
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,670
Lu Zizheng.

301
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,780
Are you sure you're not pretending to piss me off?

302
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,460
I'm sure.

303
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,420
Then swear it.

304
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:18,110
Miss Gu,

305
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,090
I have to swear for such a trivial matter?

306
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,220
Isn't that too much?

307
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,300
No.

308
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,190
You must swear.

309
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:27,620
Okay.

310
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,830
I swear.

311
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,910
I'm not Lu Zizheng,

312
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,470
nor am I from another place,

313
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,100
and I'm not pretending.

314
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,030
What is pretending?

315
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,230
Has it started already?

316
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,220
It is said that the Star of Rebellion

317
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,100
can connect the stars of two worlds,

318
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,310
bringing people from the other side to this one.

319
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:57,340
The scattered Four Treasures will be found.

320
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,150
How can I find them?

321
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,320
Detach from love and hate.

322
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:06,670
The identity of Star of Rebellion must be kept secret,

323
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,860
or it will bring deadly trouble

324
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,740
and close the gate of time and space,

325
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,660
casting you into another space.

326
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,140
Damn Star of Rebellion.

327
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:19,990
Dongxi.

328
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,780
-My lady.
-Where did you go so early in the morning?

329
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,910
My lady, here's the bloody tofu you asked for.

330
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:24,620
You made it?

331
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,470
I had the chef Da help me make it.

332
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,430
Oh my,

333
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,940
this is too disgusting.

334
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,110
Take it to the kitchen.

335
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:36,910
What is this?

336
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,240
Boiled blood curd,

337
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,870
it's good for your health.

338
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,430
You've lost so much blood,

339
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,690
you should replenish.

340
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,830
Are you feeling better?

341
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,320
What do you mean?

342
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,520
You seemed down

343
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,710
when you left yesterday,

344
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,550
I was a bit worried.

345
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,790
You're worried about me?

346
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,350
No,

347
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,500
I'm worried about myself.

348
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,700
Afraid you'd kill me.

349
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,990
I can't beat you.

350
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,030
But you can still poison me.

351
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,370
There are so many ways.

352
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,520
You really look like Lu Zizheng.

353
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,410
Then you can call me Lu Zizheng.

354
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,110
That way, when you talk to me,

355
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,260
you'll feel better.

356
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,870
Alright.

357
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,190
I brought you clothes to change,

358
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,340
and some haemostatic.

359
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,740
I'll apply it for you after you finish your meal.

360
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,200
No need.

361
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,180
I'm recovered now.

362
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:20,970
I don't believe it.

363
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,170
You don't believe me?

364
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,510
It's really recovered.

365
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,870
What's going on?

366
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,340
How did your wound heal so quickly?

367
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,250
I've learned martial arts.

368
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,820
You're so calm.

369
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,790
You said 'so calm'?

370
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,070
Yes.

371
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:55,820
You said it yesterday.

372
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,020
I learned it from you.

373
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,900
I'll try to talk like you from now on.

374
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,580
In this way,

375
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,630
you can consider me as

376
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,980
the real Lu Zizheng.

377
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,590
Anything can happen

378
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,490
in this world.

379
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,510
What do you mean?

380
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:10,450
Never mind.

381
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,210
Let me ask you,

382
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,710
why were you hunted by the government?

383
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,030
Well,

384
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,410
I stole a treasure from the Mantra Sect.

385
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,750
Mantra Sect?

386
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,150
You shouldn't

387
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,410
know too much about it.

388
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,790
When are you leaving?

389
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,550
Where?

390
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,790
Leave Changqing?

391
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,540
Changqing is too dangerous.

392
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,120
I'll leave when things cool down.

393
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,440
Since you are a martial artist,

394
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,260
let me ask you something.

395
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,000
Go ahead.

396
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,520
Do you know the Four Treasures?

397
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,880
Why are you asking about this?

398
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,740
Just asking.

399
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,760
Why ask me?

400
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,820
You're my only friend.

401
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,880
I can only ask you.

402
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,480
You consider me a friend?

403
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,760
What else?

404
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:03,630
Alright,

405
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,500
I'll ask around for you

406
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,990
and let you know if there's any result.

407
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:11,150
My lady,

408
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,099
the clothes made by Madam Zhang are very beautiful.

409
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:15,400
Welcome.

410
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,230
Madam Zhang,

411
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,589
I want to make an outfit.

412
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,339
Thank you.

413
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,620
Morning...

414
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,660
Hi.

415
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,660
I called you here today for one thing.

416
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,960
The magistrate hopes the Changqing Chamber of Commerce

417
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,840
can help the government catch the Mantra cultist.

418
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,590
Chairman,

419
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:57,750
if I may interrupt,

420
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,550
you come from a martial arts family,

421
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,560
and you are famous in the martial arts world,

422
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,490
but you're not familiar with our business rules.

423
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,740
The Chamber of Commerce

424
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,890
handles only business matters.

425
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,460
It's best for the government

426
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,120
to deal with capturing the cultist themselves.

427
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:13,990
Xing Si,

428
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,260
bring it here.

429
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:25,590
[Account book]

430
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:25,700
Manager Yang,

431
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,440
take a look.

432
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,740
This is...

433
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:28,330
Yes.

434
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,150
Last year's account from Chunfeng Restaurant,

435
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,940
totaling 18,236 taels of silver,

436
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,740
netting 9,361 taels.

437
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,980
Taxes amounted to 673.4 taels.

438
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:40,860
Is there any problem?

439
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,660
Manager Yang,

440
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:45,730
how much was an egg last year?

441
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,980
The price fluctuates throughout the year.

442
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,850
Five copper coins each,

443
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:50,830
it's a fair price, huh?

444
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,400
Five copper coins each.

445
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,820
That's not cheap.

446
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:54,380
Stop it..

447
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,700
Manager Yang,

448
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,550
do you accept this price?

449
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,510
Sure.

450
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,370
Yet you used eggs at ten coins each

451
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,800
and vegetables at eight coins a bunch.

452
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,110
With this accounting showing 9,361 taels of silver,

453
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,740
I'm afraid it's over 3,000 taels more.

454
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,840
Manager Yang,

455
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:16,920
please take a look at the accounts and the tax.

456
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,020
Chairman Duan,

457
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,980
about what you said earlier

458
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,110
asking the Chamber of Commerce to help capture the cultist,

459
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,820
I fully support it.

460
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,620
We can provide both

461
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,750
money and strength.

462
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,260
What do you think?

463
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,180
Great.

464
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,310
Let's talk about

465
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,770
about the accounts later.

466
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:35,830
What's wrong?

467
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,370
The government has asked

468
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,780
the Chamber of Commerce to assist in capturing the Mantra cultist.

469
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,580
While some merchants disagree,

470
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,880
our Qingfeng Restaurant

471
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,420
should pay more attention.

472
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,700
Mantra cultist?

473
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:48,990
Yes.

474
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,380
The business has been poor recently,

475
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,140
and now we have to cooperate with the government

476
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,170
and compete with Chunfeng Restaurant.

477
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,350
Chunfeng Restaurant?

478
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,020
Is that vegetarian restaurant

479
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,540
competing with us?

480
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,330
Yes.

481
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,300
Who else can it be?

482
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,710
How can a vegetarian restaurant compete with a meaty one?

483
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,300
It doesn't make sense.

484
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,220
We have guests.

485
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,660
Ladies, please come in.

486
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,290
Dongxi.

487
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,290
Are these people here

488
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,100
to discuss business or to eat?

489
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,670
Why does it look so awkward?

490
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,480
Ladies, please come in.

491
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,140
No,

492
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,820
I prefer sitting in the lobby.

493
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:30,710
Okay.

494
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,180
The air is good, and it's bright.

495
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:32,830
Sure.

496
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,190
You can sit in the lobby.

497
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:37,620
Sorry.

498
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,270
Please show me your menu.

499
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,750
Miss, look over there.

500
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,240
Do you have a telescope?

501
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:48,460
What?

502
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:49,750
Without a telescope,

503
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,190
how can I see the menu

504
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,140
from this far away?

505
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,300
Miss, why don't you come closer to take a look?

506
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:54,900
No need,

507
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,030
just bring out your specialties.

508
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,110
Bring out all our specialties?

509
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,000
Okay.

510
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,880
No problem. Please wait a moment.

511
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,190
The elbow is not rotten.

512
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,320
The duck is smelly.

513
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,190
The braised pork is greasy.

514
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,380
No wonder it can't beat a vegetarian restaurant.

515
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,060
Let's go, Dongxi.

516
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,590
Go home.

517
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,020
Pack it up.

518
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,880
Don't waste it.

519
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,190
My lady.

520
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:37,880
Pack it up.

521
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,730
My lady.

522
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,950
How did you get in?

523
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,810
What if Dongxi sees you?

524
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:52,840
She won't.

525
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,070
I saw her leaving.

526
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,300
Annoying.

527
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,830
Why didn't you ask me how I got out?

528
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,980
With such a big hole on your shoulder,

529
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,150
one day was all it took.

530
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,540
How can a small cellar lock you up?

531
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,740
So calm.

532
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,540
Stop it.

533
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,340
Tell me, what's the matter?

534
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,860
Nothing special.

535
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,150
I just hadn't seen you all day

536
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:15,020
and wanted to see what you were up to.

537
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,110
Since Dongxi went out,

538
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:16,910
I came in.

539
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,210
The lady is asleep.

540
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,590
Thank you, Madam Zhang.

541
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:30,990
Dongxi.

542
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,100
Come in.

543
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,590
My lady.

544
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,840
You were outside the whole time?

545
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,670
So you knew it?

546
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,860
But don't worry,

547
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,880
I won't gossip, my lady.

548
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,230
When did you find out?

549
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,260
When you came back from Shangqing Temple

550
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,300
and made noodles.

551
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,870
You also watched over me

552
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,290
like this in the wine cellar?

553
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,840
Yes, my lady.

554
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,020
Dongxi, you're so kind.

555
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:00,950
Thank you.

556
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,730
My lady, don't mention it.

557
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:07,660
Master.

558
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,400
What is this?

559
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,620
I have an idea

560
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,340
to boost Qingfeng Restaurant's business.

561
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,460
Master again?

562
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,500
When will you call me father?

563
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,980
Soon.

564
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,510
Soon.

565
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,310
What's the idea?

566
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:28,600
You'll see.

567
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,030
Holding a food festival at Qingfeng Restaurant.

568
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,650
That's a great idea.

569
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:36,670
The Chamber of Commerce should support it.

570
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,490
Yes.

571
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,700
Changqing has many local delicacies,

572
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,630
but no one has ever promoted them.

573
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,060
If we hold a food festival,

574
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,940
it can increase the popularity of the Chamber of Commerce

575
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,990
promote business exchanges,

576
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,210
and expand the influence.

577
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,630
Is this your idea?

578
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,460
No,

579
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,410
it's my daughter's idea.

580
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,780
Then she must be a good cook.

581
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,000
Of course.

582
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,350
Mr. Duan,

583
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,100
anytime you're free,

584
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,470
please come to our house for a family meal.

585
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,320
Gladly.

586
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,300
Thank you.

587
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:05,980
Farewell.

588
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,500
Young Master,

589
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,310
right now,

590
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,020
capturing the Mantra cultist should be the priority.

591
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,460
Holding a food festival

592
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,580
might displease Magistrate Du.

593
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,180
The idea is actually good.

594
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:20,820
What Chairman Gu said

595
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:21,860
makes sense.

596
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:22,820
Yes.

597
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:26,090
But Miss Gu is not an ordinary woman.

598
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,740
Shangqing Temple's first incense

599
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,020
and strange phenomena in the sky,

600
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,430
I wonder if they're related to her.

601
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,580
Forcing entry into the city gate and holding a food festival,

602
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:39,150
there must be a reason.

603
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,860
Send someone to investigate.

604
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,230
Yes.

605
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:42,940
Wait.

606
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:46,380
Keep it discreet.

607
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,780
Master, you called for me?

608
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,390
This matter needs to be taken seriously.

609
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:56,580
No one is allowed to roam freely.

610
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,990
Lock up those who look good.

611
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,070
Pay them as usual,

612
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,270
but they can't show their faces

613
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,910
to Chairman Duan.

614
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,730
Why is that?

615
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,910
You fool,

616
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:06,870
how else

617
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,700
will he notice Qiao

618
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,000
among so many people?

619
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:14,260
Master, are you planning to match them?

620
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,210
Yes,

621
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,860
Mr. Duan is handsome

622
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:17,880
and comes from a good family,

623
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,890
and he's not engaged.

624
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:22,060
If Qiao takes a liking to him...

625
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,310
We can find a matchmaker.

626
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,190
No.

627
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:24,930
No.

628
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,920
Qiao came back to life.

629
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,970
I can't let her suffer any grievances.

630
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,770
Even if we need a matchmaker,

631
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:34,540
she has to take a fancy to him first.

632
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:35,730
So,

633
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,670
you're creating an opportunity?

634
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,340
Yes.

635
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,130
Our Qiao

636
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,690
has high standards.

637
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,340
Yes.

638
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,030
Mom,

639
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:52,650
what are you doing?

640
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:53,820
Caramelizing sugar.

641
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,350
It's the key for delicious braised pork.

642
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:14,670
My lady,

643
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,790
what are you doing?

644
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,100
Do you know why your

645
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,580
braised pork isn't tasty?

646
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,960
No idea.

647
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,350
Because you didn't caramelize the sugar.

648
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:26,820
To make good braised pork, you must caramelize the sugar first.

649
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,590
Like this.

650
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:28,580
My lady,

651
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,070
how do you suddenly know so much?

652
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,240
It's my family's secret recipe.

653
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,660
I'm not just teaching you,

654
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,360
I'm teaching all the chefs at Qingfeng Restaurant.

655
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,340
Chunfeng Restaurant focuses on vegetarian dishes,

656
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,590
so we'll focus on meat at Qingfeng Restaurant.

657
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,650
I don't believe we can't defeat them.

658
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,580
My lady,

659
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,390
Mr. Duan is here.

660
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,140
Great.

661
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:49,590
We must impress his taste buds

662
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,580
and persuade him to hold the food festival at Qingfeng Restaurant.

663
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,910
This is a perfect promotion opportunity.

664
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,450
This way, please.

665
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:03,300
Manager Gu.

666
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,340
Mr. Duan,

667
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,820
it's an honor to have you here.

668
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,110
Please come in.

669
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,030
Please.

670
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,010
Manager Gu,

671
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,650
what a feast.

672
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,220
Since you're here, we must treat you to the best dishes.

673
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:21,180
It's rare for you to come today,

674
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,260
please make yourself at home.

675
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,260
Thank you.

676
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,740
Try our braised pork.

677
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,670
How's the taste?

678
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:40,440
This braised pork is truly unique.

679
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:43,490
My daughter named it "So Delicious It Makes You Cry" Braised Pork.

680
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,620
Why would delicious food make one cry?

681
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,700
She said that eating this braised pork

682
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,300
brings a sense of happiness.

683
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:52,760
It's true.

684
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:53,340
Isn't it?

685
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,210
Eat more if you like it.

686
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,460
Please, have more.

687
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,570
Manager Gu,

688
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,750
does Miss Gu have a specific plan

689
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,010
for the food festival?

690
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,970
She proposes that each restaurant sets up a stall

691
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:08,430
on Yong'an Street in front of Qingfeng Restaurant,

692
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,210
with Qingfeng Restaurant as the main venue.

693
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:12,860
Her goal is to promote Qingfeng Restaurant?

694
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,960
No,

695
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,170
it's to promote Changqing.

696
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,510
It's just an idea,

697
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,870
we still need to discuss it with everyone.

698
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,780
Manager Gu,

699
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:23,740
please stay.

700
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,170
I'll try Miss Gu's cooking another day.

701
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,510
You're always welcome.

702
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:30,900
Young master.

703
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:32,760
Manager Gu,

704
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,540
I have a request.

705
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,860
I'd like to visit your kitchen to see

706
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,490
how this braised pork is made.

707
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,310
For the sake of the food festival's promotion,

708
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,280
I want to know it well.

709
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,150
Sure.

710
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:42,930
This way,

711
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,730
please.

712
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,150
Dongxi.

713
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:45,790
Go check

714
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,530
if Mr. Duan mentions the food festival.

715
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:48,050
Okay.

716
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:58,880
So soon?

717
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:16,000
Qi Chunjiao.

718
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,990
Aren't you training today?

719
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,570
I...

720
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:21,760
I'm rehabilitating recently.

721
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,840
but the intensity isn't high.

722
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,030
Then why were you standing at the station?

723
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,110
Actually...

724
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,820
Actually, I...

725
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:35,110
I was waiting for you.

726
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,830
I have something to tell you.

727
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,380
You...

728
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:41,370
I...

729
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,580
-You...

730
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,260

[China][Long live China]

732
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:50,900
I'm leaving.

733
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,350
Where are you going?

734
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:58,440
I'm going abroad for postgraduate studies next month.

735
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,820
Going abroad?

736
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,950
Will you come back?

737
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,220
I have it all planned.

738
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,380
I'll go abroad at 22,

739
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,490
come back at 25,

740
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:13,230
and settle in a major city.

741
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:20,290
So, you're not coming back?

742
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,890
Probably not.

743
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,140
Would your decision

744
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:35,340
change for someone?

745
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,450
Probably...

746
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:41,690
Probably not.

747
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,550
Don't come over.

748
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,040
I look terrible right now.

749
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:56,980
Don't come over.

750
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:58,140
Alright,

751
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,130

780
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,250

What are you doing?

808
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,390
Mr. Duan,

809
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,510
you said you wanted to see braised pork

810
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,170
and didn't allow me to come in.

811
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,270
You...

812
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:43,330
This is inappropriate.

813
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,230
Manager Gu,

814
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:44,820
I...

815
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,320
I'm really not what you think.

816
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,440
Duan Yu.

817
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,390
Are you real or fake?

818
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,250
Miss Gu,

819
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,000
I'm Duan Yu from the Duan family of Changqing.

820
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,300
Look at me carefully.

821
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:59,100
Do you really not recognize me?

822
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,980
We've never met.

823
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:04,850
By the way, how's your foot?

824
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,500
Right.

825
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,500
My lady, you can't take it off.

826
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,380
Why?

827
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,860
I'm just checking if I have blisters on my feet.

828
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,710
How could you

829
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,620
expose your feet in front of a man?

830
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,280
What?

831
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:22,170
A woman's feet can only seen by her husband.

832
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,490
Why not?

833
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,900
They're just feet.

834
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,450
My lady, you can't.

835
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:30,340
Alright,

836
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,420
I won't take it off.

837
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:36,390
Mr. Duan,

838
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,420
you've had skin contact with my daughter.

839
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,540
Except you,

840
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:42,930
she can't marry anyone else now.

841
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:43,710
Chairman Gu,

842
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:46,490
my master didn't see or touch anything.

843
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,410
How could there be skin contact?

844
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:49,740
He saw her foot,

845
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:50,820
didn't he?

846
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,180
And held her, right?

847
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,180
Gu Xingwu.

848
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,810
Miss Gu is talented and beautiful.

849
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:58,710
Many men are proposing to her.

850
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,340
That's true,

851
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:05,290
but Mr. Duan saw my daughter's feet after all.

852
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,190
You're forcing us to propose.

853
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:07,920
-I…
-Xing Si.

854
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:09,980
Don't be rude.

855
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,850
Manager Gu,

856
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,679
I'll leave for now.

857
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,889
Chairman Gu,

858
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:17,969
farewell.

859
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:19,620
Young Master.

860
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,420
Young Master.

861
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,250
Just now...

862
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,429
Just now, I was..

863
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:27,870
At fifteen, I had my mind set on learning.

864
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,600
At thirty, I stood firm.

865
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,900
At forty, I had no doubts.

866
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,219
At fifty, I understood the will of Heaven.

867
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:34,580
At sixty, my ear was obedient.

868
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,780
At seventy, I could follow my heart's desire

869
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,179
-without transgressing what was right.
-Sir.

870
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:38,739
Sir.

871
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,219
He was too sleepy

872
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,170
and fell asleep.

873
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,969
It has nothing to do with me.

874
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,700
What kind of storyline is this?

875
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:03,590
Rejected in modern times,

876
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,590
and reunited in ancient times.

877
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,600
Am I

878
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,980
about to have the highlight of my life?

879
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,980
What highlight?

880
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,150
My lady, what's wrong?

881
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:13,660
No...

882
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,090
No... nothing.

883
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,030
I just

884
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:19,200
saw a bug and got scared.

885
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,170
Wait at the door.

886
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,290
Why did you bite me?

887
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,220
Are you crazy?

888
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,350
What were you thinking?

889
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,680
You looked so obsessed.

890
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,350
None of your business.

891
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,610
Go back to your cellar.

892
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,450
I have a favor to ask.

893
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:34,730
What?

894
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,340
Can I take

895
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,470
a hot bath?

896
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,750
The cellar is damp,

897
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,910
and I got rashes.

898
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,460
What do I owe you in this life?

899
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,620
When are you leaving?

900
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,440
Lu Zizheng.

901
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:17,320
Where is Dongxi?

902
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:18,860
She's on guard.

903
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,770
Don't interrupt.

904
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,100
Do you trust her so much?

905
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,350
In this family,

906
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,460
she and my father

907
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,320
are the only ones who doesn't mind

908
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,330
that I came back from the dead.

909
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,020
I don't want them to get involved.

910
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:30,890
And then?

911
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,000
And you're

912
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,900
the only person I know here.

913
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,770
I don't want you to be caught either.

914
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,120
But staying here,

915
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,810
you're like a ticking bomb.

916
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:39,400
A bomb?

917
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:41,810
What's that?

918
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,320
Something that can explode.

919
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:50,320
Go on,

920
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,080
I'll go get some air.

921
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,330
My lady,

922
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,650
why are you here?

923
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:13,980
I'm fine.

924
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,600
Just talking to the moon.

925
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,100
Talking to the moon?

926
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,540
My lady,

927
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,220
why are you crying?

928
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,940
Dongxi.

929
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:29,100
They're all scared of me

930
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,940
since I came back to life.

931
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,380
Why aren't you scared?

932
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,700
It's good that you're alive.

933
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,690
I asked the monks at Shangqing Temple.

934
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:39,610
They said only good people can return to life.

935
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,740
Dongxi, you're so sweet.

936
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,350
You always lie differently each time.

937
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,260
My lady, don't cry.

938
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,620
I'll take care of you,

939
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,500
protect you,

940
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,750
and stay with you for a long, long time.

941
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,620
Thank you, Dongxi.
