But what?

93
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,280
Master Kongkong of the Shangqing Temple may know about it.

94
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,480
Master Kongkong?

95
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,190
He was the one telling me that I'm the Star of Rebellion.

96
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,650
So he was also the one telling you to gather the Four Treasures?

97
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:28,690
Then let's split up into two teams and go back to Changqing.

98
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:42,120
These are the Dragon and Phoenix Pendants my mother left to us.

99
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,580
My mother once said that

100
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,200
when Duan Yu gets married,

101
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,990
I should give this Phoenix Pendant to his wife.

102
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,600
Now,

103
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,920
I'll use this Phoenix Pendant as a token

104
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,800
and propose marriage to the Du Family.

105
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,080
Magistrate Du, I hope that you can let Ruoyun

106

107
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,280
Marriage is a happy connection for two families.

108
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,480
I hope that Duan Yu can be my son-in-law.

109
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,140
But I'm worried that

110
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,800
he only loves Gu Qingqiao.

111
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,240
Don't worry.

112
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,550
Marriage is an important thing.

As his elder brother, I'm just like his father.

116

The Duan Family really has strict rules about its family tradition.

117
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,270
If there's a marriage between the Duan Family and the Du Family,

118
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,030
it can also help to reassure the people in Changqing.

119

What you said is quite right.

120
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,909
With the marriage between our two families,

121
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:40,180

It's getting late. Just go to sleep first.

188
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,840
Master Ruan.

189
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,610
I'm sure we will meet again soon.

190
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:26,620
[Zen]

191
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,480
There's no one called Master Kongkong here?

192
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,470
That's impossible.

193
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,800
I saw him right here.

194
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,160
Amitabha.

195
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:36,360
We've never had a monk named Master Kongkong in our temple.

196
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,880
Have you misremembered it?

197
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,170
Is it possible that

198
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,800
he was a registered monk or Buddhist here for a short stay?

199
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,800
I've checked the name list of the registered guests.

200
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,010
There's no one named Kongkong.

201
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,440
Thank you, Priest.

202
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,340
[Zen]

203
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,320
Wait.

204
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,000
Priest,

205
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,080
can I ask you one more question?

206
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,730
Please go ahead.

207
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,420
Have you ever heard of

208
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,400
the Sword Spirit?

209
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,790
Sword Spirit?

210
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:06,480
Yes.

211
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,360
Someone once told me that

212
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,920
there is a spirit in the sword,

213
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,390
but it just needs to be awakened.

214
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,640
Speaking of that,

215
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,640
I once heard a priest say that

216
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,440
he chanted sutras with a wooden fish every day,

217
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,560
and as time went by,

218
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,470
the wooden fish was infected by Buddha's aura and had spiritual energy.

219
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:27,360
From then on, every time he chanted sutras, it would buzz secretly.

220
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,710
The Sword Spirit you mentioned

221
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,260
might be a spiritual object that is similar to the wooden fish.

222
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,370
Since chanting sutras can awaken a wooden fish,

223
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,020
is there a way to awaken the Sword Spirit?

224
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,590
But I don't know

225
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,760
the specific method.

226
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:45,960
Priest,

227
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,970
if you see Master Kongkong,

228
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,760
can you pass a message to him?

229
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,240
Please go ahead.

230
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,040
The Chosen Girl's life is at stake.

231
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,080
Please tell us what to do.

232
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,800
The so-called fate is like a circle.

233
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,350
The end is where the beginning is.

234
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,930
If you're destined to meet each other, there'll be consequences for the causes.

235
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:10,860
[Zen]

236
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,760
Amitabha.

237
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,490
How come there is no such a person here?

238
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,960
I clearly saw Master Kongkong here.

239
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,550
Master Kongkong saw through your identity at a glance,

240
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,360
and he knew about the Four Treasures.

241
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,450
Is he related to the Sacred Blood Sect?

242
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,330
That's impossible.

243
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,470
Can you not associate everything with the Sacred Blood Sect?

244
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,520
It's hard to say.

245
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,560
The Sacred Blood Sect always acts mysteriously.

246
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,600
There are many highly skilful martial artists in this sect.

247
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,120
They have also set up this trap for many years.

248
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,720
But there's still nothing we can do.

249
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,580
We can only depend on our fate now.

250
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,960
As the old saying goes,

251
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,390
life and death are determined by fate, while wealth and rank are determined by Heaven.

252
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,960
Maybe if I die here,

253
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,480
I can go back home and see my mother.

254
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,000
Qiao, I don't dare to...

255
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,030
Didn't the monk just say that

256
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,680
the end is where the beginning is?

257
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,520
Since everything started here,

258
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,610
I'll wait for the result here till the end.

259
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,850
Maybe obsession can change the the good and evil of fate.

260
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,090
I always mention "as the old saying goes".

261
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,920
These old sayings became mottoes

262
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,400
because things really happened, right?

263
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,120
Mottoes?

264
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,800
Mottoes.

265
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,730
I'll also give you a motto that I often use.

266
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,720
We should fight against our fate till the end,

267
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,200
because as long as you don't die, you'll become an elite by fighting against it till the end.

268
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,400
Whether you get hurt or not in the fight,

269
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,420
just fight against it till the end.

270
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,430
Qiao.

271
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,330
Are you alright?

272
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,560
I'm very fine.

273
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,560
I feel so relieved and relaxed now.

274
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,480
That's good. That's good.

275
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,440
Well,

276
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,980
shall we go down the mountain?

277
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,680
Let's go down the mountain.

278
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,740
I want to go to the Qingfeng Restaurant to see my father.

279
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,270
We're here again.

280
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,410
This year, I revisited the place where we had met each other.

281
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:15,120
Though things were still the same in spring, that lady was no long there, which made me so upset.

282
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,380
I need some time to find Master Kongkong.

283
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,200
Do you want to live outside the city?

284
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,060
It'll be safer.

285
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,520
Now I'm already

286
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,250
a tough man who doesn't care about life and death.

287
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,600
There's nothing to be afraid of.

288
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,750
But...

289
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,680
But what?

290
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:36,000
The orders for arresting me are posted all over the suburbs of the city.

291
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,980
I don't want to implicate you.

292
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,840
At worst, we can disregard life and death together.

293
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,920
Sometimes,

294
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,240
I really can't bear to let you leave me.

295
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,480
Only sometimes?

296
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,000
Of course.

297
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,920
You were the one who almost killed me.

298
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:01,770
In this world, only women and villains are very hard to deal with.

299
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,330
I'm not a woman.

300
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,700
I'm a handsome man now.

301
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,990
Do you think I should disguise myself again...

302
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,310
to cover up my beauty?

303
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,260
No need.

304
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:19,530
No one can recognize you when you're dressed like this.

305
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,790
The Duan Family finally proposed a marriage.

306
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,320
I thought that it would be the happiest thing.

307
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,000
But I don't feel happy at all.

308
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:33,660
My Lady, are you afraid of Miss Gu?

309
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,660
Miss Gu and her family lost everything overnight.

310
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,790
They are so pitiful.

311
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,910
I wonder how she is now.

312
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,040
The Duan Family proposed a marriage at this time.

313
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,060
Duan Yu will definitely hate me.

314
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,330
My Lady.

315
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,610
Marrying Young Master Duan

316
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,560
has always been your wish, hasn't it?

317
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,920
You've been waiting for so many years for this, haven't you?

318
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,920
But Duan Yu doesn't like me.

319
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,120
The woman he loves is Gu Qingqiao.

320
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,100
My silly lady,

321
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,960
Gu Qingqiao is a fugitive now.

322
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,680
I'm afraid she can hardly return to Changqing.

323
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,079
It's impossible for her and Young Master Duan to get married.

324
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,430
The marriage between you and Young Master Duan

325
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,839
is truly decided by parents and arranged by matchmakers.

326
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,900
It's justifiable.

327
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,240
You should be happy.

328
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,960
But I still don't feel happy.

329
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:19,240
My Lady, there's still plenty of time.

330
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,160
After you two get married,

331
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,760
you'll be the one staying by his side every day.

332
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,329
Young Master Duan will forget Miss Gu one day.

333
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,400
You have to listen to your inner voice.

334
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:31,440
What?

335
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,020
Miss Gu said that before.

336
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,320
I can feel it now.

337
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,080
Shaoyi, why are you here?

338
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,330
I'm here to ask you about your marriage with Duan Yu.

339
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,180
You know that

340
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,390
Duan Yu only loves Gu Qingqiao, don't you?

341
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,400
In this marriage,

342
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,120
you'll definitely be the one suffering losses in the end.

343
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,440
I don't know what on earth your father is thinking.

344
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,510
This marriage is a covenant of alliance between the Duan Family and the Du Family.

345
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,860
It's not just about a romantic relationship.

346
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,720
I'll marry the Duan Family's boy for their social connections,

347
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,680
while the Duan Family's boy will marry me for our Du Family's assistance.

348
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,480
This is a good thing for both families.

349
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,540
Then you and Duan Yu

350
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,480
will be sacrificed for benefits.

351
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,120
You...

352
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,440
have taken Gu Qingqiao's side now?

353
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,710
No, no, no.

354
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,740
All the nonsense about being sacrificed for benefits

355
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,340
has been said by Miss Gu.

356
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,860
Only she would take parents' decisions and matchmaker's words

357
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,070
as a joke.

358
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,220
But it's true that we'll be

359
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,430
sacrificed for benefits.

360
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,180
What would you like to eat?

361
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,890
The owner of the Qingfeng Restaurant has been changed?

362
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,500
Sir, you know what?

363
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,720
The Qingfeng Restaurant is the property of the Chunfeng Restaurant now.

364
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,400
Let's go.

365
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,840
After you left,

366
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,480
the Qingfeng Restaurant was sold to Manager Yang at a low price.

367
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,360
Magistrate Du was the mastermind behind Manager Yang.

368
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,120
It was inappropriate for our young master to interfere openly.

369
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,030
But he has been taking care of Mr. Gu privately all this time.

370
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,470
So, don't worry.

371
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,720
Let's go.

372
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,490
I want to see my father as soon as possible.

373
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:08,080
Okay.

374
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,920
Xing Si.

375
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,280
Miss Du.

376
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,800
You are back.

377
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,160
Has it been a safe trip?

378
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,290
Everything is fine.

379
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,160
You didn't even tell me you were back.

380
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,560
I've just come back.

381
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,260
Besides...

382
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,710
What else do you want to say?

383
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,960
Besides, you are going to get married soon.

384
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,600
You are quite well-informed.

385
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,440
I'm just happy for you, right?

386
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,080
Your wish finally came true.

387
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,510
You're happy for me?

388
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,580
On what grounds can you be happy for me?

389
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,770
Did you make Ruoyun angry again?

390
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,900
Alright. Let's go.

391
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,040
Three pancakes, please.

392
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,290
The ingredients are quite enough in the pancakes sold by you. They're really delicious.

393
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,920
Thank you. Please enjoy your meal.

394
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,760
Freshly baked pancakes!

395
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,520
Just take a rest, My Lord.

396
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,520
I'm not tired.

397
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,840
Let's sell more pancakes

398
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,700
so that we can add some dishes to our dinner tonight.

399
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,150
Give me a pancake!

400
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,880
Okay. Coming.

401
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,440
Two pancakes.

402
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,120
Qiao...

403
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,550
Let's talk later. See you again.

404
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,900
Let's go! Let's go!

405
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,920
Get out of the way!

406
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,110
Let me take a look.

407
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,820
Si.

408
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,600
It's all my fault.

409
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,470
The Gu Family ended up like this because of me.

410
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,740
Duan Yu also got injured because of me.

411
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,140
Now even Ruoyun is involved in this matter.

412
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:54,200
Why does everything have something to do with me?

413
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,260
A person's fate is decided by Heaven.

414
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,370
It can't be changed.

415
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,730
I'd like to ask you for help.

416
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,280
What do you want me to do?

417
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,280
Just kill me.

418
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,440
Are you crazy?

419
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,850
If I'm dead,

420
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,210
Duan Yu will be free from all this trouble.

421
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,510
Everyone will be free from all this trouble, too.

422
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:16,160
It'll be as if nothing had happened.

423
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,340
This plan is good.

424
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,690
Then all of you will be free from all this trouble,

425
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,560
but I'll be dead.

426
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,720
Buddy, can you be more serious?

427
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,350
Life and death are important things. Don't joke about them.

428
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,080
Okay. I'll be more serious.

429
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,960
I'll definitely kill you seriously.

430
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,070
Then I'll kill myself.

431
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,120
After that, people will think we committed suicide for love seriously.

432
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,970
In that case, Young Master Duan, Ruoyun and your father

433
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,470
will feel ashamed forever.

434
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,720
Do you think it'll be serious enough?

435
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,350
I used to like a saying very much.

436
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,080
It says, "When the sky falls, those tall people will prop it up."

437
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,740
Now it seems

438
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,510
to be nonsense like a fart.

439
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:49,770
A...

440
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,640
A fart?

441
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,320
It stinks and makes a big noise,

442
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,520
but there's nothing in the end.

443
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,960
Alright, Miss Gu.

444
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,520
Well, can we change the subject?

445
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,160
You don't want to kill me,

446
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,680
because you are too selfish.

447
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm selfish?

448
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,720
If I'm dead,

449
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:08,680
Ruoyun will marry Duan Yu.

450
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,830
You'll be so sad, won't you?

451
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,880
Miss Gu,

452
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,520
can we stop talking about death?

453
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,300
It's such a serious topic.

454
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,240
Okay.

455
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,080
For the sake that the woman you love has been taken away,

456
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,880
I'll stop making you feel worse.

457
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,680
Alright.

458
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,600
I'll go back to the inn myself.

459
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,730
No need to see me off.

460
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,640
Sit down, please.

461
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,670
Sorry to keep you waiting.

462
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:38,730
What's the matter?

463
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,200
I want to talk to you

464
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,480
about our marriage.

465
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,800
It's decided by our parents and arranged by matchmakers.

466
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,860
I don't want to hear you talk about it.

467
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,240
You're quite clear that

468
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,640
I'm engaged to another woman.

469
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,320
Your elder brother has said that

470
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,840
your previous engagement with Gu Qingqiao was cancelled a long time ago.

471
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,190
You should know

472
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,080
what I'm thinking.

473
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,160
So,

474
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,530
you're going to reject the engagement between us?

475
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:04,960
If I break off the engagement with the excuse that I'm destined to be a jinx of my wife,

476
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,690
it won't hurt your reputation.

477
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:12,330
Then aren't you afraid that it'll hurt my feelings?

478
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,510
Did Gu Qingqiao come back with you?

479
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,590
I asked you out

480
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,800
to talk about the marriage between you and me clearly.

481
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,150
Duan Yu, don't change the subject.

482
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,530
Is she back?

483
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,170
Does she know that we're going to get married?

484
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,080
Ruoyun, this is something between her and me.

485
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,390
It's something between you and her?

486
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,360
What about me?

487
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,200
What should I do?

488
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,130
Duan Yu.

489
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,640
How long have you known her?

490
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,040
How long have I known you?

491
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,840
You even risked your life for her.

492
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,840
What about me?

493
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,670
Have you ever thought about me?

494
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:41,880
Our Duan Family in Changqing and your Du Family have been friends for generations.

495
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,410
I've always treated you as my younger sister.

496
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,840
You treat me as your younger sister?

497
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,840
If I say yes to you,

498
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,240
will your elder brother agree?

499
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,440
Will my father agree?

500
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,640
Aren't you afraid that if you reject the engagement with me,

501
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,080
it'll make the Gu Family's situation get worse?

502
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,040
Don't forget that

503
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,720
Gu Qingqiao is a fugitive.

504
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,680
Du Ruoyun.

505
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,240
She's not a fugitive.

506
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,000
If we can't get married,

507
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,800
my father's fear of the Duan Family

508
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,530
will never be quelled.

509
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,720
The Duan Family and the Du Family were on bad terms,

510
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,980
and you fell out with your elder brother.

511
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,400
As long as Gu Qingqiao is still alive,

512
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,770
Changqing won't be peaceful.

513
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:14,600
Du Ruoyun!

514
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,720
Are you threatening me?

515
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,200
I'm not threatening you.

516
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:23,490
Actually, before I came here, I was still thinking about

517
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:25,460
whether I should marry you or not.

518
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,040
But now I've figured it out.

519
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,380
Why do I have to marry

520
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,400
a selfish man who is going to ruin

521
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,600
his own family for his affections towards a woman?

522
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,400
Yes, I'm doing this for my affections towards a woman.

523
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,280
I'm sorry.

524
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,240
I'm not the only one whom you should say sorry to.

525
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,360
You should also say sorry to the Duan Family

526
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,720
and Gu Qingqiao.

527
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,020
Qiao is innocent.

528
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,680
Qiao...

529
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,670
If she had a conscience,

530
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,640
she shouldn't have come back to Changqing to harm other people.

531
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,640
Nor should she have appeared in Changqing again.

532
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,480
What do you mean?

533
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,880
I saw her being with Xing Si with my own eyes.

534
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,840
Du Ruoyun.

535
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,870
If you dare to hurt Qiao,

536
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,180
I won't let you off!

537
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,860
[Duan]

538
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,850
Is Xing Si not back yet?

539
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,120
No, he's not back yet.

540
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,840
Come on. Let's go out.

541
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,640
The good show has begun.

542
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,500
Candied haws!

543
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:41,890
Candied haws!

544
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,950
-Si.
-Shaoyi.

545
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,090
Have you seen Miss Gu?

546
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,480
No. What’s wrong?

547
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,160
Miss Gu is missing.

548
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,160
What?

549
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,330
Isn't Gu Qingqiao with you?

550
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,260
How come she's missing?

551
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,740
She was with me.

552
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,150
But later, she insisted on going back alone.

553
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:00,920
I was worried about her.

554
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,610
When I went back to look for her, she was already missing.

555
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:03,640
Then tell my uncle about it at once.

556
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,280
No.

557
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,800
I can't tell Young Master about it.

558
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,480
Why?

559
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,120
It'll be a big problem if I tell him.

560
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,120
What should we do?

561
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,250
Come with me.

562
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:11,470
Where are we going?

563
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,490
Who are you?

564
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,970
You kidnapped me.

565
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,060
You have to tell me who you are, right?

566
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,570
Is anyone there?

567
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,610
Help! Help!

568
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:26,890
Help!

569
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,330
Who... Who are you?

570
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,080
Miss Gu.

571
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,400
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

572
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,320
Du Ruoyun?

573
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,950
You're the one who has kidnapped me?

574
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:46,940
How have you been?

575
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,600
Why... Why did you kidnap me?

576
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,760
I didn't kidnap you.

577
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,270
I saw you being with Xing Si,

578
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,910
but it was inconvenient for me to get reunited with you on the street.

579
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:57,370
Then why did you send two people to follow me?

580
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,320
I didn't send them to follow you.

581
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,320
I think it was the sheriff who did it.

582
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,130
Thank you for saving me.

583
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,760
I have something to tell you.

584
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,400
I didn't mean to save you.

585
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:33,320
But since you knew that someone was following you,

586
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,760
why didn't you run away?

587
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,730
Runing away?

588
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,760
Where could I go?

589
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,530
I had no one to rely on after all.

590
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,440
Did you deliberately ask Xing Si to leave there?

591
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,170
I didn't want to implicate him.

592
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,880
Ruoyun, just cut to the chase.

593
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,990
I thought that as the Duan Family had proposed a marriage to me,

594
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:55,760
I had won.

595
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,360
Now I seem to understand

596
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,600
why they all helped you

597
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:01,840
and like you.

598
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,110
Actually, if you didn't come to see me,

599
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,300
I would still go to see you.

600
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,340
Do you want me to break off the engagement with the Duan Family?

601
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,680
No.

602
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,320
I want to tell you that

603
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,710
there will be plenty of time

604
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,000
for you and Duan Yu to be with each other.

605
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,990
He will forget me sooner or later.

606
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,160
What do you mean?

607
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,950
I won't marry Duan Yu.

608
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,690
I'll leave sooner or later.

609
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:32,860
I don't believe it.

610
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,650
Why do you refuse to believe it?

611
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,000
Because of me,

612
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,840
the Duan Family and the Du Family became enemies,

613
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,470
and Duan Yu also fell out with his elder brother.

614
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:41,330
He even wasted his bright future.

615
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,720
I also...

616
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,850
What?

617
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,080
I also don't know what else will happen in the future.

618
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,320
Actually, what you said is what I want to say.

619
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,880
It looks like you really love Duan Yu.

620
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,200
Yes.

621
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,040
But I actually hope that I can just like him.

622
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:05,920
Ruoyun.

623
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,280
Actually, I have something to tell you.

624
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,600
Go ahead.

625
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:13,580
If your spouse doesn't love you,

626
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,860
it'll be painful for you to be with him all your life.

627
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,340
Think about it.

628
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,950
Without me,

629
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,180
Duan Yu would marry you.

630
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:27,460
But do you think his purpose would be the connection with the Du Family

631
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,390
or really marrying you, Du Ruoyun?

632
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,880
Isn't it too unfair for you

633
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:32,620
to live like this all your life?

634
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,960
I grew up with Duan Yu.

635
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:39,350
I decided to marry him when I was very young.

636
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,090
But later, after we grew up,

637
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,640
he was getting

638
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,770
farther and farther away from me instead.

639
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,120
When we reached the age of marriage,

640
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,170
he just evaded me directly.

641
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,610
Sometimes,

642
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,390
when a girl is in love,

643
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,030
maybe she just likes herself in love better

644
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,370
and ignores the other one's feelings.

645
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:11,280
Actually, there's a boy who has had a crush on you all this time.

646
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,880
Do you know that?

647
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,770
It looks like you know that.

648
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,280
But we can't be together.

649
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,760
Regardless of the social status in this era,

650
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,750
let's just talk about love.

651
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,730
Xing Si also grew up with you.

652
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,440
He has had a crush on you since childhood, too.

653
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,640
He wants to marry you,

654
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,680
but you don't like him.

655
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,670
If you still marry him in the end,

656
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,030
which of you do you think will be happier?

657
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,180
But I don't want to give up just like that.

658
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:42,880
If you don't want to give up,

659
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,080
you two will become a miserable couple.

660
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,760
What if Duan Yu takes a concubine in the future?

661
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,720
What will you do?

662
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,480
Will you be sad or upset?

663
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,720
Could it be that

664
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,260
you're willing to be his concubine?

665
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,200
What concubine? I...

666
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,670
I'm not qualified. Do you understand?

667
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,600
What I said just now is all in vain.

668
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,640
Forget it.

669
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,600
Let's not talk about Duan Yu.

670
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,480
What's your plan for your future life?

671
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,200
I'll take one step at a time to deal with the problems.

672
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,610
I'll live as long as I can.

673
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,880
How about I send you out of the city?

674
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,660
I still have some things to do.

675
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,240
I'll leave after the things are done.

676
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,000
Then you and Duan Yu...

677
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:35,070
I won't compete with you for being his wife or concubine.

678
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,520
That's good.

679
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,680
But this is my attitude.

680
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,530
I can't decide it for Duan Yuan.

681
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,850
Who are you?

682
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,440
Are you blind?

683
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,050
You don't even know who I am?

684
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,050
Get out of the way!

685
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,760
You'll be killed if you don't step aside at once!

686
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,690
No one is allowed to enter the room!

687
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,680
This is great.

688
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:11,910
Hurry!

689
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,840
What happened to you two?

690
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,600
So this is the result of your kidnapping?

691
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,440
You were kidnapped by them instead?

692
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,440
It's none of your business.

693
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,940
It was Ruoyun who saved me.

694
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,300
Miss Ruoyun.

695
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:24,710
How are you?

696
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,320
Can't you see how I am?

697
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,550
My Lord.

698
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,770
It's getting late. Just go to bed.

699
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,370
I'll wait a little longer.

700
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:48,380
Maybe

701
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:51,600
Qiao will come back to take a look at me when it's midnight.

702
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,550
My Lord,

703
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,080
could it be that

704
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,070
you mistook that person for Lady Qiao?

705
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:57,400
How would I mistake another girl for Qiao?

706
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,430
You can go to bed first.

707
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:00,680
I'll wait a little longer.

708
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,680
Maybe Qiao will be back soon.

709
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,120
Qiao.

710
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,870
Duan Yu, thank you for looking for me everywhere.

711
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,360
I was too careless.

712
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,920
I just wanted to take a look at my father from afar.

713
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,560
But I didn't expect that I would be targeted by the officers from the government.

714
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,880
It's good that you're fine.

715
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,460
I sent someone to look for you in the south of the city.

716
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,640
There was also no trace of you in the Gu Family.

717
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,040
Where on earth did you go?

718
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,730
I didn't do my job well.

719
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:30,280
In order not to alert the officers from the government,

720
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,810
I didn't bring Miss Gu back.

721
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,040
It’s not Si's fault.

722
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:37,740
I've returned here safely anyway.

723
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,430
No place in Changqing is safe now.

724
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,750
You can live here temporarily.

725
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:45,010
I'll find a chance to let you see Mr. Gu.

726
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:52,100
Just live here temporarily.

727
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,300
If anything happens,

728
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,560
it'll be convenient for me to come in time.

729
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,320
It's okay.

730
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,980
I'm just a little tired.

731
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,120
Alright. Just have a rest.

732
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:28,570
Master Ruan.

733
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:34,989
My father used to be the owner of a restaurant.

734
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:39,159
Now he has to make a living by selling pancakes.

735
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,340
I really want to tell him that

736
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:46,790
I'm living quite a good life now.

737
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,070
However,

738
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,989
we obviously met each other,

739
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:59,080
but we couldn't get reunited with each other.

740
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,840
Please tell me

741
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,920
what I should do.

742
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:15,800
It's so hot.

743
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,990
Is it my illusion?

744
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,510
Qiao.

745
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:26,700
Qiao!

746
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,550
My Lord, it's me.

747
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,370
Now the officers are keeping a close eye on us outside.

748
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:31,960
Maybe Lady Gu won't come back.

749
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,600
Why don't you go take a rest?

750
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,520
No.

751
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,020
Maybe Qiao went to the south of the city to see me.

752
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:38,850
Dongxi.

753
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:39,920
Let's go open the stall.

754
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,880
My Lord.

755
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:42,890
You didn't sleep all night.

756
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,490
The others and I will go.

757
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,590
No.

758
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:46,940
I have to go.

759
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,720
I can't stop worrying about it.

760
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,960
I have good eyesight.

761
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,080
I can recognize Qiao at a glance.

762
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,360
My Lord!

763
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,200
Don't worry.

764
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,870
I can hang in.

765
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,020
I've asked around.

766
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:59,070
Mr. Gu is still running his stall in the south of the city today.

767
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,200
In that case, I can see my father today?

768
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,360
Young Master, bad news!

769
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,480
My Lord.

770
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,510
What do you guys want to do?

771
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,490
Don't you comply with the law?

772
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,850
I've warned you before.

773
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,840
You offended someone that couldn't be offended.

774
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,400
I...

775
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,200
What are you doing?

776
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,400
Do you want to kill me?

777
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,560
Listen up, everyone.

778
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,160
This man is called Gu Xingwu.

779
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,320
His daughter, Gu Qingqiao, is a fugitive.

780
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,080
Now even their servant wants to kill people.

781
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,160
Go hit them!

782
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,320
Let's hit them!

783
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,240
You can't go.

784
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,410
This may be a trap,

785
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,890
which is used to catch you.

786
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,850
Xing Si, take good care of her.

787
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:35,570
Okay.

788
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:36,510
Step aside!

789
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,790
Well done! They should get beaten as they bullied honest people.

790
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:54,950
Step aside!

791
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,880
-Qiao!
-My Lady.

792
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,320
-Yang Chunfeng
-Father!

793
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,400
Let go of Gu Qingqiao!

794
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,030
Chairman Duan, I'm not the one who wants to catch her.

795
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:07,190
If I ask them to let her go, it doesn't count.

796
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,980
Young Master Duan, I beg you.

797
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,350
Please save Qiao.

798
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,280
Let go of her!

799
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,170
Gu Qingqiao is a fugitive.

800
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:18,340
Do you want to be an accomplice, Young Master Duan?

801
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:19,610
Young Master.

802
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:20,890
Father.

803
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,230
Don't worry.

804
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,550
I'm innocent.

805
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:25,690
I'll go home in two days.

806
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,280
Take her away.

807
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,610
It's not allowed to visit her?

808
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,350
The magistrate has just said that

809
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,240
Gu Qingqiao has committed a capital crime.

810
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,400
We can't be lenient with her.

811
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,330
It's not even allowed to visit her.

812
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,150
Well...

813
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,920
Please take good care of her.

814
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,740
If she is well looked after,

815
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,900
there will be other rewards for you.

816
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,810
No problem. No problem.

817
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:59,350
Everything has been arranged well.

818
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:02,230
But the warden said that she had been convicted of a capital crime.

819
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:05,520
I'm afraid my elder brother had an agreement with Magistrate Du.

820
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,760
They intended to kill Qiao.

821
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:08,870
What should we do?

822
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:11,150
Let's beat the drum to seek justice.

823
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,850
Uncle, haven't you said that

824
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,800
Magistrate Du is most afraid that this case will be revealed to the public,

825
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,730
so he won't retry the case in court?

826
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,510
What if we beat the drum to convict Qiao?

827
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,240
-Lord Magistrate.
-Lord Magistrate.

828
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:32,830
You may leave.

829
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,410
-Yes!
-Yes!

830
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,570
I just want to take a bet.

831
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,230
Lord Magistrate, as such a high-ranking official,

832
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:51,020
you're here to see me personally.

833
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:51,880
There must be something.

834
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,920
Interesting.

835
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:55,830
In that case, let's get straight to the point.

836
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,700
Where is the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword?

837
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:04,730
How did you know the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword?

838
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:10,900
What do you want?

839
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:12,120
Just tell me.

840
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,910
I want to prove my own innocence.

841
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,360
I have nothing to do with the Mantra cultists.

842
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,590
I also didn't kidnap Duan Shaoyi.

843
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,380
If you give the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword to me,

844
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,670
I can say yes to you.

845
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,460
I've hidden the sword in a safe place.

846
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,060
If you want to get the sword,

847
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,650
just acquit and release me.

848
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,090
If I die,

849
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,640
no one can get the sword.

850
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,160
Gu Qingqiao, you're in my hands now.

851
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,540
If you don't tell me,

852
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,560
I won't do anything to you.

853
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,960
But I can't guarantee that

854
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,990
I won't do anything to Gu Xingwu.

855
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,440
How despicable!

856
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:48,280
If you want to get the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword,

857
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,320
then I want to ask what your actual identity is, Lord Magistrate.

858
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,280
There is a limit for my patience.
