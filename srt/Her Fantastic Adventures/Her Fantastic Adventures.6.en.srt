[Her Fantastic Adventures]

3
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,440
Hello, Si.

4
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:52,720
Si!

5
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:53,890
Help! Hurry up!

6
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:54,450
Hurry up!

7
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:54,970
Si!

8
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,070
Help!

9
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:56,810
Guard Xing!

10
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,050
What's wrong?

11
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:58,710
Si!

12
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:00,030
Si, how are you?

13
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,050
-Guard Xing!
-Carry him inside now.

14
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:01,690
-Okay.
-Okay.

15
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,690
Okay. Let's go. Come on.

16
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,410
Do it gently.

17
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:03,940
Let's go.

18
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:14,310
Doctor.

19
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,190
How is he?

20
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,650
Young Master Duan.

21
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,510
I think he has been poisoned.

22
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,450
Why did he suddenly get poisoned?

23
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,910
And he was even poisoned in the Gu Residence.

24
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,370
He was fine when I was talking to him.

25
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,600
He suddenly fainted.

26
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,690
Tu Jia insisted on sending him back to his residence.

27
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,350
The member of our Duan Family can't die outside.

28
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:34,390
I...

29
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,300
Miss Gu.

30
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,350
Please go back home first.

31
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,700
I have some family affairs to deal with.

32
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,530
Young Master Duan.

33
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,490
Go back first.

34
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,600
If you want to tell him something, just say it later.

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,579
[Episode 6]

36
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,329
Xing Si is a thoughtful person.

37
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:53,730
It's really strange that

38
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:54,930
he has been poisoned.

39
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:57,730
Young Master.

40
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,370
Forgive me for saying this.

41
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,960
You must have noticed that

42
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,490
Xing Si's situation of getting poisoned this time

43
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,880
is quite similar to Su's poisoning case which happened many years ago.

44
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,320
Could it be that...

45
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,330
Xing Si can't die.

46
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,810
We must save him.

47
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:11,730
Young Master Duan.

48
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:12,980
The silver needle did react to it.

49
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,090
It's not the same as the poison for Su, which took effect very quickly.

50
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,880
Will it hurt his life?

51
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:18,930
I think he's fine for now.

52
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,530
I've applied acupuncture to him and sealed his blood vessels.

53
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,100
We need to ask for help at once.

54
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,050
Who should we ask for help?

55
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:23,810
Doctor Hu.

56
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,810
He's highly skilled at detoxification in the Martial Arts World.

57
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,870
I'll go invite him.

58
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,290
Come back as soon as possible.

59
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,410
Your buddy's life will all depend on you.

60
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,130
Step aside!

61
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,340
Step aside!

62
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:33,610
Step aside!

63
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,340
Yuan Da.

64
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,050
I...

65
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,490
I... I... I...

66
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:54,530
I... I...

67
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,610
I'm not.

68
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,100
You still denied it?

69
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,170
The Records and Name Lists of Wuyi Guards.

70
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,730
There are records about all the incidents that every Wuyi Guard has participated in.

71
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,220
The fact that Yuan Da killed a man and escaped

72
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,550
has also been recorded.

73
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,740
No... I didn't.

74
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,890
You said no, but is the truth really like that?

75
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,020
How dare you deny it?

76
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,140
You said he was lying. You have to show the evidence.

77
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:37,800
Yuan Da.

78
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:38,730
Tell them

79
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,110
why you killed Su.

80
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,010
Tu Jia,

81
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,170
are you out of your mind,

82
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,400
or is he out of his mind?

83
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,060
If he really was a fugitive of the Wuyi Guards,

84
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,650
with so many Wuyi Guards living in the house,

85
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,290
why did he cook for them without even escaping?

86
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,490
He would even try to kill Xing Si?

87
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,150
Do you think this makes sense?

88
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:51,970
Xing Si was the one

89
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,570
who witnessed him killing Su.

90
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,690
We can only prove it after Xing Si wakes up.

91
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,090
If Young Master Duan had not helped you,

92
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,140
you three might not have been able to beat him in the fighting.

93
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,050
It's not a problem for him to have a head-on fight with you guys.

94
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,090
Then why did he poison Si?

95
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,410
He even poisoned Si in his own residence?

96
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,370
Was he stupid?

97
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,570
Stop making excuses.

98
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:06,970
Take him back to the jail first.

99
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,210
Then let's interrogate him slowly.

100
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:08,850
Yes!

101
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,420
No! Don't touch him!

102
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,220
Miss Gu.

103
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:12,720
If you go on being so rude,

104
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,170
don't blame me for offending you.

105
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,160
Stop, you all.

106
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,200
Young Master.

107
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,270
I must

108
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,210
take Yuan Da back to interrogate him.

109
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,740
No! Da is my family.

110
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,250
You can't take him away without evidence.

111
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,290
I know his personalities well.

112
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,700
He wouldn't do such a thing.

113
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,930
Give me some more time.

114
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,610
I'll make him tell the whole story.

115
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,690
We haven't figured out the truth yet.

116
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,330
Miss Gu, please

117
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,130
keep a close eye on Yuan Da for me.

118
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,330
Don't worry, Young Master Duan.

119
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:48,810
Doctor.

120
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,409
What's going on?

121
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,090
Young Master Duan.

122
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,610
Xing Si broke through the sealed blood vessels by himself and woke up.

123
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,490
He's been like this after he woke up.

124
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,850
Then can he survive now?

125
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,090
He's fine for now.

126
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,210
But I'm afraid he has been poisoned by food toxins.

127
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,810
We need to find the antidote.

128
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,310
Tu Jia.

129
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,970
Send someone to pick up Shaoyi and Doctor Hu.

130
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,030
Yes, Young Master.

131
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,130
Food toxins?

132
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,370
Da!

133
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:18,920
Da!

134
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,530
Dongxi!

135
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:31,270
Dongxi!

136
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,610
My Lady.

137
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,780
Dongxi.

138
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:38,750
Have I ever treated you badly?

139
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,090
You... You've helped me a lot.

140
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,540
How would you treat me badly?

141
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,190
Then do you know that

142
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:46,560
after you let Da go,

143
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,159
the Gu Family will be implicated?

144
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,890
I... I...

145
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:50,890
I didn't do it.

146
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:54,010
I don't know that Da has left.

147
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,830
Do you still want to lie to me?

148
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,500
I gave you this hairpin at that time.

149
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,800
I'm giving this gift to you.

150
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,090
Be good to me from now on.

151
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,450
I will serve you well for the rest of my life.

152
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,650
It was still on your head this morning.

153
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,910
How dare you say that you didn't let Da go?

154
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,130
My Lady.

155
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,690
I didn't mean to harm you.

156
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,370
But... But they wanted to kill Da.

157
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,410
I was scared.

158
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,370
You were scared?

159
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,480
You were scared, so you let him go?

160
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,340
Why didn't you discuss it with me?

161
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,730
I was afraid that there would be no chance after a long time.

162
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:34,730
There would be no chance?

163
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,720
Why did you think there would be no chance?

164
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,460
Don't you believe in what Da said?

165
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,450
I believe in Da.

166
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,730
I don't think he's a fugitive who killed a man.

167
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,320
You believe in him?

168
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,090
If you believe in him, then why did you let him go?

169
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,130
Now people will think that he ran away to escape punishment.

170
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,800
If Wuyi Guards catch him,

171
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,400
he will be killed.

172
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,180
My Lady.

173
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,500
It's all my fault.

174
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,680
Please save Da.

175
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:54,790
Please save Da!

176
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,840
My dear girl, stop kneeling.

177
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:57,610
Just tell me

178
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,960
where you hid Da.

179
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,530
Young Master Duan.

180
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,650
Take me to the kitchen.

181
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:12,450
The kitchen?

182
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,980
How come there are

183
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,210
so many mushrooms in the residence?

184
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,830
Then you have to ask Da.

185
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,180
Ask Yuan Da to come here.

186
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,150
I want to ask him about something.

187
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,220
Well...

188
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,010
Just wait till Xing Si wakes up, and then you can ask him.

189
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,140
Xing Si has waken up.

190
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,850
But he suffers from dementia now.

191
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:29,650
That's great.

192
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:30,380
What?

193
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,840
That's great?

194
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:35,049
I mean, it's great that Xing Si has woken up.

195
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,460
So, just ask him to come here.

196
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,340
I want to ask him about something face to face.

197
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:46,770
What's wrong?

198
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,190
Da ran away.

199
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,480
He ran away?

200
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,130
What happened?

201
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,730
Young Master Duan, calm down.

202
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:54,820
Listen to me.

203
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,050
As long as you promise not to kill Da,

204
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,930
I'll take you to see him.

205
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,820
You know where he is?

206
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,250
Probably.

207
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,890
Probably?

208
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,440
What do you mean?

209
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,660
I mean, I basically know where he is.

210
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,570
But...

211
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:13,630
Fine.

212
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:14,850
I promise you.

213
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,370
Young Master Duan.

214
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,050
You're really a man with a fake poker face.

215
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:18,930
What do you mean?

216
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:19,990
Nothing. Nothing.

217
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:20,890
I'm just...

218
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,290
complimenting you.

219
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:24,480
Tu Jia!

220
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,380
No!

221
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,210
Don't ask them to come.

222
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,070
Let's go alone.

223
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:27,770
Why?

224
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,730
What if they can't control their emotions well?

225
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:31,930
It's too risky.

226
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,750
What do you mean this time?

227
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,730
With your martial arts skills, you're quite capable of subduing Da.

228
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,050
You don't need any assistance at all.

229
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,570
Besides, you still have me

230
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:40,530
You?

231
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:41,690
That's right. Me!

232
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,730
I just want to be protected by you alone.

233
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:44,970
I don't want to go with a group of people.

234
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,030
You don't like those who hunt wolves?

235
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,670
You're indeed a big hero. Young Master Duan.

236
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:52,940
Tu Jia!

237
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:55,860
Young Master.

238
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,770
Take the mushrooms back to our residence and show them to Doctor Hu.

239
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,290
If it was really because of them,

240
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,010
we'll know how to treat his disease.

241
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:02,570
Yes.

242
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,370
Take them all away.

243
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,270
Let's go.

244
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,060
Are you sure this is the way?

245
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,170
This road is covered by a thick layer of leaves.

246
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,860
Neither footprints nor traces of wheels can be seen.

247
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,120
It's even so desolate.

248
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,510
How can you be sure that it's this way?

249
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,330
Because I know the arts of tracking.

250
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,450
You know the arts of tracking?

251
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,770
I've learned them from TV.

252
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:27,690
What's TV?

253
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,370
It's interesting to watch it anyway.

254
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,170
I'll tell you the details later.

255
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,550
If you torture Xing Si like this,

256
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,910
will he die?

257
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,300
Hasn't Doctor Hu said that

258
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,530
those who are poisoned by food toxins

259
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,170
must vomit all the toxins out before taking medicine?

260
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,050
He's been vomiting for a long time.

261
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,210
Just let him remember it.

262
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,640
He insisted on taking a bite of someone else's mushrooms.

263
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,940
Because of that, he's feeling so unwell now.

264
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,090
That's enough.

265
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,020
I'm doing this for his own good.

266
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,410
Do you know that because of him,

267
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,100
Duan Yu has brought much trouble to the entire

268
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,960
Duan Residence and Gu Residence?

269
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,300
Though Duan Yu always scolded Xing Si,

270
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:07,170
he really helped him when his life was at stake.

271
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,430
Of course.

272
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,490
They grew up together.

273
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,330
They have never been separated from each other.

274
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,930
Duan Yu asked Xing Si to punish me.

275
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,530
Xing Si just followed his order so resolutely.

276
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:25,930
Xing Si, are you okay?

277
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,530
I'm fine.

278
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:28,820
Come on.

279
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,570
Si.

280
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,650
You're not quite healthy.

281
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,690
Shaoyi.

282
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,950
Take some medicine first.

283
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:51,570
You may leave.

284
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:52,410
Yes.

285
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,240
Xing Si.

286
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,530
Your dialogue novel is really good.

287
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,810
Si, I've told Miss Ruoyun about your ability

288
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,270
to write dialogue novels.

289
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,630
She really admires it.

290
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,050
By the way, Si,

291
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,450
there are many people reading your dialogue novel.

292
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,770
How about we do business?

293
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,690
You'll be in charge of writting novels,

294
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:18,930
while I'll ask some people to copy them and sell them.

295
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,660
We'll share the money equally.

296
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:25,150
But my share of the money was all taken away by Young Master.

297
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,170
Duan Yu has also read your dialogue novel?

298
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,900
He even got a share of the money?

299
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,550
What a scumbag!

300
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,710
Waiter, give me a pot of tea.

301
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:37,510
Okay.

302
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,260
Has Yuan Da ever said that

303
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,690
he was once a Wuyi Guard?

304
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,730
Are you interrogating me?

305
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,610
I'm worried that after being cheated,

306
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,810
you would still be so silly as to help him calculate the amount of money.

307
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,890
Though Da and I are not a family,

308
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,290
we are more like a family.

309
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,370
He has

310
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,880
never told me about his previous identity,

311
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:58,850
but

312
00:12:59,010 --> 00:12:59,890
I trust him.

313
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,420
Isn't it too easy for you to trust someone?

314
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,450
I trust you, too.

315
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,650
Yuan Da used to be a member of my Wuyi Guards.

316
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,170
He was kind of a subordinate of mine.

317
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,100
I won't kill him.

318
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,570
I just want to know what food he gave Xing Si to eat.

319
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,050
Da wouldn't poison him.

320
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,840
I didn't say that he poisoned him.

321
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,170
The doctor said that Xing Si was poisoned by food toxins.

322
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,850
He must have eaten something by mistake.

323
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,410
So we need to ask Yuan Da about it clearly.

324
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:28,810
Only in this way can we know how to find the incompatible food for detoxication.

325
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,890
Well, as for Su...

326
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,930
Will you take revenge for him?

327
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,570
You've just said that you trust him.

328
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,110
Yes, I trust him.

329
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,460
I trust you, too.

330
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,020
So I believe that there must be some

331
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,370
misunderstanding about this matter.

332
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,650
So, you really know what to do, just like making dumplings

333
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,680
in the teapot.

334
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,250
You really scared me.

335
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,330
Talk nicely.

336
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:58,130
Young Master Duan is really smart, handsome

337
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,370
and talented.

338
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:01,810
Well,

339
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:03,830
I understand this.

340
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,450
What a scumbag.

341
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,190
You can even flirt with me.

342
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:10,490
With you,

343
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,410
I've learned many new words.

344
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:13,870
Really?

345
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,890
What new words have you learned?

346
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:20,530
A clear stream.

347
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,110
From now on,

348
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,060
don't let him eat mushrooms again.

349
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,050
Yes, yes, yes.

350
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,370
When I caught Da at that time,

351
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,480
I thought Da had strangled Su to death.

352
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,940
In the end, the autopsy proved that Su had died from poisoning.

353
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,910
Did he also eat someone else's mushrooms secretly?

354
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:45,860
However,

355
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,000
since you knew that Su had died from poisoning,

356
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,600
then why was Da still considered as a murderer?

357
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:53,090
We brought him back not to regard him as a fugitive,

358
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:55,690
but to find out about what had really happened.

359
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,060
It turns out that Da has been wronged for so many years.

360
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,560
I was too reckless.

361
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,080
I scared Da.

362
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,750
When Young Master comes back,

363
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,290
I will give Da a satisfactory explanation.

364
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:23,430
Da!

365
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,820
Miss... Miss Gu.

366
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:28,940
Yuan Da.

367
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,330
I'll give you a chance.

368
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,010
Tell me what happened to

369
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,030
Su and Xing Si.

370
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,760
Mr... Mr. Duan.

371
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,070
I... I really didn't...

372
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,730
didn't do it.

373
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:38,490
Calm down.

374
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,420
Talk about it slowly.

375
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,370
I... I didn't kill anyone.

376
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,000
Su from the Wuyi Guards

377
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:49,130
committed suicide to escape punishment after his secret was revealed.

378
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,650
Put back the stuff which you've stolen.

379
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:11,530
Go away.

380
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,720
It's none of your own business.

381
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,710
Unless you put it down,

382
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:15,970
otherwise...

383
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,690
you won't be able to walk out of here when I'm in front of you.

384
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:19,750
I won't put it down!

385
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,710
I... I'll say it one last time!

386
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,420
Put back the stuff which you've stolen.

387
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:43,580
Stand up!

388
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,090
You...

389
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,170
Stand up!

390
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,370
You stole something and possessed poisons secretly,

391
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,280
which... which were against the rules.

392
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:56,970
It's a capital crime!

393
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:57,940
Let go of me!

394
00:16:58,330 --> 00:16:59,240
Su.

395
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,540
You're hopeless.

396
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,320
You're screwed.

397
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,500
Come with me to see Young Master Duan.

398
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,050
I won't go back with you!

399
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:07,300
Don't come over.

400
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,240
It's just death, isn't it?

401
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:11,859
Su!

402
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:13,430
What are you doing?

403
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,599
Su!

404
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:15,650
Su!

405
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:17,410
Su!

406
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:18,790
Spit it out!

407
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:19,660
Spit it out!

408
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,420
Su! Su!

409
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,319
Su.

410
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:24,690
Su!

411
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:25,290
Da!

412
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,010
What are you doing?

413
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,460
How dare you kill your fellow apprentice!

414
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,050
I... I... I...

415
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:30,690
I didn't do it.

416
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:31,730
How dare you deny it?

417
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:32,890
I saw it with my own eyes.

418
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:33,420
I'll kill you!

419
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:33,870
I...

420
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,130
I didn't do it!

421
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,240
Su.

422
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:41,420
Su!

423
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:51,770
Miss... Miss Gu.

424
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,530
I'm... I'm sorry.

425
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,170
I... I'll go back with you.

426
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,020
Don't blame Dongxi.

427
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,010
Don't worry.

428
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,130
I won't blame her.

429
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:02,780
I didn't expect that

430
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,380
you would be such an affectionate man.

431
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,030
Young Master Duan.

432
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,850
I'm... I'm sorry.

433
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,470
I'll go back with you

434
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:15,040
and talk to Xing Si about it clearly.

435
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:16,450
Okay.

436
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,360
The misunderstanding was finally cleared up.

437
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,870
It was thrilling,

438
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,520
just like a movie.

439
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:28,930
A movie?

440
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,140
It's about stories.

441
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,030
Let me tell you a story.

442
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,780
Okay.

443
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:43,620
Go ahead.

444
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,490
Once upon a time, there was a girl

445
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,910
called Qi Chunjiao.

446
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,740
She was an excellent athlete.

447
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,180
So was her father,

448
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,440
and so was her mother.

449
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,420
One day, her father drove a car to go out

450
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,270
and had an accident.

451
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,380
Then he never came back.

452
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,430
Only Chunjiao and her mom were left at home.

453
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:11,150
It was her father's dream to make

454
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,610
Chunjiao become a champion.

455
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,930
But this dream

456
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:22,150
became the responsibility of Chunjiao and her mom.

457
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:23,850
This responsibility

458
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,490
was so stressful that Qi Chunjiao couldn't breathe.

459
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,490
Duan Yu, are you listening?

460
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,080
Yes, I am.

461
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,130
Go ahead.

462
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,370
Later,

463
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,530
Qi Chunjiao was injured.

464
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,590
It was called Thrower's Fracture.

465
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,650
She couldn't be an athlete anymore.

466
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,750
She was so scared at that time.

467
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,700
She thought she was a sinner herself.

468
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,480
Then what happened?

469
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,050
She didn't have the courage

470
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:08,290
to face her mother who had sacrificed everything for her.

471
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,970
She didn't even have the courage to live.

472
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:13,930
What happened later?

473
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:17,850
Later?

474
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:20,490
Later,

475
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,710
in order to regain her confidence,

476
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,690
she confessed her love to the boy whom she had a crush on

477
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,570
for many years.

478
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,990
It seemed that Qi Chunjiao

479
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,770
was not reserved enough.

480
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,840
Right. She was not reserved enough.

481
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,850
But even thought she was not reserved enough,

482
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:42,370
it was also okay if she could confess her love successfully.

483
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:45,840
But in the end, she didn't even finish saying the words which she had prepared for a long time.

484
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,530
Then that person turned her down.

485
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,290
What did he say?

486
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,280
He said he wanted to study abroad.

487
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,670
Studying abroad?

488
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,790
It's like going to a distant place.

489
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:59,340
Get to the point.

490
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:02,330
He said he didn't want to think about love affairs.

491
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,790
It seemed that

492
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,460
he didn't like Qi Chunjiao.

493
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,260
That's true.

494
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,030
After going home that day,

495
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,530
Qi Chunjiao felt as if

496
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,530
she had been abandoned by the world,

497
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,470
and she was a loser.

498
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,090
Even God wouldn't be willing to take one more look at her.

499
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,930
♫In the bustling place♫

500
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,120
♫That transient looking back♫

501
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,280
♫You raised your head♫

502
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,280
♫The fireworks flew past the night sky♫

503
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,980
♫The night breezes played music gently♫

504
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,290
♫Even flying birds stopped♫

505
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,970
♫To review your gentleness♫

506
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,340
♫I'm most afraid that in my dreams, I can't see♫

507
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:49,440
♫Your smile♫

508
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,820
♫Until the end♫

509
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,730
I acted recklessly,

510
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,730
made a wrong judgment and wasn't thoughtful enough.

511
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,390
Not only did I make Si get hurt,

512
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,780
but I also showed great disrespect for my predecessor.

513
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,890
I'm willing to be punished.

514
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,950
Please punish me, Predecessor Yuan.

515
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:04,290
Well...

516
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,210
It's all...

517
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:06,850
all...

518
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,250
all my fault.

519
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,090
I hope that Young Master,

520
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:13,300
Senior and Junior can forgive me.

521
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,500
Yuan Da is a kind-hearted man.

522
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,770
He requites injustice with kindness.

523
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,970
Don't mention these things again.

524
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:20,210
Yes.

525
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:21,930
Young Master.

526
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,390
[Yuan Da]

527
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,050
It has been confirmed that

528
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:32,680
Su stole something and possessed poisons secretly, which were against the rules.

529
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,730
He refused to admit his own crimes and committed suicide.

530
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,660
He got the punishment he deserved.

531
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,130
Those unwarranted charges against you are cancelled.

532
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,580
You don't have to hide anymore from now on.

533
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:45,730
Thank you for clearing my name, Young Master.

534
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,780
I'm always at your service, Young Master.

535
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,890
Why don't you go make some braised pork for everyone now?

536
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:52,410
Okay.

537
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,570
According to Mr. Si's dialogue novel,

538
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,170
once a man and a woman fall in love with each other,

539
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,300
they will spend more time with each other.

540
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,240
You grew up with Young Master Duan,

541
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,490
but you've never dated him under the tree of lovesickness

542
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,090
or flown a kite with the wind.

543
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,870
You read my dialogue novel secretly?

544
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,890
I just read a few pages.

545
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,580
I just don't understand

546
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,650
why Gu Qingqiao took away all the stuff

547
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,520
which had been yours originally.

548
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,590
With Duan Yu's personalities,

549
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,530
Gu Qingqiao might not be able to win his heart.

550
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,750
I'm not going anywhere.

551
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,070
I just want to stay at home.

552
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:30,660
No, I'm not going to the Jizhou Academy.

553
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,620
Do you want me to send you there personally?

554
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,970
Uncle, I lost my mother when I was a child,

555
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,970
and my father doesn't stay by my side.

556
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:42,030
Besides, I'm weak and often get sick.

557
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,170
I can't feel the love from my parents.

558
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,950
I only have you, Uncle.

559
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,390
Besides, Jizhou Academy is far away.

560
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:52,490
If I really get sick

561
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,570
and have to lie in bed,

562
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,860
and then my condition gets worse because I miss

563
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,690
my hometown,

564
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:58,770
you won't be able to see me for the last time.

565
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,490
Uncle.

566
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,330
Are you so cruel that you want to abandon me?

567
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:05,870
Shaoyi,

568
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:06,970
I'm sorry.

569
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,850
I didn't think it through.

570
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,030
How about

571
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,740
asking Xing Si to invite Mr. Qi to go with you?

572
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:14,440
No need.

573
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,630
Xing Si!

574
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,370
-Xing Si!
-No need!

575
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:22,400
Now I feel refreshed, and I'm quite healthy.

576
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:24,000
I'll go.

577
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:25,510
I'll depart now.

578
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,200
Or...

579
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,010
Or what?

580
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,610
You can study in seclusion

581
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:32,810
without going out of your house.

582
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:33,810
I'll be grounded?

583
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:34,920
I'm going to tell my father that

584
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,050
I didn't do anything wrong,

585
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,100
but you want to ground me.

586
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,960
Then you should go to the academy.

587
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,450
Do you know what my father will say if he knows that

588
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,650
you want to ground me?

589
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:45,970
It's good to ground Shaoyi!

590
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:49,690
You took the initiative to say that you wanted to study in seclusion.

591
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:50,650
Yes, yes, yes.

592
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,690
I took the initiative so actively.

593
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,490
You seem to have made progress.

594
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,600
Then I'll go now.

595
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:58,680
Just go.

596
00:24:58,890 --> 00:24:59,690
Go away now.

597
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:02,530
Scumbag!

598
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:06,580
Scumbag. Scumbag.

599
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:07,850
You are a scumbag!

600
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,060
My Lady.

601
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:10,940
[To Gu Qingqiao]

602
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,450
Did Miss Du ask someone to send it here?

603
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,510
It was sent here early in the morning.

604
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:18,520
Qiao,

605
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:21,370
the day before yesterday, I tasted some top-quality Jiangnan Green Tea,

606
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:24,330
so I specially gave a portion of it to you so that you can taste it.

607
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,930
No wonder I liked her so much as soon as I saw her.

608
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,610
Though she's a lady from a noble family,

609
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,740
she's quite forthright and generous.

610
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,180
Dongxi.

611
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:35,370
Let's also go find something to give her a gift in return.

612
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,850
Okay, My Lady.

613
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,810
In your opinion,

614
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,170
does she know that

615
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:43,540
with our awkward relationship like this,

616
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:47,450
giving a girl some green tea is an insult, which means that this girl is a hypocrite?

617
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,570
I don't know whether it's an insult.

618
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:52,410
Anyway, I think although Miss Du

619
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,810
looks pretty,

620
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,540
she's actually evil-hearted.

621
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,840
I don't think she's evil-hearted.

622
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:00,930
But I quite like this green tea.

623
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,780
Good morning, Young Master Duan.

624
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,250
Miss Gu.

625
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,540
You two both look good today.

626
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:17,390
Miss Gu, if you want to say something, say it directly.

627
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:19,610
I have a question,

628
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,570
and I'd like to ask you about it.

629
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,460
Please go ahead.

630
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,490
May I ask you

631
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:30,770
how to cultivate true love?

632
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:33,170
Xing Si.

633
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:36,170
This is his secret skill.

634
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:39,490
Firstly, these two people have to miss each other every day.

635
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,410
Only in this way can they fall in love with each other as time goes by.

636
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:44,570
Then they'll love each other deeply, respect each other

637
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:45,990
and stay with each other forever.

638
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:46,750
Okay.

639
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:49,220
What I want is to fall in love as time goes by and stay with each other forever.

640
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,540
Then what do you want to do this time, Miss Gu?

641
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,670
From today onwards,

642
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,370
I'll come to the Qingfeng Restaurant every day

643
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:55,850
to manage the business for my father.

644
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,090
What does that have to do with us?

645
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,180
Of course it has something to do with you.

646
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,490
The Chamber of Commerce is located behind the Qingfeng Restaurant, isn't it?

647
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,890
If I come here to manage the business for my father every day,

648
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:05,200
I can also spend more time with you.

649
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,790
Isn't this killing two birds with one stone?

650
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:10,330
So, Miss Gu, after talking so much,

651
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,930
you just want to be with our young master?

652
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:14,790
What else could be the reason?

653
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:15,660
Miss Gu,

654
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,690
I don't think this is good for your reputation, right?

655
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:20,200
Why is this not good?

656
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,610
In this era,

657
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,930
the marriage between a man and a woman is approved by their parents and arranged by the matchmaker.

658
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,410
Many women have never seen

659
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,420
their husbands before the wedding.

660
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,930
They don't know that a good marriage

661
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:33,490
is built on the basis of understanding each other thoroughly.

662
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:35,100
After getting married

663
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:36,650
they find that they have different personalities

664
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:37,860
and different life habits.

665
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,060
They even have different goals in life.

666
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:42,310
If they get divorced,

667
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,510
they'll even have to face financial disputes.

668
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:48,090
Their child will be the most pitiful one.

669
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:51,550
He'll have to think whether to choose his father or his mother.

670
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:52,570
What a tragedy.

671
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,630
It's really a tragedy in the world.

672
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:58,710
This tragedy seems...

673
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:01,180
seems quite pitiful.

674
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:04,730
Tomorrow's sun will illuminate today's haze.

675
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:05,730
Alright, Miss Gu.

676
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,590
Please stop talking about strange theories and heretical ideas

677
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,890
and stop making a long speech.

678
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,330
We still have something important to do.

679
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,300
See you.

680
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:11,830
Alright.

681
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,240
It's settled then.

682
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,290
What a troublemaker.

683
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,890
She's quirky and mischievous.

684
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:22,690
Young Master,

685
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,210
why have you falled in love

686
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,490
with such a wild girl?

687
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:29,570
I wonder who proposed the marriage for me.

688
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:33,610
Well, that was just a joke under the urgent situation.

689
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:36,650
Can a matchmaker's words be regarded as a joke?

690
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:37,490
Young Master.

691
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:39,610
Well, you can't go back on your word.

692
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:40,490
Then Miss Du...

693
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:41,230
Shut up.

694
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:45,930
Do you believe that I'll ruin your way of selling dialogue novels?

695
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:08,170
What brings you here, Miss Gu?

696
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,050
I...

697
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:11,450
I'm just here to see your work environment.

698
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,610
And I want to see if you can offer a part-time job here.

699
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:15,540
A part-time job?

700
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:16,170
Yes.

701
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:17,490
It means a concurrent job.

702
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:20,170
Anyway, it's just like catching a rabbit while cutting grass.

703
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,230
Catching a rabbit?

704
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:24,090
I think you're about to catch a sheep.

705
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,150
Mr. Si, you're really smart.

706
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:29,350
Anyway, even if there is one sheep, you'll catch it.

707
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,930
If there are a herd of sheep, you'll still have to graze them.

708
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:31,770
Miss Gu,

709
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:36,050
your flattery doesn't work on me.

710
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:38,400
Du Ruoyun!

711
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,490
Hush!

712
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:42,230
What does this have to do with Miss Du?

713
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,730
Miss Gu, don’t talk nonsense.

714
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,970
You think you can argue with me with your slow brain like that?

715
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,170
You're far inferior.

716
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:48,340
Tell me.

717
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,490
What do you think of the part-time job?

718
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:51,810
If you don't say yes to me,

719
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:53,290
I'll tell Young Master Duan that

720
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,850
you met Du Ruoyun secretly

721
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:56,610
and even spoke ill of me.

722
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,010
I didn't speak ill of you.

723
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:00,730
Nor did Miss Ruoyun.

724
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,770
This is just a clumsy denial resulting in self-exposure.

725
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:05,280
Tell me.

726
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,050
What did she say about me?

727
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,250
She said...

728
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:14,530
She said you were a clear stream.

729
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,690
This is okay.

730
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,130
What else?

731
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,150
That's all.

732
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:19,450
Really.

733
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,810
Miss Gu, I have to go out to handle something.

734
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:23,470
Have a seat inside for a while.

735
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:26,910
About the part-time job, it's settled then.

736
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:31,810
Two hundred grams of pepper.

737
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,810
Ten grams of young leaves.

738
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:34,700
Miss Gu,

739
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:37,870
how is your research on the new recipe going?

740
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:42,730
I want to carry forward the Glory of Meat

741
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:45,220
of our Qingfeng Restaurant.

742
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:49,850
Isn't it easier to come up with an idea if you go back to the Qingfeng Restaurant?

743
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,820
Not necessarily.

744
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,840
As the old saying goes,

745
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,380
only by adjusting the distance

746
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,130
can you observe the whole situation.

747
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:01,060
You need to have the overall view in everything.

748
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:03,810
That's right.

749
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:07,130
What you said makes sense.

750
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:10,960
Who told you that?

751
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,490
My dad.

752
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,330
My dad?

753
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:20,080
Well,

754
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,600
Young Master Duan,

755
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:25,030
do you want to eat the braised pork made by me?

756
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:26,890
Sure.

757
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,810
Actually, there are also many other dishes which I can make.

758
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,610
I'll make them for you next time.

759
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:32,090
Okay.

760
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:34,090
Duan Yu.

761
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:38,810
Why are you also here?

762
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:40,720
Yes.

763
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:42,370
I heard that you're here,

764
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,470
so I specially came here to see you.

765
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:50,610
This is the honey chrysanthemum tea I've specially made for you.

766
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,190
Taste it.

767
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,100
Thank you.

768
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,240
I grew up with Duan Yu.

769
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:09,870
I know his life habits the best.

770
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,980
The weather is a little dry,

771
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:14,770
so I've brought some chrysanthemums here.

772
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:26,370
Young Master.

773
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:29,690
Xing Si, you're here.

774
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:31,020
You two may go out first.

775
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,070
I have something to tell Xing Si.

776
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,850
Then I'll leave now.

777
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:39,040
Qiao, aren't you leaving?

778
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:42,970
Alright. I'll go.

779
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:46,540
I'm leaving.

780
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,410
Didn't I tell you not to leave the Duan Residence?

781
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,730
If Young Master Duan finds out about this,

782
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,410
he'll break my legs.

783
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:02,930
What are you afraid of with me here?

784
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:03,620
Besides,

785
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,380
it'll be fine if we sneak out

786
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,650
without letting others know, won't it?

787
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,980
Young Master Shaoyi, where are you going?

788
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:09,530
Mr... Mr. Qi.

789
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,120
We are not going anywhere.

790
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:13,490
We're just taking a walk around this yard

791
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:15,100
to get some fresh air.

792
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,580
What brings you here?

793
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:20,970
It's all because of you.

794
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:22,290
Because of me?

795
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:25,100
I've been studying very hard these days.

796
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:26,820
Right, Ruoyi?

797
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,700
Yes, yes.

798
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,060
Very...

799
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,670
It's good that you study hard.

800
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:35,790
Ruoyi.

801
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,170
Take Mr. Qi

802
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:38,490
to the living room and entertain him.

803
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,240
No need.

804
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,530
Let's go to your study room first.

805
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:02,090
Do you think Duan Yu

806
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,090
takes Gu Qingqiao seriously?

807
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:06,330
I don't know, either.

808
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:09,469
After all, love between men and women is all about fate.

809
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:11,530
Miss Ruoyun,

810
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,679
you're the best girl in the world.

811
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,659
I think you will definitely find

812
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:18,210
your Mr. Right.

813
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:20,690
I hope so.

814
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:23,500
Alright.

815
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,449
You don't have to see me off.

816
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:25,370
I can go back by myself.

817
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:25,969
No.

818
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,000
Young Master said that

819
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,260
I must escort you back to your residence.

820
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:40,540
My Lady,

821
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:42,010
I'll warm your feet with hot water

822
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:43,409
to relieve your fatigue.

823
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,650
My little Dongxi is so nice.

824
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:48,460
How come you're so considerate?

825
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,050
Da is so lucky.

826
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:51,540
My Lady,

827
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,409
don't make fun of me.

828
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:58,290
My Lady,

829
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:01,220
the color of the petals in your birthmark

830
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,820
seems to have become deeper.

831
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:03,530
Really?

832
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:10,970
It seems that the color has really changed.

833
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,810
Do you feel that something is wrong?

834
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:15,050
What's wrong?

835
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,490
I can't explain what is wrong.

836
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,090
I just feel uneasy.

837
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:28,060
[Life can be bitter, but we can make it sweet]

838
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,890
♫Love doesn't need to be put together♫

839
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:45,280
♫Feel it with your heart♫

840
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,090
♫Whether it's autumn and winter, I've been missing you♫

♫Even if♫

00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:54,110
♫My hair turns grey as time goes by♫

843
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,320
♫Meeting you♫

844
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:58,060

♫I persist in it♫

847
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:00,690
Maybe

848
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:02,940
she really has nothing to do with the Star of Rebellion.

849
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,640
♫No matter how long the journey is♫

850
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,170

♫We'll stay with each other♫

852
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:07,010
so she's different from

what she used to be.

854
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,970
[Life can be bitter, but we can make it sweet]

855
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,170
My Lady, what's wrong with you?

856
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:23,810
Since people in the ancient times emphasize a good match for each other,

857
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:28,100
is it really that important to marry someone from a family of equal status?

858
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:30,730
In terms of family background,

859
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:32,330
I've already lost.

860
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,380
In terms of facial attractiveness...

861
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:37,650
It means appearance.

862
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,810
I'm not better than Ruoyun.

863
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:41,450
My Lady.

864
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:43,290
To take a wife, virtues are the most important.

865
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:45,170
Only when a man take a concubine will he think about appearance.

866
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,810
You're considerate towards both your superiors and inferiors.

867
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:47,690
You're also kind, smart

868
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:48,690
and sympathetic.

869
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:51,580
Those who are only pretty are no match for you.

870
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:53,290
Good, Dongxi.

871
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,810
You're eloquent.

872
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,940
Beautiful faces are the same,

873
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:01,950
but I'm the only one who has an interesting soul.

874
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:04,250
You've made progress.

875
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:06,610
I just hope that you and Young Master Duan

876
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,180
can get married soon.

877
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,890
Getting married soon?

878
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,060
It's still too early to say this.

879
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,290
After all, we don't know each other well.

880
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:17,420
Then you should try to learn about him.

881
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:21,490
That's the trick. I should learn about him.

882
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,290
After drinking so much,

883
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,740
we can't drink anymore.

884
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:27,660
Let's play a game together.

885
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:31,650
This game is called the Meeting of Complaining about Your Boss.

886
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:32,610
Complaining?

887
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,330
If the spoon points at someone,

888
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:36,210
that person needs to either drink the wine in the bowl

889
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,740
or tell us something about Duan Yu.

890
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:40,570
Why is it about Young Master Duan?

891
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:42,530
That's because he's your boss.

892
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:44,380
The name of this game is

893
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:46,290
the Meeting of Complaining about Your Boss.

894
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:47,210
Understand?

895
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:48,150
Yes.

896
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:50,450
Let's get started.

897
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,140
[The Manual of Complaining about Your Boss]

898
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:01,260
Let me ask a question first.

899
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,010
What does your boss usually like doing?

900
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,410
He likes...

901
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:08,550
He likes drinking.

902
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:15,310
It's you again.

903
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,380
How often

904
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,710
does your boss

905
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:21,090
go to the brothel?

906
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,010
Brothel?

907
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,760
Brothel? I don't know.

908
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,650
Well, go on.

909
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,530
What does your boss like to eat?

910
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:37,450
What color does your boss like to wear?

911
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:39,780
How many girlfriends does your boss have?

912
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:56,910
Let me do it.

913
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:04,770
This maltose is well-distributed and delicate.

914
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:05,490
My Lady.

915
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:06,130
Da.

916
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,870
You're just like a blender.

917
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:08,540
Well...

918
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,090
My Lady.

919
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:11,930
The softness

920
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:14,130
of this glutinous rice is appropriate.

921
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:14,930
What a perfect match.

922
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:15,580
Dongxi.

923
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,090
It's not tiring to work

924
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,300
if men and women collaborate with each other.

925
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,010
This has been the truth since the ancient times.

926
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:25,380
The tacit understanding between you two

927
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,140
can be rated a full mark.

937
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:45,890

941
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:52,390
You two have made me feel so sweet,

942
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,420
