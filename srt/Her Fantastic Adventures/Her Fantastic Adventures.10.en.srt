00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,860
I'm Duan Yu from the Duan family of Changqing.

5
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,060
I'm here to discuss something important with
the Lord of the Divine Palace.

6
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:16,910
Strange?

7
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,390
Why is it so quiet here?

8
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,120
May I ask who you are?

9
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm Duan Yu. I have His Lordship's order.

10
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,820
I came to discuss something important
with The Lord.

11
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,750
I'd appreciate

12
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,200

Are you still upset about what happened
during the day?

15
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,900
My Lady.

16
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:52,970
I...

17
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:59,090
I got you into trouble, My Lady.

18
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,460
Silly girl.

19
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,790
What are you talking about?

20
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,550
I'm really happy that I can help.

21
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,550
It was my fault in the past.

22
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,470
I didn't realize what you were going through.

23
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,970
If something like this happens again,

24
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,630
you shouldn't keep it from me.

25
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,800
Go ahead and cry.

26
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,990
You'll feel better if you cry.

27
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,670
My Lady,

28
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,750
I also knew that

29
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,970
the family's debt was paid off long ago.

30
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,060
But he is my father.

31
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,970
What else can I do?

32
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,680
Some people

00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,080
may be family,

34
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,790
but they are actually obstacles.

35
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,820
Don't be too sad.

36
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,450
Considering my father did his best to help

37
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,360

38
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,710
I'll think of it as a favour for my mother.

39
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,750
Dongxi.

40
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,710
You are such a kind girl.

41
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,380
You're on the ball.

42
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,780
You have empathy and kindness.

43
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,610
However,

44
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,350
you don't have to be too upset

45
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,150
for a nobody who's irrelevant to you.

46
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,950
You should cherish the present,

47
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,460
and the people around you.

48
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,570
I know you are kind to me.

49
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,950
I will repay you for all your kindness.

Silly girl.

51
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,830
I'm not talking about me.

52
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,570
I meant Da.

53
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,230
Who?

54
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,970
Da is such a loyal man.

55
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:47,710
Look.

56
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,730
These earrings are beautiful.

57
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,490
Da has good taste.

58
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,210
Let those bad things go.

59
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,320
Say goodbye to those old earrings.

60
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,310
Put on these new earrings.

61
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,510
It's all a new beginning.

62
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,510
Don't worry.

63
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,630
I went to Qingfeng Restaurant today.

64
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,660
I've figured out how to deal with her,

65
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,120
so she'll drop to her knees and beg
for mercy.

66
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,070
Shaoyi,

67
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,930
you're doing this for me.

00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,980
when he come back?

70
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,870
I'm not doing this

71
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:16,920
entirely for you,

72
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,000
It's also for the Duan family.

73
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,530
I want to know

74
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,590
why that girl deserve Duan Yu.

75
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,710
If she couldn't even handle this,

76
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,370
how could she marry into the Duan family?

77
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,870
Show me the account book.

78
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,570
My Lady,

79
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,780
please review.

80
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,230
The business hasn't seen much improvement.

81
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,290
We need to come up with something new.

82
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:49,040
People are paying for the private room every day.

83
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,810
It's under Du Ruoyun's name.

84
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,020
Yes, it was from Young Master Shaoyi.

85
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,720
He has booked it for three days.

86
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,620
He said he had something important

87
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,700
to discuss in there.

88
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,880
I don't understand the reason.

89
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,909
How could you not understand?

90
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:01,500
He knew our business wasn't doing well,

91
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,720
so he wanted to help us.

92
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,990
He thought that I could lose face,

93
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,190
so he came up with an excuse.

94
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,100
That's what you call being a friend.

95
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,030
Watch and learn.

96
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,930
I'll go take a look.

97
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:14,770
What are you doing?

98
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,310
You can't come in.

99
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,550
This is strange.

100
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,110
This is a private room in my restaurant.

101
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,110
Why can't I enter?

102
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,180
I booked it.

103
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,070
You can't go in.

104
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,760
What are you doing here?

105
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,710
You're not doing anything

106
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,060
shameful, are you?

107
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,630
Are you dating someone

108
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,810
in my private room?

109
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,310
No.

110
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,450
I have something important to do the day
after tomorrow.

111
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,490
You'll find out by then.

112
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,930
But before that,

113
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,030
you cannot enter.

114
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,350
Not only you are not permitted,

115
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,750
none of your people are permitted to enter.

116
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,570
So mysterious.

00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,560
Young Master has not come back yet.

121
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,360
I know.

122
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,420
I just had something to ask you.

123
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,630
Is the day after tomorrow an important day?

124
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,960
The day after tomorrow?

125
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,490
I... I don't think so.

126
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,230
Is it possible

127
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,910
that Duan Yu is coming back?

128
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,050
I don't think it's that soon.

129
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,450
Young Master will need some time to return.

130
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,820

131
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,390

134
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,380
I got it.

135
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,309
I'm sorry.

136
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,630
I am aware of what will happen tomorrow.

137
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,640
Don't blame me for breaking my promise.

138
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,500
I'm barging in.

139
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,550
Duan Shaoyi, you scared me to death.

140
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,150
This will be Gu Qingqiao's reaction tomorrow.

141
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,590
When she goes in,

142
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,400
she is going to step on the special oil
and slip.

143
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,260
She'll fall down beside the table.

144
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,160
There's a dangerous string.

145
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,690
The string will cause the table to flip.

146
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,440
She won't know

147
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,460
what will be waiting for her...

148
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,150
When the moment comes,

149
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,910
she and her Qingfeng Restaurant will become

150
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,390
a laughingstock among the Changqing people.

151
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,590
But are we pushing

152
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,940
the boundaries too far?

153
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,930
She'll get hurt if she falls.

154
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,380
Don't worry.

155
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,780
I've placed a water tank downstairs.

156
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,630
Even if she falls over,

157
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,640
it will only be some scratches.

158
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,520
She'll be safe.

159
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,640
But...

160
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,950
then she will realize that

161
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,660
she shouldn't have asked the storyteller to
defame you.

162
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,320
Otherwise,

163
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,270
I'll keep messing with her,

164
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,070
until she realizes her mistake.

165

I don't know.

169

I haven't seen her today.

170

Happy birthday.

Your idea of the trick room

180

is amazing.

It will definitely work in Qingfeng

191
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,750
Happy birthday to you.

192
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:30,070
Happy birthday to you.

193
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:29,770
[Birthday]

194
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:34,830
Happy birthday, Shaoyi.

195
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,230
Really?

196
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,510
It's absolutely true.

197
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,420
Qingfeng Restaurant is very popular these
days.

198
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,660
It is said that many people booked this
room.

199
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,060
Even more people are walking on the street.

200
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,770
They are either here to have fun,

201
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,430
or to collect candies.

202
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,550
Gu Qingqiao is really extraordinary.

203
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,480
She is able to overcome

204
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,080
any difficulty she faces.

205
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,030
When did you start

206
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,960
keeping in touch with Gu Qingqiao?

207
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,990
How could you not tell me about your secret
plan?

208
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,510
I have never met Miss Gu.

209
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,940
I only found out today

210
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,790
when she asked Si to host it.

211
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,120
It's Si who's been arranging all this.

212
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,210
It was meant to be a surprise,

213
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,530
so I didn't tell you.

214
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,110
It was so embarrassing for me today.

215
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,070
Not at all.

216
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,600
We were all very touched.

217
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,190
Today, I saw

218
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,020
Si's eyes became watery.

219
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,410
It seems there'a reason for Duan Yu to like
her.

220
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,860
Well,

221
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,980
About that...

222
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,490
It'll be the last time.

223
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,350
Duan Yu.

224
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,910
I don't know how you're doing.

225
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,410
Do you miss me?

226
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,590
Anyway, I miss you so much.

227
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,920
Shaoyi has been really naughty.

228
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,470
During your time away,

229
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,750
he tries to trick me every day.

230
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,490
I can only do my best

231
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,230
to prevent it.

232
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,900
I hope you can come back home safely.

233
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:24,930
Duan Yu.

234
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,030
You're awake.

235
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,110
May I ask.

236
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,800
Are you the Lord of the Divine Palace?

237
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,830
Yes.

238
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,400
And no.

239
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,300
Am I still

240
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,190
in the Divine Palace?

241
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,110
Yes.

242
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,730
And no.

243
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,040
Does it mean

244
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,570
I am dead?

245
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,430
Life and death are unpredictable.

246
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:02,250
Only faith is eternal.

247
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,610
Then how did I get here?

248
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:09,290
Divine Palace exists beyond the secular
world.

249
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:14,400
It can't be invaded by any external force
or evil energy.

250
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,910
If you want to get in,

251
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:20,970
it depends on your own fate and ability.

252
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,440
The stronger you are,

253
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,130
the harder it is to get in.

254
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,260
So, everything

255
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,330
you encountered on your way in

256
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,900
is set to minimize your ability

257
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,650
to hurt the Divine Palace.

258
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,560
If you can see me,

259
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:42,520
it proves that you have strong willpower.

260
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,440
If you have any questions,

261
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,160
just ask.

262
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,080
The Star of Rebellion you predicted years
ago

263
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,280
has indeed appeared.

264
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,430
I want to know if she poses

265
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,350
a significant threat to the Duan family.

266
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:58,750
If you didn't consider the threat
significant,

267
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:01,330
you wouldn't have approach me.

268
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,920
Is that correct?

269
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,860
Is there a a win-win solution

270
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,700
for her and the Duan family?

271
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,530
Love and hatred

272
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:11,210
are all part of your destiny.

273
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,340
I'm willing to dedicate my life to reversing
her misfortune.

274
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,390
If it's a misfortune, how can it be easily
resolved?

275
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:26,360
Since you accessed the Divine Palace
with a strong will,

276
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,440
why don't you use the power to foresee
the vision?

277
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,640
Qiao.

278
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,390
No.

279
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,510
Qiao.

280
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,890
Hang in there.

281
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,990
You really are my destiny.

282
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,020
Goodbye.

283

284
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,510

285
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,750
No!

286
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:20,560
No!

287
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,020
No!

289
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,490
The Divine Palace.

290
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,070
Have I been there?

291
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,280
Was that

292
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,220
all true?

293
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,750
Take care, sir.

[Glory of Meat]

295
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:09,980
Welcome to revisit again.

296
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,540
Sir, have you eaten?

297
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,190
-No.
-Welcome to Qingfeng Restaurant.

298
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,180
Line up over there.

299
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:14,630
Okay.

300
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:15,670
-Waiter.
-Sir.

301
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,150
Not bad.

302
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,300
I'll come back next time.

303
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:17,990
Okay.

304
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,230
Gu Qingqiao

305
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:22,160
has captivated everyone in Changqing.

306
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:23,700
Manager,

307
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,710
you'd better think of something.

308
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,070
If this goes on,

309
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,550
we'll all go poor.

310
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,390
Bah!

311
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,790
Stop saying such bad things.

312
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,250
You think I'm not anxious?

313
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,550
Do you know who's Gu Qingqiao?

314
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,750
Yes.

315
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,110
We'll follow him later.

316
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:38,630
Okay.

317
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,070
Good.

318
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:43,550
It seems like Qingfeng Restaurant has
offended a lot of people.

319
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,670
Follow them.

320
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:45,360
Go.

321
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:46,390
Yes.

322
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,220
Young Master Shaoyi.

323
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,690
Did you deliver the letter?

324
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:57,420
Yes.

325
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,810
Miss Gu was pleased about it.

326
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,210
She said she'd be there on time.

327
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,380
That's great.

328
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,580

Am I destined not to fly a kite?

332
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,870
It keeps falling.

333
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,480
What's wrong with Duan Shaoyi?

334
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,510
He's even late for flying a kite.

335
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,170
Shaoyi.

336
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,680

Shaoyi was kidnapped?

342
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:49,960
Yes.

343
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,990
Where did you get this letter?

344
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,190
It was from a servant of the Duan family.

345
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,140
That's strange.

346
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,340
If it's true,

347
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,930
he is a master.

348
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,680
He didn't directly write on the letter.

349
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,520
The text was cut and assembled into a
collage.

350
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:07,280
I feel like there's something going on.

351
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,080
These characters

352
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,770
look familiar.

353
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,000
What's going on?

354
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,190
-Where are you going?
-What's going on?

We shouldn't talk to her.

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,810
Guys, tie her up!

381
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,240
Catch her!

382
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:02,590
Okay.

383
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,950
Look at you guys.

384
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,350
Why do you

385
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,760
have to be hooligans?

386
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,950
You don't even read the calendar when you
kidnap people.

387
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,410
Kidnapping requires a lot of techniques.

388
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,870
It's not just a matter of having a lot of people.

389
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:39,910
Besides,

390
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,360
there aren't many of you.

391
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,200
Take off your masks.

392
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,270
I told you so.

393
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,580
You sounded familiar.

394
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,220
I'm really disappointed in you.

395
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,060
You deceived Dongxi for money for so many
years.

396
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,870
Couldn't you just start a small business?

397
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,670
Why resort to kidnap and murder?

398
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,040
Miss Gu, please forgive me.

399
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,570
Miss Gu, please forgive me.

400
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,230
I didn't mean to kill you.

401
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,020
I just wanted to tie you up.

402
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,260
I'm just trying to

403
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,980
make some money for my family.

404
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,850
You won't tell me?

405
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,850
Then I'll report the case to the police.

406
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:17,080
You'll stay in prison for the rest of
your life.

407
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,190
It won't happen again.

408
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,270
It won't happen again.

409
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,430
Please forgive me,

410
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,380
and let me go.

411
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,370
I won't do it again.

412
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,930
I won't do it again.

413
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,630
Tell me.

414
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,060
Who asked you to kidnap me?

415
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,220
Father, look.

416
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:40,330
This character is identical to the one in
this booklet.

417
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,160
[Kidnapping Letter]

418
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,330
I knew it.

419
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,210
Ruoyun.

420
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,470
You're indeed my daughter.

421
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,460
Where did you get this booklet?

422
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,540
Gu Qingqiao

423
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,490
made this game booklet on her own.

424
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,000
So it must be Gu Qingqiao

425
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,530
who kidnapped Shaoyi.

426
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,330
But that's not right.

427
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,240
If she did it,

428
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:05,830
she could've just directly written one.

429
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,990
Why did she cut and paste it?

430
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,160
This...

431
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,540
This is to cover up her action.

432
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,820
She has always been a peculiar person.

433
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,670
She's trying to disguise as someone else who
sets her up,

434
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,400
so that she can get away with it.

435
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,260
It makes sense.

436
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,020
Why aren't they here yet?

437
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,200
Those outsiders are not reliable.

438
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:33,660
Coming.

439
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,580
Shaoyi.

440
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,140
Sorry to keep you waiting.

441
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:49,010
You came by yourself?

442
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,160
Why are you here?

443
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,070
Why not?

444
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,010
You invited other people?

445
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,140
No.

446
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,310
Didn't we agree to meet in the woods?

447
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,310
Didn't you mention wanting

448
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:03,280
to discuss something in a quiet place?

449
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,810
I think this is a nice place.

450
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:05,800
Let's talk.

451
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,840
How was your journey here?

452
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,710
It was good.

453
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,000
It's too windy outside.

454
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,220
I brought a kite

455
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,440
but it got stuck on a tree.

456
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,090
I couldn't reach it.

457
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,550
We have nothing to do now.

458
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,660
What a pity.

459
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,860
I haven't flown a kite for a long time.

460
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,390
Now that you mention it, I really want to
play.

461
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:30,460
Shall we go out and look for it?

462
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,350
Maybe I can help you get it down.

463
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,430
Sure.

464
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,980
Let's look for it together.

465
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,540
I know you and Ruoyun have been messing
with me.

466
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,230
No. No way.

467
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:44,050
I know it's because of Duan Yu.

468
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:46,310
I've disrupted the harmony you once had.

469
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,000
To be honest,

470
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,640
I'm more confused

471
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,150
than any of you.

472
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,190
Everything that happened after I came here

473
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,320
has been so strange.

474
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:58,670
But

475
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,720
you are so authentic,

476
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:01,790
and lovely.

477
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,470
I've seen different sides of me

478
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,620
that I've never noticed before.

479
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,390
Duan Yu

480
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:10,060
looks indifferent,

481
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,460
but he's actually very passionate.

482
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,840
He takes everything very seriously.

483
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,640
He's a man in engineering.

484
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:18,870
I thought

485
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,620
my wish was to be with him.

486
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:24,910
It turned out to be a knot in my heart.

487
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,350
A knot?

488
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,590
And you.

489
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,420
You look like an unreliable person,

490
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,290
but actually,

491
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,320
you're very smart.

492
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,990
You did a good job on the mechanisms.

493
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,350
If I hadn't been in an escape room before,

494
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,680
I might have fallen from the second floor.

495
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,180
Why are you laughing so hard?

496
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:48,910
I thought Duan Yu liked you

497
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:50,380
because he was tricked.

498
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:51,090
It seems

499
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,200
you deserve a little bit of his love.

500
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,050
I don't know how long this

501
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,710
bit of relationship can last.

502
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,450
Actually, I know

503
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,340
we've gone too far.

504
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,990
But if you can't even defeat me,

505
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,710
how can you marry into the Duan family?

506
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,540
How can you compare yourself to Ruoyun?

507
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,500
I know.

508
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:12,110
That's why I tried my best to please you.

509
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,350
Thank you for the birthday.

510
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,310
For many years,

511
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:18,480
I only had a bowl of noodles on that day.

512
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:19,690
All right.

513
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,660
I've buttered you up.

514
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:23,350
Can our intelligence rivalry

515
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,310
come to an end?

516
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,000
OK.

517
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,680
As long as you don't hate me.

518
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,830
What's there to hate?

519
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:31,110
It means I'm levelling up myself.

520
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,170
Later, I'll cook Sword Roast Whole Lamb for us

521
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,010
to celebrate.

522
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,110
But you'll have to pay.

523
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,950
Sure.

524
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:38,620
I'll pay.

525
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,080
Also,

526
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,260
I must create more rituals

527
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,780
in the limited time.

528
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,060
So you could remember me in the future.

529
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,160
Are you going somewhere?

530
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,060
Hurry!

531
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,620
Stop!

532
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,740
Gu Qingqiao.

533
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,880
I don't think you're going anywhere.

534
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,200
Wait.

535
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,450
I don't need you anymore.

536
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,310
You can go back.

537
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,270
Who are you?

538
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:00,950
Go away.

539
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,590
You're good at acting.

540
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:06,760
I wanted to say

541
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:09,390
you have really good costumes.

542
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,550
Don't worry.

543
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:12,150
I won't let you do this for nothing.

544
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:12,880
I'll give you

545
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,060
double the price.

546
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,290
Who are you?

547
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,310
Go away!

548
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,720
Or I won't go easy on you.

549
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,150
All right.

550
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,820
You're really good at acting.

551
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,130
Give me a moment.

552
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,410
Gu Qingqiao,

553
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,360
I'll be honest with you.

554
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,290
I hired them to kidnap you.

555
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,570
I've given the kidnapping letter to
the Magistrate.

556
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,740
I was going to put a charge on you,

557
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,740
so you could stop being with Duan Yu.

558
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,170
I admit

559
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,630
I may have gone too far.

560
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,670
But this is the last time I mess with you.

561
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,100
I really admire your honesty.

562
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:53,330
The rivalry has brought us closer.

563
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,300
From now on,

564
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,650
we are close brothers.

565
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,150
But

566
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,740
the rookies you hired

567
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,560
were already arrested by Xing Si.

568
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,630
Now,

569
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,800
they're on their way to the Duan Residence.

570
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,730
Then who are these people?

571
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,150
Have you two

572
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,480
had enough of the drama?

573
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,710
Tie them up!

574
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,340
Magistrate Du.

575
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,640
Magistrate Du.

576
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,270
Bad news!

577
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,630
Bad news!

578
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,870
What happened?

579
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:37,250
Duan Shaoyi was kidnapped by Gu Qingqiao.

580
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,360
Did you receive the letter too?

581
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:40,680
Magistrate Du,

582
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,250
the letter is fabricated.

583
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,470
You really are something this time.

584
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,810
Even you knew about this?

585
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,250
What do you mean?

586
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,870
What letter is fabricated?

587
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,070
Don't talk nonsense.

588
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:52,480
Mr. Du.

589
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:53,970
The letter is fabricated.

590
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,730
Here's the story.

591
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,600
Young Master Shaoyi wanted to hire

592
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,930
someone to pretend to kidnap Gu Qingqiao.

593
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,220
It was all a joke.

594
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,570
But he never thought

595
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,330
the real kidnapper would come.

596
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,040
I saw it with my own eyes.

597
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,180
Gu Qingqiao colluded with the Mantra Sect

598
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,950
to kidnap Young Master Shaoyi.

599
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:13,770
What?

600
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,110
The weather is so unreliable.

601
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,320
It changes so quickly.

602
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,720
I've long heard that your Four Pillars of
Destiny was cursed.

603
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,980
People who meet you will have bad luck.

604
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,640
No, I'm not.

605
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:35,780
I'm not walking.

606
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,510
I'm not walking.

607
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,110
Sir,

608
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,170
we only want this girl.

609
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,530
The guy is such a burden.

610
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,160
I think we should kill him.

611
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,350
That way, we'll be able to walk faster.

612
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,130
Do it.

613
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,240
Don't come over!

614
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,640
If you dare lay a hand on him, I'll kill you!

615
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,470
How dare you kill me?

616
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,190
Do you know who my father is?

617
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:03,250
My father is Duan Yan from Changqing.

618
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,890
If you dare lay a finger on us,

619
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:07,100
my father will kill you all.

620
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,860
You're Duan Yan's son?

621
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,460
Excuse me.

622
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,570
Where is the nearby rest stop?

623
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,460
I've been traveling for a long time.

624
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,590
I want to take a rest.

625
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:04,550
A rest stop?

626
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:06,330
I don't know.

627
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,790
I was just passing by.

628
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,230
Are you also passing by?

629
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:09,740
Yes.

630
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,970
You didn't bring anything with you.

631
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,650
You only have a good horse.

632
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:16,120
I thought you were a local.

633
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,630
Local?

634
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:20,500
I'm just a traveler with a horse.

635
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:21,780
Everywhere is my home.

636
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,400
You must have a good horse when travelling.

637
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,710
Money and clothes don't matter.

638
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:27,400
Stop!

639
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,120
What about people's lives?

640
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,750
Do they not matter as well?

641
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:32,720
Sir,

642
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,570
what are you talking about?

643
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,440
The horseshoes are new.

644
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,220
If you're not a local,

645
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,560
your horse must be new as well.

646
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,750
The place

647
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,380
that allows you to buy horses

648
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:47,250
is the rest stop five miles away.

649
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,660
Who are you?

650
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,470
What do you want?

651
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:53,430
I should be asking you that.

652
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,300
Five people died at the rest stop.

653
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,340
You're here for revenge,

654
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,710
aren't you?

655
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,520
You're quite good.

656
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,090
No matter who you are,

657
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,440
it's unfortunate of you to meet me today.

658
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,480
I'm going to kill you too.

659
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,190
Bloodcraft.

660
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:16,260
Sir.

661
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,330
Sorry we're late.

662
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,040
It's okay.

663
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,400
It was too sudden. Not your fault.

664
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,360
How's the investigation going?

665
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,290
Sir,

666
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,540
we investigated the nearby villages.

667
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,380
Everything seems fine. Nothing is wrong.

668
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,780
It seems that this is not a simple incident.

669
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:30,190
I have to report it to His Lordship as
soon as possible.

670
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,680
Take care of this.

671
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,420
Yes sir.

672
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:42,050
[Duan Residence]

673
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,650
Bastard!

674
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,520
How did you protect Shaoyi?

675
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,240
Shaoyi is immature.

676
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,460
You too?

677
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,580
So many people

678
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,510
were fooled by a kid.

679
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,650
His Lordship, please don't be angry.

680
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:03,340
Mr. Qi

681
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:05,390
has led Ruoyi in the search for them.

682
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,810
It's my fault.

683
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,730
Xing Si.

684
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,710
You grew up

685
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,580
in the Duan Residence.

686
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,500
I am disappointed in you.

687
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,420
I'm sorry.

688
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,940
I will definitely find Young Master.

689
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,150
If Shaoyi is fine,

690
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,670
everything is fine.

691
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,500
But if anything happens to Shaoyi,

692
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,520
you and Wuyi Guards will be buried together.

693
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,580
Yes, His Lordship.

694
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,260
Ask Magistrate Du to come here immediately.

695
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,520
I need to know everything.

696
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,080
Yes.

697
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,489
Xing Si.

698
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,420
I heard that Mr. Duan is back.

699
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,110
Yes.

700
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,560
He was furious.

701
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:44,380
He asked me to tell Magistrate Du to come
here to discuss something important.

702
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,370
Shaoyi.

703
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,550
Will Shaoyi be alright?

704
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:49,480
Young Master Shaoyi is so smart.

705
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,480
He will be fine.

706
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,100
We have so many guards.

707
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,170
Those kidnappers won't get too far.

708
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:55,370
We'll find them soon.

709
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,510
It's all my fault.

710
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,930
If it wasn't for me,

711
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,710
Shaoyi wouldn't have thought of pretending
to be kidnapped

712
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,150
and framing Gu Qingqiao.

713
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,800
If it wasn't to frame Gu Qingqiao,

714
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,980
he wouldn't have gone to the wilderness.

715
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,840
If he didn't go to the wilderness,

716
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:11,210
he wouldn't have been kidnapped by the
Mantra Sect.

717
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:11,970
Miss Du,

718
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,490
everyone has his own fate.

719
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:15,820
You can't blame others.

720
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,630
What do you mean?

721
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,470
No, I mean

722
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,130
Young Master Shaoyi is blessed.

723
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,890
I'm sure it'll turn out all right.

724
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:23,760
Miss Du,

725
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,320
don't blame yourself.

726
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,500
If there's an option,

727
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,960
I'd rather be the one being kidnapped.

728
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,540
No.

729
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:33,630
I mean

730
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:35,260
nobody should be kidnapped.

731
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:38,210
I won't let this happen again.

732
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,810
Ruoyun.

733
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,690
Don't go anywhere for the time being.

734
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,560
Stay at home.

735
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,520
It's safer.

736
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,120
Guard Xing.

737
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,110
Let's go.

738
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:48,990
Yes.

739
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,090
Shaoyi.

740
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:54,190
Why aren't you saying something?

741
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,320
Is your brain damaged?

742
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,110
I'm fine.

743
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,580
I feel they broke my neck.

744
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,730
Why did they hit me so hard?

745
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,240
This is my first time being knocked out.

746
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,530
Are you okay?

747
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,470
I'm fine.

748
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,730
I'm better than you at fighting.

749
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,260
Fighting?

750
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,100
We were beaten.

751
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,030
Even if we were beaten, I'd been stronger.

752
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:19,430
I was born a Hercules.

753
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,840
I'm stronger than many guys.

754
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,140
I was the torch carrier in my neighborhood.

755
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,900
I've even made a name for myself.

756
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,230
What's a torch carrier?

757
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,720
Why haven't I heard of your name?

758
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,530
I didn't live in Changqing when I was young.

759
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,580
Anyway, I'm fine.

760
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,180
Look at you.

761
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:38,870
How can an ancient man not know any
martial arts?

762
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,110
If you had some strength,

763
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,480
we wouldn't have ended up like this.

764
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,230
Doesn't your family have

765
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,600
a reputation in martial arts?

766
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:50,190
We are now friends for life.

767
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,290
To be honest,

768
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,880
I don't have the talent for that.

769
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,240
My father has hired many masters to train
me,

770
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,370
but they all failed.

771
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,070
That's good.

772
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,090
Your body lacks coordination.

773
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:03,050
That's so you.

774
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,190
Don't laugh at me.

775
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,090
If you laugh,

776
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,700
I won't tell you anything anymore.

777
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,390
I...

778
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,640
I was just kidding.

779
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,780
Actually, you're quite smart.

780
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,010
You can use it.

781
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,160
You got the talent.

782
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:16,320
What's the point?

783
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,610
I like to work on mechanisms.

784
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,040
My father doesn't appreciate it at all.

785
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:21,800
He says it's useless.

786
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,060
I won't be successful.

787
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,340
In this world,

788
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:27,560
no one could define your success

789
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:29,630
except for yourself.

790
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,500
Only you could define your success.

791
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,690
I think

792
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,840
your mechanism is well designed.

793
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,680
If you launch escape rooms

794
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,070
in my place,

795
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:40,340
you'll definitely get rich.

796
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,510
What do you mean?

797
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:42,900
I...

798
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,150
I mean you helped Qingfeng Restaurant earn
a significant profit.

799
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,330
You got the talent.

800
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,800
I have faith in you.

801
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,260
Come on.

802
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:53,820
I can't do it just because you have faith
in me.

803
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,060
You're a fast learner.

804
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,400
You're talented.

805
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:58,880
Sir,

806
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,050
I don't understand.

807
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,470
Why are we keeping that Duan guy?

808
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:04,270
Why did we kidnap the girl?

809
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,440
In order to find the relic.

810
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,370
Where are we going to get the relic?

811
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,390
The Right Guardian.

812
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:10,320
Can you defeat the Right Guardian?

813
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,920
No.

814
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,770
But what does this have to do with him?

815
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,510
Killing two birds with one stone, okay?

816
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:20,110
Use Gu Qingqiao to lure out the Right Guardian.

817
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,690
Use the Duan family to kill him.

818
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,070
We can take back the relic

819
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,800
without harming any of our men.

820
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,210
But will the Right Guardian come?

821
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,930
Back then at Qingfeng Restaurant,

822
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,640
they worked together

823
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,350
to kill many of our men.

824
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,950
Their relationship

825
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,810
is anything but ordinary.

826
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,020
This time,

827
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:42,590
I will make them pay with their blood.

828
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,570
Tell me.

829
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,930
Why did they kidnap you?

830
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:48,500
They must be looking for something.

831
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,660
What is it?

832
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,220
Whose is it?

833
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,720
This thing

834
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,720
seems to be theirs,

835
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,080
but it's actually mine.

836
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,360
This is confusing.

837
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,590
It's either theirs,

838
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,190
or yours.

839
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:05,050
How can it be theirs and yours?

840
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,000
I can't explain it to you in a few words.

841
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:11,270
I can't describe this thing to you.

842
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:13,250
I don't have it on me now.

843
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,020
It won't be easy

844
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,480
for them to find it as well.

845
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,520
I gave it to Duan Yu.

846
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,600
Not bad.

847
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,880
That's what Qingfeng Restaurant was about
last time?

848
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,660
It's a pity that I did missed the fun.

849
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:30,690
But it's good that you don't have it.

850
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:32,130
If they found out,

851
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,080
we would be dead by now.

852
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,860
So smart of you.

853
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,230
So,

854
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:39,750
we have to use this information gap

855
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,370
to find a way to escape.

856
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:44,250
What's an information gap?

857
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:49,630
An information gap is

858
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,520
that they don't know what we know.

859
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:54,540
We know everything they know.

860
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,420
The part

861
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,910
of knowing what they don't know

862
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:58,060
is called information gap.
