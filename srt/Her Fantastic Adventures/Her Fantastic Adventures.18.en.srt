[Her Fantastic Adventures]

00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:49,820
What do you think?

00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,690
[I promise that I'll never hurt Qing or let her get hurt.]

00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,690
[Now Ruan Siqiong volunteers to help Qing get the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword.]

6
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,070
What's the use of a written pledge?

7
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,539
Don't think too much.

8
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,050
Under an unfavorable condition,

9
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,500
you have to compromise.

10
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,440
Lu Zizheng,

11
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,860
I'm warning you.

12
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,850
As a human being, you must have a bottom line.

13
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,680
Uncle Ruan has never hurt us.

14
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,170
Even if your purpose is to get the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword,

15
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,449
you can't hurt him.

16
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,180
That's petty kindness shown by a woman.

17
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,340
I hope that before you do anything,

18
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,130
you can think about

19
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,460
everything we've been through in Xiling.

20
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,700
Anyway, I'm really grateful that

21
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,390
I could meet them at the most difficult
moment in my life.

22
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:27,690
Alright.

23
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,100
I got it.

24
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,740
When the Great Master comes back,

25
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,170
do you think we can get the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword?

26
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,410
How would I know?

[Episode 18]

00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:49,100
[Grave of Kong Yanwu from the Qianyi Hall]

29
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,130
For everything that happened in the past,

30
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,520
I want to talk about it but I don't dare to.

31
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,100
Many years ago,

32
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,490
the founder of the Xiling Sect

33
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,040
found this sword at the Xiling Mountain

34
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,220
and used the power of this sword to achieve his aspirations in the Martial Arts World,

35
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,050
which made him became invincible.

36
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,530
And because of this sword,

37
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,460
he established the Xiling Sect.

38
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,750
From then on,

39
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:19,180
all the chiefs of our Xiling Sect

40
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,730
have had a mission for generations.

41
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,290
What mission is it?

42
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,220
It's to wait for the person who can pull the sword out.

43
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,060
Even the founder of our sect couldn't pull it out?

44
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,990
No, he couldn't.

45
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,660
Since the establishment of our sect,

46
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,980
not only our founder,

47
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,100
but also all the chiefs of the Xiling Sect have ever come here to try pulling the sword out.

48
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,940
But none of them could pull it out successfully.

49
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,300
Siqiong.

50
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:46,930
In my opinion, being a strong person doesn't necessarily mean that he has power.

51
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,540
I've never coveted this sword.

52
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,500
I hope that after you know this, you can

53
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,820
make a right judgement in the future

54
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,250
and won't be confused by your inner obsession.

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,740
Master,

56
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,060
please tell me now.

57
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,850
As long as you sacrifice your heart to this sword,

58
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,570
you can exchange it for the power which the mortals will fear.

59
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:14,060
By that time, you will be invincible in the world.

60
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:19,579
But you will also need to pay a huge price for this.

61
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,829
Being invincible in the world?

62
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,420
Is this sword that powerful?

63
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,050
The efforts of all the chiefs

64
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,730
from different generations are buried under this sword.

65
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,890
After putting your heart on this sword,

66
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,820
you'll have no emotions or desires

67
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,060
and have no joy or sorrow.

68
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,460
Even until the end of your life,

69
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,060
you won't be able to feel

70
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,290
sympathetic or other emotions.

71
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,810
From the moment of sacrifice,

72
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,340
all that is left

73
00:04:54,980 --> 00:05:00,650
in your life is waiting for death.

74
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:01,900
Master.

75
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,340
Since it's such a powerful sword,

76
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,270
what's its name?

77
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,010
Black Wood Human-shaped Sword.

78
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,460
Black Wood Human-shaped Sword?

79
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,650
Master.

80
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,730
I want to pull the sword out.

81
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,490
No.

82
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,180
If the Sword Spirit allowed you to pull the sword out,

83
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,940
it wouldn't have an attitude like that.

84
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,300
Siqiong.

85
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,500
Let's go.

86
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,490
Just be a guardian

87
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,570
like me.

88
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,210
No.

89
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:35,500
Master.

90
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,020
I want to be a strong man like the founder of our sect.

91
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,570
I want everyone to know that

92
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,460
I'm the disciple who you feel proudest of.

93
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,770
I want to protect our Xiling Sect

94
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,730
so that we will never be attacked by foreign enemies.

95
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,790
I'm willing to sacrifice my own life.

96
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,460
I want to be the strongest man in the world.

97
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,210
Siqiong.

98
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,850
Are you okay?

99
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,200
Master.

100
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,090
I'll use the identity of the strongest man in the world

101
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,900
to guard the glory of Xiling.

Who else wants to compete with me?

109
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,560
It's been 15 years.

110
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,230
The person I've been waiting for is finally coming.

111
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:17,960
Stop!

112
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,390
How come you're the only one who is back?

113
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,130
They've snatched the wine,

114
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,990
so they are slower than me while coming back.

115
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:25,850
Just go inside.

116
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,770
Has Wu also gone with him?

117
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,650
Yes.

118
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,380
We've searched all over the tribe, but we couldn't find her.

119
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,010
She must have gone

120
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,140
to the Moon Wolf Tribe with Young Master Duan.

121
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,480
Why did Wu do that?

122
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,050
Her only purpose was to help you.

123
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,290
The women of our tribe are kind-hearted.

124
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,480
I hope that you can cherish her.

125
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:50,650
Prepare a horse for me.

126
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,530
I'm going to look for them now.

127
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,370
Young Master Shaoyi.

128
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,730
I'm really worried about this.

129
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,490
I'd like to ask for your permission

130
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,100
to lead a team of Wuyi Guards to go there.

131
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,330
Please permit it, Young Master Shaoyi.

132
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,860
Okay. All of them should go.

133
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,190
Bring your weapons!

134
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,460
If the Moon Wolf Tribe dares to hurt my uncle and Wu,

135
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,410
I'll kill them all!

136
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,540
Young Master Shaoyi.

137
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,370
Protecting you should be the first priority of the Wuyi Guards.

138
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,370
Protecting me?

139
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,010
I'm fine now, right?

140
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,700
Distinguished guests from Changqing,

141
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,180
Young Master Duan has promised to help our Fire Crane Tribe

142
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,320
kill the enemies with his own power.

143
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,900
Then I'll give him the holy relic.

144
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,310
Everyone, please don't break the promise.

145
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,330
What about Wu?

146
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,450
Are we going to disregard Wu as well?

147
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,890
This is the fate she chose.

148
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,900
She should finish it herself.

149
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,600
Please don't interfere, Young Master.

150
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,799
Otherwise, it will ruin their good intention instead.

151
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,730
I can't believe that they are willing to help you to this degree.

152
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,410
Fine.

153
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,260
Even though you don't let me go help them,

154
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,860
I can't just sit there without doing anything.

155
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,900
Everyone, listen to my order!

156
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,300
Get ready for the battle.

157
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,130
Prepare to attack the Moon Wolf Tribe and assist my uncle

158
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:55,970
at any time.

159
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,700
-Yes!
-Yes!

160
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,370
Come on. Let's drink.

161
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,490
Refill your cups!

162
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:01,340
Hurry up!

163
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,050
Hurry up!

164
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,420
The meat is almost done from being roasted.

165
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,890
Come on. Hurry up.

166
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:05,850
Let's share the meat.

167
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:06,890
Let's go on drinking.

168
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:07,700
Guys,

169
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,400
enjoy yourselves with the food and wine.

170
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,460
Heshe.

171
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,060
Why are you back?

172
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:16,940
You mistook me for another person.

173
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,310
Heshe is patrolling the outside area.

174
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,170
No.

175
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,980
In the entire Moon Wolf Tribe, only your clothes are red

176
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,170
with patterns.

177
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,540
I think you misremember it.

178
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,460
Where are you going?

179
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,850
Come on. Have a drink.

180
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:33,730
Have a drink.

181
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:34,950
Have a drink.

182
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,010
You're not Heshe.

183
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,910
He isn't...

184
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:42,730
Bahe.

185
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,850
He's drunk.

186
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,460
I'll take him back to his room.

187
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,190
You go first.

188
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:46,690
Okay.

189
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,290
It's on fire!

190
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,520
Over here! Hurry up! Put out the fire!

191
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,110
When I enter the Moon Wolf Tribe,

192
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,850
I'll set fire as a signal.

193
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,070
By that time, release the horses.

194
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,710
There are some firecrackers tied behind the horses.

195
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,280
They will rush into the tents of the Moon Wolf Tribe.

196
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,240
I'll take this chance to catch the leader of the Moon Wolf Tribe.

197
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,370
By that time, we can use this as a threat

198
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:55,550
so that the Moon Wolf Tribe will never attack the Fire Crane Tribe.

199
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,910
Hurry up! Fetch some water!

200
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,200
Fetch some water now!

201
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,620
Over there!

202
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:01,580
Fetch some water!

203
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,350
Hurry up!

204
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,250
Everyone, get up.

205
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:09,490
Who is it?

206
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,190
You didn't expect this, did you?

207
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,960
I'm still alive.

208
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,270
You won't be able to escape.

209
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,680
Catch it!

210
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,810
Catch it!

211
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,210
Don't let the horses run away.

212
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,180
Drag them now!

213
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,300
Catch them now!

214
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,460
Hurry! Hurry!

215
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:09,850
Hurry up!

216
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,460
Uncle!

217
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:16,460
Young Master!

218
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,530
Young Master!

219
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,020
Hurry!

220
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,620
Banxia Xiexin Decoction.

221
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,530
Banxia.

222
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,290
Astragalus.

223
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,100
Yellow lotus.

224
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:32,810
Dried ginger.

225
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,260
When do you think the Great Master will come back?

226
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,180
Honey-fried licorice roots.

227
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,140
How would I know?

228
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,290
Ginseng.

229
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,540
Then what should we do?

230
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,460
-We can only wait.
-Red dates.

231
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,900
We can only wait and see.

232
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:47,970
It looks like I can only ask Uncle Ruan about it again.

233
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,500
I also need to take some delicious food to him.

234
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,050
Qing!

235
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,810
What did I say just now?

236
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,420
Banxia Xiexin Decoction.

237
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,720
Speak louder.

238
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,490
If he speaks lounder,

239
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,810
I'll hear him, too!

240
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:07,740
No matter what questions I asked you,

241
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,180
you never knew the answers.

242
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,890
The annual exam is coming soon.

243
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:12,150
What should you do now?

244
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,020
The annual exam?

245
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,030
The annual exam?

246
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,170
What should we do?

247
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,450
Right.

248
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:18,740
The annual exam?

249
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,070
What's the annual exam?

250
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,530
Is it the final exam at the end of the semester?

251
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,720
If you fail this year's annual exam,

252
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,490
the consequences will be quite serious.

253
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,460
Quite serious?

254
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,340
How serious is it specifically?

255
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,070
You'll know it by that time.

256
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,500
What's the content of the annual exam this year?

257
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,160
It's about medical classics.

258
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:46,150
Will our master highlight the key points for us?

259
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:51,020
[Annotations of Materia Medica]

260
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,570
What's written in it are all the key points.

261
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,830
Can you finish reading such a thick book?

262
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,250
It'll be useless even if you can finish reading it.

263
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,210
I remember that our master set a question like this last year.

264
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,570
A five-year-old boy

265
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,960
had a stomachache after having dinner with his father.

266
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,690
His mother happened to be giving birth to a child.

267
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,980
If you are a doctor,

268
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,560
how will you deal with it?

269
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,330
A Problem-solving Question?

270
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,010
I remember that

271
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,620
our First Senior wrote a whole page.

272
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,100
In the end, our master still deducted some points.

273
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,300
It's too difficult.

274
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,060
The annual exam is coming soon.

275
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,620
I wonder who will be the  invigilator this year.

276
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,970
It would be great if Uncle Ruan can be the invigilator.

277
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,660
Even if Uncle Ruan is the invigilator, we'll still have to take the exam, won't we?

278
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,940
You don't understand, do you?

279
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,440
Uncle Ruan doesn't care about these things at all.

280
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,840
If he is the invigilator,

281
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,570
then we can...

282
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:30,220
Understand?

283
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,030
If Uncle Ruan is really the  invigilator,

284
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:36,540
there will be much hope for our annual exam this time.

285
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,600
No problem.

286
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,690
Just leave it to me.

287
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:55,790
What's that smell?

288
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:01,380
Uncle Ruan.

289
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,280
You really have the temperament of an immortal.

290
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,440
When you took those two steps to come out just now,

291
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,370
I felt like I had been baptized by your immortal aura.

292
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,380
I really wish that I could see you every day to enjoy the visual pleasure.

293
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,610
I wonder if I can see you in the exam hall this time.

294
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,460
You'll see me if you want to.

295
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,600
Really?

296
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,380
So you'll be the invigilator of this year's annual exam?

297
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,650
I wonder when the Great Master will come back.

298
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,380
He'll come back when he should.

299
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,650
Well,

300
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:36,770
the content of this year's annual exam is...

301
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,740
Just pretend that I didn't ask about it.

302
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,860
You're holding the book upside down.

303
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,120
What are you thinking?

304
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,490
Junior.

305
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,290
How is it going

306
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,310
with your consideration about that matter?

307
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:08,650
It isn't quite appropriate, is it?

308
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,210
For the sake of our friendship,

309
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,770
just help me.

310
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,310
Are you really going to watch me fail the exam?

311
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,020
Uncle Ruan.

312
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,740
I have a question for you.

313
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,430
It's this part here.

314
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,020
Here.

315
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,060
Uncle Ruan.

316
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,810
I seem to have no questions now.

317
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,100
What's wrong with you?

318
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:51,890
Uncle...

319
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,530
Uncle Ruan.

320
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,100
My stomach hurts suddenly.

321
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,620
Can I go to the toilet?

322
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,500
No, you can't.

323
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,520
Uncle Ruan.

324
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:28,500
I want to drink some water.

325
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,630
You can't drink water during the exam.

326
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,060
Uncle Ruan.

327
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,810
What's wrong, Qing?

328
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,420
Uncle Ruan.

329
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:09,340
What's the pronunciation of this character?

330
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,070
I don't know.

331
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,090
I'll say it again.

332
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,980
If there are any cheaters

333
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,640
appearing in this exam again,

334
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,860
there will be severe punishment.

335
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,530
Uncle Ruan.

336
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,180
How severe will it be?

337
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,970
The cheaters will be expelled from our sect

338
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,970
with those who have failed the exam.

339
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,620
Uncle Ruan.

340
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,340
You're blocking the light.

341
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,220
It's okay.

342
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,800
You don't need it anymore.

343
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,120
Time's up.

344
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,210
Hand in the papers.

I passed the exam!

347
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,260
I passed the exam!

348
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,350
Junior.

349
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,080
You're good.

350
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,150
I didn't expect that you would get the highest score.

351
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,090
You're here.

352
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,550
Let me help you look for it.

Did you find yours?

355
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,350
I didn't find mine.

356
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,790
I found yours.

357
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,090
[The 82nd Place, Dongfangchun Jiaoqing]

358
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:46,460
I can't believe this!

359
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:48,810
How come you got such a high score?

360
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,100
I'm not in the top three.

361
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:50,570

Man Tianxing got the fifth place.

364
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,890
Alright. It's okay.

365
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,090
Just take the exam carefully next time.

366
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:02,220
I knew you would pass the annual exam.

367

370
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,860

If Uncle Ruan hurts First Senior

454
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,220
with the Prajna Palm,

Uncle Ruan wouldn't be so heartless, would he?

460
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,510
We should inform First Senior's family first.

Wait! Don't go!

557
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:19,570
Wait!

558
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:20,250
Buddies!

559

[Xiling Sect]

560
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,100
Wait! Don't go!

561
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,330
I told you someone would come to see me off, right?

562
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:23,860
Buddies.

563
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,670
Wait.

564
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,170
I knew you guys would come to see me off.

565
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:27,930
Junior Guan!

566
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:29,490
Lord Shen.

567
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,900
Have you seen Junior Guan?

568
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,690
No.

569
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:33,740
Well...

570
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:34,970
Junior Guan!

571
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,170
Aren't you guys here to see me off?

572
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:39,550
[Xiling Sect]

573
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,500
-Junior Guan!
-Guan Mu!

574
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:38,530
Junior Guan!

575
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:39,730
Guan Mu!

576
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,100
-Junior Guan!
-Junior Guan!

577
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:48,700
Master.

578
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:50,420
As the First Senior,

579
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,730
I have the responsibility and duty

580
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,190
to go down the mountain and find Junior Guan.

581
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:57,060
Do you all want to go?

582
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,140
Yes!

583
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,290
The disciples of Xiling always help each other.

584
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:02,250
Not a single one can be omitted.

585
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,480
We will follow the rules of our sect,

586
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,740
and we're willing to go down the mountain to find Guan Mu for you.

587
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,450
Good!

588
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:09,870
You're indeed the disciple whom I feel proudest of.

589
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:10,900
However,

590
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,460
isn't it such a big fuss

591
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,730
to let so many of you

592
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,220
look for just one disciple?

593
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:17,860
I'll go, too.

594
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:21,700
Junior.

595
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:24,410
Why are you here to join them as well?

596
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:25,810
It's not necessary to ask the strongest man

597
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:28,100
in the world to look for just one disciple, is it?

598
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,690
I'm the junior fellow disciple of his master.

599
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:31,490
I also have the responsibility.

600
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:33,780
Senior.

601
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:36,090
Just consider it as a study tour.

602
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,710
Fine!

603
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:40,900
Just go and come back early.

604
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:46,560
[Xiling Sect]

605
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,170
What's wrong with you?

606
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:49,170
Didn't you say that you wouldn't go?

607
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,420
I want to go down the mountain to check the routes

608
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,750
and get ready for our departure from here.

609
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,500
Alright.

610
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:55,730
I'll go find Senior Guan,

611
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:56,460
and you'll go find the way.

612
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,850
Let's come back after I find him and you find the road.

613
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:58,540
Juniors.

614
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,290
Keep up with us!

615
00:29:59,290 --> 00:29:59,900
Okay.

616
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,760
He's badly injured.

617
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,770
His tendons and blood vessels have been damaged.

618
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,530
Can you cure his injury or not?

619
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:42,160
I will certainly do my best to treat him.

620
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:45,190
But he can't move during this period.

621
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,740
Otherwise, his injury will be incurable.

622
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:57,710
Thank you, Lord Witch Doctor.

623
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,330
I'm sorry.

624
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,290
Duan hurt his arm because of me.

625
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:31,350
I followed him because I wanted to help him.

626
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,750
I was afraid that you would be sad if he died.

627
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,250
I didn't expect that

628
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:38,090
he would get hurt because of me instead.

629
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,350
Don't blame yourself.

630
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,540
It was you who brought my uncle out of the Moon Wolf Tribe.

631
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,140
It was you who saved his life.

632
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,360
I'm the one who should apologize.

633
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:49,660
I've failed to protect you by your side all this time.

634
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,590
Because of me,

635
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,770
your life was even in danger.

636
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,110
I'm so useless.

637
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,930
Don't say that.

638
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:02,420
I've figured it out.

639
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,820
Even if I keep staying by your side,

640
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,370
I'll just be a burden that makes you worry.

641
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:10,260
In the past,

642
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:15,300
I was always fooling around with the protection of a group of people.

643
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,300
I even

644
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,500
made you almost get killed.

645
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,850
What do you mean?

646
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,800
Wu.

647
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,890
Now I can't

648
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,410
protect you.

649
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,420
I don't deserve you.

650
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:43,380
I found her.

651
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,220
Where is she?

652
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,050
She's on the Xiling Mountain

653
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:47,000
in the Qingshui Town.

654
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,800
Who else knows that?

655
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,880
For now, only I know this.

656
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,080
Block the news first.

657
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:52,090
Let's make plans later.

658
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:52,620
Yes.

659
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,610
Young Master Duan.

660
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:54,870
I'm afraid it'll still

661
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,960
take some time for your hand to recuperate.

662
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,540
Thanks to you, Lord Witch Doctor,

663
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,450
I've survived somehow.

664
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:03,300
The problem of the Moon Wolf Tribe has been solved, too.

665
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,030
I will set off to return to the Central Plain soon.

666
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:08,290
I hope that you can keep your promise

667
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:10,110
and give the holy relic to me.

668
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,420
If it's not something urgent,

669
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,490
it's not wise

670
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:14,740
to travel at this time.

671
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:15,830
It doesn't matter.

672
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:18,090
I have my own plan.

673
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,050
Fine.

674
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:22,100
You've solved the problem for our tribe.

675
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,980
I will keep my promise

676
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,260
and give the holy relic to you.

677
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,130
Where is the holy relic?

678
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:35,030
Lord Witch Doctor,

679
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,080
what do you mean?

680
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,180
Bad news!

681
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,720
The holy relic is missing!

682
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:39,730
Well,

683
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:40,900
how come the holy relic is missing coincidentally

684
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,830
when we're here?

685
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,980
Could it be...

686
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:45,570
Just say it.

687
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:47,770
Where's Wu?

688
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:48,600
I don't know.

689
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,640
Have any of you seen Wu?

690
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:09,980
Wu.

691
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,889
I won't give the holy relic to you guys.

692
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:17,780
You and he will leave once you get the holy relic.

693
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,580
You can leave,

694
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,060
but Shaoyi must stay.

695
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:20,889
Wu.

696
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,350
Shaoyi has told me

697
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,600
about what happened between you two.

698
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,340
Why?

699
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,350
I don't understand.

700
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:29,080
He said he can't protect me now.

701
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,440
But I don't care.

702
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,210
I don't need him to protect me.

703
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,620
Maybe Shaoyi knows that

704
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:36,540
if a man

705
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,050
can't protect his beloved women,

706
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:40,420
when he loses her,

707
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,440
how regretful he'll feel.

708
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:45,530
Are you talking about yourself?

709
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:47,820
Yes.

710
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,449
I couldn't stand by her side determinedly at that time,

711
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:52,980
and I failed to protect her.

712
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:57,410
This is also my lifelong regret.

713
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,030
Maybe Shaoyi just doesn't want to repeat my mistake.

714
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,510
So please trust him

715
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,240
and give him some time.

716
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,910
What does the woman you like

717
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,280
look like?

718
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,380
Maybe this is a miracle.

719
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,750
She looks exactly like

720
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,580
your Goddess.

721
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,040
So I firmly believe that this belongs to her.

722
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:26,150
Otherwise, it wouldn't have been such a coincidence.

723
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:28,340
Ask Shaoyi to come here.

724
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:29,650
Let him solve

725
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:31,380
the problem between him and me.

726
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:40,770
Wu.

727
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:41,740
Listen.

728
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,170
We women on the prairie

729
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,860
don't need men's protection.

730
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,600
Don't try to evade me with a reason like that.

731
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,420
I didn't.

732
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,100
I just want to be stronger,

733
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,250
just like my uncle.

734
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,330
Duan is so strong,

735
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:52,700
but he still lost

736
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,150
his most beloved woman, didn't he?

737
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,210
Without her staying by his side,

738
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:56,700
what's the use of being so strong?

739
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,540
If your purpose is not to take the holy relic away by cheating us,

740
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,200
and if your feelings are true,

741
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,500
then prove it to me.

742
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,700
My feelings are true.

743
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,380
How do you want me to prove it?

744
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,510
I'm willing to do anything.

745
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,510
Duan has said that

746
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:07,340
his beloved woman

747
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,140
looks exactly like our Goddess.

748
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,370
If you guys can bring that woman

749
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,780
back to our Fire Crane Tribe,

750
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,890
I'll believe that you didn't lie to me,

751
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,090
and I'll believe that

752
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,800
you didn't find an excuse to evade me.

753
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:18,730
By that time,

754
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:20,540
I'll definitely give you the holy relic.

755
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,370
By that time,

756
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,980
I'll definitely come back to be with you.

757
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,110
We'll be together forever.

758
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,990
You have to remember that

759
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,570
you are my slave.

760
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,170
No matter where you go,

761
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,050
you'll be my slave forever.

762
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,000
Trust me.

763
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:36,930
I'll definitely come back to see you.

764
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:38,610
Alright. Just go now.

765
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,050
We women on the prairie

766
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,170
won't cry because of men.

767
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,440
Lord Witch Doctor.

768
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:06,460
Goodbye.

769
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:07,660
Take care.

770
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:18,330
Let's go.

771
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,250
Come on.

772
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,340
Keep up with the procession!

773
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:23,820
Yes!

774
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:24,380
Hurry up!

775
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:37,400
My son is not here.

776
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:38,770
He's not here?

777
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:43,250
He said he needed to go out to see a patient early in the morning.

778
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:46,050
All of you are the disciples of Xiling Sect, right?

779
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,730
I'm Guan Mu's junior fellow disciple.

780
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:49,290
Mr. Guan,

781
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:52,830
do you know whose home he went to for treating the patient?

782
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:55,650
As I'm old now, I can't remember it clearly.

783
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,370
It seems to be Zhang's or Chang's home.

784
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:02,430
Guan Mu's medical skills are quite good.

785
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,220
When the villagers heard that he was back,

786
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,160
they all lined up to ask him to treat their diseases.

787
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:09,580
Thank you, Mr. Guan.

788
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:11,290
I have something else to do.

789
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:12,620
I have to go deal with it.

790
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:17,550
Uncle Ruan.

791
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,960
We've been busy looking for him all morning.

792
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,530
How about

793
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,910
we find something to eat?

794
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:22,510
Let's eat.

795
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:25,450
Ladies and gentlemen,

796
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:26,780
all the dishes are here.

797
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,010
Why is there no meat?

798
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:29,940
First Senior,

799
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,380
it's not easy for us to have a chance to come out.

800
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,650
Can't we eat something good?

801
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:33,530
-You’re so stingy.
-Yeah.

802
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:34,540
You're so stingy.

803
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:35,780
I'm...

804
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,690
I'm stingy?

805
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,870
[Wine]

806
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:41,950
This is for you.

807
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:51,460
First Senior.

808
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,260
What do you mean by giving this to me?

809
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,210
What do you mean by asking me that?

810
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:56,940
What are you trying to express?

811
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,130
I... I... I...

812
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,370
I... Stop saying "I".

813
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:01,420
It's fine if you don't like me.

814
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,500
Why did you give me a fly swatter?

815
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,320
Do you want to be beaten?

816
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:03,760
I'll just beat...

817
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,580
Exactly.

818
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,380
The officers from the government all gathered around that place.

819
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,020
Really?

820
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,810
I don't know which family he was from.

821
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:09,810
How unfortunate.

822
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,100
Why did he kill himself by jumping into the river at such a young age?

823
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,300
Exactly.

824
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,500
I think that man's bag

825
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:15,370
[Chrysanthemum]

826
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:16,330
looks a bit like this one.

827
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,580
They're both grey.

828
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,110
What's going on?

829
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,880
Are you this victim's relative?

830
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,010
This is impossible.

831
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:34,920
It's not him.

832
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,160
No.

833
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:38,440
If the answer is no, please step aside.

834
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,160
Guards!

835
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:39,870
Pull him away!

836
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:40,420
-Yes!
-Yes!

837
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,150
Junior Guan.

838
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:42,660
-Junior Guan!
-Go! Hurry up!

839
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,610
Junior Guan!

840
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,470
-Junior Guan!
-Go!

841
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,920
What's going on?

842
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,260
The government officers are handling a case.

843
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:48,860
Don't come forward.

844
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,650
What are you doing?

845
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:50,500
Second Senior.
