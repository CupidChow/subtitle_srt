Man Tianxing was suddenly killed.

67
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,220
It's like a diversionary tactic.

If they didn't come for Xiling,

could it be targeting someone?

00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,790
Master Ruan, I can't control myself anymore.

194
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:32,670
You have to

195
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,920
break my arms and legs.

196
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:13,860
Master Ruan.

197
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,910
Ruan Siqiong, impressive.

198
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,670
You found out.

199
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,910
Lord Shen, it was you.

200
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,430
I didn't expect you to use such sorcery

201
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,320
to control the meridians of the human body.

202
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,150
That's right.

203
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,070
The beauty of the puppet strings

204
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,530
is that you can't control

205
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,780
your actions even if you want to resist,

206
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,820
whether it's Guan Mu or Man Tianxing,

207
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,870
Since you've found it,

208
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,800
tell me where Black Wood Human-shaped Sword is.

209
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,310
Otherwise...

210
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,590
Qing.

211
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,350
Think carefully.

212
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,270
If you kill me,

213
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,280
you'll lose your leverage.

214
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,470
There are plenty of Xiling disciples.

215
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,030
If killing you is not enough,

216
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,830
I'll just have to kill a few more.

217
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,220
So you planned this all along.

218
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,020
That's right.

219
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:03,590
Otherwise,

220
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,070
how could I be your friend?

221
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,070
Darn it.

222
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,670
You used me.

223
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,030
What did I use?

224
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,140
Your information was useless.

225
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,070
But

226
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,390
you gave me a good opportunity.

227
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,510
Guan Mu didn't want you to leave Xiling,

228
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,270
choosing to leave the mountain himself,

229
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,350
saving me a lot of trouble.

230
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,770
Bastard.

231
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,870
I'll kill you!

232
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,910
I'll kill you right now to avenge my fellows!

233
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,150
The puppet strings can't control you?

234
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,070
Of course.

235
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,680
I'm exceptionally gifted.

236
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,710
Otherwise, how could Master value me so much?

237
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:55,370
You and your brother are really extraordinary.

238
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,300
Bai is meticulous,

239
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,880
being able to notice such a tiny flaw

240
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,510
as the blood spots.

241
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,950
I had no choice

242
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,380
but to find a way to kill him.

243
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,630
But unexpectedly,

244
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,630
he was more resolute than I thought,

245
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,340
actually killing Man Tianxing,

246
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,910
ruining my plan of killing them both.

247
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,120
Despicable wretch,

248
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,550
you framed my brother and killed my senior.

249
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,540
I curse you

250
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,590
and your ancestors!

251
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,430
How dare you?

252
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,070
Go on.

253
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,700
Ruan Siqiong.

254
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,200
Did you see that?

255
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:35,420
If you don't tell me where the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword is,

256
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,190
she will end up worse.

257
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,550
Do you want the sword or her?

258
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,350
Make your choice.

259
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,270
You might not know.

260
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,230
Only the Grand Steward knows where

261
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,960
the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword is.

262
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,760
Really?

263
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:54,990
Tell me,

264
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,410
where is the sword?

265
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,110
It's...

266
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,030
It's...

267
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,070
Master...Master Ruan.

268
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,120
It's okay.

269
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:58,870
Master Ruan.

270
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,410
Master Ruan.

271
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,060
Master Ruan.

272
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:09,870
Let's go.

273
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:10,980
Master Ruan!

274
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,430
Master Ruan!

275
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,630
Master Ruan!

276
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,910
Master Ruan!

277
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,870
What does the real sword seeker look like?

278
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,590
If he comes to me,

279
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,350
how can I recognize him?

280
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,070
You have the power of Black Wood Human-shaped Sword.

281
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,470
Every time the sword seeker touches you,

282
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,190
it will resonate with the power in your body.

283
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,390
Resonate?

284
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,430
Every time he touches you,

285
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,500
your emotions and desires

286
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:44,190
will return to your body little by little.

287
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,950
Remember,

288
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,390
the sword seeker

289
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,270
is your salvation

290
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,270
and also your curse.

291
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:02,830
Master Ruan.

292
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:03,560
Master Ruan.

293
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,050
Master Ruan.

294
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:04,780
Master Ruan.

295
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,069
What happened?

296
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,030
Master Ruan.

297
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,230
Master Ruan.

298
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,750
Senior Lu, wake up!

299
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,710
Qing.

300
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,190
Fu Rong, I'll leave this to you.

301
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,250
I'll go after Qing.

302
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,540
You scum!

303
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,860
Your whole family are murderers!

304
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,080
I'll tear you into pieces!

305
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,020
You scum!

306
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,150
Shut up!

307
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,630
If it weren't for the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword,

308
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,460
I would have cut off your tongue.

309
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,670
Go ahead.

310
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,830
Do it now!

311
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,470
You're not a man if you don't.

312
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,140
I'll bite my tongue and kill myself.

313
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,230
Do you want to die?

314
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:55,710
Fine,

315
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,420
I'll grant your wish.

316
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,350
Kill me.

317
00:17:58,990 --> 00:17:59,550
If you kill me,

318
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,190
you'll never get the sword.

319
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,630
You...

320
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,160
That's right.

321
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,970
I don't want to kill you,

322
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,340
but that doesn't mean

323
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,270
I can't scar your face

324
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,750
or disable you.

325
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,630
You love to talk, huh?

326
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,310
I can keep your tongue,

327
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:31,150
but I will dig your eyes first.

328
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,470
What?

329
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:36,750
Do you think someone will come to save you?

330
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,390
Have you forgotten

331
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,870
Ruan Siqiong, the No.1 in the world,

332
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,790
is dead?

333
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,830
Just now.

334
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,990
Look.

335
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,270
He died in your own hands.

336
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,110
Help!

337
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,030
Help me!

338
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:03,550
The No.1 is not so great after all.

339
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,590
Tell me where the sword is,

340
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,630
and I might consider

341
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,110
sparing your life.

342
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,550
I can't say it too loud.

343
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,390
Come here.

344
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,700
Are you tricking me?

345
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,550
You've paralyzed me.

346
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,340
How could I?

347
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:30,870
It...

348
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,150
It's...

349
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,700
It's...

350
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,950
Even if I know where the sword is,

351
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,590
I would never tell you.

352
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,940
You want to die?

353
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,330
Senior Bao.

354
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,810
I, Bao Quancai from Xiling Sect

355
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,060
will revenge for disciples of Li San Hall,

356
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,790
Guan Mu and Man Tianxing

357
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,070
today.

358
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,830
Senior Lu, what should we do?

359
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,180
Master Ruan, weren't you the No.1 in the world?

360
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,870
Why did you die so easily?

361
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,630
Master Ruan was gone.

362
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,860
We're either dead or injured.

363
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,870
It's all my fault.

364
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,510
Master Ruan.

365
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,830
Master Ruan.

366
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:30,670
Qing.

367
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:31,870
Can you walk?

368
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:32,870
Senior Bao,

369
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,630
I'm paralyzed.

370
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,650
Just go.

371
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,860
He wants the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword.

372
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,790
He won't kill me.

373
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,990
Such deep fellowship.

374
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,110
Then I'll make you

375
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,870
kill your own senior, how about that?

376
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,790
Senior Bao, run!

377
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,270
Disciples of Xiling support each other.

378
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,750
I will protect

379
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:52,790
my junior.

380
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,390
You overestimate yourself.

381
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:07,870
Senior Bao.

382
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,590
I'm the First Senior.

383
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,420
I have the responsibility to protect the juniors.

384
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,670
I won't let you

385
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,520
kill any more disciples of Xiling.

386
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,930
Senior Bao.

387
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,790
Dongfangchun Jiaoqing,

388
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,530
tell me where the sword is.

389
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:27,110
and I might spare his life.

390
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,500
Otherwise,

391
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,250
I'll kill him

392
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,150
in front of you.

393
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:31,950
I'll tell you.

394
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,270
I'll tell you.

395
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,220
As long as you let him go,

396
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,890
I'll tell you everything.

397
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,720
I'll tell you everything.

398
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,350
Go.

399
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,420
Senior.

400
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,310
Senior Bao.

401
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,840
Senior Bao.

402
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,090
-Did you see it clearly?
-Senior Bao.

403
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,830
Senior Bao.

404
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,030
If you don't tell me where the sword is,

405
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,100
you'll end up like him.

406
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,710
Idiot.

407
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,550
You've been tricked.

408
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,090
Only Ruan Siqiong knew about

409
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,780
the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword.

410
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,750
Now that he's gone,

411
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,680
you will never know

412
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,380
where it is.

413
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,910
Tricked?

414
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,250
Impossible.

415
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,630
Aren't you supposed to be dead?

416
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,860
Why are you still alive?

417
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,090
You killed the Xiling disciples,

418
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,210
so I will send you to hell myself.

419
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:19,220
I'll take you home.

420
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:47,780
Senior Bao.

421
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,320
Master Ruan.

422
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,270
It's all over now.

423
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:57,760
It's time to go home.

424
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,130
I found this on Shen You.

425
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,420
He said it's puppet strings.

426
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,310
I think he used this to control everyone.

427
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,620
This weapon is too evil.

428
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,000
It's better to destroy it.

429
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,070
But...

430
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,870
how could the puppet strings be the weapon of Herbal King Valley?

431
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:19,750
Indeed,

432
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,250
puppet strings are known in the Martial Arts World,

433
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,470
but never seen.

434
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,430
Maybe it's a unique martial skill invented

435
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,350
by someone.

436
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:31,170
Could there be someone else behind Shen You?

437
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:35,110
Qing, come with me to meet Senior Song.

438
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:37,020
If he can find some clues

439
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,390
in the puppet strings,

440
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,590
maybe he can help us find out

441
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,640
the real murderer behind this.

442
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,270
So,

443
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,820
another disciple was killed?

444
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,710
The murderer is the Lord of Herbal King Valley,

445
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:51,510
Shen You.

446
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:54,550
Do you know why he killed Xiling disciples?

447
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,150
For the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword.

448
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,670
That sword again.

449
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,830
This is the weapon we found.

450
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:08,410
Shen You called it puppet strings.

451
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,230
I would like you to take a look.

452
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,710
to see which sect

453
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,430
or whose weapon this is.

454
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,390
You may leave now.

455
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,590
We have something to talk.

456
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,510
Yes.

457
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,910
[Grave of beloved wife, Shan Yao][Grave of late husband, Song Qi]

458
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:36,220
Grave of late husband, Song Qi?

459
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:38,830
For so many years,

460
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,740
there's one thing

461
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,870
I can't figure out.

462
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,550
Please go ahead.

463
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,900
You've been slow-witted since young

464
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,500
and couldn't even defeat me.

465
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:51,150
But later, you became the No.1 in the world.

466
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,170
I want you to tell me the truth.

467
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,350
Is your power

468
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,270
from

469
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,030
the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword?

470
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,200
Yes.

471
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,400
I knew it.

472
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,870
But I didn't expect

473
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:15,070
Master loved you so much,

474
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,590
using the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword

475
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,830
for his beloved disciple so easily.

476
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:20,710
And you,

477
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,760
for the title of the world's No.1,

478
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,270
refused to use the sword

479
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,550
to save your senior.

480
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,470
What a great Xiling.

481
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,720
Is that so-called "Xiling disciples

482
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,430
supporting each other"?

483
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,910
How could it be?

484
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,230
Oh no.

485
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,410
Master Ruan, are you alright?

486
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,510
I used these puppet strings

487
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:12,430
to repair my own meridians.

488
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,070
I think it's enough

489
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,790
to kill you.

490
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,660
So you're the one behind Shen You.

491
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:19,750
Yes, it's me.

492
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,550
Senior,

493
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,190
if you have a grudge against me,

494
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,730
you can take revenge on me.

495
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:27,200
But those innocent Xiling disciples,

496
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,260
what did they do wrong?

497
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:28,780
Shut up!

498
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,950
Master Ruan, open the door!

499
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:33,790
-Open the door, Master Ruan.
-This Qing means something

500
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:34,790
different to you, right?

501
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,910
Senior, this is between you and me.

502
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,160
Don't hurt her.

503
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,760
You've changed.

504
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,270
You've become softer

505
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,790
with weaknesses.

506
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,370
Die.

507
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,140
Song Qi, stop!

508
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,470
If you dare to hurt him,

509
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,790
I'll burn this place down.

510
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,620
You wouldn't dare.

511
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,110
It's you who wouldn't dare.

512
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,370
Here are the portraits of Master Shan Yao

513
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,230
and her favorite paper kites,

514
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,990
Everything here is as it was when she was alive.

515
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,150
If you dare to kill Master Ruan,

516
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,620
I'll burn this place down.

517
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,940
Then try it.

518
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,190
Senior,

519
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,480
don't make more mistakes.

520
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,090
Stop hurting others.

521
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,300
I've already taken ninety-nine steps,

522
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,830
just one last step to go.

523
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,080
Master Ruan.

524
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:21,720
Don't come over.

525
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,110
Give up.

526
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:25,490
He can't get rid of these puppet strings.

527
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,670
He can't escape,

528
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,270
then I'll burn them.

529
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:38,260
[Dear Shan Yao, now I am accompanied only by my shadow. Why couldn't we die together?]

530
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,230
Shan Yao!

531
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,250
Senior!

532
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,550
Master Ruan, run!

533
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,430
Senior.

534
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,110
Fire! Run!

535
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,110
Senior!

536
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,030
-Run! Master Ruan!
-Shan Yao!

537
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,580
Senior.

538
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,980
Ruan Siqiong.

539
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,470
Remember,

540
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,410
both Shan Yao and I

541
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:03,490
were killed by you.

542
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:07,870
Senior.

543
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,620
Shan Yao.

544
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,660
Do you know that I've never forgotten

545
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,220
about the past?

546
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,750
You and Senior Shan Yao will always be my family.

547
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,140
Leave.

548
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,070
I don't want to see you again.

549
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,230
Shan Yao.

550
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,030
I'm coming.

551
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,450
Senior Song Qi,

552
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,680
Senior Shan Yao,

553
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,390
may you find

554
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,680
happiness in the next life.

555
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,270
What do you want to say?

556
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,230
Master Ruan,

557
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,390
I want to tell you something.

558
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,870
Actually, I've been lying to you.

559
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:02,470
I want the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword

560
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,790
not to save my mother.

561
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,390
I wonder if you noticed

562
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,300
the order for arrest on

563
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,950
Qingshui Town's bulletin board.

564
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,380
It has my portrait.

565
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:13,510
Not only that,

566
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,110
Bai isn't my brother.

567
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,950
My real name isn't Qing,

568
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,270
it's Gu Qingqiao.

569
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,550
Bai is my good friend,

570
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,740
Lu Zizheng.

571
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,810
I want to use the sword not to save others,

572
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,830
but to save myself.

573
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:30,710
Gu Qingqiao?

574
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,390
Why did you choose to tell me this now?

575
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:40,190
You know, even if you hide it from me,

576
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:43,030
you could still get the sword.

577
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,270
Because...

578
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,870
Because I don't want to be like them.

579
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,150
I want the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword,

580
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:52,080
but I want to get it fair and square.

581
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,470
Fair and square?

582
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,250
It does seem like something you'd do.

583
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,120
Aren't you angry

584
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,870
because I lied to you?

585
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,240
Of course I'm angry.

586
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,640
But because you told me the truth,

587
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,470
I'm actually happy.

588
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,070
Let's go.

589
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:30,710
[Wine]

590
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:39,270
Thinking back to when we descended the mountain,

591
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,070
it feels like another lifetime.

592
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,950
Master Ruan, how are your injuries?

593
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:44,630
It's fine.

594
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:45,510
Please wait.

595
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,150
Who are you?

596
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,500
Qiao.

597
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:06,900
Senior,

598
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,430
they are here for me.

599
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:09,670
Who is he?

600
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,100
Master Ruan,

601
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:14,510
he's the one I told you about,

602
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,190
who lied to me, used me,

603
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,700
and made me homeless.

604
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,070
The Duan family of Changqing and Xiling

605
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,870
have never disturbed each other.

606
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:25,310
Why are you chasing after the Xiling disciples today?

607
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,230
I've heard a lot about you, Master Ruan.

608
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:29,510
I'm here for Gu Qingqiao.

609
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:31,020
Gu Qingqiao?

610
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,250
Who is Gu Qingqiao?

611
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:35,860
Senior,

612
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:36,870
it's me.

613
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:37,870
You?

614
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,820
Isn't your name Dongfangchun Jiaoqing?

615
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,950
I'll explain later.

616
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:41,790
Qing.

617
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,850
Young Master Duan said he's here for you.

618
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,250
Do you know him?

619
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,350
No.

620
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,630
The disciple of Xiling, Dongfangchun Jiaoqing,

621
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:53,220
said she doesn't know Young Master Duan from Changqing.

622
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,860
I think you've got the wrong person.

623
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,010
Please leave.

624
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:58,710
Qiao,

625
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,710
what's between us is not what you think.

626
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:01,950
Give me a chance to explain.

627
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:02,700
Sorry,

628
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:04,900
I can't give you that chance.

629
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,580
If there's nothing else,

630
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,310
we have to send our seniors back

631
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,640
to the mountain.

632
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:11,990
Qiao.

633
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,510
Young Master, sorry.

634
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:16,910
Young Master,

635
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,310
your hand is badly injured.

636
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,850
If it becomes disabled,

637
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:22,250
who will take care of you?

638
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,390
What happened to his hand?

639
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,310
Is it hurt?

640
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,090
We do have medicine in Xiling.

641
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,180
But...

642
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:33,310
Qing, do you know him or not?

643
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,490
Should we help him?

644
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:36,990
Young Master,

645
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,430
you are in such pain,

646
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:40,430
yet coming all the way to see Miss Gu.

647
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,230
Why do you have to do this?

648
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:46,750
Let's go.

649
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,070
Miss Gu,

650
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:51,220
since you're a disciple of Xiling,

651
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,980
which is famous for the medical skills,

652
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,990
and we are both from Changqing,

653
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,760
please help the Young Master.

654
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:00,550
Master Ruan,

655
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:01,910
how about...

656
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,720
You've decided?

657
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:08,790
Follow us.

658
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:10,989
Thank you, Miss Gu and Master Ruan.

659
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,510
Kong Anguo's Preface.

660
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:22,580
The books written by Fu Hsi, Shennong, and the Yellow Emperor,

661
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,150
are called the Three Masterpieces,

662
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:28,239
representing great morality and wisdom.

663
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,800
I...

664
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,630
I can't teach you.

665
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:39,550
Get out!

666
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,870
Master, I won't do it again.

667
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,750
Dare to argue back?

668
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,110
You fail!

669
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:50,070
So reckless.

670
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,320
Why are you late?

671
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:53,810
Master, Master Ruan and the others are back.

672
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:57,090
Quancai is really uncapable.

673
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,370
Everyone stay put.

674
00:34:58,770 --> 00:34:59,630
I'm going to discipline these youngsters.

675
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,110
Let's go and have a look.

676
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,480
Hurry up.

677
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:08,320
Do you know how many days you've been away?

678
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,340
Where is Quancai?

679
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,970
Is Guan Mu unwilling to come back?

680
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,390
This is...

681
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:29,830
Who is it?

682
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:31,550
Senior,

683
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,440
I failed to protect them.

684
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:52,030
Who's inside?

685
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,510
Who is it?

686
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,430
Who is it?

687
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,890
Who is it?

688
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,790
Who killed my disciple?

689
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:31,230
That's all for today's treatment.

690
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,160
Senior Fu Rong will take care of it.

691
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,600
Miss Gu,

692
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:36,750
aren't you going to ask

693
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,410
why the Young Master got hurt?

694
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,710
This is Xiling,

695
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:42,550
and she's a disciple of Xiling's Li San Hall,

696
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:43,590
Qing.

697
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:51,590
Miss Gu.

698
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:53,670
Miss Qing.

699
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,520
Young Master...

700
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:57,950
He...

701
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,830
I have nothing to do with Young Master Duan.

702
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:00,560
Taking you in

703
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,950
is in line with Xiling's mission of healing people.

704
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:04,630
Even if it weren't you today,

705
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:05,880
I would have helped.

706
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,180
Please don't misunderstand.

707
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,550
Young Master thought you were taken away by the Moon Wolf Tribe,

708
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,640
then he fell off the cliff.

709
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,670
He hurried to Xiling from miles away before recovery

710
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,070
upon hearing news of you.

711
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,430
To catch me?

712
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,360
No, Miss Gu...

713
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,030
Miss Qing, you misunderstood.

714
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,270
The Young Master was just worried about you.

715
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:24,030
That I might collude with the Sacred Blood Sect?

716
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,470
It's not what you think.

717
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,070
In Xiling,

718
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,670
no one can hurt my disciples.

719
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,800
If you two have other intentions,

720
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,190
you won't be able to stay in Xiling.

721
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,390
Let's go.

722
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:40,990
Miss...

723
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:46,830
Young Master.

724
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:48,190
Young Master.

725
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,600
I heard everything.

726
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,110
Young Master,

727
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,870
you're so injured,

728
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:58,980
how could Miss Gu be so heartless?

729
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,640
I hurt her too much.

730
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,910
You had no choice.

731
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:07,020
We went through so much to find Miss Gu,

732
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,710
but she is so hostile to us.

733
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,420
With that Ruan Siqiong protecting her,

734
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,920
I can't even talk to her.

735
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:15,700
I just need to make sure she's by my side.

736
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,130
I'll find a chance to explain to her myself.

737
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:21,980
So,

738
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:26,750
Man Tianxing was killed by Bai?

739
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,670
Junior Man was controlled by puppet strings.

740
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:34,030
Bai had no choice.

741
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,500
But

742
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:39,510
what he did was too reckless,

743
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,750
and then he was disrespectful,

744
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,940
Master Ruan had no choice

745
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,210
but to expel him from the sect.

746
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,430
Senior,

747
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,870
I overstepped.

748
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:55,870
Junior.

749
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:57,350
Junior.

750
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,910
How could you leave like this?

751
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:04,230
You should take me with you.

752
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:08,860
It's so noisy.

753
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,460
I can't sleep at all.

754
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,350
Junior.

755
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,150
Alright,

756
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,790
the dead deserve respect.

757
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:14,510
Lie down.

758
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,660
You've been taking care of me.

759
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,070
Junior.

760
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:33,750
