the Sacred Blood Sect massacred Xiling because of this sword.

150
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,590
That's why the sword disappeared.

155
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:37,920
The Sacred Blood Sect is really a disaster.

156
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,230
Some said this sword was still in Xiling

157
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,850
and was guarded secretly.

158
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,180
It could be possible that the sword is still in Xiling.

00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,270
Go over there.

193
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,270
-Hurry up. -Don't slouch.

194
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:34,820
Hurry!

195
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:35,550
Go.

196
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,430
Hurry up.

197
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,290
Get another batch.

198
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,190
Hurry up.

199
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,140
-Stand up. -Hurry up.

200
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,020
Go.

201
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,670
Over there.

202
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,470
Do you hear me?

203
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,990
Young Master.

204
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,150
Run for your life!

205
00:09:59,150 --> 00:09:59,940
Run!

206
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,340
They're here to make trouble.

207
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,460
Chase them!

208
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,260
Gu Qingqiao.

209
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,320
Qiao.

210
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,190
Qiao.

211
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,190
I got you.

212
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,340
You are a bad guy!

213
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,490
Let me go if you dare!

214
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,000
Stop talking.

215
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,150
Let me help you up.

216
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,820
Slow down.

217
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,670
My butt.

218
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,940
My leg.

219
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,500
Let's go back.

220
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,750
No.

221
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,650
If I can't find Duan Yu, I'd rather die outside.

222
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:26,250
Watch out!

223
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:32,900
Watch him.

224
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,100
Waiter.

225
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,190
Be our guards ourside.

226
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:35,710
Sir.

227
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,500
Let me ask you.

228
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,430
Are women and children nearby often caught and sold?

229
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,070
Yes.

230
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,160
The tribes nearby are often attacked by the Moon Wolf Tribe.

231
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,360
Young Master Shaoyi.

232
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,590
Do you remember

233
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,520
the characteristic of the girl who ran away that day?

234
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,190
This is the totem of the Fire Crane Tribe.

235
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,270
Fire Crane Tribe?

236
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,500
Where is the Fire Crane Tribe?

237
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,430
Go north.

238
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,430
Close to the stream and rocky beach.

239
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:03,940
Okay.

240
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,190
Let's go.

241
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,960
Maybe Duan Yu is waiting there.

242
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:08,260
Young Master Shaoyi.

243
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,150
Your butt.

244
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,030
Not a big deal.

245
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,070
I'm fine.

246
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,430
Stick out your belly.

247
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:20,710
Don't forget your identity.

248
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,510
My identity?

249
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:22,960
What is my identity?

250
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,700
Are you out of your mind?

251
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,200
You're a widow in Zhang Village.

252
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,020
You are pregnant because you had an affair with a man.

253
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,220
I'm a kind fortune teller who passed by.

254
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,190
You wanted to commit suicide.

255
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,190
I saved your life.

256
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,620
Can't you think of something good for me?

257
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,150
It's so complicated.

258
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,350
I can't memorize it.

259
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,820
How much

260
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,380
is the fortune-telling?

261
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,630
I do not tell fortune.

262
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,890
How stupid you are to drive away a potential client!

263
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,550
Wait a moment.

264
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,940
Sir.

265
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,020
You'll have a bloody disaster.

266
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,950
Your family will be unsettled. You will have arguments with your wife. Nothing will be in your favor.

267
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,860
You won't have any chance to get rich.

268
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,430
Since your life is so miserable,

269
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,430
I won't charge you any.

270
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,080
Qing.

271
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,250
Let's go.

272
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,620
You are a born actor.

273
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,440
Bravo.

274
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,400
I can be your mentor.

275
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,420
Don't you think it's strange?

276
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:28,950
What's strange?

277
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,420
Along our way here,

278
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,500
many people wear white clothes

279
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,630
with the same sword.

280
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:38,370
[Wanted]

281
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,280
Take a look.

282
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,950
A clearance sale.

283
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,470
Only 998.

284
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:41,790
Only 998.

285
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,270
A clearance sale.

286
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,790
Only 998.

287
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,550
You can have the same outfit as Ruan Siqiong, the greatest martial artist in the world.

288
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,460
Ruan Siqiong?

289
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,510
Only 998.

290
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,500
Could this be a coincidence?

291
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,860
You can have the same outfit as Ruan Siqiong, the greatest martial artist in the world.

292
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,350
Who is Ruan Siqiong?

293
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,280
Why is everyone imitating him?

294
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,950
He's obviously not important.

295
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,100
Take a look.

296
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,530
-The same outfit as Ruan Siqiong. -Let's go.

297
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,940
Since last month when

298
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,460
Uncle Ruan defeated Nangong Wuhen,

299
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,140
the best martial artist of Shenlong Pavilion,

300
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,540
this town has been bustling with large crowds.

301
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,270
What are you looking at? Can you hurry up?

302
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,670
Do you know how hard it is to pretend pregnant?

303
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,940
Peole come here to see how charming Uncle Ruan is.

304
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,700
I'm tired.

305
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,830
I want to take a rest.

306
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,430
Why are they still not used to it?

307
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,430
Why are you so troublesome?

308
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,070
Senior.

309
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,630
I want to buy the same outfit as Uncle Ruan.

310
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,620
What do you think?

311
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,030
Can you aim high?

312
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,260
You are a disciple of Xiling.

313
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,840
How can you wear counterfeits like them?

314
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,990
Please join the line.

315
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,410
Everyone will get one.

316
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,690
Everyone will get one.

317
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,670
Okay, thank you.

318
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,620
Everyone will get one.

319
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,170
Today, Yuelai Inn opens to welcome guests.

320
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,260
It's an honour

321
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,590
to have Master Ruan who returned from his journey in our inn.

322
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,830
Welcome in

323
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,150
and take a look at the greatest martial artist in the world.

324
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,180
I didn't expect ancient people

325
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:00,980
also like to join in the fun.

326
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,640
Do you want to see Master Ruan?

327
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:05,310
Let's go.

328
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,950
We need to find the sword in Xiling.

329
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,390
Let's go and see the greatest martial artist in the world.

330
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,220
Let's go.

331
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:11,950
Come on.

332
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,030
Stop pushing.

333
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,070
For the sake of my baby,

334
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,310
please let me have a look at

335
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,350
the greatest martial artist in the world.

336
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,010
No problem.

337
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,390
No problem.

338
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,030
Senior.

339
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:24,550
It's Uncle Ruan.

340
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,670
Please come in.

341
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,870
Doesn't Uncle Ran hate the crowd the most?

342
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,870
Let's go, Senior.

343
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,420
Are you stupid?

344
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,100
You don't have to elbow your way out

345
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,700
if you want to see Uncle Ruan.

346
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,770
Do you know the shortcut?

347
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:36,230
Let's go.

348
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,230
Let's take a look at the master of martial arts.

349
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,780
Please line up.

350
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,430
Please line up.

351
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,190
Don't push.

352
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,100
Isn't it this way?

353
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,030
Don't push.

354
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,360
[Wanted]

355
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:55,860
Junior Man.

356
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,380
We didn't learn martial arts for nothing.

357
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,170
This is the best time to use it.

358
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,420
I'm busy.

359
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,290
Senior, look.

360
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,460
Are pregnant women so tough now?

361
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:13,740
Shh.

362
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,810
What did you say to them?

363
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:34,140
I said we were all martial artists

364
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,640
and there was no need to expose each other.

365
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,280
Can they understand it?

366
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,060
No problem.

367
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,620
Senior.

368
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,550
What did you say?

369
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,750
I told her that she displayed the gestures so fast

370
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,880
that I didn't get it.

371
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:46,900
Hmm.

372
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,770
Hurry up.

373
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:51,420
Master Ruan.

374
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,710
It's really him.

375
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:53,580
So handsome.

376
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,990
So good-looking.

377
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,310
He's so handsome. I finally meet him in person.

378
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,460
What's so good about me

379
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,300
except my handsome face?

380
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,620
Why did you escape marriage for me?

381
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,829
When I was young,

382
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,670
I sweared that I would only marry the greatest martial artist.

383
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,230
Is it really so important

384
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,109
to marry the best one in the world?

385
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:12,349
Of course.

386
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,220
People only remember the best.

387
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,790
It's so noisy outside.

388
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,430
Senior.

389
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,580
Is that Uncle Ruan?

390
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:31,670
Hold on.

391
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,530
This is not an ideal position.

392
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,660
I can only see the back side of his head.

393
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,110
I don't think it's Dr. Ruan.

394
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:44,750
It doesn't look like him from this angle.

395
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,470
Take down another piece.

396
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,470
What if they notice us?

397
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,150
I'll help you.

398
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,180
I'm not afraid.

399
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,380
Did you leave a letter to your family,

400
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,710
saying you would elope with Ruan Siqiong?

401
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,200
Of course.

402
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,270
Okay.

403
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,630
Don't worry.

404
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,020
I'll take you with me.

405
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,430
Madam.

406
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,400
Are you alright?

407
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,900
Uncle Ruan.

408
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,270
Uncle Ruan.

409
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,110
Uncle Ruan, are you alright?

410
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,420
Who are you? You are so ugly.

411
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,300
So rude of you!

412
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,670
Who are you?

413
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,820
How dare you pretend to be Uncle Ruan?

414
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,020
You are so shameless.

415
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:43,440
I will definitely give you a lesson today.

416
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,020
Where is Lu Zizheng?

417
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,420
Why isn't he here at such a critical moment?

418
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,150
I hate people ruining my hairstyle.

419
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:31,990
Who is that?

420
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,190
Uncle Ruan?

421
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,140
Nangong Wuqing.

422
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,910
I didn't spare your life

423
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,820
for you to bully the weak.

424
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,710
Dr. Ruan.

425
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,900
Ruan Siqiong.

426
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,590
I'll say it again.

427
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,830
I'm not Nangong Wuqing,

428
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,470
but Nangong Wuhen.

429
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:58,830
Watch out.

430
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,600
I'll let you remember my name today.

431
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,970
I don't remember the name of a dying person.

432
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:15,980
Dr. Ruan.

433
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,420
My chest hurts so much like it's on fire.

434
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,290
Am I dying?

435
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,580
Be quiet.

436
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,340
Dr. Ruan.

437
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,780
I'm Chunjiao.

438
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,790
I'm Chunjiao who broke her arm.

439
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:45,790
Are you showing up on your own or do you want me to force you?

440
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,160
Greetings, Predecessor Ruan.

441
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,660
What's your relationship

442
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:55,690
with her?

443
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,040
She's my sister.

444
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,640
She was hit by the Flame Palm of Shenlong Pavilion.

445
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,300
I need to take her back to Xiling to detoxify her.

446
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:09,500
[The Xiling Sect]

447
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,950
If someone is easy to panic,

448
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,230
suffers from insomnia

449
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,310
and is forgetful.

450
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,700
In addition, he has cankers in his mouth

451
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,430
and has constipation.

452
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,750
His pulse...

453
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,750
Senior Lu. Senior Lu.

454
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,590
Who's attacking me?

455
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:33,190
Who?

456
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,860
Lu Huahua, tell me.

457
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,630
What medicine do you need to cure the illness I said just now?

458
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,750
If you can't answer it,

459
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,890
I can't give you the antidote

460
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,550
to your toxin.

461
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,060
Master.

462
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:48,940
You...

463
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,220
It hurts.

464
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,170
What happened?

465
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,640
I can't take it anymore.

466
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,790
I didn't expect that after all these years,

467
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,870
the one who accompanied me through the last moment of my life

468
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,740
was Dr. Ruan.

469
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,470
Life is unpredictable.

470
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,160
I am not sure how my mom feels

471
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:18,910
if she knows this.

472
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,750
Don't worry.

473
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,340
The Flame Palm you got

474
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,070
can be cured by Uncle Ruan

475
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,870
with his Prajna Palm.

476
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,620
But

477
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:33,030
you have to endure

478
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,190
the pain and bleeding from your wound.

479
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,630
When did Dr. Ruan leave?

480
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,390
Dr. Ruan.

481
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:43,740
Ruan?

482
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,550
You mean Uncle Ruan?

483
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,460
Yes.

484
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,610
Dr. Ruan.

485
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,030
is your Uncle Ruan.

486
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,830
Don't worry.

487
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,520
With Uncle Ruan's treatment,

488
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,620
you won't die.

489
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,580
If he doesn't want to save me,

490
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,460
I will still die.

491
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,900
You're fine now.

492
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:03,660
Then...

493
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,260
Do you mean I can leave now?

494
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,050
Uncle Ruan said three days.

495
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,390
You can leave in three days after you fully recover.

496
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,630
Three days?

497
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:12,540
Yes.

498
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,760
You will surely recover in three days.

499
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,990
Thank you for your help. I'm Furong.

500
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,940
Furong?

501
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,830
Your name is so nice.

502
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,300
I haven't asked your name yet.

503
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,620
I...

504
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,350
I am Qing.

505
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,510
My brother is Bai.

506
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:37,780
Where is my brother?

507
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,350
Your brother has settled down.

508
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,950
You just need to recuperate.

509
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,580
Qing.

510
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,950
Where did you come from?

511
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:48,510
We came from the east.

512
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,820
We are on our way to Xiling to seek our family.

513
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,020
In order to avoid bandits,

514
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,550
I disguised myself as a pregnant woman.

515
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,360
You're so smart.

516
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:02,690
Have you heard

517
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,060
that Uncle Ruan brought back a girl?

518

-Senior. -What's wrong?

520
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,500
I heard that Uncle Ruan brought a girl back.

521
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,510
Is she pretty?

522
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:13,150
What are you thinking about?

523
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,500
Qing saved us today.

524
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:18,340
Uncle Ruan took her back to cure her wounds.

525
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,470
What are you doing here?

526
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,350
Why aren't you studying?

527
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,060
Go back.

528
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:24,740

529
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,120
What are you looking at?

530
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:29,030
What are you looking at?

531
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,350
Go back

532
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,510
to study.

533
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,460
Let's go.

534
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,340
-Senior was beaten again. -What are you laughing at?

535
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,200
Stop laughing.

536
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,430

537
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,190

You can check the account anytime.

You are in charge.

You traveled around the world.

00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,380
Drop by?

569
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,630
It's heavily guarded here.

570
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:12,020
No outsider is allowed to enter.

571
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,540
You dropped by so easily?

572
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,370
Of course.

573
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,060
I can go anywhere I want.

574
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,400
Good for you.

575
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,190
Why are you so complacent?

576
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,380
Good for you.

577
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,310
You were hit by Nangong Wuhen,

578
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,930
so we have a reason to stay here now.

579
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,510
Do you have any conscience?

580
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,180
I almost died from that palm.

581
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,140
So annoying.

582
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,430
What should we do now?

583
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,100
What should we do?

584
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,010
You have to ask yourself.

585
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,030
Let's split up

586
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,710
to find the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword.

587
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,680
No problem.

588
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,690
What does the sword look like?

589
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,900
Well...

590
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,190
You don't know, do you?

591
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:57,540
I...

592
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,300
It looks like a sword.

593
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:11,060
Greetings, Dr. Ruan.

594
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,710
Master Ruan.

595
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,360
Are you Chunjiao?

596
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:16,450
I'm Qing.

597
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,060
Actually,

598
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:20,660
my full name is Dongfang Chunjiaoqing.

599
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,490
It's a mouthful name.

600
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,410
So just call me Qing.

601
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,930
Master Ruan.

602
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,800
Have you seen me before?

603
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,780
I've never met you before,

604
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,380
but you seem familiar.

605
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:41,270
Think about it.

606
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,000
You might be able to recall it.

607
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,550
I think you mistake me for someone else.

608
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,120
Do you want to see me throw discus?

609
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:04,990
Discus?

610
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,750
Discus? Discus?

611
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:14,630
This...

612
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,120
That's it.

613
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:31,700
I used to know nothing

614
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,590
but throwing discus before.

615
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,120
Then my arm was injured.

616
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,780
A doctor encouraged me,

617
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,380
saying that life was not only about scores,

618
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,540
and it was not just about discus either.

619
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,050
Where is the doctor now?

620
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,550
It's hard to see him again.

621
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,870
Even if we meet again,

622
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:57,230
I don't think he still remembers me.

623
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,870
Fate cannot be made.

624
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,090
This is too shallow.

625
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,590
Isn't it a little perfunctory?

626
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,090
Thank you for keeping off the Flame Palm for me.

627
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:15,690
The toxin of Flame Palm needs to be deactivated at noon every day.

628
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,050
It's already afternoon.

629
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,730
Come here tomorrow.

630
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,890
Why has Dr. Ruan turned into the goblin mode？

631
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,580
She seems to have no martial arts skills.

632
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:41,000
How can she pull out the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword?

633
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:47,980
Qiao.

634
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,030
Qiao.

635
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,550
Who is Qiao?

636
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,700
I'm Wu.

637
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:01,300
Miss.

638
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,820
Where am I?

639
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:05,380
This is the territory of the Fire Crane Tribe.

640
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,950
I will thank you for your help.

641
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,810
Please contact my subordinates.

642
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,860
No way.

643
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,220
I have the right to punish

644
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,050
the sinners I brought back.

645
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,430
You can't go back to the Central Plain.

646
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,550
I must go back.

647
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,170
I have something to do.

648
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,530
The most important thing for you now is to take the medicine.

649
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,000
Miss.

650
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,110
Where is my ring?

651
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,430
It remains unknown if you can survive.

652
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,510
What's the use of that ring?

653
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,970
It's very important to me.

654
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,640
Please give it back to me.

655
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,990
Take the medicine first.

656
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:39,730
Miss.

657
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:40,940
Miss.

658
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:06,830
Qiao.

659
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:08,670
Let's change sides.

660
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,710
Let me step on it.

661
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,730
Do you want to change?

662
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,090
No?

663
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:23,650
All right.

664
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,010
There's enough sadness for today.

665
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:33,870
All right, I've made the bed for you.

666
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,130
You can sleep next to me.

667
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:35,890
Thank you.

668
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:36,830
Man Tianxing.

669
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,960
Come and help me.

670
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,990
Are you drying your hair again?

671
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,800
Do you even have a hair dryer here?

672
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,890
Summon the wind.

673
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:50,510
Speed up.

674
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,710
Raise the wind speed!

675
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,400
You are really talented.

676
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,840
I've never seen someone drying their hair with martial arts.

677
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,050
It's not a big deal.

678
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,600
There are people who cook with internal force.

679
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,910
Our master said

680
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,540
there wouldn't be so many bad guys to punish.

681
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,870
Practicing martial arts can make your life easier

682
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,600
except for building your body.

683
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,860
Take the Flame Palm you got for example.

684
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,150
If you don't vomit blood or feel any pain,

685
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,910
it can serve as a heater in winter.

686
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:19,540
It will be perfect.

687
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,790
It's thought-provoking.

688
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,270
I feel like I've entered

689
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,510
a new world.

690
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,980
We Xiling disciples study medicine and practise martial arts as well.

691
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,940
That's why we can understand the world better than ordinary people.

692
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,670
Of course.

693
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,230
It's nine fifteen now.

694
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:32,950
Time to put off the candles.

695
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:33,670
Hurry up.

696
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:34,110
Senior is here.

697
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,510
Let's go. Hurry up.

698
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:38,110
Hurry up. Close the door.

699
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:42,940
Get up.

700
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:44,880
Senior has left.

701
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,910
I want to gossip about something.

702
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,750
Although I'm not a martial artist,

703
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,820
I've also heard of the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword,

704
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,680
the greatest treasure of Xiling.

705
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,420
I don't know if I'm lucky enough to...

706
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,150
Shh.

707
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,130
In Xiling,

708
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,350
no one is allowed to mention that sword.

709
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:08,930
And it disappeared 15 years ago.

710
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,690
Why can't no one mention it?

711
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,150
Because

712
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,950
it brought bloody disaster to Xiling.

713
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,830
Don't mention it again.

714
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,670
Got it?

715
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,180
What's wrong with you?

716
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,910
Why are your nostrils stuffed?

717
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,560
I don't want to be poisoned by your drug.

718
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,110
You think too much.

719
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:57,860
Let's go.

720
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:12,250
The more powerful a weapon is,

721
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,620
the simpler it is.

722
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:14,560
How is it?

723
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,670
Do you feel it?

724
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,679
This is just an ordinary wooden sword.

725
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,350
Try this one.

726
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,139
When I saw it,

727
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:35,070
I felt something special.

728
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,199
It's obviously a pile of scrap metal.

729
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,120
I searched all night in vain.

730
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,679
What about you?

731
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,960
Anywhere you haven't searched?

732
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,139
In the residential area,

733
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:55,670
I haven't gone to Tianshan Residence of Tianwang Mountain

734
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,210
and Ruan Siqiong's dome.

735
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,620
Touch the dome

736
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,760
when Ruan Siqiong

737
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,110
treats you tomorrow.

738
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:02,710
Okay.

739
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:03,730
Be careful.

740
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,560
Where is it?

741
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:08,110
It's strange.

742
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,620
How could it disappear?

743
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,640
Junior.

744
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:14,900
Have you seen my Trident of the Sea God?

745
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:18,900
How many times have I told you

746
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,960
not to eat in bed?

747
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:21,760
No idea.

748
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,310
Did you leave it in the martial hall?

749
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,390
No.

750
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:27,170
I've searched everywhere.

751
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:32,690
I suspect

752
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,440
there's a thief.

753
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,710
Master Ruan.

754
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,060
Master Ruan.

755
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,230
What are you looking at?

756
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,300
Nothing.

757
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,750
I'm just curious

758
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,860
what the residence of the greatest martial artist looks like.

759
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,910
I'm just looking around.

760
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,220
Do you need me to show you around?

761
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:01,850
No.

762
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:04,900
It's noon. Let's start the treatment.

763
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,130
I knew it.

764
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,150
Her body can absorb my internal force.

765
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,550
It seems that she is the one who can pull out the sword.

766
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,190
Does the wound still hurt?

767
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:55,050
Master Ruan.

768
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,860
You're amazing.

769
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,070
It doesn't hurt at all.

770
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,960
The treatment for today is over.

771
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,090
You can go back now.

772
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,220
Come here tomorrow.

773
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,370
Did you find any clues?

774
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,190
He entered

775
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:23,980
when I was looking for the clue.

776
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,780
It's not good.

777
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,260
You have to go down the mountain when you recover the day after tomorrow.

778
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,450
We don't have enough time.

779
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:30,710
I'll visit Tianshan Residence tonight.

780
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,080
Be careful.

781
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:34,520
How's your wound?

782
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:37,470
You know what?

783
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:39,600
Ruan Siqiong is indeed the best martial artist in the world.

784
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,700
When he treated me,

785
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:42,810
I felt like I was reborn.

786
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,940
-Why is he so... -You're obsessive with him.

787
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:48,070
Don't go.

788
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,370
I'm not sleepy.

789
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,990
I must catch the thief tonight.

790
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,950
Master's Tianshan Residence?

791
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,350
I finally have a chance

792
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:07,380
to perform in front of Master.

793
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:09,840
[Medicine]

794
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,110
Brat!

795
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:12,980
Stop!

796
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:21,900
It's you!

797
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,460
Brat!

798
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,190
I caught you.

799
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:25,750
Bao.

800
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:27,600
I'm here to see Master Wang.

801
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,960
I have something important to discuss with him.

802
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,760
How dare you still find excuses?

803
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,090
Trying to escape?

804
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,180
It's not that easy.

805
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:47,890
Who are you?

806
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:50,710
Why are you fighting in my residence at midnight?

807
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,300
Master Wang.

808
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,620
My brother and I grew up together

809
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,540
after our parents died.

810
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,490
We've never been apart for a second.

811
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:03,860
He entered Tianshan Residence by accident

812
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,460
because he worried about me.

813
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:08,220
Please forgive him

814
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,940
for the sake of his love for his sister.

815
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:10,590
Master.

816
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,310
Master.

817
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,510
He is not a good brother at all.

818
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,240
He broke into Xiling

819
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,840
and looked around at night.

820
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,160
He is clearly a thief.

821
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,840
Also, when I was checking the armory today,

822
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,210
I found many weapons were lost.

823
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:24,310
It must be him.

824
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,680
Is it true?

825
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:31,320
I've never stolen anything from Xiling.

826
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,460
I've never stepped on any plant.

827
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,300
You framed me

828
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,030
without

829
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,260
any evidence.

830
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:38,810
Aren't you too hasty?

831
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:42,080
If you really lost something,

832
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,900
how can you prove that I stole it?

833
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,920
If I really wanted to steal,

834
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,200
why didn't I steal some valuable items?
