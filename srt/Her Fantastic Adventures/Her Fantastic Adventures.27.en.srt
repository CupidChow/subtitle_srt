[Her Fantastic Adventures]

3
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,789
A few days ago, I witnessed

4
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:47,320
the Xu family defect to the Sacred Blood Sect.

5
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:50,039
I can't help but have mixed feelings.

6
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:51,690
Several of my fellows

7
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:54,539
were also killed by the Sacred Blood Sect.

8
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:56,090
Xiling Sect and the Sacred Blood Sect

9
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,630
are mortal enemies.

10
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,640
It's only natural for me to be on high alert.

11
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,540
Master,

12
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,460
I have also heard about the Sacred Blood Sect,

13
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,600
but what I know

14
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,280
is quite different from what you said.

15
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,300
How so?

16
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,360
I heard

17
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,320
when the Duan family rallied Martial Arts World

18
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,250
to attack the Sacred Blood Sect,

19
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,460
the Sacred Blood Sect had not harmed any civilians.

20
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,329
The claim that they used commoners

21
00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:26,450
to practice the Blood Technique was completely fabricated.

22
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,329
Bai.

23
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:28,610
I don't know

24
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,670
where you heard such things,

25
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,550
but

26
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,600
all five of my juniors died from Blood Technique,

27
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,060
and their deaths were gruesome.

28
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,880
Injuries and deaths are inevitable during conflicts.

29
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,660
How can you be so certain

30
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,920
that the Sacred Blood Sect is evil?

31
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,700
[Episode 27]

32
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,630
The most terrifying aspect of Blood Technique

33
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,760
is that practitioners advance rapidly in their skills,

34
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,670
but the longer they practice, the more damage it does to themselves.

35
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,990
They then need the blood of others to sustain their own cultivation.

36
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,230
It is an undeniable fact that the Sacred Blood Sect

37
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,910
harmed civilians for their own advancement.

38
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,670
Bai,

39
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,100
what you said today

40
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,520
stays between you and me.

41
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,310
Do not let a third person hear it,

42
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,280
or it will bring trouble to you.

43
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,310
I understand.

44
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,510
In the whole Xiling,

45
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,000
you are the best to me.

46
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,420
You are the most promising disciple

47
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,300
I've ever had.

48
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,590
Naturally, I have to look out for you.

49
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:37,740
Come, sit down.

50
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,520
Sit down.

51
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:42,790
Today,

52
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,820
we have a great celebration.

53
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,540
My favorite disciple...

54
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,180
No.

55
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,000
One of my most cherished disciples

56
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,320
has returned to Xiling.

57
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:58,930
Master,

58
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,940
then which other disciple do you cherish?

59
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,030
Certainly not you.

60
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,580
Master, you hurt me so much.

61
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Come on.

62
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,970
I propose

63
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,690
a toast to Bai.

64
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,980
He has returned with sincerity,

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,540
and we all recognize

66
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,130
his intentions.

67
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,100
Let's wipe the slate clean

68
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,070
and move forward united as Xiling disciples,

69
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,920
supporting each other.

70
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:25,650
Here.

71
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,800
Cheers.

72
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,270
Welcome back, Bai.

73
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,410
Cheers.

74
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:32,500
Cheers.

75
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,310
Cheers.

76
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,110
Cheers.

77
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,880
I heard they're hosting a welcome banquet

78
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,300
with good food and drink.

79
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,500
I want to join too.

80
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,530
Master!

81
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,730
-Help me!
-Huahua!

82
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,250
Huahua!

83
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:32,790
What's wrong?

84
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:33,900
What's going on?

85
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:35,500
What's wrong?

86
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,970
What happened?

87
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,500
Bai, you...

88
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,420
Bai?

89
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,010
Huahua!

90
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,680
Huahua!

91
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,240
Is it you?

92
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,310
Is it you?

93
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:48,670
Hurry.

94
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,130
Give me the antidote!

95
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,510
Give me the antidote!

96
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,580
Bai.

97
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,150
I beg you.

98
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,540
Give me the antidote.

99
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:00,770
They...

100
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,130
They are your fellow disciples!

101
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,510
I have no fellow disciples.

102
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,780
I have no parents,

103
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,310
no clan,

104
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,470
no friends.

105
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,260
In this life, I came alone,

106
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,900
and I will leave alone.

107
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:18,500
You...

108
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,240
Blood Technique?

109
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,430
You are indeed from the Sacred Blood Sect!

110
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:57,790
Great Master Zhang.

111
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,100
Please hand over the treasure map.

112
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,700
No way!

113
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,310
You don't really think

114
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,740
there's only a few of us

115
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,240
who came to Xiling, do you?

116
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,300
If you've got guts,

117
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,790
come at me.

118
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,800
My disciples know nothing.

119
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,850
This is not up to you.

120
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,160
Bastard!

121
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,950
Don't you know

122
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,060
we have the best in the world?

123
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,920
When Siqiong comes back,

124
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,580
he will avenge us.

125
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,510
Master.

126
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,230
You've always wanted to know

127
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,030
where Ruan Siqiong went, right?

128
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,750
I can tell you now.

129
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,050
He's dead.

130
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:38,730
He died giving the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword

131
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:41,250
to Gu Qingqiao.

132
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,560
He's not coming back.

133
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,830
Impossible.

134
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,090
Siqiong is the best in the world.

135
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,120
He wouldn't die.

136
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:49,900
Master.

137
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,630
Do you know Ruan Siqiong became the number one

138
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,740
because he gave his heart

139
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,520
to Black Wood Human-shaped Sword?

140
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,080
And now that sword is pierced

141
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,910
by my Soul-stealing Nail.

142
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,320
No matter how powerful he is,

143
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,490
his soul

144
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,390
will be trapped by me,

145
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,510
forever unable to rise again.

146
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,620
Master.

147
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,030
In my heart,

148
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,900
I still see you as my master.

149
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,770
You are the only one in Xiling

150
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,580
who treats me well

151
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,680
and cares about me.

152
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,270
Bai...

153
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,280
Submit to the Sacred Blood Sect.

154
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,520
As long as you join us,

155
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,809
I can spare your life.

156
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:35,799
Do you still remember the Xiling rules?

157
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,480
Xiling disciples

158
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,760
stand united,

159
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,360
watching out for each other.

160
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:49,230
My greatest regret in life

161
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,630
is not being able

162
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:55,580
to protect my disciples.

163
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,270
I will never submit to the Sacred Blood Sect.

164
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,500
Zhang Sifeng!

165
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,290
Don't you care about your disciple's life?

166
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,320
Tianshan!

167
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,070
Master!

168
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,550
Master.

169
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,920
It's all my fault.

170
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,750
I failed to see through him.

171
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,510
Tianshan.

172
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,580
What about the other disciples?

173
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,580
I never thought

174
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,630
that among Xiling disciples,

175
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,610
there would be one from the Sacred Blood Sect.

176
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:49,020
Such disgrace!

177
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,730
You're wrong, Zhang Sifeng

178
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,750
I was born a member of the Sacred Blood Sect.

179
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,280
I joined Xiling Sect

180
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,900
just to get the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword.

181
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,360
In my heart,

182
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,080
I've never been a disciple of the Xiling Sect.

183
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,790
[Sacred Blood Sect]

184
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,390
Mother, I'm scared.

185
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,270
Don't be afraid. Just hide well.

186
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:32,910
Don't be afraid.

187
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,020
What about you?

188
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,280
No matter what happens,

189
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,590
don't make a sound.

190
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,540
Do you hear me?

191
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,320
Don't make a sound.

192
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,630
So, there's still someone left.

193
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,870
Father, let me handle this.

194
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,550
No!

195
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,430
No!

196
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,350
No!

197
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,580
You should

198
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,940
pay for their crimes!

199
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,810
So,

200
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,100
you're that person's son.

201
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,750
A true remnant

202
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,910
of the Sacred Blood Sect.

203
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:10,750
That's right.

204
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,820
Years ago, the Duan family joined forces

205
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:16,300
with the three great families to exterminate the entire Sacred Blood Sect.

206
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,370
I was the only one

207
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,410
who escaped.

208
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,000
Great Master Zhang.

209
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,630
Considering I once joined Xiling,

210
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,950
I'll give you a chance.

211
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:29,020
Hand over the treasure map in exchange for Wang Tianshan's life.

212
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,190
No!

213
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,100
No, Master!

214
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,580
Zhang Sifeng, think it through.

215
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,110
Ruan Siqiong is dead.

216
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,570
He's now Xiling Sect's only disciple.

217
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,940
The treasure map is just an object;

218
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,080
a life is real.

219
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,510
Give me the treasure map,

220
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,390
and I promise

221
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,100
to let him go.

222
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,340
No!

223
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,110
I'll fight you all!

224
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,070
Master!

225

226
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,190
I've failed you.

227

Master.

228
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,570
Don't call me Master.

229
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:10,720
I don't have a disciple like you.

230
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,810

231
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,490
Forgive me.

232

233
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,280
Tianshan!

234

Zhang Sifeng.

236
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,940
Hand over the treasure map!

I...

238
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:03,230
I won't let you get what you want.

239
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,380
Even if you slaughter everyone in Xiling,

240
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,790
you will not get the treasure map.

241
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:10,900
What do you mean?

242
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:18,530
You're too late.

243

Go search the place.

247
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:40,670
Yes.

248
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,040
If you can't find the treasure map,

249
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,640
burn Xiling to the ground.

250
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,590
If I can't have it,

251
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,570
no one can.

252
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,380
Yes.

Our fate

255
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,930
will not end here.

256
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,900
I will take back everything I've lost.

257
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,560
No one can stop me.

258
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:07,720
My Lord.

00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,370
Did you find the map?

260
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,510
I've failed.

261
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,440
Zhang Sifeng was too cunning.

262
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,410
He must have moved the treasure map

263
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,210
to a safer place long ago.

264
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,400
There's no one in Xiling anymore.

265
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,420
Who could he have given the map to?

266
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,340
What?

267
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,340
Say it again.

There's no one in Xiling anymore.

269

Who could he have given the map to?

270
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,020
You're wrong.

271
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,300
Xiling Sect still has one last disciple:

272
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,770
Gu Qingqiao.

273
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,980
Notify everyone.

274
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,260
Head to Jizhou Academy immediately.

Master Ruan has been unresponsive lately.

288
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,180
Could something have happened?

289
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,830
Predecessor Ruan might be in a deep sleep.

290
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:33,890
Give him some time.

291
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,270

your Qilin swordsmanship,

293
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,700
he might take you as his disciple.

294

I had no intention of disturbing you.

00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,460
I just want to go out.

387
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,270
No.

388
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,300
I thought you knew what to do.

389
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,680
But now, you want to go to Jizhou with him?

390
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,680
I won't allow it.

391
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,170
Absolutely not.

392
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,800
Father.

393
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,490
I'm going to Jizhou to find someone,

394
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,170
not to elope with Duan Yu.

395
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,860
I'll be back in a few days.

396
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,050
Qiao, don't lie to me.

397
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,900
You still have feelings for Duan Yu, don't you?

398
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,650
Listen to me.

399
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,910
You're still young.

400
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,160
Once we leave Changqing,

401
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,870
you will meet new people

402
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,600
and have a better life and family.

403
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,350
Father, what are you thinking?

404
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,760
Shaoyi might be missing because of me.

405
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,310
I have to find him.

406
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,240
Didn't you always teach me

407
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,830
to be responsible?

408
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,800
I don't want to see those around me

409
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,330
getting hurt because of me anymore.

410
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,640
In Changqing,

411
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,230
it was you and Duan Yu;

412
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:02,580
in Xiling, it was Lu Zizheng and Master Ruan.

413
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:07,200
I just want all this to end quickly.

414
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:10,670
Young Master.

415
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,440
I don't think Miss Gu will come.

416
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:17,680
Let's go.

417
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:18,710
Okay.

418
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,420
Miss Gu, you're here.

419
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,690
Wait.

420
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,120
You're leaving before I even arrive?

421
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,320
That's a bit too eager, don't you think?

422
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,340
Freshly made buns

423
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,530
—one for each.

424
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,250
My father made the filling.

425
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,170
Mr. Gu,

426
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,230
didn't you say...

427
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,800
Buns should be eaten hot.

428
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,840
Take care of Qiao.

429
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:40,840
I will.

430
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:41,930
Father.

431
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,520
You should go back now.

432
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,500
Don't worry.

433
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,530
I will return safely.

434
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,350
Miss Gu.

435
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,190
Guard Xing.

436
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,030
Any news about Young Master Shaoyi?

437
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,490
It was my mistake.

438
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:04,950
I thought he was returning to Jizhou voluntarily

439
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,270
and relaxed my guard.

440
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,720
Little did I know

441
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,610
he would disappear again.

442
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,160
Again?

443
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,720
Has Shaoyi gone missing before?

444
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,040
Young Master Shaoyi dislikes studying.

445
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,660
He always finds excuses

446
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,330
to escape before exams.

447
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,550
But this time is different.

448
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,020
His clothes and money are all still here.

449
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,510
I've checked carefully.

450
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,370
He didn't take anything with him,

451
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:29,640
and it looks like

452
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,520
he left in a hurry.

453
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,950
It seems our speculation

454
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:33,960
was correct.

455
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,440
I just met your brother at the Noble Families Congress.

456
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,300
But when I came back, I heard Shaoyi was missing.

457
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,360
Don't worry.

458
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,110
I've arranged for students from the academy

459
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,370
to search everywhere.

460
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,030
Shaoyi is mischievous;

461
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:49,110
perhaps he has just skipped back to Changqing.

462
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,950
Thank you for taking care of Shaoyi's matters, Principal Cheng.

463
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,820
I still prefer it when you call me Uncle Cheng.

464
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,900
Back when your father was alive,

465
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:01,550
you used to call me that all the time.

466
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,710
Shaoyi often said you and your wife treated him well.

467
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,030
By the way,

468
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,830
I'd like to visit your wife.

469
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,910
She has tuberculosis.

470
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:10,980
It may affect you.

471
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,870
It might be best not to visit her.

472
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,590
Young Master.

473
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,160
What did the principal say?

474
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,750
Uncle Cheng rushed back from the Noble Families Congress

475
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,010
and didn't see Shaoyi.

476
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,560
He suspects Shaoyi might have returned to Changqing.

477
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,210
Shaoyi didn't take anything with him this time;

478
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,540
it doesn't look like he intended to go far.

479
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,740
When was the last time you saw Shaoyi?

480
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,220
It was four days ago in the afternoon.

481
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,420
I helped Young Master Shaoyi settle in.

482
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:41,910
Young Master Shaoyi.

483
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:42,790
Take a rest.

484
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,040
Leave this to me.

485
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,960
The items I just bought are all very valuable,

486
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,080
and I need to use them later.

487
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,630
Make sure no one touches them.

488
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,340
Yes.

489
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,220
Shaoyi!

490
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,020
Cen Kun?

491
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,790
You're finally back.

492
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,780
Last time, you escaped Mr. Guo's exam.

493
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,520
Mr. Guo was very angry.

494
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,840
You better be careful.

495
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,240
Don't worry.

496
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,720
If Mr. Guo targets me,

497
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,900
I'll just go complain to Principal Cheng.

498
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,430
Alright.

499
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,430
I have some things to take care of.

500
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,110
I'll see you later.

501
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,110
Okay, go ahead.

502
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,200
Ruoyi.

503
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,420
They didn't bring any guards.

504
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,420
You should go too.

505
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,580
You're a girl.

506
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:22,270
It's inconvenient for you to follow me around.

507
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,500
I'll call you if I need anything.

508
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,500
You may leave now.

509
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,350
Yes.

510
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,630
Who was that person talking with Shaoyi?

511
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,430
The Jizhou Academy only accepts

512
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,740
direct descendants from major sects.

513
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:36,220
The one talking with Young Master Shaoyi

514
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,450
was the heir of the Cen family in Jizhou.

515
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,540
When was the last time I saw Shaoyi?

516
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,270
Let me think.

517
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,640
It was three days ago in the morning.

518
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,760
I asked him where he was going,

519
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,870
and he said he had an appointment

520
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:47,930
and left in a hurry.

521
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,790
Do you know who he was meeting

522
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,710
and where he went?

523
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:51,790
I don't know.

524
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:52,780
But

525
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,270
he took something unusual with him this time.

526
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,320
What is it?

527
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,420
He took a chicken.

528
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:57,870
A chicken?

529
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,410
I didn't think

530
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,570
it was related to Young Master Shaoyi's disappearance.

531
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,260
So...

532
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,280
This is a fighting chicken.

533
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,670
Why would Shaoyi have this?

534
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,620
Young Master Shaoyi

535
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,740
is skilled in many things.

536
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,990
Young Master Shaoyi, you just returned to Jizhou.

537
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,220
This isn't appropriate.

538
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,480
You don't understand.

539
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,860
I have big plans.

540
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,260
How much money do we have?

541
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,680
Young Master gave us three hundred tael.

542
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,010
Give all the money to me.

543
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:39,900
Wait for me here.

544
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:43,490
Young Master Shaoyi.

545
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:44,400
Come on.

546
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:47,420
Here.

547
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,980
What's this?

548
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,780
This is my newly bought "Iron General."

549
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,990
Take good care of it for me.

550
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:55,710
Let's go.

551
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,040
Young Master Shaoyi.

552
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,480
We don't have any money.

553
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,710
Where are we going?

554
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,330
Who said we don't have money?

555
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,710
When I go into the casino,

556
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,090
I'll come out with plenty.

557
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:06,570
Let's go

558
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,520
buy some things.

559
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:08,820
Mr. Duan.

560
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,450
This is the most precious treasure in our shop.

561
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:14,690
The most unique luminous pearl in Jizhou.

562
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:17,430
Pack it up.

563
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,430
Okay.

564
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,990
I'll wrap it up for you now.

565
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:20,570
Wait.

566
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,020
I mean

567
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,440
wrap up everything

568
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,470
with "pearl" in its name.

569
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,050
You mean to say

570
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,190
all the antiques in Shaoyi's room

571
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,330
were won in the casino through cockfighting?

572
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:32,930
Ruoyi.

573
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:35,190
Why didn't you tell Young Master about this?

574
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:37,290
Young Master Shaoyi wasn't addicted to it.

575
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,820
He only went occasionally,

576
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,850
so I didn't think much of it.

577
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:42,910
What did Shaoyi buy?

578
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:45,020
I have a receipt here.

579
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:47,530
[Receipt]

580
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,050
[Coral bracelet] [Coral necklace]

581
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,260
Roughly calculated,

582
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,300
these items are worth over ten thousand tael.

583
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,560
If he won so much money,

584
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,630
would the casino just let him leave easily?

585
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,380
Exactly.

586
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,830
If Shaoyi won so much from the casino,

587
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,260
they would definitely try to get it back.

588
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,970
Could his disappearance

589
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,210
be related to them?

590
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,410
[Gambling]

591
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,780
First time here, misters?

592
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,080
What would you like to play?

593
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:15,850
Cockfighting.

594
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:16,710
Cockfighting?

595
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:19,260
Who recommended you to be here?

596
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,130
Duan Shaoyi.

597
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,940
This way, please.

598
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,820
Come in, please.

599
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,750
Are you

600
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,840
Duan Shaoyi's friends?

601
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,230
We are.

602
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,210
Good.

603
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,830
I was just about to go to

604
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,130
Jizhou Academy to find you.

605
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:56,300
Didn't expect you'd walk right in.

606
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,310
Guys,

607
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,480
tie

608
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,010
them up!

609
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:00,800
How dare you!

610
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,410
Do you know who our young master is?

611
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:04,610
I don't care who he is.

612
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,100
On my turf,

613
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,750
I make the rules.

614
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:08,530
Beat them up!

615
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,800
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

616
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,330
Hurry up and hand over Duan Shaoyi!

617
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,190
That's exactly what I wanted to ask you!

618
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,130
If you have nothing to hide,

619
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,060
why do you act guilty

620
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,440
and attack us right away?

621
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,510
Duan Shaoyi won my money.

622
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:37,330
I was just planning to kidnap you

623
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,100
to get my money back.

624
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,280
So you don't know

625
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,750
where Shaoyi is?

626
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:42,970
If I knew,

627
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,660
would I be bothering with you?

628
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,600
I was hoping you'd tell me

629
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,710
where he is

630
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,370
so I can get my money back.

631
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,770
You run a casino.

632
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,890
If you didn't want to lose money,

633
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,190
why did you let him leave?

634
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,390
You think I wanted to?

635
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:55,800
As soon as I approached him,

636
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,600
those flying darts and arrows

637
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,480
of his shot out.

638
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,740
Look,

639
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,880
look at my face—ruined!

640
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,290
You better not be lying to us.

641
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,400
I swear I'm not.

642
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,440
Many people saw

643
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,990
what happened that day.

644
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,680
I couldn't stop him even if I tried.

645
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,650
Otherwise, why would I

646
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,070
be so eager to catch him?

647
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:18,440
It seems that the most suspicious place

648
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,910
before Shaoyi entered the academy

649
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:22,350
is the casino.

650
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:22,620
[Casino]

651
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,270
Xing Si.

652
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,410
Arrange for people to keep an eye on the casino owner.

653
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,580
Yes.

654
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,920
Why did Shaoyi collect so many antiques?

655
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,930
Everything he bought

656
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,260
had "pearl" in its name.

657
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,160
Pearl?

658
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,670
Heavenly Pearl.

659
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:46,540
That's right.

660
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:48,700
Shaoyi went to the casino to earn money

661
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,680
to help you find the Heavenly Pearl.

662
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,930
That rascal.

663
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,970
I really hope he just snuck back to Changqing.

664
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,310
I hope so too.

665
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:58,350
But there's no news from Changqing.

666
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,350
So he must

667
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,100
still be in Jizhou.

668
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,190
Let's check his room again.

669
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,360
There might be

670
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,380
more clues.

671
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,600
What's your name?

672
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,310
Who's your teacher?

673
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,370
Sir,

674
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,730
I'm not a student.

675
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,050
I am a member of the Duan family's Wuyi Guards.

676
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:28,260
Since when could guards

677
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,690
roam freely in Jizhou Academy?

678
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,640
Sir.

679
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,310
We're staying here

680
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,730
under the care of Principal Cheng.

681
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,810
So what if Principal Cheng said so?

682
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,830
The academy only hosts

683
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:45,690
direct descendants of major families.

684
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:49,430
How can

685
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,270
a lowly guard

686
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:55,480
sully our sacred school?

687
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,020
Get out immediately

688
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:04,660
and don't stain our academy's grounds.

689
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:11,110
Golden pearls, jade pearls, Buddhist pearls...

690
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,470
He really bought all kinds of pearls.

691
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,790
The luminous pearl Young Master Shaoyi bought

692
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,790
is missing.

693
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,380
Could he have left it somewhere?

694
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,460
He really liked that night pearl

695
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,250
and often played with it.

696
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,070
It shouldn't be left behind.

697
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,720
Could he have taken it with him?

698
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,450
Very likely.

699
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:31,170
Shaoyi didn't take any money,

700
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:34,480
so maybe he sold the luminous pearl for cash.

701
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,240
It's late.

702
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,990
Tomorrow, we'll check the jewelry shops.

703
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,390
We might find some leads.

704
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:39,010
Okay.

705
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:40,760
Master,

706
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,740
Cheng Mufei has a wife suffering from tuberculosis.

707
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,380
He deeply cares for her

708
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:46,870
and looks after her daily.

709
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:49,750
What else?

710
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:53,500
Duan Yu and the Star of Rebellion have come to Jizhou,

711
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,040
staying at Jizhou Academy.

712
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,680
Because Duan Shaoyi has gone missing.

713
00:31:58,410 --> 00:31:59,130
I see.

714
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:00,630
Master,

715
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:01,710
should we retrieve

716
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:04,170
the treasure map from the Star of Rebellion?

717
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:07,060
Who are you to teach me?

718
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:33,350
Qiao, are you awake?

719
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,240
So early?

720
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,390
I thought you might be hungry,

721
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,920
so I brought you breakfast.

722
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:43,930
Come in.

723
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:54,260
Have you had breakfast?

724
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:54,940
Not yet.

725
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,380
You can have the soy milk.

726
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,630
I only took a sip.

727
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:58,430
Don't mind it.

728
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:05,060
We still don't know

729
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,960
where that luminous pearl went.

730
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,590
Could Shaoyi have taken it?

731
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,550
Forget it.

732
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,730
I knew you'd mind.

733
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:18,730
It's hot.

734
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,740
Finished.

735
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,490
From now on, don't give what you've eaten to others.

736
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:32,760
I just don't want to waste food.

737
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,620
No, I...

738
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,970
I mean,

739
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,800
except for me,

740
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,110
no one else is allowed.

741
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:39,750
Okay.

742
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:44,840
Young Master!

743
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:45,710
Young Master!

744
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,190
Young Master!

745
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:48,120
What's wrong?

746
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:48,980
What happened?

747
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,560
A severed hand was found.

748
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,130
They think it might be Young Master Shaoyi's.

749
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,540
Early this morning,

750
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,750
someone found a severed hand by the roadside in the suburbs.

751
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,610
The constables want us to identify it.

752
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:00,410
Young Master,

753
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,290
this hand can't be Young Master Shaoyi's, right?

754
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:06,540
Qiao, don't panic.

755
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:07,570
It can't be his.

756
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,920
You're right.

757
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:10,880
It can't be his.

758
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,340
Xing Si, take care of this.

759
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:14,350
Okay.

760
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:21,150
It can't be Shaoyi.

761
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,460
It can't be Shaoyi.

762
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:23,610
It can't be Shaoyi.

763
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,100
Duan Yu, can you tell?

764
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,800
The cut is very clean,

765
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,690
as if

766
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:33,219
it was chopped off.

767
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:36,050
You're the only ones who reported someone missing

768
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:36,920
in all of Jizhou.

769
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,179
I bet it belongs to the person you're looking for.

770
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,230
Sign here.

771
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,170
How can you say it's him just from a hand?

772
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:42,810
Qiao.

773
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,639
Isn't he a playboy?

774
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:46,760
Loaded with money, right?

775
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,860
Robbery and murder seem reasonable.

776
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:50,050
Come on, sign here.

777
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:54,020
Qiao.

778
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,110
Wait.

779
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,050
Qiao.

780
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:01,950
This hand

781
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,470
is not Shaoyi's.

782
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:07,320
You can tell from just one hand?

783
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,230
Let's go.

784
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,120
Shaoyi has been practicing martial arts since childhood.

785
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,670
He holds the bow with his left hand and shoots with his right.

786
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:20,050
His right index and middle fingers would have calluses,

787
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,770
but this hand doesn't.

788
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,820
So it can't be Shaoyi's.

789
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:24,940
That's a relief.

790
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,700
Why didn't you say so earlier?

791
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,090
I just realized it.

792
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,690
Boss.

793
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,300
Boss, bad news!

794
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,340
Something terrible happened.

795
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,090
What is it? Speak.

796
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,290
Another piece of a body was found.

797
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,730
This time, it's a leg.

798
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,370
This is endless.

799
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:39,260
Lead the way!

800
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:41,590
The killer is too cruel.

801
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,810
Where there is light, there is shadow.

802
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,070
The most complex thing

803
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,600
is always the human heart.

804
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,190
This guy is very likely a sociopath.

805
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:52,060
No news is the best news.

806
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,120
Shaoyi must still be alive.

807
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:55,720
We can't give up hope.

808
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,610
Shaoyi is so smart; he'll be fine.

809
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,800
But

810
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:06,200
whose hand is this?

811
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,550
A dismemberment case.

812
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:21,710
Interesting.

813
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:25,910
[Respect Teachers]

814
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:34,750
Hello, Mr. Guo.

815
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:36,400
Who are you?

816
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:37,590
I'm Duan Yu.

817
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:38,830
I remember.

818
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,720
Five years ago, you were also a student here.

819
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,790
I taught you mathematics.

820
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,440
Thanks to your diligent teaching,

821
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,880
I was able to succeed.

822
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:51,810
Go in.

823
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,920
Don't keep the principal waiting.

824
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:57,670
I just saw Mr. Guo. He seemed a bit upset.

825
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,240
He

826
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,760
has a fiery temper.

827
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,010
Just now, he came to complain about a student,

828
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:05,000
and I said a few words in defense of the student.

829
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,130
He got so angry that he wanted to leave.

830
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,650
I'm getting old.

831
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:10,290
I can't control him anymore.

832
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:12,810
Uncle Cheng.

833
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,450
I have searched all over Jizhou

834
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,260
and received a letter from Changqing,

835
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,260
but there is still no news of Shaoyi.

836
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,920
Today, the authorities found a dismembered body.

837
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,340
I recognized that the deceased was not Shaoyi,

838
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,740
but I am worried he might become the next target of the killer.

839
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:28,340
Don't worry.

840
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:31,700
I still have some influence in Jizhou.

841
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,460
I will write to the Jizhou magistrate,

842
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,010
asking him to keep an eye on people entering and leaving Jizhou.

843
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,390
Thank you, Uncle Cheng.

844
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,860
The luminous pearl is this big.

845
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,160
It glows at night.

846
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,260
Haven't you seen it on Shaoyi?

847
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:48,580
No.

848
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,670
See? These days

849
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,480
people are returning to the academy.

850
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,760
Everyone is busy.

851
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:54,430
Who has the time to notice these things?

852
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:55,360
That's right.

853
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:02,830
What do you mean?

854
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,360
You came to the academy?

855
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,160
Listen.

856
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:05,900
Go back now.

857
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:07,640
If you come again,

858
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,220
I will report to the authorities

859
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,570
and fight you to the end.

860
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:12,000
Fine.

861
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,320
I'll be waiting.

862
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:14,710
You...

863
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,590
I'll wait.

864
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,480
Lu Zizheng.

865
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,030
Shh,

866
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,140
lower your voice.

867
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,580
Why are you in Jizhou?

868
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,640
Have you finished your business?

869
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,210
Almost.

870
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,230
Then why are you here?

871
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,510
Shaoyi is missing.

872
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:37,800
We came to Jizhou to find him.

873
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,600
We worried he might be in danger.

874
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,560
Aren't you an official of God?

875
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,190
Can you divine where Shaoyi is?

876
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,180
I can do that.

877
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,760
But you need to answer me a question first.

878
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,990
So stingy.

879
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,500
Before you left Xiling,

880
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,520
did the Great Master give you anything?

881
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,320
Master Ruan died because of me.

882
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,760
It's lucky he didn't stab me for revenge.

883
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,220
Would he give me anything?

884
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,100
Why are you asking this?

885
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,080
I'm afraid

886
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,720
I might miss something good.

887
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:04,490
Fine,

888
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,460
can you help me now?

889
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:07,490
I still have something to do.

890
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:09,200
Just help me with one reading.

891
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:10,410
Okay.

892
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,380
Close your eyes first.

893
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,500
Are you done?

894
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,140
Are you done yet?

895
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,030
Lu Zizheng, you trickster!
