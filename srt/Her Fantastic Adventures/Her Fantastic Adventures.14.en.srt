3
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,300
Sir,

4
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,789
may I know your name?

5
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:46,870
Master,

6
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,710
he's Qing's brother, Bai.

7
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,990
You caught him yourself.

8
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,630
Quick-witted，

9
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,940
eloquent,

10
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,930
and great body.

11
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:56,470
Master,

12
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,140
he is clearly a thief.

13
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,860
Why are you praising him?

14
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,350
Accusing someone

15
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,470
without evidence

16
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,590
is quite hasty,

17
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,740
don't you think?

18
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,830
Why are you siding with him?

19
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:08,850
If you don't believe me,

20
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,150
you can go to the arsenal with me

21
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,740
and see if what I said is true.

22
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,620
Senior.

23
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,990
Senior.

24
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,600
We found your Trident of the Sea God.

25
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,200
You...

26
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,230
You found it?

27
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,350
And other missing weapons.

28
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,630
The artisan of the weapons workshop took them by mistake,

29
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,960
and have them repaired.

30
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,600
Master,

00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,950
I...

32
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:29,950
I swear I saw them...

33
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:30,700
Alright.

34
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,590
Let's go.

35
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,829
The truth is out.

36
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,520
Go back to sleep.

37
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,310
Young Master Bai,

38
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:42,190
would you like to stay in Xiling for a longer time?

39
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,560
Yes.

40
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,540
Thank you on behalf of my brother.

[Episode 14]

42
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,370
The three-day treatment period is almost over,

43
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,310
and I'm going to leave in a proper way.

44
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,190
What should I do?

45
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,490
Then stay here properly.

46
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,250
Sorry for the offense yesterday.

47
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,780
Please forgive me, Mr. Bao.

48
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:23,700
I won't eat.

49
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,160
I'll pay for one month's

50
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,570
meals of yours.

51
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,140
Go ahead.

52
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,180
What is it?

53
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,630
We want to be disciples.

54
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,470
Disciple?

55
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,510
That's right.

56
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,880
We want to be disciples.

57
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,270
My brother and I grew up wandering around the world

58
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,480
since childhood.

59
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,350
But these days in Xiling,

60
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,870
I've seen the value of excellent education.

61
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,190
We want to join Xiling,

62
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,110
like a drop of water in the sea

63
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,940
or a sand in the desert,

64
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,340
to contribute to Xiling's construction.

65
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,260
You're right.

66
00:03:58,770 --> 00:03:59,800
Well said.

67
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,130
So touching.

68
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:02,950
But I don't believe it.

69
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,110
Tell me.

70
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,990
What is your real motive

00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,310
No.

73
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:08,860
No.

74
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,680
We truly love Xiling

75
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,990
and want to make contribution.

76
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,630
Yes.

77
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,510
We have inherited our family

78
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,130
and have some martial arts skills.

79
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,170
You must have seen it last night.

80
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,910
You are the most suspicious.

81
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:22,930
Besides,

82
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,030
my master is not easy-going.

83
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,400
Especially the way he chose his disciple

84
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,230
is quite different.

85
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,370
The two of you?

86
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,670
Impossible.

87
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,590
Okay.

88
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,770
No problem.

89
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:49,040
We warmly welcome you to join the Li San Hall.

Thank you, master.

91

Master,

92
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,670
are you sure?

93
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,970
He...

94
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,580
Isn't he too old?

95
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,260
Age is not a problem.

96
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,540
I've waited for 20 years

97
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,330
to find such an

98
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,160
extraordinary,

99
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,040
good-looking

100
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,270
and handsome disciple.

101
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,250
Can my sister join too?

102
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,870
Well...

103
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:22,870
Qing.

104
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,210
Qing,

105
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,680
how old are you?

106
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,510
I'm 16.

107
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:29,910
16...

108
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,510
16...

109
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,480
You may still be a little old.

110
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,490
It will be hard to start training.

111
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:38,900
Well,

112
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,620
didn't you just say

113
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,370
age is not a problem?

114
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,350
It's a double standard.

115
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,550
Well,

116
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,670
do you have any foundation in martial arts?

117
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,020
I...

118
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,690
I can do

119
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,780
Smoke Palm.

120
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,870
What's wrong with Smoke Palm?

121
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,930
This is discrimination against the food industry.

122
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,090
I knew you were unreliable.

123
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,530
You still have to rely on me.

124
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,390
I disagree.

125
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,230
He clearly judges by appearances.

126
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,760
No matter what he judges by,

127
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,180
he chose me.

128
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,810
He does have a taste.

129
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,990
Narcissist.

130
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,310
You're not,

131
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,270
then think of a way.

132
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,320
I'm thinking.

133
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,070
Go on.

134
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,990
Here, take the medicine.

135
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,470
Miss Wu,

136
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,150
please return the ring.

137
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:48,990
That ring...

138
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,450
It's very important to me.

139
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,070
If you want money,

140
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,490
I can give it to you.

141
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,670
Then tell me.

142
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,630
are you a human trafficker?

143
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,030
I'm not a trafficker.

144
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:00,670
Liar.

145
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,710
Wu,

146
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,110
don't be rude.

00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,040
Mr. Duan.

148
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,350
Give it to me.

149
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,240
You may leave.

150
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,970
Mr. Duan, take the medicine.

151
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,070
Thank you.

The Moon Wolf Tribe is here!

The Moon Wolf Tribe is here! Run!

00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:34,190
Hurry!

157
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,350
Run!

158
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:37,990
Wait.

Fire Crane Tribe.

160
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,610
We finally found it.

161
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,630
Young Master,

162
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,220
we're here to rescue you.

163
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,190
I recognize you.

164
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,570
You are human traffickers.

165
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,580
Don't talk nonsense.

166
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,580
We're not.

167
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,380
I know you.

168
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,160
You bought people from the Moon Wolf Tribe.

169
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,550
I recognized you too.

170
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,000
Aren't you the slave of the Fire Crane Tribe?

171
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,960
Slave?

172
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:25,810
What slave?

173
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:26,590
You are a slave!

174
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,250
Your whole family are slaves!

175
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,480
My uncle disappeared with you.

176
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,510
Where is he?

177
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,549
Uncle?

178
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,900
What uncle?

179
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,030
A bunch of human traffickers.

180
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:36,940
Young master,

181
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,950
why bother talking to her?

182
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,470
Calm down.

183
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,960
Listen to me,

184
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,600
we're here to find someone,

185
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,760
nothing else.

186
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,210
Don't believe them.

187
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,420
They are not good people.

188
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,030
I almost...

189
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,500
You...

190
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,400
You liar!

191
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,020
Come here.

192
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,140
How dare you bully me.

193
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,190
I'll teach you a lesson.

194
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,940
Take your hands out.

195
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,430
Take it out!

196
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,470
I'm here.

197
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,350
Please stop.

198
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,080
-Don't cover your face.
-Stop!

199
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,460
Young Master.

200
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,760
Take your hands out.

201
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,670
Are you okay?

202
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,400
Are you okay?

203
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,080
Where is Shaoyi?

204
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,070
Uncle,

205
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,040
I finally found you.

206
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:51,880
You...

207
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,110
What...

208
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,060
I'm fine.

209
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,430
Qing.

210
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,280
Qing.

211
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,710
Did Master really reject you?

212
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,700
Yes.

213
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,900
I really want to stay.

214
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,440
Don't worry.

215
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,080
We'll help you.

216
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,790
Do you think

217
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,510
Master Ruan will take me as his disciple?

218
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,760
No,

219
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:26,240
I must find a way to stay in Xiling.

220
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,530
Master Ruan.

221
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,330
Why are you wearing gloves today?

222
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,160
My hands are cold.

223
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,570
Master Ruan,

224
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,440
may I ask you a question?

225
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,290
Go ahead.

226
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,840
Do you take disciples?

227
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,260
I never take disciples.

228
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,280
I knew it.

229
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,750
So only Master Wang

230
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,200
from the Li San Hall

231
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,300
takes disciples in Xiling?

232
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,320
The second generation of disciples of Xiling are dwindling.

233
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,540
Only Senior and I are left.

234
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,340
Master has been traveling around all year long.

235
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,470
I don't care about inheritance at all.

236
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,340
Indeed,

237
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,950
only my senior takes disciples.

238
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,490
Fine.

239
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,360
Come again tomorrow,

240
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,910
and the treatment will be over.

241
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,930
Master Ruan,

242
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,960
are you sure there's no need for phased treatment?

243
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,930
Will it affect the effect?

244
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,550
No need.

245
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,450
You will recover tomorrow.

246
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,420
Good morning, Master Wang.

247
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:42,870
Master Wang,

248
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,200
here's your wash water.

249
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,610
Look at your skin.

250
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,280
So nice.

251
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:55,360
It's so smooth and flawless.

252
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,890
No wrinkles at all.

253
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,950
Even mosquitoes would slip on it.

254
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,500
You must be

255
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,050
in your early twenties.

256
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,870
I'm already in my fifties.

257
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,720
You're exaggerating.

258
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,500
No, no.

259
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,710
You have the best skin I've ever seen.

260
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,250
Let me tell you a secret.

261
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,770
Even Master Ruan, Ruan Siqiong,

262
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,210
after so many hardships,

263
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:22,240
doesn't have skin as good as yours.

264
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,560
You have a point.

265
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,130
What's your name again?

266
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,730
I'm Dongfang Chunjiaoqing.

267
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,090
You can call me Qing.

268
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,030
Qing,

269
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,360
from now on,

270
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,040
don't come here again.

271
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,470
I know your purpose.

272
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,510
I won't take you as my disciple,

273
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,190
so stop bothering me.

274
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,080
Both...

275
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,300
Bothering you?

276
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,890
Yes.

277
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,970
You're a grown-up girl.

278
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,360
You should know keeping a distance

279
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,270
is respect for each other.

280
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,120
Right?

281
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,990
What a weirdo.

282
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,960
Master Ruan,

283
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,430
thank you.

284
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,040
I'm leaving the mountain today.

285
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,790
I hope we can meet again.

286
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,120
Where are you going

287
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,460
after leaving here?

288
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,640
I don't know.

289
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,780
Maybe I can find a job

290
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,440
and wait for my brother.

291
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,600
A weak woman like me

292
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,830
has no power,

293
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,110
and no one to rely on.

294
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,290
I might be bullied.

295
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,110
Maybe that's my fate.

296
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,720
Hold me back.

297
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,070
Ask me to stay.

298
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,400
Take care.

299
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,570
You too,

300
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,640
Dr. Ruan.

301
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,980
Qing, we'll miss you.

302
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,230
Alright.

303
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,140
No need to see me off.

304
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,200
I made this medicine myself.

305
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,430
Keep it well.

306
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,450
It's effective for colds

307
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,530
and headaches.

308
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,420
Qing,

309
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,070
I can't treat you to a meal.

310
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,200
Here are a few taels of silver.

311
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,130
Buy yourself some delicious food.

312
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,900
Thank you.

313
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,800
Though we can't be fellow disciples,

314
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,270
it's great to know you all.

315
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,110
Bye.

316
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,430
-Bye.
-Bye.

317
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,310
Take care.

318
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,510
What's wrong?

319
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,910
I envy you

320
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,950
for having such companions.

321
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,750
Don't be silly.

322
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,150
I'm your only companion.

323
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,020
Finding out where the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword is

324
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,270
and staying alive

325
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,720
is your top priority.

326
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,390
Got it.

327
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,780
Take care of yourself.

328
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,030
Don't always bully others.

329
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,290
Except you,

330
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,910
I won't bully anyone else.

331
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,830
Take her as my disciple?

332
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:02,650
That's right.

333
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,180
Dongfang Chunjiaoqing.

334
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,520
You remembered her name?

335
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,370
Siqiong,

336
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,060
as the No.1 in the world,

337
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,190
I'm afraid you don't know the struggles of ordinary people.

338
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,150
I'm from a normal family.

339
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,490
To get here,

340
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,520
I've made a lot of efforts than others.

341
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,950
I know well the price I have to pay.

342
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,180
I don't want to see ordinary children

343
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,440
struggle in the world.

344
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:36,040
So I won't take such disciples anymore.

345
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,710
Your eldest disciple

346
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,270
is just like that, isn't it?

347
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,020
I...

348
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,340
I only allow myself to make the mistake once.

349
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,760
Since you've already made a mistake,

350
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,080
another one won't hurt.

351
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:50,710
Then

352
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,750
what do you like about her?

353
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:54,900
She

354
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,860
might become the No.1 in the world.

355
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:02,330
Fine.

356
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,960
You stay and look for the sword.

357
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,460
I'll stay in Qingshui Town to survive.

358
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,310
What else?

359
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,840
Lu Zizheng,

360
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,190
can you stop copying me?

361
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:09,820
If you keep copying me,

362
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,070
I'll really get mad.

363
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:12,870
You're almost dead,

364
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,830
what's there to be afraid of?

365
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:14,030
You...

366
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:14,630
Qing.

367
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:15,870
Bai.

368
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:16,610
Qing.

369
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,340
What's going on?

370
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:17,780
Wait.

371
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,230
Did they find something?

372
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,160
Get ready

373
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,310
to run at any time.

374
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,660
I'm exhausted.

375
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:23,900
Why are you two

376
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,090
walking so fast?

377
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,720
What's up?

378
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,190
Go back with me.

379
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,280
Let's go.

380
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,940
Why?

381
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,970
Master

382
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,200
accepts you as his disciple.

383
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,300
Starting today,

384
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,860
you two will be disciples of the Li San Hall of Xiling.

385
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,870
You must follow Xiling's rules,

386
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,170
to save people

387
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,480
and uphold justice.

388
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,640
You must not betray your master,

389
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,570
and must keep your thoughts pure.

390
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,370
Remember,

391
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,099
Xiling disciples support each other,

392
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,790
and work together.

393
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:11,349
Yes, Master.

394
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:14,920
Siqiong,

395
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,099
say something.

396
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,069
Good.

397
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,500
Keep it up.

398
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:25,920
Quancai,

399
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,359
take them around

400
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,440
to familiarize with Xiling,

401
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:33,350
and also tell them about Xiling.

402
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,830
There have been eight halls since the founding of Xiling Sect:

403
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,830
Qian Yi Hall,

404
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:39,980
Dui Er Hall,

405
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,580
Li San Hall,

406
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,440
Zhen Si Hall, Xun Wu Hall, Kan Liu Hall,

407
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,840
Gen Qi Hall, and Kun Ba Hall.

408
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,280
Great Master has nine disciples,

409
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,320
eight of whom are hall leaders,

410
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,170
and Master Ruan ranks ninth.

411
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,670
Fifteen years ago,

412
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:00,730
[Grave of Xun Wu Hall's Zu Linmao] [Grave of Gen Qi Hall's Zhou Ming]

413
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,710
Great Master led seven hall leaders

414
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,520
to fight the Sacred Blood Sect, suffering heavy casualties.

415
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,780
After the war, five masters passed away,

416
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,310
and two were missing.

417
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:07,870
Only Master

418
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,990
was unable to go because of his injury

419
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,030
and survived.

420
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,990
If Master Ruan hadn't become the No. 1 in the world,

421
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,510
Xiling would have fallen

422
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,470
since then.

423
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,800
Xiling truly upholds justice.

424
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,700
These heroes died honorably.

425
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,370
Died honorably? Easy for you to say.

426
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:32,220
After that battle, Xiling lost a lot.

427
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,540
That's why the disciples of other halls

428
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,790
are under the unified teaching of Li San Hall's leader.

429
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,380
That's why

430
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,070
all disciples,

431
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,540
new and old,

432
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,400
must pay respect to the five deceased masters.

433
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,250
[Grave of Xun Wu Hall's Zu Linmao] [Grave of Gen Qi Hall's Zhou Ming]

434
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,870
Without them,

435
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:54,270
Xiling wouldn't be stable today.

436
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,150
What do you mean?

437
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,350
Are you not

438
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,490
sincerely joining Xiling?

439
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,720
I just thought of my deceased family.

440
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,340
We haven't been home for a long time.

441
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,940
We also want to worship them.

442
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,340
This is the rule set by the Great Master.

443
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,830
We start lessons at 5 a.m.

444
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,240
Medical studies in the morning,

445
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,950
martial arts in the afternoon,

446
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,390
and take turns going down the mountain to treat people.

447
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:27,350
The consultation fee is for the maintenance of the sect.

448
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,710
Master Ruan teaches martial arts,

449
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,430
and our master teaches medicine.

450
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:33,630
Alright,

451
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,610
if there are no questions, let's go back.

452
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,800
Senior,

453
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,670
I have a question.

454
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,360
Go ahead.

455
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,250
Why did Master suddenly change his mind?

456
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,950
Was it my sincerity that moved him?

457
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:47,980
Do you really want to know?

458
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,800
Of course.

459
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,300
Go ask Master.

460
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:51,960
Forget it.

461
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,630
Uncle,

462
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,830
why are you thinner?

463
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,200
How have you been lately?

464
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,390
It's been really hard, Uncle.

465
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,240
My legs...

466
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:05,950
Shaoyi.

467
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,380
and my butt

468
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,350
-are worn out by the saddle.
-Shaoyi.

469
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,190
I miss you so much.

470
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,970
Doctor, please just ignore him.

471
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:13,610
Uncle,

472
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,930
I'm most afraid of not seeing you.

473
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:16,690
Shaoyi.

474
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,810
I have nightmares every night.

475
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:19,350
Uncle.

476
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,110
Shaoyi,

477
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,350
you're overacting.

478
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,460
So hypocritical.

479
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,210
None of your business.

480
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,710
You knocked me out last time.

481
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,150
I...

482
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,950
I haven't got even with you yet.

483
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,570
I apologize.

484
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,240
So you are the guests of Changqing Chamber of Commerce.

485
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,520
Our Fire Crane Tribe

486
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:43,260
had dealings with the Chamber of Commerce and Duan Residence a long time ago.

487
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,590
To thank you for saving our young master,

488
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,190
we have a small token of appreciation.

489
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:57,740
Duan Mou,

490
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,510
you're so rich.

491
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,740
Uncle,

492
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,680
she doesn't think your name is Duan Mou, does she?

493
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,660
If it's not Duan Mou,

494
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,660
is it Re?

495
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,430
Wu,

496
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,410
don't be rude.

497
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:12,190
Re means husband.

498
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,460
That won't do.

499
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,930
You can't call my uncle Re.

500
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,220
Should I call you then?

501
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,960
It's not impossible.

502
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,470
Shaoyi.

503
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,040
You can only be my slave.

504
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,740
This is the young master of the Duan family.

505
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:26,930
Mind your manners.

506
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:28,710
It's fine.

507
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:29,820
It's fine.

508
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,310
Since my family are here to pick me up,

509
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,040
doctor,

510
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,000
I'll leave now.

511
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:36,790
Uncle,

512
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,120
you haven't fully recovered.

513
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,440
I suggest

514
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,680
you should leave after you recover.

515
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,850
Yes, young master.

516
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,440
I think you should rest for a few more days.

517
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,750
I'm the first.

518
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,590
Meat buns.

519
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,230
I got the meat buns first.

520
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,630
I want some too.

521
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:36,440
Don't push!

522
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,200
No. 1 in the world?

523
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,430
Since when did Siqiong start joking?

524
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:51,090
Hey,

525
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,400
I got the buns.

526
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,670
You adapted quite quickly.

527
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,320
If we can't enjoy life,

528
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,470
then we must adapt.

529
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,270
We have to live comfortably.

530
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,320
Don't just think about adapting,

531
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,680
think about why you joined Xiling.

532
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,680
To find Qingmu...

533
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,020
To find the sword and survive.

534
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,710
I remember.

535
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:25,990
Senior,

536
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,160
will this work?

537
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,480
Whether it can or not,

538
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,480
we have to make it.

539
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,220
I heard you know everything.

540
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:34,960
Is that true?

541
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,880
Of course.

542
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,480
I know astronomy, geography.

543
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,040
and even bedroom secrets.

544
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,260
Do you know Qingmu...

545
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,010
Master Ruan,

546
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:45,590
can you help me check

547
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,310
if my second move of Flowing Water Sword is right?

548
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,870
Not bad. Keep it up.

549
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,340
Look at Man Tianxing.

550
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,990
-She has liked Master Ruan for a long time.
-I haven't started yet.

551
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,900
What a pity.

552
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,850
I think Master Ruan is quite warm.

553
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,370
Isn't there any romantic gossip about him?

554
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:02,830
Another woman blinded by illusions.

555
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,800
Do you think anyone can be the No.1 in the world?

556
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,480
That position is built

557
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,340
on countless corpses.

558
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:11,880
Love and desires

559
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,690
don't deserve to disturb Master Ruan.

560
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,930
Don't say I didn't warn you,

561
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:19,770
people like Master Ruan

562
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,210
can only be admired from a distance,

563
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,160
not played with.

564
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,320
It's normal to have emotions and desires.

565
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,850
Master Ruan is in his prime.

566
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,960
Suppressing desires is abnormal.

567
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,820
Dongfang Chunjiaoqing.

568
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:34,340
Yes.

569
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,270
Master Ruan remembers Qing's name.

570
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:42,580
Master Ruan.

571
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:44,610
You...

572
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:47,140
look beautiful when you smile.

573
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,790
Practice the second move of Flowing Water Sword ten times.

574
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,030
I'll check tomorrow.

575
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:53,920
Yes.

576
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,880
I'm exhausted.

577
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,580
It's all my big mouth's fault,

578
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,260
offending Master Ruan.

579
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,840
Master. Master.

580
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:08,550
You're quite comfortable with calling him that.

581
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,550
What else can I do?

582
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,300
With our current situation,

583
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,370
what do you want?

584
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:13,930
Alright,

585
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,190
in the next few days,

586
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,510
we need to visit Tianlu Pavilion.

587
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,680
Tianlu Pavilion?

588
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,880
That's Xiling's sacred library.

589
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:24,460
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

590
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,520
I...

591
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,280
get a headache when I read.

592
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,500
You better go there on your own.

593
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,660
What else can you do?

594
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:32,630
I...

595
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,380
Uncle,

596
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,570
let me tell you

597
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,890
another really funny story.

598
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:41,830
If you laugh,

599
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,980
your hand won't hurt anymore.

600
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:43,700
Once

601
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,700
upon a time...

602
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,520
Wu,

603
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,750
come here and listen.

604
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,810
What's the matter?

605
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,080
What is it?

606
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,430
Here.

607
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:18,450
Thank you.

608
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:20,520
I was angry that you bought me from the Moon Wolf Tribe.

609
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,040
I thought you were not a good person,

610
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,700
so I wouldn't be polite to you.

611
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,300
But now that I think about it,

612
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,560
if you hadn't saved me,

613
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,250
I would have been dead.

614
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,420
Speaking of which,

615
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,460
you are my savior.

616
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,900
After I fell off the cliff,

617
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,060
you treated me.

618
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:35,520
I guess we're even now.

619
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,230
So why did you

620
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,260
buy slaves from the Moon Wolf Tribe?

621
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,110
It's someone I know.

622
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:45,790
She went missing.

623
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,220
Someone told me

624
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,710
she might be in the Moon Wolf Tribe's

625
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,380
slave trade.

626
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,180
What happened next?

627
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,040
Go on.

628
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,290
What next?

629
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,360
Uncle, take a rest.

630
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,160
Come out with me.

631
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,730
I'll tell you what happened next.

632
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:02,140
No.

633
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:02,690
Come on.

634
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:03,670
Come on.

635
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,590
Let me tell you.

636
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,940
I'll tell you a good story.

637
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,470
Let's go.

638
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,900
I see.

639
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:23,390
So there's actually a misunderstanding between them.

640
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,190
So,

641
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:28,990
where is Gu Qingqiao now?

642
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,090
I don't know.

643
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,310
I thought

644
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,780
she might appear in the Moon Wolf Tribe's slave trade,

645
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,620
but found you instead.

646
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,840
No wonder Mr. Duan has been chasing me.

647
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,650
Does she look like me?

648
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:41,790
No.

649
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,930
You're much prettier than her.

650
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,890
You're sweet.

651
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,120
How about

652
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,990
you be my slave from now on?

653
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,210
If you become my slave,

654
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,290
you'll have to obey me in everything.

655
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:01,820
Master.

656
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,440
Have some chicken.

657
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:35,890
Master Ruan,

658
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:40,740
why are you still up so late?

659
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,200
It's cold at night.

660
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,490
You might catch a cold.

661
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,770
I can't sleep.

662
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:46,030
Neither can I.

663
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,650
I thought I'm the only one who couldn't sleep.

664
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,300
Why can't you sleep?

665
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,650
There are too many worries.

666
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:55,510
When I close my eyes, I see people I don't want to see.

667
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:56,630
What about you?

668
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,960
I have no distractions.

669
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,390
No one enters my dream.

670
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,500
As time goes by,

671
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:03,330
I can't fall asleep even with my eyes closed.

672
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,200
Why not enjoy the beauty of the world

673
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:08,780
during the long night?

674
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,350
We are the opposite.

675
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,390
You have nothing on your mind,

676
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,840
while I have too much.

677
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,260
I wish we could switch.

678
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:17,830
Master Ruan,

679
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:20,050
if there's nothing else,

680
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,570
I'll go back first.

681
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,190
Qing.

682
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:27,100
Since you can't sleep,

683
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,340
how about...

684
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,180
Master Ruan,

685
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,470
after you left today,

686
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,950
I practiced until sunset

687
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,680
without the slightest slack.

688
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:37,050
But that Flowing Water Sword is too difficult.

689
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,440
I'm slow-witted,

690
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,470
and started late.

691
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,740
Could you give me two more days?

692
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,070
I wanted to ask you

693
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,330
if you could stay and have a drink with me.

694
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,070
You're so self-aware.

695
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,190
Follow me.

696
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,490
Flowing Water Style is not a strong sword technique.

697
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:42,350
It's about leveraging strength.

698
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:34,610
Immortal?

699
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,220
Are you serious?

700
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,260
Take it easy.

701
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,670
A man and a woman alone late at night,

702
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:42,800
quite enjoyed, huh?

703
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,350
You don't know,

704
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:47,450
Master Ruan is so handsome when playing sword,

705
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,640
like an immortal.

706
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:49,460
Look at you.

707
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,520
A totally lovesick fool.

708
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,120
No,

709
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:54,140
I just thought of Duan Yu's sword playing,

710
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:56,730
also like an immortal.

711
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,810
You really are a lovesick fool.

712
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:01,280
I...

713
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,420
Let go.

714
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,620
Apologize.

715
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,220
Are you a dog? Let go.

716
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,160
Apologize.

717
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:13,780
Admit it.

718
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:22,590
While you were together with Ruan Siqiong last night,

719
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:25,020
I searched the entire Xiling Sect.

720
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,240
I did find something.

721
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,200
What did you find?

722
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:27,830
I found

723
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
there is a forbidden area in Xiling.

724
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,750
Where is it?

725
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,660
Forbidden area.

726
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,570
I know.

727
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,480
What's its name?

728
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,520
Forbidden area.

729
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:36,950
Speak well.

[Forbidden Area]

731
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:48,930
Did you see it clearly?

732
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:51,860
This is too straightfoward.

733
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,920
What are you two sneaking around for?

734
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,370
This is Xiling's forbidden area.

735
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:56,330
No trespassing.

736
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,690
Senior,

737
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,730
what is inside

738
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,780
that there's such a big sign?

739
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:06,400
It's said that there are traps and monsters who eat humans.

740
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,190
It's said that there are traps and monsters who eat humans?

741
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:12,700
So you've never seen it?

742
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:13,340
I...

743
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,740
If I had seen it,

744
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,800
would I still be here talking to you?

745
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,920
You not only have a small body

746
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,590
but also a small brain.

747
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,230
Now leave.

748
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:25,710
Go.

749
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:26,290
Okay.

750
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:32,890
I'll go to the Tianlu Pavilion to check the forbidden area.

751
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,170
Black Wood Human-shaped Sword is a sacred object of Xiling.

752
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:57,740
It must be recorded in the sect's history books.

[Xiling Records]

756
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,100
That year, in an ordinary village,

757
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:29,560
a baby named Wang Tianshan was born.

758
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:31,670
No one knew then

759
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:35,850
that the world would change because of him.

760
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:43,969
That year, Wang Tianshan led Xiling Sect against Nanming Sect

761
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,100
in a sword competition,

762
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,960

That old man Wang Tianshan

765
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:55,460
always boasting about himself.

766
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,950
Who is speaking ill of me?

767
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:16,590
No one but the sect leader is allowed

768
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,010
inside Tianlu Pavilion.

769
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,540
Excuse me,

770
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:20,850
sir.

771
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:22,840
I'm a new disciple.

772
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,030
I'm trying to catch up with my seniors,

773
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,330
so I came to study hard.

774
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,260
I heard the books on the top floor are very valuable,

775
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,590
so I came to borrow them.

776
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,480
No one but the sect leader is allowed

777
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,100
inside Tianlu Pavilion.

778
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:39,860
Sorry to bother you.

779
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,020
Senior,

780
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,350
do you know what the Xiling's forbidden area is?

781
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:51,630
You know it too?

782
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,150
I saw it while wandering around.

783
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,810
It looks very mysterious.

784
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,730
Do you think there are treasures inside?

785
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,910
The forbidden area has always been mysterious.

786
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,190
Except for the Great Master, Master and Master Ruan,

787
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,710
no one else can enter,

788
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:08,160
so we don't know what's inside.

789
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:12,820
But it's said there are some dangerous traps,

790
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,650
monsters,

791
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,500
and treasures.

792
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:16,670
Treasures?

793
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:18,230
Dongfang Chunjiaoqing.

794
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,520
Even Mala

795
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,780
knows you now?

796
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,580
When I was recovering here,

797
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,020
I chatted with it.

798
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,930
Senior,

799
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:33,610
isn't it inappropriate for us to go in like this?

800
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:35,960
When Master Ruan isn't in Xiling,

801
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:38,050
we often come to feed the bird for him.

802
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,650
Senior,

803
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,670
do you like Master Ruan?

804
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,020
Yes.

805
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,310
So honest.

806
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,500
It's not shameful to like him.

807
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,920
I don't need to hide it.

808
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,500
Mala.

809
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,940
Dongfang Chunjiaoqing.

810
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,920
[Forbidden Area]

811
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,880
Xiling's forbidden area.

812
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,000
No trespassing.

813
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,340
[Forbidden Area]

814
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:40,860
[Forbidden Area]

815
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,930
Bai,

816
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,640
why didn't you wake me up?

817
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,120
I've been waiting for you.

818
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,790
I'll call you next time.

819
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:54,790
Bai, you don't look well.

820
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,350
Let me check your pulse.

821
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:57,610
None of your business.

822
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,390
Thanks for your concern.

823
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,590
I'm just too sleepy.

824
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,470
Go to sleep.

825
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,790
There's no one here.

826
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,470
God bless me.

827
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,350
Tomorrow I will tell Bai

828
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,550
what I've done

829
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,590
and scare him.

830
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:37,350
What have you done?

831
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:38,380
Ghost!

832
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,780
No internal injuries.

833
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,390
It shouldn't be her.

834
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,950
What are you doing here?

835
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,090
I...

836
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,890
I'm here to study all night.

837
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:49,440
Don't you know that disciples

838
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,100
are not allowed to enter here?

839
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:52,650
I don't know.

840
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,990
I saw the lights on

841
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,310
and the door wasn't locked,

842
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,230
so I came in.

843
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:58,930
I'm leaving now.
