[Her Fantastic Adventures]

3
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:44,710
She acts a bit out of line

4
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,509
and speaks strangely.

5
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,070
But

6
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,630
she isn't a bad person.

7
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,310
Besides, how could a merchant's daughter

8
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,509
be involved with the Mantra Sect

9
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,910
and kidnap Shaoyi?

10
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,390
And how could Duan Yu

11
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,190
possibly harm Gu Qingqiao?

12
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,480
There must be some misunderstanding.

13
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,190
My Lady, you are too kind.

14
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,190
You're still defending her.

15
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,070
Where is Gu Qingqiao now?

16
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,600
I'm going to ask her myself.

17
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,830
Gu Qingqiao

18
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,950
was escorted back by Master's men.

19
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,590
She is under heavy guard,

20
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,270
and no one is allowed to see her without Master's permission.

21
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,000
My Lady, you shouldn't get involved in this mess.

22
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,610
Shaoyi was kidnapped.

23
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,310
Gu Qingqiao was imprisoned.

24
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,230
And Duan Yu...

25
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,030
Everything is in chaos.

26
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,070
Shaoyi must know what happened that day.

27
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,950
I need to find him.

28
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:33,550
My Lady.

29
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,270
Young Master Shaoyi is still unconscious.

30
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,550
Then I will go to Shangqing Temple to pray for Shaoyi,

31
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,030
asking Buddha to bless him

32
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,510
with a speedy recovery.

33

37
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,510
Young Master Shaoyi.

38
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,390
It's my fault for arriving late.

39
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,030
I will kneel here until you wake up.

40
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,910
If you die,

41
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,830
I'll die with you.

42
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,790
You go first.

43
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,470
Young Master Shaoyi.

44
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,260
You go first.

45
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,710
Young Master Shaoyi!

46
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,190
Young Master Shaoyi, I'm here.

47
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,150
We won't die.

48
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,870
It's alright now.

49
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,820
-I won't let you be in danger again.
-We won't die.

50
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,390
It's okay.

51
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,590
Young Master Shaoyi!

52
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:20,990
It's okay now.

53

Is anyone there?

54
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,470
Is anyone there?

55
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,730
What's all this noise?

56
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,440
What are you yelling about?

57
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,510
-Are you done?
-Sir.

58
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,190
Sir.

59
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,980
Did you rescue Duan Shaoyi?

60
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,150
If you're so afraid of dying,

61
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,820
you shouldn't have kidnapped him in the first place.

62
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,510
I just want to ask

63
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,870
how Duan Shaoyi is now.

64
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,430
I heard the Duan family found him.

65
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,430
He should be fine.

66
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,070
Great.

67
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,010
Then Shaoyi's injury...

68
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:44,710

I want to see Duan Yu.

70
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,950
Could you pass my message to him?

71
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,430
Will you ever stop?

72
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,670
Do you know where you are?

73
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,200
This is the government prison, not your home.

74
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,350
No, no, no.

75
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,190
There might be some misunderstanding between the Duan family and me.

76
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,070
If you let me explain it to them,

77
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,110
you wouldn't have to stand here.

78
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,820
You're already in jail.

79
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,270
Saying this won't help.

80
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,910
Just stay put

81
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,390
and wait for your fate.

82
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,860
Alright, alright,

83
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,660
I understand.

84
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,510
That's how it is in TV dramas.

85
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,230
Please go to Qingfeng Restaurant

86
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,630
and mention my name.

87
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,870
No matter how much money you need,

88
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,750
they'll give it to you.

89
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,029
I just want to see Duan Yu.

90
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:20,190
No other demands.

91
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,910
I'd love to

92
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,940
make that money,

93
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,310
but I doubt I have the luck

94
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,630
to earn it from Qingfeng Restaurant.

95
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,030
Just stay here.

96
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,390
Sir, what do you mean by that?

97
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,390
What happened to Qingfeng Restaurant?

98
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,310
It was a message from Mr. Qi of the Duan family.

99
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,030
It's an order from Master Duan.

100
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,690
There would be a reward for completing the task.

101
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:44,870
I understand.

102
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,600
Don't worry.

103
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,430
What happened to Qingfeng Restaurant?

104
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,120
Guards!

105
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,150
Yes.

106
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,270
Take her out.

107
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,710
Yes.

108
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,820
Where are we going?

109
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,150
To the torture chamber.

110
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,150
Confess!

111
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,370
Why did you kidnap Young Master Shaoyi?

112
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,800
If you confess, I'll whip you less.

113
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,360
Let's make a deal.

114
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,890
This is a coerced confession

115
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,550
and illegal punishment.

116
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,270
I will sue you!

117
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,380
We're following

118
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,190
the orders of Master Duan.

119
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,750
Master Duan...

120
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:18,910
Duan...

121
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,420
Does Duan Yu know about this?

122
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,480
You're still thinking about

123
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,630
Young Master Duan?

124
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,510
You're the one who kidnapped his nephew!

125
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,750
I didn't kidnap him.

126
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,930
We were both kidnapped together.

127
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,140
Listen to her.

128
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,520
"Kidnapped together."

129
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,740
Ridiculous.

130
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,800
Then why are you the only one being punished here?

131
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:39,790
Boss.

132
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,520
What's wrong?

133
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:54,170
The magistrate has ordered

134
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,510
that today's interrogation of Gu Qingqiao ends here.

135
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,370
Resume the interrogation later.

136
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,790
Please.

137
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,470
Can you hurry up?

138
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:03,120
Alright.

139
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,070
You can settle the bill at your own pace.

140
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,470
Pack all the cash for me.

141
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,630
Master, if you take all the money,

142
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,670
how will we restock this month?

143
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,330
What about the staff's wages?

144
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,830
My daughter's life is at stake.

145
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,720
I need this money to save her.

146
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,630
I'll handle the rest later,

147
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,590
even if I have to mortgage the house.

148
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,950
Don't worry, I won't shortchange you.

149
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,870
Yes, Master.

150
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,910
Sir.

151
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,820
Just in time.

152
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,310
Don't just stand there. Hurry up.

153
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,190
I'm on my way to...

154
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,680
To where?

155
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,150
Mr. Gu.

156
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,340
Yang Chunfeng!

157
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,670
Get out of here!

158
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,170
Is this how you manage a place?

159
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,670
Guests are always welcome here.

160
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:43,470
I tell you.

161
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,380
If you keep this up,

162
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,840
Qingfeng Restaurant will truly be done for.

163
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:47,830
Bah!

164
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,430
You spit accusations

165
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,390
and now my daughter is in prison.

166
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,909
We'll settle this score later.

167
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,050
Let's wait and see.

168
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,070
Fine.

169
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,790
Let's see how this plays out.

170
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,350
But I'm in a good mood today.

171
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,920
I won't bother myself with you.

172
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,350
I'm here to inform you of something important.

173
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,390
If you've got something to say,

174
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,390
say it and get out.

175
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,610
Qingfeng Restaurant doesn't welcome you.

176
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,910
Not welcoming me?

177
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,900
I'm here to tell you

178
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,910
that from now on, you're the one not welcome here.

179
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,320
What are you talking about?

180
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,910
Are you dreaming?

181
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,150
Mr. Du has ordered it.

182
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,030
See?

183
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,590
From now on,

184
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,850
not a grain of rice will leave this place.

185
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,950
Qingfeng Restaurant is sealed by the government.

186
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,310
Everything here might be

187
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:37,040
evidence of Gu Qingqiao's collusion with the Mantra Sect.

188
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,950
None of this

189
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:41,630
belongs to you anymore.

190
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,220
You...

191
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,870
Officers, stop standing around and get to work.

192
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,270
We need to finish this quickly

193
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,310
and report back to Mr. Du.

194
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,710
You old bastard!

195
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,250
Hurry!

196
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,710
Seal down Qingfeng Restaurant.

197
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,070
Clear out all the guests.

198
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,790
Yes.

199
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,950
Master, be careful.

200
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,150
Come.

201
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,040
You're even worse at fighting.

202
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,590
I'm much stronger than you.

203
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,230
Let me tell you.

204
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,940
Mr. Du has handed over the management

205
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,750
of Qingfeng Restaurant to me.

206
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,030
Rest assured.

207
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,990
I'll manage it better than you ever did.

208
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,430
Unlike you,

209
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,310
I welcome anyone

210
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,750
who can

211
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,550
afford to eat here.

212
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,550
You must be behind all this.

213
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,390
You're too despicable!

214
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,910
If I were you,

215
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,470
I wouldn't be here.

216
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,630
Mr. Du is strict with his investigations.

217
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,760
Your shop is sealed,

218
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,470
and you'd better hurry home and see what's left.

219
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:28,990
You...

220
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:29,870
I...

221
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,830
Master! Master, be careful!

222
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,950
Hurry up!

223
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:34,610
You haven't paid yet.

224
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:35,230
Pay what?

225
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,830
We haven't finished eating.

226
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,870
Right.

227
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,270
This...

228
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:44,410
You want to completely destroy us,

229
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,530
don't you?

230
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:47,990
Master.

231
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,790
Mr. Gu.

232
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,630
I just want to...

233
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,120
Trying to plead with me is useless.

234
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,670
I won't let this go.

235
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:02,830
Master.

236
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,590
Master!

237
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,670
Our house...

238
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,870
Our house has been

239
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,070
ransacked and looted.

240
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,150
Oh no.

241
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,010
Everything is ruined.

242
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,720
I was planning to go to the government and smooth things over,

243
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,330
but now

244
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,230
everything is lost.

245
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,420
What will happen to Qiao?

246
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,340
Young Master Duan, the prison is filthy.

247
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,470
Please bear with it.

248
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:45,940
Thank you.

249
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,670
You finally came.

250
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:57,990
Duan Yu.

251
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,170
You've misunderstood me.

252
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,810
I didn't kidnap Shaoyi.

253
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,390
And I don't know anything about the Mantra Sect.

254
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,470
Please tell them

255
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,710
they've got

256
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,510
the wrong person.

257
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,680
You will believe me,

258
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,400
right?

259
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,060
Gu Qingqiao.

260
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,510
Tell me

261
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,960
what your true intentions are.

262
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,950
The Divine Palace has long foretold

263
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,430
that the Star of Rebellion

264
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:46,030
will help the Sacred Blood Sect rise again and destroy my family.

265
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,770
And you are that Star of Rebellion.

266
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,150
We are destined to be enemies.

267
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,670
Destroy the Duan family?

268
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,340
Star of Rebellion?

269
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,110
So,

270
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,430
from the beginning,

271
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,760
you deliberately approached me

272
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,320
to test me.

273
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,620
So,

274
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,360
from the beginning,

275
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,190
you were deceiving me.

276
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,390
The proposal

277
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,350
was all a lie.

278
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,230
Since you appeared

279
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,030
I started suspecting you

280
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,790
since you appeared during the capture of the Right Guardian.

281
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,350
Stop deluding yourself

282
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,120
and give up.

283
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,550
I finally understand.

284
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,790
The kidnapping

285
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,110
and the Mantra Sect

286
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,950
are all just excuses

287
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,990
because of a prophecy.

288
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:20,480
A prophecy that the Star of Rebellion will destroy your family.

289
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,470
I will destroy the Duan family?

290
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:28,790
This is the funniest joke I've ever heard.

291
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,030
No.

292
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,510
I'm the joke.

293
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,690
I thought fate brought us together again

294
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:48,010
to make up for past wrongs.

295
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,430
I thought

296
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,600
I could have a sweet romance

297
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,710
like any other girl.

298
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:03,720
I thought if I was proactive enough,

299
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,470
I could melt your icy heart.

300
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,380
I thought...

301
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,820
I thought I actually succeeded.

302
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:21,670
I'm sorry.

303
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,420
I'm sorry.

304
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,590
I'm sorry.

305
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,460
I'm sorry for deceiving you.

306
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,350
But if you want to blame someone, blame fate.

307
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,790
Fate?

308
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,140
You'd rather believe

309
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,440
some nonsense prophecy from who-knows-where

310
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,790
than believe me.

311
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,630
Gu Qingqiao,

312
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,910
tell me everything you know about

313
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,450
the Sacred Blood Sect.

314
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,230
I will ask my brother to spare your life.

315
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,830
Don't try to fool me anymore.

316
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,670
She is stubborn.

317
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,600
It seems she'll have to face extreme torture.

318
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,230
No.

319
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,680
She doesn't know martial arts.

320
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,430
Using torture will be counterproductive.

321
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,150
Just kill me.

322
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,270
It would end our ill-fated relationship.

323
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,670
I'll give you three days to reconsider.

324
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,990
We'll talk again then.

325
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,510
Wait.

326
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,100
Was there ever a moment

327
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,080
when you had feelings for me?

328
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,830
I see.

329
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:07,390
This means yes, but not anymore.

330
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,810
Did you get any information out of her?

331
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,060
Mr. Du.

332
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,070
Let's talk in private.

333
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,060
Get a doctor.

334
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,700
If anything happens to Gu Qingqiao,

335
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,000
which then will hinder the Duan family's plan,

336
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,460
I won't let you off easily!

337
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,180
Why are you still standing there?

338
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,210
Go get a doctor!

339
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,760
Yes, right away!

00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,120
I won't see you out then.

343
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,230
Thank you, Magistrate Du.

Any progress?

349
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:43,890
It seems that the Sacred Blood Sect hasn't contacted Gu Qingqiao yet.

350
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,350
What about Magistrate Du?

351
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,590
His Lordship, as you expected,

352
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,830
he refused to hand Gu Qingqiao over to us.

353
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,190
Du Huaichang thinks he has us in his pocket.

00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,430
Until the matter with the Sacred Blood Sect is resolved,

356
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,780
you and Ruoyun's marriage must be arranged quickly.

357
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,990
I don't want Du Huaichang to take advantage of this situation again.

359
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,670
I don't want to marry Du Ruoyun.

You know that.

00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,950
Whether you want to marry her or not is your business.

362
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:11,480
Whether you marry her or not is the Duan family's business.

363
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,060
The marriage alliance between the Du family and the Duan family leaves you no choice.

364
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:14,740
But I...

365
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,690
No buts.

366
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,640
In the future, if you have a woman you love,

00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,869

But Gu Qingqiao

372
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:26,790

That's right.

and attempting to assassinate the Duan family's young master,

381
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:40,820
she will be executed in public.

382
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,340
Well...

383
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,060
What should we do?

384
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,840
My brother's plan

385
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,780
is not truly to kill Qiao,

386
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,630
but to use this opportunity to lure out the Sacred Blood Sect.

387
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:50,230
So,

388
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,870
we still have a chance.

389
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,860
Young Master, please explain further.

390
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,200
Actually, my brother has long known

391
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,720
that Qiao doesn't have much information.

392
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,000
But since the prophecy has been fulfilled

393
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,590
and the Star of Rebellion has appeared,

394
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,890
he decided to

395
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,660
use the prophecy

396
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:07,570
to lure out

397
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,150
the remnants of the Sacred Blood Sect.

398
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,150
Mr. Qi has already spread the word

399
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:15,430
that Gu Qingqiao is the Star of Rebellion.

400
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:16,030
Yes.

401
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,350
So,

402
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,630
during the execution,

403
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,800
the Sacred Blood Sect will surely come to rescue her,

404
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,030
and

405
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,520
the Duan family and the government

406
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,680
can capture them all

407
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,650
and annihilate the Sacred Blood Sect.

408
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,220
But Mr. Qi

409
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,850
already had a tough fight with the Sacred Blood Sect last time.

410
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,580
Are we sure we can win this time?

411
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,760
Mr. Qi has calculated that

412
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,790
as long as we can hold out for two hours,

413
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,630
even if they use Blood Technique,

414
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,290
they will be defeated by then.

415
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,730
Blood Technique relies on circulating their own blood

416
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,050
to boost their power,

417
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,340
but their blood supply

418
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,000
is limited.

419
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,980
So if we can stall them,

420
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,540
they will naturally be defeated

421
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,940
when their Blood Technique fails.

422
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,190
Mr. Qi is impressive.

423
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,170
He knows a lot.

424
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,400
But Young Master,

425
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,370
we can't let Miss Gu take such a risk.

426
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,760
What if the Sacred Blood Sect doesn't show up?

427
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,120
Wouldn't Miss Gu lose her life for nothing?

428
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,320
I anticipated this situation.

429
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,590
This is probably the worst of all possible scenarios.

430
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,110
I've hired a group of experts.

431
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,910
When the execution starts,

432
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,210
they'll rescue Qiao.

433
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,340
Rescue her from the execution ground?

434
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,780
His Lordship has courage,

435
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,310
but you have even more.

436
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,730
You two truly are brothers.

437
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,130
Do you have a better plan?

438
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,050
I...

439
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,260
As long as she was imprisoned,

440
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,390
I couldn't save her.

441
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,510
But now,

442
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,500
there's a great opportunity.

443
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,180
So,

444
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,580
I must succeed.

445
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,040
This is Qiao's only chance to live.

446
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,220
I will send her out of Changqing

447
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,280
to a place where no one knows her.

448
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,320
Heroes are hindered by romantic feelings.

449
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,010
Even my dialogue novels don't have so many twists and turns.

450
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:58,990
I still haven't seen the outcome of the Divine Palace's illusion.

451
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,710
Perhaps whether the Sacred Blood Sect destroys the Duan family

452
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,070
depends not on the Star of Rebellion,

453
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,930
but on my choice.

454
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,750
The Duan family or Miss Gu?

455
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,880
I don't want the Duan family to fall,

456
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,890
and I don't want Qiao to die.

457
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,980
How can both goals be achieved?

458
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,430
You cannot betray either.

459
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,260
Is this an appropriate time?

460
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:26,800
Get lost!

461
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,570
Miss Du.

462
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,470
Shaoyi.

463
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,610
Where am I?

464
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:40,320
Shaoyi.

465
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,030
Shaoyi, you're awake.

466
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,090
Ruoyun?

467
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,270
Why are you here?

468
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,030
You're finally awake.

469
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,700
You had us all worried.

470
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,110
Gu Qingqiao.

471
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:53,210
Gu Qingqiao is still in the hands of the Mantra Sect.

472
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,670
You're badly injured. You shouldn't be trying to get up.

473
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,200
You haven't eaten for days.

474
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,390
Here.

475
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,580
Have some ginseng soup first.

476
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:05,140
Ruoyun, go.

477
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,540
Take people and rescue Gu Qingqiao.

478
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,100
We can't leave her behind.

479
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,110
Gu Qingqiao...

480
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,260
What happened to Gu Qingqiao?

481
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,060
His Lordship.

482
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,120
Ruoyun is here too.

483
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,120
Master Duan.

484
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:24,300
Father.

485
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,110
Are you feeling better?

486
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:33,720
Father.

487
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,020
Give the order to hunt the Mantra Sect.

488
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,560
Gu Qingqiao is still in their hands.

489
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,250
Shaoyi,

490
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,180
you were unconscious for many days.

491
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,230
Some things might not be clear to you.

492
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,780
Gu Qingqiao colluded with the Mantra Sect to kidnap you,

493
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,480
causing your injury.

494
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,330
You almost couldn't be saved.

495
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,010
Fortunately, Duan Yu appeared in time

496
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,830
and saved your life.

497
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,190
No.

498
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,510
It's not like that.

499
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,900
Gu Qingqiao and I were kidnapped together.

500
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,600
I managed to escape

501
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,900
thanks to her covering for me.

502
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,660
Otherwise,

503
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,530
I would have really died.

504
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,080
I also find it strange.

505
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,210
How could Gu Qingqiao

506
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,580
collude with the Mantra Sect to kidnap Shaoyi?

507
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,290
Right.

508
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,460
Father.

509
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:11,930
Don't listen to the slander of small-minded people.

510
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,330
Gu Qingqiao is my savior.

511
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,310
Didn't you teach me to repay kindness?

512
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,430
We have to save her.

513
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,190
I need to tell Father the truth.

514
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,590
We can't wrongfully execute an innocent person.

515
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,670
Wrongfully execute?

516
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:22,650
What are you talking about?

517
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,120
Gu Qingqiao has been imprisoned

518
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,850
and will be executed tomorrow.

519
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,870
Execution?

520
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,070
This must be a joke.

521
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,210
I have to save her.

522
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,270
Don't be reckless.

523
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,310
Who's being reckless?

524
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,860
What did she do wrong?

525
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,380
Listen carefully.

526
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,830
Gu Qingqiao colluded with the Mantra Sect,

527
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,810
intending to kidnap and murder our Duan family's young master.

528
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,040
The government has already convicted her.

529
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,530
This matter is settled.

530
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:48,720
I shall take my leave.

531
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,830
Ruoyun, don't go.

532
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,340
Father.

533
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,270
This is not how things are.

534
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,640
I know the truth.

535
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,540
She's not that kind of person.

536
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,400
Father.

537
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,470
We can't do this.

538
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,450
What can't we?

539
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,670
Shaoyi.

540
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,030
She's our enemy.

541
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,510
She will bring the Sacred Blood Sect

542
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,960
to destroy our family. She is the Star of Rebellion.

543
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,110
Star of Rebellion?

544
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,160
She's so naive.

545
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,190
How could she be the Star of Rebellion?

546
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,360
Father, you must be mistaken.

547
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:15,550
Excuse me.

548
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,320
Ruoyun, don't go.

549
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,810
Ruoyun, take care.

550
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,750
Ruoyun!

551
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,510
Father.

552
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,620
This is wrong.

553
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,110
You taught me how to be benevolent and moral.

554
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,860
Has all that vanished now?

555
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:31,700
Father.

556
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,210
We can't do this.

557
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,110
I can't do this.

558
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,700
What you say is not wrong.

559
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,340
But for now, you should

560
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,200
focus on recovering at home.

561
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:44,470
Father.

562
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:44,990
Ruoyi.

563
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:45,790
Yes.

564
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,430
Father.

565
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,620
Watch him closely.

566
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:50,110
Don't let him take a single step out of this room.

567
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:50,620
Yes.

568
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,770
Father!

569
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,630
-Gu Qingqiao is innocent!
-Young Master Shaoyi.

570
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:55,270
Young Master Shaoyi.

571
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,950
-Calm down, Young Master Shaoyi.
-Father!

572
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,150
Young Master Shaoyi.

573
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,670
Be careful of your injury.

574
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,220
Mom.

575
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,640
Maybe I can only see you again

576
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,480
when I die.

577
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:22,630
Shh.

578
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:33,020
Who are you?

579
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,240
My master sent me with a message for you.

580
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,110
Master?

581
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,040
Who is your master?

582
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,700
He said his name is Lu Zizheng.

583
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,130
What did he ask?

584
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,360
He asked

585
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,940
if you regret it.

586
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,920
I don't know.

587
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:57,260
I never expected things to turn out this way.

588
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,980
Maybe the Star of Rebellion was destined to die.

589
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,950
He said he would come to save you.

590
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,340
She's still so young,

591
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,600
but she'll be executed tomorrow.

592
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,430
It's true what they say,

593
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,430
nothing is worse than being guilty.

594
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,480
Young Master Duan.

595
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,230
Young Master Duan.

596
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,590
I came to visit her.

597
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,090
Young Master Duan.

598
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,230
I didn't expect you

599
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,530
to bring me my last meal of braised pork.

600
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,780
I can't eat it

601
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:11,430
unless it's made by Qingfeng Restaurant's cook.

602
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,110
Qiao.

603
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,120
Don't be like this.

604
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,140
Then how should I be?

605
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,070
Should I cry and beg you to let me out?

606
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,750
I am also left with

607
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,010
no other choice.

608
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,450
No, no, no.

609
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,760
Falling in love with you

610
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,300
is my own business.

611
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,030
I made this braised pork myself.

612
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,580
But Young Master Duan,

613
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,530
your braised pork is really salty.

614
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:54,000
From tomorrow onwards,

615
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,080
everything will get better.

616
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,430
I will set things right.

617
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,600
Yes.

618
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,990
Maybe this is the best outcome.

619
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,940
It's getting late.

620
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,460
I should go.

621
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,040
Qiao!

622
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,810
Qiao!

623
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,520
Qiao! What's wrong?

624
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:37,170
The food is poisoned.

625
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,720
Qiao.

626
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:41,930
Qiao!

627
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,230
Qiao!

628
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,780
Young Master Duan, you can't take her away.

629
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,510
Move.

630
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,440
She is a death row prisoner.

631
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,030
She has to die in the prison.

632
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:51,870
Move aside!

633
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:53,030
If she dies today,

634
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,830
you will accompany her in death!

635
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,410
Strange.

636
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,800
Why is no one here?

637
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:22,090
Qiao, we're almost at the clinic.

638
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,000
Hold on.

639
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:26,320
[Tea]

640
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:26,440
Qiao.

641
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,770
You have to hold on.

642
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,160
I won't allow you to die.

643
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,240
Not here,

644
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,020
not now.

645
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:33,900
Wait for me.

646
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,070
Young Master Duan.

647
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:41,690
You have a really ruthless heart.

648
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,830
You want me

649
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,070
to die in front of everyone, don't you?

650
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,460
Can't you

651
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:51,300
let me go peacefully?

652
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:54,740
Qiao.

653
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:55,810
Duan Yu

654
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:58,550
You've fallen into a trap.

655
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,740
The hairpin is poisonous.

656
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,470
Duan Yu.

657
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,370
Surrender now.

658
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,620
Take another step,

659
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,070
and it will cost you your life.

660
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,870
Give me the Nine-turn Melodious Bell.

661
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:30,780
Qiao.

662
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,480
don't come any closer.

663
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,140
I...

664
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,960
I really wish

665
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:32,030
we had never met again.

666
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:17,690
Young Master!

667
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:18,710
Young Master!

668
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,150
Young Master, are you all right?

669
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:26,930
Young Master.

670
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,270
Thank you.

671
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:37,110
What a femme fatale.

672
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,780
A femme fatale!

673
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,990
His Lordship, please calm down.

674
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,620
You can't blame it all on Young Master.

675
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,930
The Star of Rebellion escaped with inside help.

676
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,730
She must have had an accomplice,

677
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,320
likely the Right Guardian.

678
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,660
We were too focused

679
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,510
on the Sacred Blood Sect

680
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,210
and overlooked her connection to the Mantra Sect.

681
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:56,140
This requires further consideration.

682
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:56,780
Brother.

683
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,000
Please enforce family law on me.

684
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,910
Family law can punish your body

685
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,620
but not your heart.

686
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:10,360
I'll give you a chance to redeem yourself.

687
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:11,970
Go after Gu Qingqiao.

688
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,030
Bring her back,

689
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,590
dead or alive.

690
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,590
Great!

691
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,280
The beheading order for Qiao has been revoked.

692
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:26,480
Does this mean she's safe?

693
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,450
No matter what,

694
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,150
she is surely alive.

695
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,760
These days

696
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,340
have been hard on you all.

697
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,220
Those who can leave have left.

698
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,600
Since Qiao is safe,

699
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,560
I will stay and wait for her alone.

700
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:42,950
You and Da should

701
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,670
go live your own life.

702
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,460
But

703
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,160
there's nothing valuable

704
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,380
left in the house.

705
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,150
However,

706
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,720
I found this.

707
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,120
Qiao probably won't need it anymore.

708
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,150
Take it and use it

709
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,040
to start a small business.

710
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,330
Master,

711
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,270
this is too valuable

712
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,270
I can't accept it.

713
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,600
Besides, we won't leave

714
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,240
until My Lady returns.

715
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:06,980
Take it.

716
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,030
I'm not leaving.

717
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,510
I can't support you anymore.

718
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,330
Staying here would only burden me.

719
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,440
Leave while you can.

720
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:24,490
Master.

721
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:25,910
I promised My Lady

722
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,590
to take good care of you.

723
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,610
Now that her fate is uncertain,

724
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:31,620
we can't leave you alone.

725
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:35,200
Besides, the Gu family has been kind to us,

726
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,990
and we've saved some money.

727
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,310
Is it almost noon?

728
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,510
Da, prepare lunch.

729
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,490
Okay.

730
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,470
Master, have a seat.

731
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:48,090
Search everywhere.

732
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:49,620
Leave no corner unchecked.

733
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,240
Yes.

734
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,030
Officers,

735
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,110
what are you doing here again?

736
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,670
You've already turned the house upside down.

737
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,580
Gu Qingqiao escaped from prison.

738
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,020
Anyone harboring her

739
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:04,290
will be executed along with her.

740
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:07,820
Do you hear me?

741
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,239
Qiao escaped!

742
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,360
That's wonderful news!

743
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:14,449
Great!

744
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,989
Master, let's ask Da to add a meat dish.

745
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:17,540
Okay!

746
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,120
Let's go eat meat.

747
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,070
Let's go.

748
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,110
Okay.

749
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,210
This...

750
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,750
Are these people mad?

751
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,850
Let's go eat meat.

752
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,120
Let's go eat meat.

753
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,610
Where am I?

754
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,760
I...

755
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:21,360
Did Lu Zizheng poison me to death?

756
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,310
Gu Qingqiao.

757
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:27,780
Who's there?

758
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,000
Master Kongkong.

759
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,380
Is that you?

760
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,160
Master?

761
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,310
Is that you?

762
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,710
Master.

763
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,510
Master.

764
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,140
Are you talking to me?

765
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:48,400
Am I dead?

766
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:50,830
Look at the mark on your ankle.

767
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:53,460
It's your life symbol in this world.

768
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,530
You are not from my world.

769
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,190
If it turns completely black,

770
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,790
you will die

771
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:02,250
and never return to your original world.

772
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,010
What should I do?

773
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,500
Master!

774
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,570
Remember.

775
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:10,500
The Four Treasures are your only way back.

776
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,910
Go to Xiling.

777
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,320
Go find the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword.

778
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,200
Master!

779
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,590
Master!

780
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:20,990
Master, don't go!

781
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:22,950
How do I get there?

782
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,770
Were you dreaming?

783
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,300
Why were you yelling?

784
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,690
Where did you go?

785
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,850
I went to your house.

786
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,150
How is my father?

787
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,550
How are they doing?

788
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,520
They seem well,

789
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,070
in high spirits.

790
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:41,350
In high spirits?

791
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:43,300
They heard you broke out of prison,

792
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,300
so they added meat to their meal.

793
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,690
I have to go back.

794
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:52,210
You can't.

795
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,560
Your house is surrounded by officials,

796
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,600
and there are wanted posters for you

797
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,000
all over Changqing.

798
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:58,330
You can't go back.

799
00:36:58,770 --> 00:36:59,650
Don't worry.

800
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:00,840
Your father is fine.

801
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:03,110
He even has two people with him.

802
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,280
It must be Dongxi and Da.

803
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,160
I don't know

804
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,410
how I'll ever repay their kindness.

805
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:12,120
Alright,

806
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,240
you seem to have recovered well.

807
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,330
It's time to pack up and leave here.

808
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,580
What now?

809
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:21,980
Who exactly are you?

810
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,680
Lu Zizheng.

811
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,760
How can a mere Right Guardian of the Mantra Sect

812
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:28,100
possess such extraordinary abilities,

813
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:31,490
coming and going as you please?

814
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:34,270
Coming and going as I please?

815
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:35,550
Then why did I stay in your family's wine cellar

816
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,630
for so long,

817
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,710
needing you, the daughter of a small shopkeeper,

818
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,110
to help me out of the city?

819
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,330
Why do you keep coming to me

820
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,290
and even save me?

821
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:45,030
Why?

822
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,640
Who are you?

823
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,920
Listen carefully.

824
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,420
I'll only say this once.

825
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,880
Who I am is not important.

826
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:57,210
What matters is

827
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,000
who you are.

828
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:10,950
So Duan Yu never trusted me from the start.

829
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:31,380
♫Walking into the misty forest♫

830
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:39,880
♫The moonlight pulls the shadow♫

831
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,970
♫I walk forward in the darkness♫

832
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,220
♫Continuously♫

833
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,310
♫Following the lonely scent♫

834
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,310
One heart, one person.

835
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,270
Till death do us part.

836
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:02,310
♫The distant bagpipe song♫

837
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:06,390
♫Where does the heart settle?♫

838
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:10,490
♫Memories are like shackles♫

839
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,850
♫Tormenting♫

840
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,270
[Life can be bitter but we must be sweet]

841
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,700
♫Who rushes into confusion?♫

842
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:24,730
♫Can't see the truth♫

843
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:28,750
♫Promises shatter in an instant♫

844
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:30,630
♫Leaving blurry dream♫

845
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,820
♫And longing♫

846
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:36,840
♫The world turns into a vortex of sorrow♫

847
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:40,930
♫Swallowing your silhouette♫

848
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:44,500
♫I will seal everything and return it♫

849
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:47,800
♫Before dawn♫

850
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:52,130
♫For your forgetfulness♫
