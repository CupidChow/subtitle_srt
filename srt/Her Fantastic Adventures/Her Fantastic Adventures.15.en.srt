[Her Fantastic Adventures]

3
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,440
Master Ruan.

4
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:58,789
Master Ruan.

5
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,670
Master Ruan is being serious about this.

6
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,520
When Uncle-Master draws his sword, it means...

7
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,630
It means blood will be shed.

8
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,870
I'm scared.

9
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,430
I had an internal injury before.

10
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,370
Help me block it first.

11
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,800
Master Ruan, I want to have a try.

12
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,200
No need.

13
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,760
I aspire to be the second best in the world.

14
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,960
Please enlighten me.

15
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,930
Why not aim for the best?

16
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,690
With you around,

17
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,740
how could I dare to covet that position?

18
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,070
Let's give it a try then.

[Episode 15]

20
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,640
How dare she hug Master Ruan?

21
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:31,829
Let go.

22
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,450
Let go now.

23
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,100
Class is over.

24
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,610
Time to eat.

25
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,440
Let's go.

26
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,680
Let's go and eat.

27
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:45,660
Master.

28
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,970
I found Bai and Qing

29
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,180
sneaking around the forbidden area.

30
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,010
I think they're definitely up to something.

31
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,860
They're new to Xiling.

32
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,880
It's normal for them to explore around.

33
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,670
You're overthinking.

34
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,550
Master,

35
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,680
they are indeed acting suspiciously.

36
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,670
I know you are jealous of Bai

37
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,180
and think I favor him.

38
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:05,970
Master...

39
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,910
Stop.

40
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,150
Quancai.

41
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,710
A true cultivator

42
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,310
must have a clear

43
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,980
and calm heart.

44
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,930
You are too narrow-minded

45
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,390
and unfit for greater responsibilities.

46
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:27,850
That scared me.

47
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,730
Master Ruan's face must have looked awful just now.

48
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,730
Once my injuries heal in a few days,

49
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,770
he won't be able to find me.

50
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,230
It seems that

51
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,590
the forbidden area is off-limits for now.

52
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,730
When I snuck into the Tianlu Pavilion last night,

53
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:42,890
I ran into Master Ruan.

54
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,750
Do you think he found out about us?

55
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,980
If we were discovered,

56
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,890
we wouldn't be sitting here.

57
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,140
Let's wait and see.

58
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,700
I still think there's something wrong with the Tianlu Pavilion.

59
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,590
I need to check it out in a few days.

60
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:01,950
Don't be stingy.

61
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,920
-How about this?
-Give it to me.

62
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,090
Just lend it to me.

63
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,500
Hurry, hurry.

64
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,180
Ligusticum, angelica...

65
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,110
Not bad.

66
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,550
Not bad.

67
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,250
Second Senior.

68
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,250
You scared us.

69
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,390
That's right.

70
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,710
Qing.

71
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,030
What are you laughing at?

72
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,830
You have leeks stuck in your teeth and didn't pass.

73
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,450
Nonsense!

74
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,630
How can you make fun of Master?

75
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,860
Quancai.

76
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,520
You are good at everything

77
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,420
but care too much about trivial matters.

78
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,540
Too much.

79
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,470
Don't laugh.

80
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,110
Did Master say that?

81
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,070
First Senior. Do it for us.

82
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,700
Come on.

83
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,380
First Senior, come on.

84
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,100
First Senior, come on.

85
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,680
First Senior, come on.

86
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,409
-First Senior, come on.
-Stop.

87
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:05,890
You!

88
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,860
You have leeks in your teeth.

89
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:09,760
Failed.

90
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:10,880
You...

91
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,460
Two qian of herbs are missing.

92
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,560
Failed.

93
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:15,840
You...

94
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,550
You don't look like one of us from Li San Hall.

95
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,310
Failed.

96
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,380
My disciples

97
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,540
must be good-looking.

98
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,570
Master...

99
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,150
You failed!

100
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,390
Let's go.

101
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:54,840
Go.

102
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,040
Why did you pull me out?

103
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,070
Didn't you notice my uncle is a bit feverish?

104
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,790
Are these herbs even working?

105
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,270
This place isn't as good as Changqing.

106
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,110
They lack many rare herbs.

107
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,480
Should we go back to Changqing then?

108
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,120
No.

109
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,830
The journey back to Changqing is too bumpy.

110
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,230
It's not suitable to move the Young Master.

111
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,480
I'm going out for a bit.

112
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,220
Where are you taking me?

113
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,200
I'm taking you to Lord Witch Doctor's tent.

114
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,800
Hurry up.

115
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,560
Please protect our Fire Crane Tribe

116
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,860
from foreign invasions.

117
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,280
May we turn misfortune into blessings

118
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,610
and stay safe and sound.

119
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,740
This is our Fire Crane Tribe's treasure.

120
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,750
When the Moon Wolf Tribe attacked before,

121
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,480
it was through this divination

122
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,020
that we avoided a disaster.

123
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:04,850
My Lord said

124
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,390
as long as it stays with our tribe,

125
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,200
we'll be safe from harm

126
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,950
and won't fear the Moon Wolf Tribe anymore.

127
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,070
Is that why you were sold to bandits,

128
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,830
because of the Moon Wolf Tribe?

129
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,680
Yes.

130
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,990
The Moon Wolf Tribe are prairie bandits

131
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,190
who often raid us.

132
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,520
They kill our strong men

133
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,650
and sell our women and children.

134
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,990
We constantly have to move our camp

135
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,350
to keep our tribe alive.

136
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,610
I hate those bandits so much!

137
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:31,890
It's infuriating!

138
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,490
I'll take Wuyi Guards and drive them out.

139
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:35,590
Calm down.

140
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,549
My Lord said

141
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,230
as long as the treasure is with the Fire Crane Tribe,

142
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,450
we'll be safe.

143
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,870
I brought you here

144
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,159
because your uncle's injuries are severe.

145
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,200
If we pray with the treasure

146
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,510
while Lord Witch Doctor is away,

147
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,370
it will help him recover quickly.

148
00:08:59,070 --> 00:08:59,950
Wu!

149
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,310
don't you know

150
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,420
strangers are forbidden here?

151
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,240
I'm sorry.

152
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:08,800
My Lord!

153
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,470
He is my slave.

154
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,740
He's not a stranger.

155
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,860
Young Master Shaoyi.

156
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,880
Don't listen to Wu's nonsense.

157
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,460
I told the truth.

158
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,450
My Lord.

159
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,060
It's not Wu's fault.

160
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,160
I insisted on coming in.

161
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,360
Young Master Shaoyi.

162
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,120
The Fire Crane Tribe is not a safe place.

163
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,500
The Moon Wolf Tribe could return to raid us at any moment.

164
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,750
Once Young Master Duan's injuries are healed,

165
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,240
you should leave as soon as possible.

166
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,030
Master, what's this notice about?

167
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,500
It's for hiring a Grand Steward.

168
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,070
Grand Steward?

169
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,770
What does that entail?

170
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,560
They maintain the rules

171
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,620
and improve the environment of Xiling.

172
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,820
They have almost all the powers

173
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,800
of the Sect Leader.

174
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,230
So,

175
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,660
if we become the Grand Steward,

176
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,150
we can freely enter

177
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,740
the Tianlu Pavilion and the forbidden area.

178
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,230
Finding Black Wood Human-shaped Sword

179
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,640
would be just around the corner.

180
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,100
You can sign up over there.

181
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,560
Let's sign up.

182
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,430
We should all go.

183
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,510
Go.

184
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,400
Go.

185
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,830
Unexpectedly,\

186
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,250
ten people have signed up

187
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,650
for this election.

188
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,970
To ensure fairness,

189
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,000
Siqiong and I

190
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,410
have decided on five rounds

191
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,350
of written and physical tests.

192
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,650

Easy.

382
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:37,550
Just set up an equation.

383
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,350
Grind the ink.

384
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,400
Do you have paper?

385
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,480
Give me paper!

386
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,490
Here.

387
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,470
Why is it so big?

388
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,390
Such a waste.

389
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,010
Never mind, no time to complain.

390
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,800
[Solving: Suppose]

391
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,580
What do you need paper for?

392
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:53,540
Suppose there are X chickens

393
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,140
and Y rabbits.

394
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:00,230
X plus Y equals fourteen.

395
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,230
What are you doing?

396
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,780
You let me win during the martial arts round.

397
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,920
I hate owing people.

398
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,050
Consider this me paying you back.

399
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,330
You're so stingy!

400
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,800
Draw the picture bigger.

401
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,180
Y equals 38.

402
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,100
What kind of chicken scratch is this?

403
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:23,980
Quiet!

404
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:27,670
I've forgotten how to solve it after setting up the equations.

405
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,030
Aren't you supposed to be smart?

406
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,230
I learned this in elementary school.

407
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,490
I've forgotten it all.

408
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:32,910
Hush.

409
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,870
[Setting up equations: Let x be chickens and y be rabbits]

410
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,700
[9 chickens, 5 rabbits]

411
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,890
What's the answer?

412
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,400
The answer is...

413
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,820
-Six rabbits and nine chickens.
-Five rabbits and nine chickens.

414
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,950
The correct answer is

415
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,790
Five rabbits and nine chickens.

416
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,850
Six rabbits and nine chickens.

417
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:16,210
Congratulations to Senior Bao Quancai.

418
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:23,680
Quancai

419
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,110
Well done.

420
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,490
Grand Steward!

421
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,050
Grand Steward!

422
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,650
Grand Steward!

423
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,080
Grand Steward!

424
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,590
Grand Steward!

425
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,610
Stop making a fuss.

426
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,440
Did your gym teachers teach you math?

427
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,440
Welcome.

428
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,110
Welcome, Grand Steward.

429
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,600
Welcome

430
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,540
Welcome, Grand Steward.

431
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,620
Grand Steward.

432
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,830
I have a suggestion.

433
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,540
We're all fellow disciples.

434
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,330
Your goals are my goals.

435
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,600
Second Senior, please go ahead.

436
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,460
Grand Steward.

437
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,080
Can we have more meat dishes in the future?

438
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,660
No problem. Leave it to me.

439
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,900
Great!

440
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,390
Great!

441
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:06,950
Let's eat.

442
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,010
Senior, where are you going?

443
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,030
Master Ruan never comes to the dining hall.

444
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,360
I'm taking him his meal.

445
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,340
Why is it all noodles?

446
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,020
Where are the dishes?

447
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,070
Master Ruan isn't picky.

448
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,150
As long as he's full, it's fine.

449
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,390
I didn't expect the world's number one

450
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,430
to be nurtured in such conditions.

451
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,030
Truly admirable.

452
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:24,950
Senior, don't worry.

453
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,750
You won't have to endure hardship anymore.

454
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,550
Leave it to me.

455
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,350
No, no.

456
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,750
Master Ruan. He...

457
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,040
Master Ruan.

458
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:35,120
To thank you for your fair judgment and keen insight

459
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,390
during the Grand Steward selection,

460
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,200
I've specially prepared spicy crayfish,

461
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,540
sweet and sour pork,

462
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,150
original-flavor beef,

463
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,310
and grape juice for you.

464
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,000
In the future, keep it simple.

465
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,400
No need for such trouble.

466
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:52,180
Squeeze this lemon on the shrimp.

467
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,440
It'll be especially delicious.

468
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,190
Master Ruan.

469
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,210
It's been a long time since I've had an orange.

470
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:01,890
Orange?

471
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,210
What's going on?

472
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,240
I discovered by accident once.

473
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,530
I accidentally spilled a jar of salt,

474
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:14,010
and Master Ruan ate it without any reaction.

475
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,910
Could this be the legendary...

476
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,020
Taste blindness?

477
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,430
Taste blindness?

478
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,240
I'll do it myself.

479
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,820
Young Master, you're hurt. Let me do it.

480
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,710
Si.

481
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,670
Come out.

482
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,530
Be careful.

483
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:50,830
Go.

484
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,270
What's the matter?

485
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,330
Follow me quickly.

486
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:59,370
Young Master Shaoyi, what are you planning?

487
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:01,700
Wu said that the Fire Crane Tribe has a treasure

488
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,350
that can help your uncle recover.

489
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:03,830
Really?

490
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,920
Then let's go ask for it.

491
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:06,690
Hush.

492
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:07,380
No.

493
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:08,760
Lord Witch Doctor said

494
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,580
it's the Fire Crane Tribe's most precious treasure.

495
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,510
I'm afraid they won't give it to us.

496
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,830
So what are you planning?

497
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,610
I want...

498
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:19,820
For Young Master...

499
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,190
Steal.

500
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:29,230
Go!

501
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,040
What are you doing?

502
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:53,490
You scared me.

503
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:58,270
Our first attempt is a failure.

504
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:01,300
What were you two doing just now?

505
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,790
We were trying to steal your holy relic

506
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,580
to heal Duan Yu.

507
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,780
Young Master Shaoyi.

508
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,560
How can you openly

509
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,620
admit to stealing like that?

510
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:17,830
It's okay.

511
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,820
He and I are in a very close relationship.

512
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,820
Whatever he does, I'm part of it too.

513
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,350
It's fine.

514
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,240
Are you two...

515
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:32,980
I...

516
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,780
I'm her slave.

517
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,320
Young Master Shaoyi.

518
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,650
How can you be so happy about being a slave?

519
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:46,030
If word gets out that the young master of the Duan family is a slave,

520
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:48,670
it wouldn't be appropriate.

521
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,680
I...

522
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,350
I can help you steal the holy relic.

523
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,030
Heroine,

524
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,580
Young Master Shaoyi

525
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,550
can be your slave.

526
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,300
We must get the holy relic

527
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,310
before Lord Witch Doctor returns,

528
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,030
pray with it to your uncle,

529
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,070
and then return it.

530
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:11,800
Understood.

531
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,170
Forgive me.

532
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,670
I'm doing this

533
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:17,600
to save my uncle.

534
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,520
Please forgive me.

535
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,030
Mr. Si.

536
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:27,990
Stay here.

537
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:29,040
If Lord Witch Doctor returns,

538
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,030
inform us immediately.

539
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:30,430
Okay.

540
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:31,220
Si.

541
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,390
This is in your hands now.

542
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,170
Be careful.

543
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,490
Hurry back.

544
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,550
Look over there.

545
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,150
Let's go!

546
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:49,990
Thanks, Wu.

547
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,270
Then will you be my slave forever?

548
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,710
I would be honored.

549
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:57,670
Now that we have the holy relic,

550
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,680
what should we do next?

551
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,680
We should pray to it.

552
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,110
How?

553
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:05,430
I've seen Lord Witch Doctor pray,

554
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,090
but I've never done it myself.

555
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,070
Whatever.

556
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,070
Let's give it a try.

557
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:16,820
Uncle.

558
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:17,620
Uncle.

559
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,430
I stole...

560
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:19,590
I stole

561
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,310
the holy relic to heal you.

562
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,350
You young people

563
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,700
lack virtue.

564
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:31,610
Xing Si.

565
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:34,110
Even you are participating in this nonsense?

566
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:34,910
Young Master.

567
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,790
I thought this treasure could save you.

568
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,830
That's why I took such a desperate measure.

569
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,000
Don't blame him.

570
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,740
He was just trying to save you.

571
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,580
Wu!

572
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,840
That was your idea, wasn't it?

573
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,040
Stealing the holy relic,

574
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,860
do you realize how severe the punishment is?

575
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,500
My Lord, I'm sorry.

576
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,910
It's not Wu's fault.

577
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,150
It's not Si's fault either.

578
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,730
It was all my idea.

579
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:56,950
If there's punishment,

580
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,320
let it fall on me alone.

581
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:02,350
Lord Witch Doctor has been diligently treating me

582
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,410
and gathering herbs for my recovery.

583
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,950
I am deeply grateful.

584
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:10,070
Wu did this for my sake.

585
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:12,750
I beg you to be lenient.

586
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,960
My men stole the holy relic.

587
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,780
I didn't teach them well.

588
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,270
If there's any punishment,

589
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,390
I will take

590
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,990
full responsibility.

591
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:23,820
This item is indeed of great significance

592
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,110
to the Fire Crane Tribe.

593
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:30,590
The Duan family has helped our clan in the past.

594
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:34,120
We will let this matter go.

595
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,840
However, you must leave

596
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,510
today.

597
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,590
My Lord.

598
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,550
He's my slave! I won't let him go!

599
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,760
Wu!

600
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,750
Don't covet what doesn't belong to you.

601
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,090
You are a woman of the Fire Crane Tribe.

602
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:50,450
You should grow up.

603
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,550
No!

604
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,390
My Lord.

605
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,230
I beg you.

606
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,260
I know I was wrong.

607
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,630
There won't be a next time.

608
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,140
It was my immaturity,

609
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:59,320
all my fault.

610
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,310
I beg you.

611
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,030
Please.

612
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,370
Let go. Stop it.

613
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,110
It's Qiao's portrait

614
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,620
Why is Qiao's portrait here?

615
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:08,870
Could it be...

616
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,790
Leave now.

617
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,660
Lord Witch Doctor.

618
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,550
The Duan family will take responsibility for any loss

619
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,670
the Fire Crane Tribe has suffered.

620
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:20,510
Let us

621
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:22,950
part ways here.

622
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:23,750
Uncle.

623
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,600
Lord Witch Doctor, please forgive me.

624
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,110
My injuries are not fully healed,

625
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:30,310
and I may need to stay a few more days.

626
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,200
This...

627
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,000
My Lord, please let them stay.

628
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:40,820
Since Young Master Duan asked,

629
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,350
then stay.

630
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:46,150
But our tribe is very poor.

631
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:49,110
I hope you can understand.

632
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,630
The inner chamber of Tianlu Pavilion

633
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:04,030
is off-limits to anyone except the leader.

634
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,590
I'm the new Grand Steward.

635
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,910
I have the same rights as the leader.

636
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,300
[Grand Steward]

637
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:15,660
Then, please take your time to review.

638
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,780
I will take my leave.

639
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,630
It's all books.

640
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,370
There's no clue.

641
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,670
There is no place to hide.

642
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:45,860
[Grand Steward]

643
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,240
Maybe there's a secret mechanism.

644
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,540
Many years ago,

645
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,220
the founder of the Xiling Sect

646
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:11,500
discovered a precious sword on Xiling Mountain.

647
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:17,190
With the power of this sword,

648
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,790
he roamed the martial world,

649
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,630
creating the Xiling Sect.

650
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,830
Black Wood Human-shaped Sword?

651
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:31,670
But at the peak of Xiling Sect,

652
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:34,590
the founder retired.

653
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,190
He left a message before he left.

654
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,510
The Black Wood Human-shaped Sword

655
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:42,550
gave great power

656
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,190
but also came with a high cost.

657
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,760
What are you reading?

658
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,510
Studying again?

659
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,580
I couldn't sleep.

660
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:01,690
So, I thought I'd find a book to read.

661
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:04,090
Maybe it will help me fall asleep.

662
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,000
What are you reading?

663
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,950
Let me see.

664
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,640
A cookbook?

665
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,130
That can help you sleep?

666
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:21,960
Yes.

667
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:22,830
It works.

668
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,220
You should try it too.

669
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,350
Thank you.

670
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,230
I can sleep now.

671
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,980
Congratulations.

672
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,670
I'll borrow this book.

673
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:31,810
[Recipe]

674
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,030
Master Ruan.

675
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,740
Aren't you reading anymore?

676
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,670
It's late.

677
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,340
I'll go back with you.

678
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:45,340
No need.

679
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,190
I'm going to Yuanzhi Hall.

680
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,630
We aren't going the same way.

681
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,360
I'm also going to Yuanzhi Hall.

682
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:51,900
Oh no.

683
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,800
Did he discover anything?

684
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,510
Master Ruan!

685
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:07,790
What's wrong?

686
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:08,740
Master Ruan!

687
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:10,390
Are you alright?

688
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,400
Master Ruan!

689
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,740
What's wrong?

690
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:20,990
Master Ruan?

691
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:24,750
There's no heartbeat.

692
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,160
Emergency.

693
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:32,830
Emergency!

694
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,510
Yes.

695
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,770
I told you the lights would be on in the Tianlu Pavilion.

696
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,640
Look.

697
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,350
No, no, it's not what it looks like.

698
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,190
Junior Sister.

699
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,170
It's not

700
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,220
what it looks like.

701
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,470
Master Ruan passed out.

702
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:53,930
This...

703
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,430
Master Ruan, this...

704
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,880
Junior.

705
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,310
Really?

706
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,360
Exactly.

707
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,570
I don't believe it.

708
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,660
Go back to your seat.

709
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,330
What's going on?

710
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:21,060
What's wrong with them?

711
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,780
Why do you look so pale?

712
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:25,620
I didn't sleep well.

713
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,640
Let me tell you.

714
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:31,190
Last night I went to the Tianlu Pavilion...

715
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,790
Are you going to skip class?

716
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:36,770
Bai.

717
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:46,350
Senior Sister,

718
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,520
you guys go eat first.

719
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,920
I'll come find you later.

720
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:51,430
Master Ruan.

721
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,570
I'm here to bring you food.

722
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,250
From now on, just prepare the usual meals.

723
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,150
You're a patient.

724
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,010
You should eat something good.

725
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:14,989
Well,

726
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,800
if you hear

727
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:19,909
any strange rumors in the next few days...

728
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,139
It's sweet.

729
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:24,199
It's honey pear soup.

730
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:26,350
I added three times the usual amount of sugar.

731
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:27,300
Master Ruan.

732
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,889
Please don't believe those rumors.

733
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:30,840
It's too salty.

734
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:33,790
Too salty.

735
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:34,510
Then don't eat this.

736
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,370
I want to eat it.

737
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:41,120
Master Ruan.

738
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,320
You've regained your sense of taste!

739
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,550
I like this one.

740
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,400
You're back.

741
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:55,060
Third Senior Sister, let's switch seats.

742
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,510
Man Tianxing.

743
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,000
Why are you doing this too?

744
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,730
Senior, I didn't.

745
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,440
I don't know what you mean.

746
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:02,990
I haven't done anything

747
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:05,360
beyond the relationship of fellow disciples with Master Ruan.

748
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,660
Why are you telling me this?

749
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,120
What's it got to do with me?

750
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,650
I'm going to wash up.

751
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,820
Why are you so difficult?

752
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,000
Don't mind it.

753
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,080
That's just her personality.

754
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,080
It'll get better.

755
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:26,850
Why is finding a sword so hard?

756
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,520
You have to pass all these tests.

757
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:33,060
Every test is tough, but you have to get through them all.

758
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,000
Master Ruan.

759
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,700
Isn't it bitter?

760
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,180
Yes.

761
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,210
But it has a unique flavor.

762
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,020
Just looking at it makes my teeth ache.

763
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,150
Since when

764
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,350
did Master Ruan care so much about food?

765
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,130
Maybe he's getting old.

766
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,980
That makes sense.

767
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,150
Qing.

768
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:17,560
Come over.

769
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,470
I want to talk to you.

770
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,580
No way.

771
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,900
We guessed right?

772
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:31,470
Bai, the last disciple of the Li San Hall,

773
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,310
wants to ask the senior brothers for guidance.

774
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:34,230
Who's first?

775
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:35,960
Me.

776
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,550
[Xiling]

777
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,820
[Xiling]

778
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,130
Are you a Husky?

779
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:15,730
Do you bite everyone you see?

780
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:16,550
I want to.

781
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,630
I can't stand them.

782
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:26,900
Let's make up.

783
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,510
I don't want to

784
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,830
fall out with you

785
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,230
over such a small matter.

786
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:38,310
As long as you don't fall out with Ruan Siqiong.

787
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,270
You're insulting my character.

788
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,600
You of all people should know.

789
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:48,910
I went to the Tianlu Pavilion to check the forbidden area

790
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:52,240
and look for clues about the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword.

791
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,190
Who knew Master Ruan was there too?

792
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,030
Did you find any clues?

793
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,970
I only found some fragments.

794
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:02,270
The book says

795
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:05,680
that those who obtain the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword

796
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:08,220
will also pay a painful price.

797
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,840
I thought about it.

798
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,930
Maybe we shouldn't look for it anymore.

799
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,930
Paying a price is better than dying.

800
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,300
If we can't find the Four Treasures,

801
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,750
your happiness is only temporary.

802
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:18,230
I...

803
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:23,180
I don't want to burden you.

804
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,980
You've done enough for me already.

805
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,180
I crawled out of hell.

806
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:31,410
I'm tough.

807
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,210
I was born

808
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:38,100
to a noble family, an illegitimate child of a servant.

809
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,820
I hid and ran

810
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,500
like a rat.

811
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,500
The family offended someone

812
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:48,370
and their enemies hired bandits to wipe them out.

813
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,610
I hid under corpses to survive.

814
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,970
Since then, I swore

815
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,350
not to let anyone

816
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:56,070
take my life easily.

817
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,790
My fate

818
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,590
is in my own hands.

819
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,390
Alright.

820
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:08,990
Now,

821
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,840
I'll face life and death with you again.

822
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:12,680
Qing,

823
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:15,160
I want to ask you seriously.

824
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,720
Have you ever done anything

825
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:20,060
beyond a fellow disciple's relationship with Master Ruan?

826
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,380
If you mean

827
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:24,670
physical contact to save someone,

828
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,490
-then I...
-You...

829
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:28,830
Do you like Master Ruan?

830
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,690
My admiration for Master Ruan

831
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,830
is based on my respect for the strong

832
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,230
and the love between fellow disciples.

833
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,350
There's no romantic feelings.

834
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:36,040
So,

835
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:38,830
did you kiss Master Ruan that day?

836
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,400
I swear to God.

837
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,370
Absolutely not.

838
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,270
I...

839
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,470
I really saw it.

840
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:45,630
Qing, stop hiding it.

841
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,710
Second Senior, you really saw it wrongly.

842
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,830
I am a righteous and upright person.

843
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:52,230
I would never deceive everyone about this.

844
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,570
I believe her.

845
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,700
Actually, I believe her too.

846
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:59,190
So you don't trust me?

847
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:00,600
You don't believe me either?

848
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,600
I already know about that incident.

849
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:04,670
It was my mistake that night.

850
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,420
It has nothing to do with Qing.

851
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,120
Master Ruan,

852
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,680
what mistake are you talking about?

853
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,820
I kissed her.

854
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,630
Oh no.

855
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,710
I'll never be able to clear my name.
