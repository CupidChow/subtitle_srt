[Her Fantastic Adventures]

3
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,420
My heart is sealed in the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword.

4
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,750
So every time the sword seeker touches me,

5
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,140
the power in my body

6
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,210
will resonate with it

7
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,820
and the lost emotions and desires

8
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,570
will return to my body little by little.

9
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:00,390
The Black Wood Human-shaped Sword belongs to the sword seeker.

10
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,650
I must return it to her.

11
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,370
Why did you

12
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,930
suddenly tell me this today?

13
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,090
I have a favor to ask of you.

14
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,270
Please go ahead.

15
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,889
If I can help, I'll do my best.

16
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,980
If you promise that the Duan family and Xiling can form an alliance

17
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,130
and work in unity,

18
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,490
then I'll draw the sword.

19
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,490
What do you mean?

20
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,370
The mark of the Star of Rebellion on Qing.

21
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,030
Four of its petals has already turned black.

22
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,160
If we don't save her,

23
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,490
she will die soon.

24
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:28,930
If I save her,

25
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,420
she'll be Duan family's enemy.

26
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,610
Your brother will not let Xiling go.

27
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,410
You're unmatched in this world.

28
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,560
With you around, my brother may not be able

29
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,960
to do anything to Xiling.

30
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,010
My heart

31
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,820
has been sealed in Black Wood Human-shaped Sword ages ago.

32
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,850
When Qing pulls out the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword,

33
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:47,810

34
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,690

Senior.

37
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,770
I was willful when I was young

38
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,350
and wanted to explore the Martial Arts World.

39
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,060
So I didn't take any responsibility for Xiling.

40
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,580
You've been working hard because of me.

41
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,650
All these years,

42
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,500
thank you for your hard work.

43
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,980
We are fellow brothers,

44
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,790
no need to be so courteous.

45
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,010
But since you're going down the mountain again.

46
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,250
I don't know when you'll be back.

47
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:20,870
Senior,

48
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,850
I'll leave Master to you.

49

Don't worry.

No, no.

How can I be the Grand Steward?

56
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,290
You are the Deputy Steward

57
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,220
while I'm the legitimate Steward.

58
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,579
These are the accounts of Xiling.

59
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,800

Open it and take a look.

67

I ground it with plaster.

68

I even lacquered a blackboard for you.

69
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,970
This way, you can write on the board

Yes.

You're an old immortal.

Despite your white hair,

I just stopped by to take a look.

Taking a look with baggage?

107
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,210
It's normal for girls to carry a bag when they go out.

There are always many things we need to pack.

No way.

112
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,220
Fine.

113
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,130
Since you're not running away from home,

Young Master Duan is here.

119

Why are you also here?

121
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,330
I invited him.

It's not that urgent.

127
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,650
Why don't we discuss it

128
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:17,730
and decide later.

129
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,210

This is too urgent.

133
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,260
I thought about it.

134
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,170
Actually,

135
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,780
I can find another Spiritual Treasure first.

137
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,930
So you already know everything.

138
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:32,860
I know nothing.

139
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,370
Do you think that

140
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,800
once the sword is pulled out,

141
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,050
I will die?

142
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,050
That's ridiculous.

143
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,090
I just feel everything's too rushed.

144
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,370
Then why did you assign your position

145
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,010
to Fu Rong and Lu Huahua?

146
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,260
Why did you steal the group picture

147
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:48,930
at the bathhouse?

148
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,610
Qing,

149
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,159
were you planning to leave Xiling alone?

150
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,630
Since we've made it clear,

151
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,460
let me be straight with you.

152
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,450
I heard you telling the Great Master that

153
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,890
if I draw the sword, you will die.

154
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:08,970
So I will never

155
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,700
and would rather die than draw the sword.

156
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,700
I won't sacrifice your life

157
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,450
to preserve mine.

158
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:14,820
Master Ruan,

159
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,410
there's no room for discussion.

160
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:18,850
Qiao.

161
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,290
If it's you,

162
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,140
maybe Predecessor Ruan won't need to die.

163
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,210
Me?

164
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,410
How can I do that?

165
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,770
It's not impossible.

166
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,730
You're not only the sword seeker,

167
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:35,690
but also the Star of Rebellion who can gather the Four Treasures.

168
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:36,850
So?

169
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,860
The Duan family has been guarding against the Star of Rebellion for many years.

170
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,289
We know very well that there are many

171
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,570
unbelievable things regarding the Star of Rebellion.

172
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,530
One of them

173
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,370
is to turn fate around with the Four Treasures.

174
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,880
For Predecessor Ruan,

175
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,450
you may be the sword seeker who will cause his death.

176
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,820
But for the Four Treasures,

177
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,250
you are the Star of Rebellion that can use their powers.

178
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:57,800
Can...

179
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,010
Can you make it more straightforward?

180
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,640
Predecessor Ruan's heart

181
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,290
was sealed in the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword.

182
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,370
To keep him alive,

183
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,210
we need to break the seal first.

184
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,090
As the original owner of the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword,

185
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:12,950
you can help Predecessor Ruan to get his heart back.

186
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,130
The purpose is clear,

187
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,780
but the process is vague.

188
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:22,490
I...

189
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:24,690
You...

190
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,530
Are you lying to me?

191
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,650
Of course not.

192
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,020
Without enough certainty,

193
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,890
Master won't allow us to open the Jiuqing Secret Cave.

194
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,690
You must have guessed it before.

195
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,090
The reason Master didn't allow you to draw the sword

196
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,210
was because he didn't want me to die.

197
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:44,290
Qing.

198
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,420
You once said

199
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:49,940
if we don't give it a shot, we won't stand a chance at all.

200
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,490
I hope to give it a try

201
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,340
with this opportunity.

202
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,180
Can I really do it?

203
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,630
I'll do my best to help you.

204
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,850
So this is Jiuqing Secret Cave.

205
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,850
There was a restriction set around

206
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,130
the Jiuqing Secret Cave by the Grand Master.

207
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,370
Only the Great Master of the Xiling Sect can open it.

208
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,130
So it was under the lake.

209
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:51,090
No wonder we couldn't find it after searching for so long.

210
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,210
Great Master.

211
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,510
Don't worry.

212
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,230
I will bring Master Ruan

213
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,470
back safely.

214
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:13,170
Slowly.

215
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:22,290
This way.

216
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,050
Let's go.

217
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,750
What's all this?

218
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,680
So cool.

219
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,010
It's the first time I've seen

220
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,790
such a mythical scene after being in the ancient period for so long.

221
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,950
It's exactly like a television drama.

222
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,770
This is the Mythical Stone Formation invented by our Grand Master.

223
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,310
These stone monuments were made from meteorites.

224
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,390
It's very rigid.

225
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,230
Grand Master is highly skilled.

226
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,630
The carvings on the stone

227
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,730
is the Flowing Water Sword technique.

228
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:20,090
The founder of Xiling Sect deserves his reputation.

229
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,150
I once entered the Jiuqing Secret Cave,

230
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,480
but Master took me away.

231
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:28,110
The Mythical Stone Formation had no abnormal movement then.

232
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,060
But I know

233
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,630
there must be something strange about it.

234
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,630
We should be careful.

235
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,460
Qing.

236
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,300
I'll go first.

237
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,670
Be careful, Master Ruan.

238
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,420
There's indeed a trap.

239
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,590
How do we get across?

240
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,900
Don't you know how to fly through the air?

241
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,600
We can't.

242
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,770
There are no footholds in the air.

243
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,730
And it's too far away.

244
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,610
And we can't touch these mythical stones.

245
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,730
Looks like we must pass this test.

246
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:37,000
Since Great Master Zhang took you through the Mythical Stone Formation,

247
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,060
it means there must be a way to pass it.

248
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,910
We must find a solution.

249
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,800
This place is underground.

250
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:47,970
Why is there light?

251
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:51,970
That's right.

252
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,940
The Jiuqing Secret Cave is underground.

253
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,340
Logically, there won't be any light spots.

254
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,880
This might be a hint to pass the test.

255
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,250
Maybe we can try stepping on these light spots.

256
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,150
It's worth a try.

257
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:06,830
Predecessor Ruan.

258
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,250
I'll go first this time.

259
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,370
Be careful.

260
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,740
You guessed right.

261
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:42,290
Qing.

262
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,730
You go in the middle.

263
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,650
Duan Yu and I will protect you.

264
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,480
Be careful.

265
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:15,780
Are you alright?

266
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,350
Qiao.

267
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,140
Come on.

268
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,120
Don't be afraid.

269
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,110
I'm here.

270
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:25,890
Qiao.

271
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:26,990
You can do it.

272
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:51,690
Master Ruan,

273
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,380
the Flowing Water Sword technique.

274
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,430
Master Ruan, the Flowing Water Sword technique!

275
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:02,820
Let's go.

276
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,870
It was so dangerous just now.

277
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,860
Thank you for reminding us.

278
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,030
There are traps in the Mythical Stone Formation.

279
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:21,730
This way.

280
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,260
Grand Master must have set up this Formation

281
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,620
to let the disciples

282
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,270
to master the Flowing Water Sword technique.

283
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,430
Slow down.

284
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,340
This...

285
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:55,500
Isn't this the sword used for our Sword Roast Whole Lamb?

286
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,450
Yes.

287
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,140
It's Grand Master.

288
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,990
He looks exactly like the portrait.

289
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,200
Grand Master passed away

290
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,920
and became a Sword Spirit to protect the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword.

291
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,650
Grand Master is highly skilled.

292
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:16,980
You are no match for him.

293
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,530
I'll handle it later.

294
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,050
Draw the sword as soon as possible.

295
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:20,490
Okay.

296
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:21,950
Predecessor Ruan.

297
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,980
Be careful.

298
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,650
Don't worry.

299
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,730
My heart is in the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword.

300
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,990
I'll not die by the hands of Grand Master.

301
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,860
Master Ruan, wait for me.

302
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,020
I'll return your heart to you soon.

303
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,370
Grand Master,

304
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,270
I, Ruan Siqiong,

305
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,860
am here to draw the sword.

306
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:05,610
Go draw the sword.

307
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,300
Master Ruan, take care.

308
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,460
Is everything okay?

309
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,550
We're running out of time.

310
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,880
Predecessor Ruan can't hold him for long.

311
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,810
What should I do?

312
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:29,980
Duan Yu.

313
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,980
Put your hand

314
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,810
on the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword.

315
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:33,730
Close your eyes

316
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,960
and feel its power.

317
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,570
Duan Yu.

318
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,090
What are you waiting for?

319
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,580
Master Ruan.

320
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,630
Why is this happening?

321
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,260
Master Ruan.

322
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,050
Why did you lie to me?

323
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:26,870
Qing.

324
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,300
I'm sorry.

325
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,050
Don't blame Duan Yu.

326
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,530
I asked Duan Yu to do this.

327
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:37,650
Master Ruan.

328
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,170
Don't die.

329
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,710
I'm not going home.

330
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,970
I don't want the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword anymore.

331
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,530
I'll return the sword to you.

332
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:47,920
I only want you.

333
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,510
Take good care of her for me.

334
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:01,610
I want her to live safely.

335
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,330
Go home.

336
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,350
I'm not going home.

337
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,890
Xiling is my home.

338
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:12,630
Master Ruan,

339
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,090
I beg you.

340
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,500
I beg you.

341
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,010
Please don't leave.

342
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,040
Don't cry.

343
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:24,550
Qing.

344
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,000
I hope you can be a

345
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,230
confident

346
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,780
and happy child.

347
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,030
In the next life...

348
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,010
In the next life,

349
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:45,060
I still want to eat your food.

350
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,860
Master Ruan.

351
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,740
Don't go.

352
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,120
Don't go!

353
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,010
Siqiong...

354
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,890
How did he leave?

355
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:10,770
Predecessor Ruan turned into dust.

356
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:14,490
He didn't even leave behind his body.

357
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:19,810
I'm incompetent.

358
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:22,570
I failed to find a perfect solution.

359
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,570
I don't blame you.

360
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,130
Just let Siqiong

361
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,970
end the ill-fated relationship

362
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:35,270
between the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword and Xiling.

363
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,830
No disciples will suffer anymore.

364
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,620
Actually,

365
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,580
there's a legend in Xiling.

366
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:48,760
Back then, Grand Master stabbed his heart with a sword.

367
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,410
After he died, he turned into a Sword Spirit

368
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:57,290
to protect the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword in the Jiuqing Secret Cave.

369
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,670
Give this sword to Qing.

370
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:06,010
This is Siqiong's wish after all.

371
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,390
[To Qing]

372
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:28,570
Qing.

373
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,690
When you read this letter,

374
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,700
I should have left you already.

375
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,560
Do you remember what you told me?

376
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,060
People die three times in their lives.

377
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,110
There are three deaths in a life.

378
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,230
The first time is when our heart stops.

379
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:44,540
The second time

380
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,560
is when everyone goes to his funeral

381
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,890
and remembers his life.

382
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,380
The third time

383
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,510
is when everyone who remembers him

384
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,390
forgets him.

385
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,070
This is when we are truly dead.

386
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,300
So don't be sad.

387
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,020
As long as you remember me,

388
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,300
I'll always be here.

389
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:00,570
Qing.

390
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:01,870
Meeting you

391
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:04,290
is the luckiest thing in my life.

392
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,340
Maybe fate is unfair

393
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,040
and won't let me accompany you to the end.

394
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:09,930
But if the Heavens

395
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:11,570
give me another chance,

396
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,610
I think I will make the same choice.

397
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:16,570

398
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,250
your arrival

399
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,130

401

You made me feel like living again.

402
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,340

403

404

She's not feeling well

451
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,820

What do you mean by probably?

562
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:46,640
He will pass by here.

563
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:47,850
Yes.

564
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:50,340
If you say so, it must be true.

565
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,870
I wonder if Duan Yu has found Gu Qingqiao.

566
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,500
Young Master Shaoyi,

567
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,510
do you miss him

568
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,180
or Miss Gu?

569
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,920
When I didn't know Wu,

570
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,730
I couldn't understand Duan Yu and Gu Qingqiao.

571
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:07,090
But now I understand them.

572
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,090
I feel sorry for them.

573
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:11,290
I want them to come back

574
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:12,820
but also don't.

575
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:15,250
What's the use of feeling sorry for them?

576
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,250
Anyway,

577
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,530
His Lordship won't let them be together.

578
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:20,740
You...

579
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:21,810
Shut up.

580
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:27,520
Xing Si, take a rest.

581
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,620
Find a carriage.

582
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:29,170
Okay.

583
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:35,050
Qiao, here.

584
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:41,850
How are you?

585
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:43,470
I'm fine.

586
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:44,920
You can take the carriage later.

587
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,840
It's okay.

588
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,540
Our priority is to go to the Fire Crane Tribe first.

589
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,090
Listen to me. Don't act tough.

590
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:50,720
All right.

591
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,800
It's more important to find the Meridian Gate.

592
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:11,210
Did Great Master say

593
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,210
how to awaken

594
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,370
the Sword Spirit of Black Wood Human-shaped Sword?

595
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:15,370
I asked him before

596
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,050
and I found that Great Master Zhang

597
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,310
also doesn't know how.

598
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,880
Qiao, what are you doing?

599
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,260
I once read in a novel

600
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,970
that a Spiritual Treasure can be awakened with blood.

601
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:40,170
I want to try.

602
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,830
Why are you messing around again?

603
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:46,980
I'm fine.

604
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:48,330
It's just a scratch.

605
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:53,490
You...

606
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:55,730
still keep it?

607
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,700
I always carry it with me.

608
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,040
You told me

609
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,620
putting the ring on the ring finger

610
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:10,130
means that two people's hearts are connected.

611
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,139
That was a long time ago.

612
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,840
I thought I made myself clear.

613
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:40,370
Whether we can gather the Four Treasures or not,

614
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,100
we will go on our separate ways.

615
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,500
I know.

616
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:46,330
We'll part ways

617
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:52,310
and be distanced from each other.

618
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,560
We are like people from two worlds.

619
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:00,970
The fish in the water

620
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,050
and birds in the sky

621
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:05,180
cannot be together.

622
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,290
For us,

623
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:15,540
the best way to say goodbye is to smile.

624
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:19,430
I couldn't do that in Changqing.

625
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,640
This time, I hope we can bid

626
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:26,940
a nonchalant farewell when the gate of time and space opens.

627
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:29,290
Okay.

628
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:31,090
I promise you.

629
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:33,020
When that day comes,

630
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:36,460
I will send you off with a smile.

631
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,110
Deal.

632
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,730
Deal.

633
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:52,030
I'm starving.

634
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,700
[Posthouse]

635
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:55,280
[Posthouse]

636
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,050
Ruoyi.

637
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:58,850
Why hasn't the person who's gone hunting come back yet?

638
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,420
He's been gone for a while.

639
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,530
He should be back soon.

640
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:03,060
When he brings back the pheasant,

641
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,090
I’ll roast it.

642
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:06,490
I really miss Miss Gu’s barbecue.

643
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,900
Do you think you are the only one who misses it?

644
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,450
I want to eat it too.

645
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:16,260
Uncle.

646
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:16,820
My uncle.

647
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,770
Young Master.

648
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:19,690
Shaoyi.

649
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,950
How did you know I would pass by here?

650
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,540
I've been out for days.

651
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:25,460
I've been staying at this posthouse every day

652
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,990
to wait for you to come back.

653
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,520
You were in a hurry to meet Wu, weren't you?

654
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,260
Yes, I even prepared a gift for her.

655
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:35,030
You didn't even attempt to hide it.

656
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,310
It's true that I like her.

657
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,580
What's there to hide?

658
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,100
[Posthouse]

659
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:41,850
Shaoyi.

660
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,730
We were just thinking about your barbecue

661
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:45,660
and you arrived.

662
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,570
I'll cook for you later.

663
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:48,630
Shaoyi,

664
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:51,410
you said you saw the Four Treasures before.

665
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:52,830
What do they look like?

666
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,490
It's a necklace.

667
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:57,060
And there's a portrait inside.

668
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,110
It looks exactly like you.

669
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,400
It's like your soul was sealed

670
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:02,490
in the necklace.

671
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,220
Yes.

672
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:04,570
Uncle said

673
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:07,920
you look exactly like the Priestess of the Fire Crane Tribe.

674
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:08,970
Do you know?

675
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,580
My uncle went through a lot

676
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,970
to get this necklace.

677
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:16,670
It's a bit too much.

678
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,140
A portrait.

679
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,890
A portrait?

680
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,460
Do you mean a photo?

681
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,020
Photo?

682
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,120
What is that?

683
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:28,990
You place a camera

684
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,360
in front of your face and press the button

685
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:32,570
so you can record

686
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:35,430
your facial expression, clothing and background.

687
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:41,330
It's something that exists in our world.

688
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,850
Who is he?

689
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:02,810
A guest from afar.

690
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:03,690
You...

691
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:06,080
Why did you come to the Fire Crane Tribe?

692
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,710
I'm here to look for someone.

693
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,660
Who are you looking for?

694
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,390
Duan Yu.

695
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,290
Do you really know me?

696
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,720
If Duan Yu is the Mr Duan you mentioned,

697
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,850
then I know him.

698
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:19,350
Young Master Duan helped the Fire Crane Tribe.

699
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:21,210
You're Young Master Duan's friend.

700
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:23,890
Of course you're a friend of the Fire Crane Tribe.

701
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,750
Duan Yu and I are not only friends,

702
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,040
but also sworn friends.

703
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,680
That's great.

704
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,000
The Fire Crane Tribe

705
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:35,390
will definitely treat you well.

706
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,380
What a pity.

707
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,380
If you really came to see Mr. Duan,

708
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,670
he left ages ago.

709
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,180
Where did he go?

710
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,630
He went to see his fiancee.

711
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,840
Fiancée?

712
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,980
Honored guest.

713
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,230
If you want to see Young Master Duan,

714
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,750
you can wait here.

715
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,470
Young Master Duan said

716
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,100
he would come back.

717
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,620
Why would Duan Yu come back?

718
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,270
Because of his fiancee.

719
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,390
He said his fiancee

720
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,850
looks exactly like the portrait of the Goddess

721
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:02,040
in our holy relic.

722
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:03,160
Wu.

723
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:07,110
It does sound a bit magical.

724
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:10,550
May I have a chance to see it?

725
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:13,130
The holy relic is the treasure of our clan.

726
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:15,060
It can't be shown so easily.

727
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,520
Please forgive me.

728
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,220
Then how did Duan Yu see it?

729
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,440
He's different.

730
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,610
He risked his life

731
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,080
to get rid of the threat of the Moon Wolf Tribe.

732
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,940
He's a true warrior.

733
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,470
I see.

734
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:32,780
Looks like I came at the right time.

735
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:36,370
Sir, you mean...

736
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:43,050
I'll take...

737
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,450
your holy relic.
