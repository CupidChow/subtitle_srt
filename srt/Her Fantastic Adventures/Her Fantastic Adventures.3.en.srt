With such lousy skills, you dare to stop me?

00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,180
They're just too polite to hit you.

00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,470
Get up.

00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,430
Young Master, we've added more guards at the villa

8
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,640
to prevent Young Master Shaoyi from running away.

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,030
Send Shaoyi to Jizhou Academy.

Okay.

Bring Miss Gu here.

12
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,310
I have a tailor coming to take her measurements and make some clothes.

13
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,110
Young Master,

14
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,910
you're not really planning to propose to Miss Gu, are you?

15
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,430
Proposing was your idea, not mine.

16
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,980
Young Master, don't take this the wrong way,

17
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,280
but you and Miss Gu

18
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,550
aren't a good match.

19
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:31,120
Whether we're suitable or not, I have my own judgment.

20
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,760
Why are you always staring at me?

21
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,360
Do I look like a plate of food?

You've grown up and look just like your mother.

What are you two whispering about?

37
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,350
Young Master Duan invited you to the Duan Residence.

38
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,840
Qiao, can't you be a bit more reserved?

39
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,790
Why did he invite me to the Duan Residence?

40
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,560
He said he got a tailor to make you some clothes.

41
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,430
Why can't the clothes be made at home?

42
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,560
Maybe he wants you to choose the fabric yourself.

43
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,320
Well,

44
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,990
they didn't clarify

45
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,000
whether the proposal is happening or not.

46
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,150
Then it's happening.

About you and Young Master Duan,

50
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,560
It seems like the Gu family is taking the initiative.

51
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,190
In reality, it's indeed you.

52
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,450
Exactly, exactly.

53
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,870
But think about this.

54
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,110
After that big incident,

55
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,060
almost everyone in Changqing

56
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,380
knows about it.

57
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,470
Few young masters dare to propose to you.

58
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,280
Now, you and Young Master Duan

59
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,670
finally have a chance.

60
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,260
You must hold on to it.

61
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,520
But it's not good for me to be too forward.

62
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,370
There's nothing wrong with it.

63
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,850
I'm not old-fashioned.

64
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,240
You getting married is what matters most.

65
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,640
I'll follow your advice.

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Going to their house to make clothes

67
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,880
is the best opportunity.

68
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,670
Turn this fake proposal into a real one.

69
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,790
Just consider it a way

70
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,430
to settle all this love and resentment.

71
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,920
What did you say?

72
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,310
Nothing.

73
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,260
It means a wish.

74
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,400
Okay.

75
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,240

Take your time eating.

77
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,630
I'll go confirm

For poor Gu Qingqiao and her father,

I'll thicken my skin.

81
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,710
In the kitchen, he fell for the young lady at first sight

82
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,540
and couldn't help

83
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,590
but hold her in his arms.

84
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,720
The loyal guard witnessed this moment,

85
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,840
realizing

86
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,400
that his master had met his destiny.

87
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,810
Although it was their first meeting,

88
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,760
Young Master Leng decided to marry the young lady

89
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,790
and brought her to his residence three days later

90
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,550
to continue their romance.

91
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,500
I really

92
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,590
am a genius.

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,910
I made it for you

94
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,390
knowing you were coming.

95
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,280
I can't come empty-handed, right?

96
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,420
Is this for me?

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,330
Who else could it be for?

98
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,200
Where did you get it?

99
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,600
Knowing you love novels,

100
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,270
I spent a lot to buy it for you.

101
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,730
Shaoyi, you're so nice.

102
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,040
If you become my aunt,

103
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,510
I'll buy you novels every day.

104
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,800
Are you that eager?

105
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,120
Of course.

106
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,880
Or are you eager for me to make you snacks every day?

107
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,600
These snacks are really good.

108
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,800
It's a pity

109
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,360
I won't have them for a while.

110
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,360
Why not?

111
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,000
I can make snacks and have Yuanhua deliver them

112
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,150
to the Duan Residence every day.

113
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,880
I'll be leaving Changqing for a while.

114
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,159
Where are you going?

115
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,409
To find your father?

116
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,030
Duan Yu insists on sending me to Jizhou Academy.

117
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,420
Jizhou Academy?

118
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,530
Then when will you be back?

119
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,320
I don't know.

120
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,320
Maybe a year, maybe two.

121
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,690
After you leave,

122
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,430
I'll have one less friend to play with.

123
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,360
Don't worry.

124
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,000

So, what brings you here?

132
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:29,800
Well,

133
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,270
can I borrow your cosmetics?

134
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,400
What are you planning to do?

135
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,200
You'll find out soon enough.

136

Why do you like Duan Yu?

137
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,940
There must be a reason.

Would you go out looking like this?

Don't wipe it off.

Pack the snacks in the food box and send them to the Duan Residence.

Are they for Young Master Duan?

No.

that Young Master Shaoyi sent?

167

They tell about countless couples,

168

but not all have happy endings.

169
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,150
My Lady, you and Young Master Duan will definitely have a happy ending.

You should go looking pretty.

I just go for a natural look with a bit of lipstick.

Natural look?

This is the first time I've heard that.

183

How about this?

184
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,960
I'll get you a face veil.

Isn't it popular for ancient people to wear face veils?

Am I not pulling it off well?

190
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,030
Turn your faces away, everyone.

191
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,560
Turn your faces away.

192
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,960
Xing Si.

193
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,440
Tu Jia.

194
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,200
Do I need to turn away too?

195
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,230
I was just joking with you guys.

196
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,750
I did put on makeup seriously,

197
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,830
but I only want you to see it.

198
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,830
You look great with or without makeup.

199
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,700
You're better off without the veil.

200
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,260
Young Master Duan, you are so sweet.

201
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,480
Miss Gu, please.

202
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,900
What's with the eagle?

203
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,400
It's our family emblem.

204
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,390
I don't understand.

205
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:42,350
Why do you have so many weapons here?

206
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,790
Our family is famous for the Qilin Bow.

207
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,520
15 years ago,

208
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,560
my father, Duan Sheng, led our men to attack the Sacred Blood Sect

209
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,270
but was severely injured by their leader.

210
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,840
My brother, Duan Yan,

211
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,150
was also injured protecting me.

212
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,310
Soon after,

213
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,920
my father passed away.

214
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,650
And my brother took over as head of the family.

215
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,040
After years of hard work, we restored

216
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,910
the Duan family's former glory.

217
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,950
These weapons are just

218
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,000
some of the spoils of war from our family's victories.

219
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,110
But this is just

220
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,780
the tip of the iceberg.

221
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,980
You're a martial arts hero.

222
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,040
Why are you involved in the Changqing Chamber of Commerce?

223
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,200
The Duan family has many businesses;

224
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,730
someone has to manage them.

225
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,910
You can shoot arrows;

226
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,230
I can throw discus.

227
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,420
Doesn't that make us a perfect match?

228
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,160
Discus?

229
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,690
What weapon is that?

230
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,040
It's not a weapon,

231
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,360
more like a piece of sports equipment.

232
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,040
Forgive my ignorance.

233
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,760
Our Duan family is familiar with seventy-two types of weapons,

234
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,790
but I've never heard of a discus.

235
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,110
Which school or sect does it belong to?

236
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,310
It's probably from sports schools

237
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,680
or sports teams.

238
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,230
Stop talking about my skills.

239
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,230
Can I ask you a small favor?

240
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:05,990
Miss Gu,

241
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
feel free to ask.

242
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,120
I want to see you

243
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,570
shoot an arrow.

244
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,270
So handsome.

245
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,840
Miss Gu, I haven't even shot the arrow yet.

246
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,480
I was talking about your perfect profile,

247
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,870
strong arms, and sexy waistline.

248
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,510
Amazing!

249
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,790
Right on target.

250
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,080
You should definitely join the national team!

251
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,390
The Sacred Blood Sect leader, Ying Tian,

252
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,760
was killed by this Qilin Bow.

253
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,840
Uncle Duan was still so strong despite his age!

254
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,000
My father was only thirty then.

255
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,840
Only thirty?

256
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,040
My mistake.

257
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:16,920
What's this

258
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,880
weird-looking weapon?

259
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,420
Is it used by the Axe Gang?

260
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,350
This is the Sacred Blood Sect's Yuanyang Axes

261
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,240
from the Xuanwu Hall.

262
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,680
How do you use it?

263
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,960
Like an axe?

264
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,240
This is the Duan family shrine.

265
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,080
During festivals and happy events,

266
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,480
I come here to pay respects to my ancestors.

267
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,230
So,

268
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,080
bringing me here is like

269
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,440
introducing me to your parents?

270
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,440
You're That's one way to put it...

271
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,760
Uncle Duan, although we've never met,

272
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,280
it's a pleasure to know you.

273
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,710
Let me kowtow to you.

274
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,190
I hope you bless me and Duan Yu

275
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,960
with a long and happy life together.

276
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,070
Auntie Duan, don't worry.

277
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,200
I'll take good care of Duan Yu.

278
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,840
Brother Duan,

279
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,510
may your spirit

280
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,270
bless us with children soon.

281
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,710
Miss Gu, my brother is still alive,

282
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,750
and isn't it a bit early to talk about having children?

283
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:48,350
Can't you pretend you didn't hear that?

284
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,820
And

285
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,790
can you not speak when I'm making a wish?

286
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,450
It won't come true otherwise.

287
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:54,920
Miss Gu,

288
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:58,050
aren't you curious about the Sacred Blood Sect?

289
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,970
Why should I be curious?

290
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,430
Nothing.

291
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,650
Just asking.

292
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,070
But there's something I want to confirm with you.

293
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,030
Miss Gu, go ahead.

294
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:17,550
Have you never seen me before?

295
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,640
Meeting at the Gu Residence was the first time.

296
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,360
Then why did you propose to me

297
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,240
at our first meeting?

298
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,950
Xing Si mentioned it.

299
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,670
Who said it doesn't matter.

300
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,870
Can't you consider it

301
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,390
as a unique bond between us?

302
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,500
Why are you smiling? Did I say something wrong?

303
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,910
It really is a unique bond.

304
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:50,480
Of course, because I'm a unique girl.

305
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,620
You really are unique.

306
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,760
Duan Yu.

307
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,080
This is the nicest thing anyone's said to me

308
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,790
since I came to Changqing.

309
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,790
You're really slick and sly.

310
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,320
Slick and sly?

311
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,490
Slick and sly...

312
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,520
It means you are very smart

313
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,430
and tactful.

314
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,630
Miss Gu,

315
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,890
you are also a very slick and sly girl.

316
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,960
Duan Yu,

317
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,620
thank you for having me at your house.

318
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,760
A heart for you.

319
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:36,640
[Duan Yu, thank you for having me at your house. A heart for you]

320
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,590
Is that true?

321
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,230
Prepare a carriage to Duan Residence.

323
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,200
Miss Du, Young Master is not home.

324
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,040
Impossible. My miss wants to see Young Master Duan.

325

-Miss. Miss.
-Go away!

326

My young master is really not home.

327
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,990
You grew up in Changqing, right?

328
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,720
I guess so.

329
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,630
I had a serious illness earlier

330
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,250
and don't remember much from before.

331
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,150
What illness?

332
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,490
Have you recovered?

333
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,079
I don't know what it was,

334
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,190
but Doctor Dong said

335
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,400
I'm fine now.

336
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,079
That's good to hear.

what do you like to do besides work?

339
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,600
I like playing chess with myself.

Playing chess?

341
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:35,270
Anything else?

342

Practicing martial arts and reading.

343
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,520
Practicing martial arts and reading all day must be boring.

344

Don't you like traveling?

345

Like wandering the Martial Arts World with a sword?

346
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,250

376
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,450
If you're willing.

377
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,350
Why wouldn't I be?

378
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,430
Okay.

379
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,200
Wait,

380
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,710
isn't it said that

381
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,000
men shouldn't see a woman's feet before marriage?

382
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,600
Sorry,

383
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,590
that was inappropriate.

384
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,710
Inappropriate? Not at all.

385
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,670
I'm just ticklish.

386
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,320
I can change them myself.

387
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,080
Okay.

388
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,150
Sorry.

389
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,790
I'm being rude again.

390
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,030
Miss Gu has been frail since childhood.

391
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,760
Although she seems fine now,

392
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,630
she's actually weak.

393
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,320
I heard Miss Gu came back to life after dying.

394
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,320
Is that true?

395
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,350
Absolutely.

396
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,280
I personally checked her pulse both when she left and when she returned.

397
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,920
You can ask anyone at the Gu Residence.

398
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,240
How do you explain her coming back to life?

399
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,830
Have you met it before?

400
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,510
It's the first time I've encountered such a thing.

401
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:52,110
Not everyone gets this kind of luck.

402
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,440
She must have already crossed

403
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,000
the River Styx.

404
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:01,590
Maybe she came back because she couldn't leave her father behind.

405
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,720
Does she seem the same as before?

406
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,120
She looks the same,

407
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,640
but it seems she's forgotten many things.

408
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,960
Also, she talks strangely.

409
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,560
Could it have been a case of feigned death?

410
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,630
Impossible.

411
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,050
She hasn't been quite right mentally since she revived.

412
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,670
Master, you are here!

413
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,490
Business is good today.

414
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,670
Yes.

415
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,310
What is this?

416
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,910
Miss Gu designed a new menu,

417
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,960
and Chef Da taught us a few new dishes.

418
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,040
Business is looking good.

419
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,280
If the food festival goes well,

420
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,630
our Qingfeng Restaurant will be the top restaurant

421
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,510
in Changqing.

422
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:58,240
[Wine]

423
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,880
Top restaurant?

424
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,840
I doubt it.

425
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,720
Manager Yang,

426
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,880
what brings you to our Qingfeng Restaurant?

427
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,640
I heard you privately approached Chairman Duan

428
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,220
to host a food festival at Qingfeng Restaurant.

429
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,600
Such a good thing, and you didn't share it with us?

430
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,120
Once it's confirmed,

431
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,000
we will, of course, invite all the managers

432
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,240
to join us at Qingfeng Restaurant.

433
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,670
Thank you.

434
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:24,950
However, I also plan to suggest to Chairman Duan

435
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,510
to hold the food festival at my Chunfeng Restaurant.

436
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:30,470
Our Chunfeng Restaurant has been famous in Changqing for decades.

437
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:33,310
I'm sure the chairman and members won't oppose it,

438
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,430
right?

439
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,680
I'm afraid Chairman Duan

440
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,760
won't agree so easily.

441
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,790
Is that so?

442
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:41,720
Fine,

443
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,280
let's

444
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,360
wait and see.

445
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,070
Manager Yang,

446
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,280
I won't see you out then.

447
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:56,950
Miss Gu,

448
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,630
you fell into the water earlier.

449
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,710
Here, drink this medicine.

450
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,230
It will ward off the cold and warm you up.

451
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:05,080
I've asked the servants to prepare several doses.

452
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,340
Take them back to your residence and use them for a few days.

453
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,440
On that rainy day...

454
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,160
Thank you.

455
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,160
You're welcome.

456
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,120
Yes.

457
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,470
What's this about?

458
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,110
Didn't we agree to take your measurements for new clothes?

459
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,110
Now?

460
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,740
In front of so many people?

461
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,300
It's not appropriate.

462
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,810
Everyone, leave us.

463
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,070
Yes.

464
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,430
No need for the trouble.

465
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,990
I'll have Dongxi bring over a piece of clothing.

466
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,950
You can use it for the measurements.

467
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:45,590
Yes.

468
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,860
That will work too.

469
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,600
Braised pork?

470
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,500
Your cook can make braised pork?

471
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,000
Don't mention braised pork.

472
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Young Master had your braised pork

473
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,470
at your house

474
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,520
and had our cook try to replicate it,

475
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,400
but

476
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,240
he couldn't get it right.

477
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,480
Bring your cook over,

478
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,140
and I'll teach him.

479
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:07,910
No need.

480
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,710
I already dismissed him.

481
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:14,160
So you made the braised pork?

482
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,560
I made it.

483
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,950
Miss Gu, try it and see how it tastes.

484
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,210
It's delicious.

485
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,540
I'm so hungry I could start cursing.

486
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,160
Got it.

487
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,010
I'll have Da make braised pork for you right away.

488
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,880
Qiao,

489
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,790
it's better for young ladies to eat less braised pork.

490
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,720
I know, you're worried about my cholesterol.

491
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,760
Don't look at me like that.

492
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,820
Forget what I said.

493
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,670
Today I went to Qingfeng Restaurant

494
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,880
to get them ready for the food festival.

495
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,480
Looks like

496
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,240
I'll need to train them tomorrow.

497
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,030
Training? What's that?

498
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,960
You wouldn't understand even if I explained.

499
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,280
Anyway, before I get married,

500
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,240
I'll help you

501
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,850
get everything sorted out.

502
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,550
What if the food festival

503
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:24,130
isn't held at our Qingfeng Restaurant in the end?

504
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:26,360
Won't all our efforts be wasted?

505
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,230
Have you heard anything?

506
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,840
Today at Qingfeng Restaurant, I ran into Yang Chunfeng.

507
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,190
He said he wants Chairman Duan

508
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:36,510
to host the food festival at his Chunfeng Restaurant.

509
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,630
If

510
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,960
Chairman Duan agrees,

511
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,040
we'd be working for nothing.

512
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,240
Don't worry.

513
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,760
Duan Yu won't agree to Yang Chunfeng's proposal because of me.

514
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,000
Are you that sure?

515
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,600
Father, don't underestimate your daughter

516
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,120
and her confidence and charm.

517
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,240
Miss Dongxi said

518
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,200
Miss Gu was gravely ill and died,

519
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,840
but then revived in the mourning hall.

520
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,000
To verify this,

521
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,350
I specifically sought out Doctor Dong,

522
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:07,480
who has treated the Gu family for years.

523
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,390
He confirmed that

524
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:10,990
he'd been prescribing medicine for Miss Gu since childhood.

525
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:13,440
Miss Gu has been frail since childhood.

526
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,910
Although she seems fine now,

527
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,240
she's actually weak.

528
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,310
I heard Miss Gu came back to life after dying.

529
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,480
Is that true?

530
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,830
Absolutely.

531
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,670
I personally checked her pulse both when she left and when she returned.

532
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:27,200
You can ask anyone at the Gu Residence.

533
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,360
But he attributed her revival

534
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,020
to his superb medical skills.

535
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,940
Also, according to the Wuyi Guards,

536
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,270
Miss Gu showed no internal strength

537
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,960
during the incident,

538
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,640
indicating

539
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,390
she is an ordinary woman

540
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,900
uninterested in the various factions of Changqing

541
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,320
and unaware of the Sacred Blood Sect.

542
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,110
When I deliberately gave her the wrong information about the origin of the Yuanyang Axes,

543
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,550
You can shoot arrows,

544
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,540
You can shoot arrows,

545
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,120
and I can throw a discus.

546
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,760
Aren't we a perfect match?

547
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,470
Gosh, drawing a bow is really tough.

548
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,200
Why wouldn't I?

549
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,960
Young Master.

550
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,000
Are you suggesting that Gu Qingqiao is connected to the Sacred Blood Sect?

551
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,670
I suspect she might be the Star of Rebellion.

552
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,600
Prophesy has it that

553
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:15,390
the appearance of the Star of Rebellion would cause heavenly anomalies

554
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:17,750
and aid the resurgence of the Sacred Blood Sect,

555
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:20,030
leading to widespread devastation

556
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,960
and the downfall of the Duan family.

557
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,650
As a member of the Duan family,

558
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,750
I must take precautions.

559
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,680
Miss Gu took the first incense at Shangqing Temple,

560
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,520
and then there were celestial phenomena,

561
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,840
which made you suspicious.

562
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,860
I helped her change her shoes

563
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,430
to check if she had the mark on her foot.

564
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,700
Actually, I'm just ticklish.

565
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,280
I can change them myself.

566
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,280
Miss Gu

567
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,460
seems too scatterbrained

568
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,920
to be the Star of Rebellion.

569
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,650
It might just be a coincidence.

570
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:53,880
Or perhaps she's playing dumb

571
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,110
and is actually very slick and sly?

572
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:56,830
What?

573
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,920
It means that she's playing dumb

574
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,720
but actually being very clever.

575
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,270
You learned this from Miss Gu?

576
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:05,080
Yes.

577
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,960
Yes, but it feels quite satisfying to say.

578
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,480
Besides, I deliberately went into the wrong room

579
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,040
and placed letters about the Sacred Blood Sect

580
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,150
on the desk,\

581
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,000
but she didn't care.

582
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,900
Look, this is what she wrote:

583
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,370
[Duan Yu, thank you for having me at your house. A heart for you]

584
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,490
Her handwriting is so bad.

585
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:26,950
And this.

586
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,780
What is this monster holding?

587
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,670
Is this a weapon?

588
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,160
Or something else?

589
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,240
You're so ignorant.

590
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,510
It says "a heart".

591
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:37,200
[Duan Yu, thank you for having me at your house. A heart for you]

592
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,470
This is a Japanese weapon,

593
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:41,280
commonly known as shuriken.

594
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,190
A heart?

595
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,190
Is this a challenge letter?

596
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,630
And what about this heart?

597
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,530
[Duan Yu, thank you for having me at your house. A heart for you]

598
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,260
This red part won't be poisonous, right?

599
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,640
Even if it is,

600
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,320
it's fine.

601
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,390
Mom, I'm leaving.

602
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,240
Chunjiao, remember to go for your check-up in the afternoon.

603
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,350
Here, drink this fish soup. It's good for your bones.

604
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,030
I'm not drinking it. I'm sick of it.

605
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,500
Hurry up, it's for your calcium.

606
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,220
Drink it.

607
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,430
Drinking this early in the morning will make me vomit.

608
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,800
Then vomit and drink again.

609
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,680
Hurry up.

610
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,320
Are you really my mom?

611
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,640
You're a top-up gift.

612
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,110
Hurry up.

613
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,720
With the time you've wasted, you could've finished two bowls.

614
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,750
Two bowls?

615
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,560
Be good.

616
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,220
Okay?

617
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,850
You need to get your strength back, Chunjiao.

618
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:36,360
[Glory of Meat]

619
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,900
In your world,

620
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,040
all I do is train and eat.

621
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,350
There's a third thing:

622
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,520
win the championship.

623
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,320
Go for it.

624
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,610
Chunjiao! Chunjiao!

625
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,750
Pick up the phone.

626
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,520
Phone.

627
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,630
Phone.

628
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,530
I need to answer my mom's call.

629
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,470
My Lady.

630
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,100
My Lady, what's wrong?

631
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,440
I'm exhausted.

632
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,910
Did you have a nightmare again?

633
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,350
I'll get you some water.

634
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:14,990
You again. What do you want?

635
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:16,510
You were out the whole day.

636
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,150
Can't I come and see you?

637
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:20,320
I'm really tired today.

638
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,610
Please go back to your cellar.

639
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:23,430
You're really ungrateful.

640
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,720
After seeing Duan Yu, you lose your head

641
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,830
and your stance.

642
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,210
Say whatever you want.

643
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,240
My stance is firm.

644
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,280
Is it truly firm or just a show?

645
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,230
You're so annoying.

646
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,480
If you don't leave,

647
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,610
I'll call for help.

648
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,390
I was going to tell you

649
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,510
the whereabouts of the Four Treasures,

650
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,160
but I've decided not to.

651
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,050
Trying to deceive me again?

652
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,120
You said before

653
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,510
you didn't know where the Four Treasures are.

654
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,570
Couldn't it be that

655
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,030
I lied?

656
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,080
Lie to whomever you want.

657
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,280
If I don't sleep, I'll have dark circles.

658
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,600
Some people just can't tell

659
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,680
who's a friend and who's an enemy.

660
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:05,010
This is one of the Four Treasures?

661
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,430
Yes.

662
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,240
This is the Mantra Sect's sacred artifact,

663
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,800
the Nine-turn melodious bell.

664
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,390
This is just my electronic watch.

665
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,150
How did it become the Nine-turn melodious bell?

666
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,560
I have no reason

667
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,950
to joke or lie to you now.

668
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,750
I've never seen the Nine-turn melodious bell.

669
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,460
How would I know if it's fake?

670
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,670
This is the Nine-turn melodious bell from the Four Treasures.

671
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:29,760
The patterns on the Nine-turn melodious bell

672
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,080
change over time.

673
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,720
And if you touch here,

674
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:35,800
it speaks like a deity.

675
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,760
The current time

676
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,600
is 9:11 PM.

677
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,310
Only such an extraterrestrial object

678
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,390
could have such magical functions.

679
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,360
Look at its texture,

680
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,010
neither leather nor metal.

681
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,350
I know.

682
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,750
This is plastic.

683
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,720
Do you want it?

684
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,310
Yes.

685
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,350
I knew you wouldn't give it to me so easily.

686
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,470
Of course not.

687
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,860
Unless

688
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,630
you do something for me.

689
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,920
It's definitely nothing good.

690
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,890
Let me make it clear,

691
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,600
I won't do anything illegal.

692
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,040
The chairman has already decided to hold the festival at our place.

693
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,000
There's no need to discuss this further.

694
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,670
How can there be no need for discussion?

695
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:21,800
Why is that?

696
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,150
Tell me why.

697
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,560
We are serving meat dishes.

698
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,900
[Changqing Chamber of Commerce]

699
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,550
You're a vegetarian restaurant.

700
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,210
Why are you getting involved?

701
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:28,600
Miss Gu.

702
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,920
You want to see me?

703
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,910
Are you trying to catch the Mantra Sect disciple?

704
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,240
I can help you catch him.

705
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,820
Let's talk in private.

706
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,720
Catch the Mantra Sect disciple?

707
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,050
What do you mean by that?

708
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,300
It's very difficult to capture him.

709
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,120
Now, the whole city knows

710
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,670
the government is looking for the Right Guardian of the Mantra Sect.

711
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,920
If we spread the word

712
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,640
that the Right Guardian will

713
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,360
surrender to the government during the food festival,

714
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,800
both the Right Guardian

715
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,590
and Mantra Sect disciple

716
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:00,960
will be curious to see who is impersonating him.

717
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,060
You are smart.

718
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,680
Can it work?

719
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,710
It can work,

720
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:07,320
but I could also set the location at Chunfeng Restaurant.

721
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,270
No no no.

722
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,320
It must be at Qingfeng Restaurant,

723
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,110
because it's the perfect place.

724
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,720
Look, I've drawn it.

725
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,310
What is this?

726
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,940
This is Yong'an Street.

727
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,080
Can't you tell?

728
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,230
This is Qingfeng Restaurant.

729
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,430
This is the pawnshop.

730
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,110
This is Dye Street. And across is the rice store.

731
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,800
Isn't it all clear?

732
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,000
Yes.

733
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,230
Miss Gu, you should stick to talking.

734
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,720
Don't worry about the details.

735
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,520
This is just about the location.

736
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,630
I've thought it through.

737
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:05,110
The front of Qingfeng Restaurant is spacious and busy,

738
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:07,480
good for blending in plainclothes officers.

739
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,630
The alleyways at the back are narrow and winding,

740
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,320
perfect for ambushes and surrounding the place.

741
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,350
The rooftops in the area are uneven,

742
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,400
great for...

743
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:23,679
Come on.

744
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,760
Your drawing skills

745
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,840
are amazing!

746
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,730
Just a minor skill, not worth mentioning.

747
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:31,790
Please continue.

748
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,150
Where was I?

749
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,590
You were talking about observing discreetly.

750
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:38,639
That's right.

751
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,639
It's easy to observe discreetly.

752
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,920
My Qingfeng Restaurant's advantageous terrain for both offense and defense

753
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,070
is unmatched by Chunfeng Restaurant.

754
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,320
Aren't you afraid of leaking the plan?

755
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,320
How could that be?

756
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,840
This is our plan.

757
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,679
And you are someone who wants to propose to me.

758
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:58,070
Xing Si said it.

759
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,120
Can't you just agree?

760
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,380
Regarding the food festival,

761
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,280
I had many concerns when Manager Gu first brought it up,

762
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,680
thinking it was unwise to hold such an event

763
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,680
during the Mantra Sect's unrest.

764
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:14,110
That's because he is incompetent and inconsiderate.

765
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,250
If it were at my Chunfeng Restaurant,\

766
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,800
everything would be organized perfectly.

767
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,000
The organizer must prioritize the bigger picture,

768
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,060
ensuring the safety of all attendees

769
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,310
and assisting the government in capturing the Mantra Sect disciple.

770
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:28,160
Then the government officials should be fed and accommodated,

771
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,870
which will surely incur losses.

772
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:32,260
Gu Xingwu, the Vice President of Changqing Chamber of Commerce,

773
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,270
and all staff of Qingfeng Restaurant will fully cooperate.

774
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:34,990
Wait.

775
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,190
What if this important event fails?

776
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,480
Then, wouldn't you have to resign from the vice president position?

777
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,510
Deal.

778
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,880
Qiao, there's nothing else.

779
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,560
I'm just worried about you.

780
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,310
What if something goes wrong

781
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,120
with the food festival?

782
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:52,680
It's a small matter for me to lose face,

783
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:53,600
but what if it affects

784
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,470
our family's livelihood

785
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,400
or your future

786
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,720
marriage prospects?

787
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,670
It's not as serious as you think.

788
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,510
Involving the Mantra Sect is dangerous.

789
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,310
Don't worry so much.

790
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,590
I've discussed everything

791
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,150
with Young Master Duan;

792
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,010
there won't be any danger.

793
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,510
As the saying goes,

794
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:15,800
"There are always more solutions than problems."

795
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,830
We must overcome every hurdle.

796
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,280
Competitions are not just about strength

797
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,590
but also mental resilience.

798
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:27,880
Never get discouraged

799
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,470
before giving your best.

800
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:32,200
Believe in yourself,

801
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,790
and you'll succeed.

802
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:38,240
The heavens will not forsake the diligent.

803
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,230
Life is about

804
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:45,360
overcoming challenges one after another.

805
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:49,190
Even if I'm not around in the future,

806
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,680
don't give up easily.

807
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,790
Persist in your dreams;

808
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:02,760
they will reward your efforts.

809
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,400
Remember my words.

810
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,510
Dad.

811
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,440
Qiao, what's wrong?

812
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,230
Nothing.

813
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,750
I just thought of someone.

814
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,000
Who?

815
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,560
Who made my Qiao so sad?

816
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,550
Nothing, let's get back to business.

817
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:30,800
This is an opportunity

818
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,330
to make Qingfeng Restaurant famous in one go.

819
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,390
We must seize it.

820
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:39,230
The younger generation surpasses the old,

821
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,750
making us proud.

822
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,170
This is what they call "the waves behind drive the waves ahead."

823
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,350
Now I've grown up.

824
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,200
You've always made sacrifices for me,

825
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,750
and now it's my turn to protect you.

826
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,240
Give me five.

The food festival

846
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,440
The food festival is a major event that will establish Qingfeng Restaurant's supreme status.

847
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,370
Everyone needs to be at their best,

everyone must practice the recipes

of The Glory of Meat extensively、

853
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,840
to truly master them.

854
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,400
Can we prove

855
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,190
that we are the best chefs?

856
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,070
Yes!

857
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:04,360
Can we win over every diner?

858
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,440
We can, we can, we can!

859
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,520
Good.

860
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:09,920
Does anyone have any other questions?

861
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,040
I have a question.

862
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,870
Why is Da the head chef?

863
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:14,120
I don't accept this.

864
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,270
Da, do you have anything to say?

865
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,670
I... I...

866
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:22,160
See, he can't even speak clearly.

867
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,160
How can he command respect?

868
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,560
What does speaking have to do with cooking?

869
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,560
Da.

00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,430
not convinced?

874
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:02,200
A buffet requires separating cold dishes from hot ones

875
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:05,080
and listing desserts and beverages separately.

876
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,160
Understanding customers' needs

877
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,430
is essential for the action planning

878
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,750
[Boundless Carnivores]

879
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,050
My Lady, look.

880
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:13,680
Not bad.

881
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:14,910
That's exactly what I mean.

882
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:15,520
Hang it up.

883
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,550
Okay.

884
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,840
My Lady, pardon my ignorance,

885
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:22,030
but what is action planning?

886
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:24,560
It's the customers' movement trajectory.

887
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,990
Movement trajectory?

888
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:31,280
It's the path they take while eating and drinking.

889
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:33,920
Eating and drinking also have a route?

890
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,200
And during the food festival,

891
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,720
the buffet is capped at three tael per person per meal.

My Lady, will it work?

00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,030
We've spent 3,000 tael on preparations.

to catch the big fish.

903
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,830

to catch a rogue.
