this man is not that person.

40
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,230
I just want to help Gu Qingqiao fulfill her wish.

41
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,420
But why does this one

42
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,310

Don't bother to see me out.

I know you care about Duan Yu,

56
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,400

and my dignity.

72
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,740
I feel sorry for you.

73

No.

00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,720
It will demean me.

You know it will demean you, huh?

00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,480
You go to the Chamber of Commerce every day.

79

You can't just be emotionally involved.

83

You have to play tricks.

84
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,530
Tricks?

The E barn collapsed, too.

89
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,920
We just recruited workers to repair the A barn,

90
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,850
but now, the E barn has collapsed.

Misfortunes never come singly.

92

The persistent heavy rain

93
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,920
caused crop failure in Changqing.

94
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,670
If we can't collect the grain,

95
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,160
we'll be out of food.

96
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,040

the grain in several counties nearby

99
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,190

100
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,630
The grain price in the black market is high.

101
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,950
If it weren't for the granaries we built before,

102
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,480
Changqing would have already run out of food.

103
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,650
But so many granaries collapsed.

104
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,750
I don't know how long we can last.

105
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,540
I heard that Yuzhou has grains.

00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,740
Can we borrow some?

107
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,750
It's hard

108
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,650
to borrow grain at this crucial moment.

109
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,720
My Lady, please go back to your room.

Duan Yu is the chairman of the Changqing Chamber of Commerce.

113
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,170
He must be anxious.

114
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,680
How can I help him?

115
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,980
Why don’t we ask Young Master Shaoyi?

116
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,240
Duan Shaoyi is grounded to study.

117

He said

118
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,000
you could throw a note into the study backyard.

119
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,040
No need.

120
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,180
He can't come out.

121
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,750
But I can go find him.

122
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,840
Something happened in Yuzhou.

123
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,960
There is indeed grain in Yuzhou,

124
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,430
but the price is higher than the market price.

125
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,260
We don't have much food left.

126
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,010
We have to get it no matter how expensive it is.

127
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,010
But in this way,

128
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,560
the Chamber of Commerce will need a lot of funds.

Yes.

132
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,510
And, you called out the merchants to donate grain.

133
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,410
But some big merchants

134
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,740
just paid us lip service

135
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,090
for self-insurance.

136
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,750
Do you want to bring some Wuyi Guards to visit them?

137
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,170
Those who are willing to donate grain will be rewarded.

138
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,820
But it's reasonable that they refused to donate grain.

139
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,590

You'd better save the grain in case of emergency.

00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,130
be solved by having a bowl of braised pork.

193
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,020
If there is,

194
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,610
have two bowls will help.

195
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:52,910
What is this?

196
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,470
Don't you hate candy?

197
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,300
Eating sweets can relieve anxiety.

198
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,280
What's this?

199
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,820
This is a dragon.

200
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,620
Look at its horns.

201
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,760
Miss Gu,

202
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,460
thank you.

203
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,500
Duan Yu.

204
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,570
I want to ask you for a favor.

205
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,330
Miss Gu, just say it.

206
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,180
Can you call me Qiao?

207
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,170
I feel awkward

208
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,660
when you called me Miss Gu.

209
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:41,720
Qiao,

210
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:45,930
thank you.

211
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:55,670
Have some candies.

212
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,690
Okay.

213
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:17,830
Mom.

214
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,350
Yu,

215
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,310
you're already like your father.

216
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,420
Have a candy and reward yourself.

217
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,470
I don't want it.

218
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,820
I want to protect you.

219
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,470
Good boy.

220
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,690
I always make dragon-shaped candy for you.

221
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:38,240
The dragon represents you.

222
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,310
I hope

223
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:42,460
you can grow up healthily

224
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,630
to be the "dragon" in the world.

225
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,480
This is my first time to make it.

226
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,000
It's inevitably abstract.

227
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,460
But I did my best.

228
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,150
I know you are a "dragon".

229
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,980
Others only care about how high you fly,

230
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:04,380
but I hope you don't fly too hard.

231
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,230
What's up?

232
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,510
Don't you like it?

233
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:17,830
I know it's not as delicious as the candy made by Fengxiang Bakery.

234
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:18,620
I like it.

235
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,510
I like it.

236
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:40,450
♫In the bustling place, a brief look back♫

237
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,040
Is this also a dragon?

238
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:40,900
Well.

239
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,720
No,

240
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,430
the front of the dragon.

241
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:47,840
♫You raised your head, and the fireworks flashed across the night sky♫

242
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,570
This is a sheep.

243
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,520
Look, it's so vivid.

244
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,180
The horns of yours are divided.

245
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,000
♫The night breezes played music gently♫

246
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,430
But mine is not.

247
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,440
♫Even flying birds stopped♫

248
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,710
Because I'm Aries.

249
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,500
♫To review your gentleness♫

250
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,470
Aries?

251
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,380
So the dragon and the sheep

252
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,370
♫The biggest fear is that in my dream♫

253
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,360
can have fun together.

254
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:02,030
♫I can't see your smile♫

255
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,410
Do you like the candy I made?

256
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:06,570
♫Until the end♫

257
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,350
Qiao.

258
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,110
♫Love doesn't need to be put together♫

259
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,490
Thank you.

260
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,330
I like it.

261
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,650
♫Feel it with your heart♫

262
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,040
I like it very much.

263
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,110
Miss Du.

264
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,310
♫Whether it's autumn or winter, I've been missing you♫

265
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,180
We grew up together.

266
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:22,610
♫Even if time has made us turn grey♫

267
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,450
He's cold in nature

268
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,990
and treats all women the same.

269
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,850
I always thought

270
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,150
♫Meeting you is my only reason♫

271
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,230
even if he doesn't like me,

272
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:30,280
♫I persist in it for you in the crowd♫

273
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,720
among all women,

274
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,250
I must be the most different one for him.

275
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:39,350
♫No matter how long the journey is, we'll stay by each other's side♫

276
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,210
It turns out

277
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,560
I'm lying to myself.

278
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,540
Miss Du,

279
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,740
Young Master

280
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,970
loves you.

281
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,100
Didn't you see it? He doesn't.

282
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,180
No.

283
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,020
Miss Du.

284
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:49,940
Miss Du.

285
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,430
Shaoyi,

286
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,360
I'm here.

287
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,740
Ruoyun,

288
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,340
why are you looking for me in such a hurry?

289
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,910
Just ask Yuanhua to see me.

290
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,630
What's up?

291
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,780
I want to drink.

292
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,060
Drink?

293
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,630
I thought you didn't drink.

294
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,350
Others can drink.

295
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,710
Why can't I?

296
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,020
Drink with me.

297
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,470
Are you crazy?

298
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,340
Do you want to be beaten to death by your father

299
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,920
or do you want to see me being beaten to death by Duan Yu?

300
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,650
Even if we were beaten to death,

301
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,700
it's more comfortable than now.

302
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,150
What happened?

303
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,920
Don't scare me. Tell me.

304
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,830
See you at the pavilion tonight.

305
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:27,590
See you.

306
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:28,290
Well,

307
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,230
why did Young Master Shaoyi and Miss Du

308
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,510
come here?

309
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,320
They used to play here

310
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,670
when they were young.

311
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,110
Does Young Master Duan know this place, too?

312
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,800
Yes.

313
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,550
Damn it.

314
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:47,320
If Young Master Duan finds out we're here,

315
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,790
I'll be beaten to death by Xing Si.

316
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,260
Guard Xing knows this place, too.

317
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,530
Then why are you here?

318
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,810
I am doomed.

319
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,980
What are you afraid of?

320
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,460
Young Master Duan

321
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,410
always

322
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,110
stays with

323
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,310
Gu Qingqiao, that lunatic girl.

324
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,980
He won't care about us.

325
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,790
Look at this yard.

326
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:11,390
We were so happy here when we were kids.

327
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,450
You were happy to bully me.

328
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,750
If Duan Yu can never change like you,

329
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,130
it'll be nice.

330
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:29,830
Wait.

331
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,060
What did Duan Yu do to you?

332
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,970
I asked you many times, but you didn't tell me.

333
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,250
I saw him with Miss Gu today.

334
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,370
It's nothing.

335
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,800
They're often together.

336
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,040
Duan Yu falls in love with Miss Gu.

337
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,050
Impossible.

338
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,940
Duan Yu won't fall in love easily.

339
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,310
He doesn't even like you,

340
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,320
let alone that lunatic girl.

341
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,270
You all know

342
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,190
Duan Yu doesn't like me, right?

343
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,940
No.

344
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,750
I just

345
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,060
draw an analogy.

346
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,920
I hope you two can be together.

347
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:07,670
Forget it.

348
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,830
Let them be together.

349
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,590
I don't want to see them anymore.

350
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,030
No.

351
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,900
I can't let them be together.

352
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,150
What can you do?

353
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:20,810
I...

354
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,150
Dad.

355
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,730
The Chamber of Commerce suggested

356
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,440
not to raise the price of food.

357
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,470
To solve the food crisis,

358
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,660
besides suspending the buffet,

359
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,260
we have to think of other ways

360
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,310
to save food.

361
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,840
Qingfeng Restaurant's dishes are expensive.

362
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,570
Many customers come here for social activities.

363
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,910
Sometimes, they order more dishes than their capacity to eat

364
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,340
to show their generosity.

365
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,400
But the food disaster is serious now.

366
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,900
It's a sin to waste food for no reason.

367
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,530
You're right.

368
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,560
If the guests here

369
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,400
not only to fill their stomachs,

370
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,020
we need to think of

371
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,780
a way to show their generosity and avoid waste.

372
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:13,230
My Lady, what are the new dishes?

373
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,020
These are the French-style dishes we promote.

374
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,790
It's said to be the French emperor's way of eating.

375
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:22,030
Every dish is the essence

376
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:23,440
with exquisite decoration

377
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,280
and is about Feng Shui.

378
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:27,200
They are beautiful

379
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,440
and taste good.

380
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,110
And for

381
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,210
the sense of ritual,

382
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,120
we'll use individual serving.

383
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,490
Each dish will be served separately.

384
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,990
One dish is a one-bite portion.

385
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:37,690
My Lady.

386
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,730
Slow down.

387
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,460
Where is France?

388
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,880
And what does it have to do with Feng Shui?

389
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:44,980
And

390
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,530
what is the sense of ritual?

391
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,880
Just remember food culture.

392
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,570
We're not only providing delicious food,

393
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,470
but also a pleasant mood.

394
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,950
Be a feast to the eye.

395
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,480
Be a feast to the eye. I see.

396
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,990
Control the speed of serving the dishes.

397
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,590
Don't go all in.

398
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,670
Let the customers enjoy it slowly

399
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,600
to improve their happy feelings

400
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,340
and make them eat less.

401
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,070
I got it.

402
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,050
-Good day, Master. -Qiao.

403
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:15,580
Dad.

404
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,650
You are really my daughter.

405
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,500
A good businesswoman.

406
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,040
Yang Chunfeng

407
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,590
will never

408
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,570
think it out.

409
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,910
Refugees are everywhere.

410
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,930
Even ordinary people have little food to eat.

411
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,590
We should save grain as much as we can

412
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,740
and keep our business stable.

413
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,550
Yes.

414
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,680
Qingfeng Restaurant benefited from the people

415
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:43,710
and we should also share benefits to the people.

416
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,220
Dad,

417
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,220
you are so nice.

418
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,420
I know it.

419
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,110
Let's go.

420
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,300
What should we do?

421
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:12,450
Here.

422
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,860
Cheers.

423
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,950
Xing Si.

424
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,680
Come and drink with us.

425
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,250
-Come on.
- Duan Shaoyi!

426
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,910
Ruoyun never drinks.

427
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,120
What are you doing?

428
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,180
I...

429
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,110
Don't scold Shaoyi.

430
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,740
Did you scold Gu Qingqiao when

431
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,840
she drank with your guards.

432
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,440
I...

433
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,750
She came to me in a bad mood.

434
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,780
Don't tell Duan Yu.

435
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,530
Ruoyi.

436
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,400
Send Young Master Shaoyi back.

437
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,500
Go back now.

438
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,690
Pretend nothing has happened.

439
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,540
Yes.

440
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,360
Young Master Shaoyi, let's go.

441
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,870
Don't pull me.

442
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,380
Young Master Shaoyi.

443
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,030
Don't go.

444
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,830
Come here and drink with me.

445
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:06,670
Si.

446
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,670
Come and drink with me.

447
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,110
Be slow.

448
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:14,740
Let me do it.

449
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,120
Si,

450
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,270
you've been the kindest to me since I was young.

451
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,040
Listen, everyone.

452
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,330
[Qingfeng Restaurant]

453
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,470
The Chamber of Commerce purchased food, and Qingfeng Restaurant distributed porridge.

454
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:42,150
The people of Changqing are so lucky.

455
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,770
My Lady, the idea of distributing porridge is great.

456
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,510
God will bless you.

457
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,540
This is Master Gu's idea.

458
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,630
He is a good man.

459
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,390
God will bless him.

460
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,170
There is a grain shortage in Changqing.

461
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,300
It's a hard time for all of you.

462
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,870
Qingfeng Restaurant will overcome difficulties with you.

463
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:58,510
- Thank you.
- I'll give you more.

464
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,570
When the food in Yuzhou reaches here,

465
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,430
we'll be able to recover.

466
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,030
Master Gu is a kind man.

467
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,430
Thank you, Master Gu.

468
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,230
Thanks to Qingfeng Restaurant.

469
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:15,170
My Lady, Chunfeng Restaurant is going to distribute porridge, too.

470
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,840
Good.

471
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,450
Yuzhou has no grain.

472
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,720
I don't know what happened.

473
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,970
Our men arrived first,

474
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,600
and started negotiation without hesitation.

475
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,180
The deal was almost done,

476
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,070
but it was reported that the grain was sold.

477
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,910
Did His Majesty come to buy it?

478
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,550
How could this happen?

479
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,010
Find out who the buyer is

480
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,480
and how they defeated us.

481
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,240
Also,

482
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,550
if there's no rice,

483
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,700
just buy millet, corn, and other food.

484
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:42,220
We'll let the people through this crisis.

485
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:42,990
Okay.

486
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,560
The situation is getting tricky.

487
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:49,270
I'm afraid it's beyond the Chamber of Commerce's reach.

488
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,630
If the government comes to help,

489
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,290
there will be more solutions.

490
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:57,000
Back then, you were a young hero.

491
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:02,110
Everyone said that you're from the wrong pond.

492
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:07,810
I did what I could to help you manage the Chamber of Commerce.

493
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,300
You didn't disappoint me.

494
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,910
The Chamber of Commerce has grown,

495
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,900
and it's hard for me to see you.

496
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,340
I was right about you.

497
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,040
The Chamber of Commerce is busy.

498
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,850
Especially due to floods,

499
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,440
there is a shortage of food.

500
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,150
Is your brother still in seclusion?

501
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:23,790
Yes.

502
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,040
He will be out in less than a month.

503
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,510
Thank you for your concern.

504
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,610
If he comes back,

505
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,100
he will come to visit you as soon as possible.

506
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,550
How about the food in Changqing?

507
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,100
I've sent people to collect grain everywhere,

508
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,390
but I got nothing.

509
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,400
The Chamber of Commerce does not have much food left.

510
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,200
I'm afraid it's hard to support.

511
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,460
Please help us.

512
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,770
Food is our priority.

513
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,360
Grains are important to the livelihood of the people.

514
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:55,230
I dare to ask the court to transfer grain.

515
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,200
It’s a serious matter.

516
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,770
If anything goes wrong,

517
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:03,170
not only will I lose my job,

518
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,270
but more importantly, the people will have no food.

519
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,470
We need to make careful deliberations.

520
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,610
But it’s urgent.

521
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,290
I'm afraid we can't delay it.

522
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,220
I'm worried, too.

523
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,500
By the way,

524
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:21,430
Ruoyun also mentioned this.

525
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,550
Is Miss Du worried about the food?

526
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,950
Not for food.

527
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,780
She’s worried about you.

528
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,510
Thanks for her kindness.

529
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,970
I’m sorry.

530
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,710
My Lady.

531
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,390
Young Master Duan is here.

532
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,100
He asked Master to request a grain transfer.

533
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,410
What does it have to do with me?

534
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:51,890
And then?

535
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,820
Master said he had to make careful deliberations.

536
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,100
My father is so mean.

537
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,550
Duan Yu,

538
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,830
didn't you get any food from Yuzhou?

539
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,590
I'm afraid the food in Qingfeng Restaurant

540
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,020
can't hold on any longer.

541
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,200
My father and I want to close for a while

542
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,780
and give the food to more people in need.

543
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,910
It can't solve the fundamental problem.

544
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,740
I've asked Magistrate Du to apply for grain transfer.

545
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,730
I hope

546
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,890
we can remove the grain shortage.

547
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:25,160
Did he agree?

548
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:29,510
Mr. Du didn't give a positive answer.

549
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,690
Why don't we ask Ruoyun for help?

550
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:35,970
Let her beg her father.

551
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,630
No.

552
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,040
Ruoyun likes you.

553
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:42,590
If you ask her for help,

554
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:43,730
she will agree.

555
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,660
It's a big deal to distribute grain.

556
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,340
How can I cheat with love?

557
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,090
I'm not that despicable.

558
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,510
Despicable?

559
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,300
I've been thinking about helping you.

560
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,660
Do you think I'm despicable?

561
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,610
You are so ungrateful.

562
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,350
Ungrateful.

563
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,520
Fine, I'm ungrateful.

564
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:03,750
You can go.

565
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,960
Young Master.

566
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:24,120
[Commerce]

567

759
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:20,630
Yeah.

760
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,960
[Miao]

761
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,500
Right?

762
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,469
Yes.

763
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:28,659
What? Force the boss of the wineshop to donate grain by drinking?

764
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:29,500
Yes.

765
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,920
But no one believes she will win.

766
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:33,679
Everyone in Changqing is gambling about

767
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,210
how many jars she can drink.

768
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,159
I believe her.

769
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,120
Why?

770
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,610
She even won Duan Yu's heart.

771
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,179
She's powerful.

772
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,600
Buddy,

773
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,170
there's only one jar left.

774
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,620
Come on.

775
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:52,420
Sister, let's work hard together.

776
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,920
Duan Yu,

777
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:12,110
do you know the six-vein sword?

778
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,860
The six-vein sword?

779
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:21,070
It is to drink liquor from my mouth,

780
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,820
and to spray it

781
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,100
from my finger.

782
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,810
You drank too much.

783
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,360
Waiter, have some rice.

784
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:32,880
Are you hungry?

785
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,240
Have food to cure hangovers.

786
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,230
Don't hurt yourself.

787
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,470
I'm not eating.

788
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,760
Having food is boring.

789
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,760
I'll keep my stomach to drink.

790
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,350
Stop drinking.

791
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,290
Duan Yu,

792
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,790
your hands are so warm.

793
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,040
Drink, keep drinking.

794
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,430
Drink.

795
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,470
Stop drinking.

796
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,540
Drink.

797
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:11,820
Still drinking?

798
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:16,570
The grain shortage is very important.

799
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:18,690
I shouldn't be angry with them now.

800
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,090
I want to find my father.

801
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:28,810
I'm convinced.

802
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,820
Qiao.

803
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:39,670
The last bowl.

804
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,400
Call the doctor.

805
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:49,890
The medicine is here.

806
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:52,270
Here.

807
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:54,110
Drink it.

808
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,420
Still drinking?

809
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,070
It's medicine.

810
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:03,310
By the way,

811
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:06,090
did I drink the last bowl yesterday?

812
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,550
Oh no.

813
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,460
It's all in vain.

814
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:11,930
It’s all in vain.

815
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,030
My Lady, Mr. Miao donated food.

816
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:15,300
He donated a lot.

817
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:17,690
Great.

818
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,380
How do you know Mr. Miao has extra food?

819
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,110
I remembered it when I made you candy that day.

820
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,840
Grain is the ingredient to make candy and liquor.

821
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,280
But I remembered it too late.

822
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,250
Qiao,

823
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,740
don't drink anymore.

824
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,240
I used to be a good drinker.

825
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:40,200
I always drank high alcohol.

826
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,870
Why was I defeated by that?

827
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,980
Do you often drink high alcohol?

828
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,150
No.

829
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,450
I'm just kidding.

830
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,950
The grains from Yuzhou and other places

831
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:57,280
have been stored in the place you ordered.

832
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,110
From now on, the grain price of Changqing

833
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,960
will be decided by us.

834
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:05,820
Thanks for your help.

835
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,540
No need.

836
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,120
If I can

837
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,080
be the chairman of the Changqing Chamber of Commerce,

838
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,630
Changqing will be firmly

839
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,790
in your hands.

840
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:21,550
Take over Duan Yu and manage the Chamber of Commerce.

841
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,900
Drive Gu Xingwu away

842
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,760
and take over Qingfeng Restaurant.

843
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,120
Is this your plan?

844
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:28,650
I…

845
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,800
It's

846
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,710
not a bad thing to be ambitious.

847
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,120
Take your time.

848
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,530
Thank you, my lord.

849
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:38,750
See you.

850
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,010
See you.

851
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,300
Dad,

852
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,530
it's a serious crime for the government to purchase food secretly.

853
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:01,390
I did this for you.

854
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,940
I will give Duan Yu a chance.

855
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,130
As long as he agrees to this marriage,

856
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:09,950
he can be the chairman of the Changqing Chamber of Commerce.

857
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:11,120
Marriage?

858
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,070
I know you.

859
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,980
You've been clinging to Duan Yu since you were young.

860
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:18,780
I noticed that.

861
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,320
I have to take the risk.

862
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:25,600
Dad, can you not act on your own?

863
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,200
This is my own business.

864
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:29,240
Can we return the grain now?

865
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,350
Don't get involved in this mess.

866
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:33,560
If anything happens to you,

867
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,930
what should I do?

868
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:37,240
Silly girl.

869
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:40,740
How can I be in danger?

870
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:43,900
As long as they can't find the whereabouts of the grain,

871
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,620
they can be under my control.

872
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,850
It's just a matter of time.

873
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,270
When Duan Yu has nothing to do,

874
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,650
he will marry you obediently.

875
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,560
Dad.
