[Episode 1]

4
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,540
What is this?

5
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,130
It choked me.

6
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,160
My Lady.

7
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,270
What happened?

8
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,720
Why did they cry just now?

9
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,490
Why did they run away?

10
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,970
My phone.

11
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,130
Where is my phone?

12
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,820
Lend me your phone, please.

13
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,050
I want to call my mom.

14
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,020
Phone?

15
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,810
Don't you have a phone?

16
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,880
Why did you dress me up like this?

17
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,210
Where is the skirt I just bought?

18
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,030
My Lady,

19
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,490
please don't scare Dongxi.

20
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,570
Dongxi?

21
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:24,760
What is it?

22
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:25,810
Master,

23
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,510
I saw

24
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,290
Madam Zhang put Miss Gu in a gown.

25
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:28,890
She's alive?

26
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,260
That's impossible.

27
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,090
Nonsense!

28
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,800
Everything is possible.

29
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,680
Yes. You're right.

30
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,370
Who are you?

31
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,450
Qiao!

32
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,010
I'm your father.

33
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,820
Are you kidding?

34
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,970
You fraud.

35
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,130
Why do you pretend to be my dead father?

36
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,250
If you keep doing this,

37
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,150
I'll be mad.

38
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:24,990
Qiao,

39
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,950
I know you are filial.

40
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,460
You don't want to leave me.

41
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,290
I am

42
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,450
Gu Xingwu, your father.

43
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,060
Father?

44
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,170
Gu Xingwu?

45
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,280
Yes.

46
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,370
Gu Xingwu.

47
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:42,930
Your father.

48
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,490
Uncle,

49
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,530
please hold me.

50
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,460
Are you going back to your bedroom?

51
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,380
Bedroom?

52
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,330
Dongxi,

53
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,580
bring the mirror closer.

54
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:09,940
You...

55
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,140
Who are you?

56
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,290
Why are you so good-looking?

57
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,330
You are the prettiest.

58
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,410
Mirror, Mirror,

59
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,210
tell me who is the prettiest in the world.

60
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,800
Of course, it's you, My Lady.

61
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,460
Mirror said that.

62
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,210
You...

63
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,810
You said it.

64
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:45,770
This...

65
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,700
Is this a prank?

66
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,730
What is a prank?

67
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,070
It's a joke.

68
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,850
Wait, let me think about it.

69
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,710
My Lady, what are you looking for?

70
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,090
Cameras.

71
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,390
What's going on?

72
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,050
Master,

73
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,410
I saw Miss Gu die

74
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,370
and put on clothes for her.

75
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,050
I...

76
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:28,140
I'm sure she was dead at that time.

77
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:28,950
Dead?

78
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,500
Why did she come back to life?

79
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,140
Master, did she drink the Mengpo Soup?

80
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,250
You bastard!

81
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,600
You're the one who drank the Mengpo Soup.

82
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,690
-Master, have a seat.
-Have a seat.

83
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,260
Master, calm down.

84
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,900
It's a good thing that Miss Gu came back to life.

85
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:45,490
You,

86
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,130
invite some doctors over

87
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,490
to check her pulse.

88
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,460
Don't make any mistakes this time.

89
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,570
You and Dongxi,

90
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,409
take good care of my daughter.

91
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:56,090
Don't make any mistakes.

92
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:56,850
Okay.

93
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,530
Master, what about inviting a Taoist over?

94
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,370
Or a monk from Shangqing Temple?

95
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,260
Why?

96
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,490
At least they can get rid of the evil.

97
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,600
Get rid of the evil?

98
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,750
I think we should get rid of you.

99
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,060
Go. Get some doctors.

100
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,870
Who can tell me

101
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,810
why my daughter suddenly came back to life?

102
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,780
It's weird.

103
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,090
I couldn't feel Miss Gu's pulse.

104
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,950
That's why I said she was dead.

105
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,650
It was beyond expectation that she came back to life,

106
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,460
and now she is sober with a strong pulse.

107
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,250
-Yes.
-Maybe the medicine didn't work before.

108
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,370
I tried my best to save her.

109
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,450
I think

110
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,770
Miss Gu might have fallen into a fake death.

111
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,930
That's why we thought she was dead.

112
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,830
It's not a misunderstanding.

113
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,520
You should admit that it was a misdiagnosis.

114
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,540
-Yes.
-Enough.

115
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,940
Don't dwell on it.

116
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,210
Just tell me

117
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,690
what I should do as my daughter woke up.

118
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,540
Build up health.

119
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,330
-Take tonics.
-A lot of tonics.

120
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,500
This dress is cumbersome.

121
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,340
My Lady, you just recovered.

122
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,020
You can't make such a big move.

123
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,890
My Lady, don't take it off.

124
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,570
This headwear is too heavy.

125
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,940
What are these?

126
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,150
My Lady, you can't throw this away.

127
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,570
I don't want it.

128
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,090
Where is the police station?

129
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,900
I want to call the police.

130
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:24,730
My Lady.

131
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,030
My Lady.

132
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,010
My Lady! You can't go out!

133
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,200
I'm warning you.

134
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,640
Get out of my way!

135
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,419
You violated the criminal law.

136
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,260
Violated article...

137
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,809
-What is the criminal law?
-What is the criminal law?

138
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:37,610
Violate the article

139
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,539
against assaulting a girl in public.

140
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:40,539
Get out of my way. I want to go home.

141
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:43,250
My Lady! You can't go out!

142
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,720
My Lady, you can't go out!

143
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,490
You can't go out! My Lady.

144
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:48,680
-My Lady.
-You...

145
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,600
Don't force me to hit you.

146
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,030
Even if you do it together,

147
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,070
I can beat you all.

148
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,390
Get out of my way!

149
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,010
My Lady!

150
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:02,930
My Lady!

151
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,650
These extras acted well.

152
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,010
Is this a studio?

153
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,110
Studio?

154
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,460
This is Changqing Street in front of our mansion.

155
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,280
My Lady, please go back with me.

156
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,330
Otherwise, Master will worry about you.

157
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,250
My Lady. My Lady.

158
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,250
My Lady.

159
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,060
Could you not call me like this?

160
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:21,020
Tell me

161
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,410
who I am.

162
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,610
Where am I now?

163
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,740
And

164
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,650
who are you?

165
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:28,890
My Lady.

166
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,940
You're the daughter of Gu Xingwu,

167
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,250
the owner of Qingfeng Restaurant in Changqing.

168
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,130
I'm Dongxi, your maid.

169
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,250
Wait. Wait.

170
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,850
Master, Miss, maid and owner.

171
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,640
Oh my god.

172
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,410
Did I travel through time?

173
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,670
Then, where is my mom?

174
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,350
Wasn't she with me?

175
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,760
My Lady, let's go back.

176
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:52,570
No.

177
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,050
This must be a game.

178
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,750
I have to find the exit.

179
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,490
My Lady, which exit do you want to find?

180
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,380
The exit where I came from.

181
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,040
Wait, sir.

182
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,230
Wait, wait.

183
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,640
Don't you have any moral conscience?

184
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,160
It's not easy for me

185
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,720
to catch the bus in the rain.

186
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,230
Besides, I'm not late.

187
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,720
Can't you just let me pretend to run into you?

188
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,870
Who do you want to run into in the rain?

189
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,790
You didn't catch the bus, either?

190
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,910
It's raining.

191
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,750
We can only wait for the next bus.

192
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,060
How is your arm?

193
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,070
Just a minor injury.

194
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,210
I'll be fine in a few days.

195
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,310
A minor injury?

196
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,880
It's been almost a month since you applied the cast.

197
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,010
I'll be fine after the cast is removed.

198
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,180
Let's have a barbecue at our place later.

199
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,430
In the library, in the canteen,

200
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,000
and in the classroom.

201
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,760
I looked up at you

202
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,290
in every place you've ever been to.

203
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,050
We have read the same book

204
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,730
and sat in the same seat.

205
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,220
If we're meant to be,

206
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,770
I'm sure you'll see

207
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,940
the bookmark I left for you.

208
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,090
This is the sixth letter this month.

209
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,610
Can't those girls be more creative?

210
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:28,540
Why did they write love letters like ancient people?

It's innovative.

214
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,460
On a rainy day,

215
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,020
it stands out from those love letters.

[999 Cold Remedy Granules]

217
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,690
It's pretty impressive.

218
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:42,940
I bought it myself.

219
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,540
It's good to drink this after getting wet.

220
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,660
Didn't I bring you an umbrella?

221
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,900
Actually, I think a man should

222
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,470
find a girlfriend who understands you well.

223
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,380
It doesn't matter whether she's pretty.

224
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,370
What matters is if she can

225
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,810
take you as the core of her life.

226
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:01,710
She should be healthy

227
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,640
and doesn't cause trouble for you.

228

Who do you like this time?

229
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,120
What are you talking about, uncle?

230
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,240
I'm talking about your future wife.

231

Duan Shaoyi,

235
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,670
those who are too nosy will never grow tall.

236
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,870
What?

237
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,320
Not bad?

238
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,870
You mean, Chunjiao is a lovely girl?

you've gained weight.

242
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,720
Do you believe that it is for tickling?

243
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,810
So many tricks.

244
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,320
Rehabilitation may take you a long time.

245
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,590
No.

246

I can't miss the next match.

247
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,060
But your bones don't heal well.

248
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,430
Although this doesn't have any effect on your daily actions,

249
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,090
it will directly ruin your sports career

250
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,330
as an athlete of hurling events

251
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,190
if your arm doesn't recover well.

252
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,160
Dr. Ruan,

253
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,800
do you think

254
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,360
a surgery will help?

255
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,640
I'm not afraid of pain.

256
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,660
Even if you break my arm and then join it,

257
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,020
I can accept it.

258
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,650
No athlete can be the champion

259
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,620
all the time.

260
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,580
So what?

261
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,800
Are they going to die?

262
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,280
Many people can still do well in other fields

263
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,430
after retiring or changing careers.

264
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,060
I don't care about others.

265
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,900
My dad's only dream

266
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,690
is to see me stand on the podium

267
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,520
and listen to the national anthem.

268
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,200
Chunjiao, I understand that.

269
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,400
No, you don't.

270
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,720
This is my dad's only dream.

271
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,400
It used to be a dream.

272
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,930
Now, it's his last wish.

273
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,110
Dad,

I'm going to retire.

276
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,330
What about your dream?

277
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,480
What about my mom?

278
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,340
I'm scared.

279
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,880
Since I was young,

280
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,630
I've done nothing but throw.

281
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,590
Dad,

282
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,180
what should I do?

00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,560
-Chunjiao.
-Dr. Ruan.

What are you doing here?

285
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,650
What did you tell my mom?

286
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,960
Nothing.

Humph,

289
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,120
if I hadn't called your coach,

290
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,480
I wouldn't have known

291
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,040
you didn't get the place for the tournament.

292
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,760
Mom.

293
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,740
Stop it.

00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,600
From now on, resume training.

Auntie Qi,

297
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,340
Chunjiao has her own ideas.

298
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,270
Don't put too much pressure on her.

299
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,720
Dr. Ruan,

300
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,280
I didn't invite you here to be a lobbyist.

301
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,480
I want you to

302
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,910
give Chunjiao a health certificate

303
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,870
so that she can attend contests as soon as possible.

304
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,860
Mom, don't make it difficult for Dr. Ruan.

305

-Dr. Ruan.

Auntie Qi,

307

Chunjiao is right.

308
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,500
I can't issue a health certificate for her.

309
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,310

The golden time of athletes only lasts a few years.

Chunjiao can't waste her time.

315

No. No.

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,750
Gosh, I'm so tired.

379
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:45,820
My Lady,

380
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,160
what are you looking for

381
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,190
all day long?

382
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,560
My Lady, slow down.

383
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,960
Find the time tunnel.

384
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,630
What is a time tunnel?

385
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,590
Should we ask the servants to help?

386
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:01,020
I'm the only one who can find it.

387
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,720
Then, I will accompany you.

388
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,100
You're a good friend.

389
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,000
What?

390
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,890
It means sisters will help each other.

391
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,200
My Lady, I dare not be your sister.

392
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,480
You are the master, and I am a maid.

393
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,170
Dongxi,

394
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,320
don't regard yourself as a maid when there's just the two of us.

395
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,920
Just treat me as your family.

396
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,100
Yes, My Lady.

397
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,760
Do you have

398
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,280
beer, skewers, or barbecue here?

399
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,880
We have rice wine.

400
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:35,170
What are beer and barbecue?

401
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,720
Let's go to the kitchen.

402
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:47,180
Dongxi, have a drink.

403
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,110
No, thanks.

404
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,400
Don't be shy.

405
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,720
There's no outsider here.

406
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,250
It's boring to drink alone.

407
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,070
Yes, My Lady.

408
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,530
Awesome.

409
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,460
Be careful, My Lady.

410
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,890
Dongxi, you are a good learner.

411
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,970
The Gu Residence is so big.

412
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,640
But why is there no one in our yard?

413
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,820
You were in poor health before.

414
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,670
The doctor let you live in a quiet environment.

415
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,310
So, no one dared come in.

416
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,330
We didn't want to disturb your rest.

417
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,050
Now...

418
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,120
What happened now?

419
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,120
You woke up

420
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:30,920
and crawled out of the coffin.

421
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:35,100
And you're not very clear-headed yet.

422
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,250
So, they dare not come here.

423
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,190
It turns out that everyone treats me normally

424
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,350
because they think I'm a little silly.

425
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,430
Why aren't you afraid of me?

426
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,140
My Lady, you're a kind person.

427
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,710
It's God's blessing that you came back to life.

428
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,600
Being with someone like you,

429
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,260
I'm not afraid at all.

430
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,050
You are so sweet.

431
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,350
Cheers.

432
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:58,750
Okay.

433
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,520
My Lady!

434
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,990
Master fainted.

435
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,200
Why didn't you get a doctor?

436
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,840
Doctor, how is he?

437
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,700
He's ill

438
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,960
probably due to stress.

439
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,470
He has a deficiency of both qi and blood.

440
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,590
He will recover after a few days' rest.

441
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:23,510
I wished for the Bodhisattva's blessing on Qiao.

442
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,730
Now, the Bodhisattva has shown its presence.

443
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,120
I have to offer incense.

444
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,260
You should have a good rest now.

445
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,760
You'd better go to the temple days later.

446
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,040
It's okay.

447
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,040
I'll be back soon.

448
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,530
Where are you going to offer incense?

449
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,500
The Shangqing Temple.

450
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,840
I'll go then.

451
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,520
It helped me come back to life.

452
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,680
So, I have to offer incense myself.

453
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,380
My Lady, let's rest here tonight.

454
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,740
[Shangqing Inn]

455
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,070
There will be many visitors tomorrow as it's the first day of the month.

456
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,480
If you don't want to be the first one to offer incense,

457
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,160
we can go up the mountain later in the day tomorrow.

458
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,590
[Shangqing Inn]

459
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,960
Does the first incense really work?

460
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,910
Yes.

461
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,840
Every first day of the lunar month,

462
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,430
people come to Shangqing Temple to offer the first incense.

463
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,350
Then, we should offer the first incense

464
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,280
and pray for your Master's health.

465
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,980
And the thriving business of Qingfeng Restaurant.

466
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,240
Qingfeng Restaurant?

467
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,440
The Qingfeng Restaurant, owned by the Gu family,

468
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,520
is a famous restaurant in Changqing.

469
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,160
I'll take you there someday.

470
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,330
Wow, I'm a rich second generation.

471
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,540
A rich second generation?

472
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,200
Stop it.

473
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,160
Can't you let your sister sleep more?

474
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,740
My Lady, don't you want to offer the first incense?

475
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,340
It's already three o'clock.

476
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,070
We have to set off after getting you washed up.

477
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,560
Why are these things

478
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,760
so heavy?

479
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,630
The heavier, the richer.

480
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,680
You are

481
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,320
the most good-looking girl.

482
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,710
Of course, you need the most expensive jewelry.

483
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,790
These can let you catch others' eyes in the night.

484
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,450
Let me sleep a little longer.

485
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,480
Catch him. Don't let him escape.

486
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,040
Hurry!

487
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:13,300
Where is he?

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,560
Where is he?

489
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,820
Where is he?

490
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,230
Search every room.

491
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,390
Search every corner.

Yes.

495
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,800
What are you doing?

496
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,570

Otherwise, we won't be able to offer the first incense.

So handsome.

He didn't even say thank you.

00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,610
He even hit me with a tile.

506
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:01,080
I won't let him go if he doesn't apologize to me today.

507

Is it far?

-My Lady.
-I'm sorry.

535

-What are you doing?
-What a joke.

00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,170
Excuse me.

564
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,610
Young Master Shaoyi!

565
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:08,840
Come out!

566
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,290
-Who are you?
-Come out!

567
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,580
The Duan family gives Shangqing Temple

568
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,870
tens of thousands of taels of silver every year.

569
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,550
Why did you let someone else offer the first incense?

570
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,870
Amitabha.

571
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,840
Buddha helps the ones with destiny.

572
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,600
Please calm down.

573
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,730
[Zen]

574
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,120
Whoever's in there, listen to me.

575
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,170
I'll give you 100 taels of gold.

576
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,760
Come out if you know what's good for you.

577
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,160
I'll pay in cash.

578
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:37,670
Who?

579
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:38,930
Who did so?

580
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,580
How dare you attack me when I'm not paying attention?

581
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,080
Young Master Shaoyi!

582
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,480
-Who is it? Come out now!
-Stop shouting.

583
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,760
-Stop shouting.
-Let me see who you are.

584
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,110
He must be a master.

585
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:47,930
A master?

586
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:53,050
Si, you're injured.

587
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:56,050
He is a martial arts master.

588
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,110
Well...

589
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,920
[Draw Straws]

590
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,360
Bodhisattva,

591
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,510
please give me a good fortune.

592
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,000
[I'll do whatever you ask]

593
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:31,530
[I'll do whatever you ask]

594
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,600
-The Heavenly Dog is eating the sun.
-Look.

595
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,530
The Heavenly Dog is eating the sun.

596
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,240
Kneel!

597
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,930
Kneel! Hurry!

598
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:05,530
Amitabha.

599
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,640
Mars entered the Girl Mansion.

600
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,460
Something will happen in Changqing.

601
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,380
Young Master Duan,

602
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,140
he is the Right Guardian of the Mantra Sect.

603
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,760
He betrayed the Mantra Sect

604
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,230
and was hunted by them.

605
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,670
The two sides caused chaos in this area.

606
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:24,840
Go and inform the magistrate.

607
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,400
If he comes to Changqing again,

608
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,060
the Duan family will not stand by and do nothing.

609
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,700
Amitabha.

610
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:35,130
[Kongkong]

611
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,890
My name is Kongkong.

612
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,030
Heavenly Dog eating the sun is an ominous sign.

613
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,710
Aren't you afraid?

614
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:48,200
Solar eclipse is a normal astronomy phenomenon.

615
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,670
Don't worry.

616
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,270
Master Kongkong,

617
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,890
there's nothing on the straw.

618
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,490
Why did you put it in the tube?

619
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:58,470
Buddha said that

620
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,850
there were three thousand worlds.

621
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:03,190
Only those who don't belong to this world

622
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,400
will get this blank draw.

623
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,470
So,

624
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,560
no one has ever drawn this one?

625
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:12,760
May I know if there is a flower mark

626
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,290
on your ankle?

627
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,450
How do you know that?

628
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:20,640
This mark represents that

629
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:23,720
you are a visitor from another world,

630
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:26,790
and also the Star of Rebellion of this world.

631
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,830
It's not strange for you to get this draw.

632
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,990
Master Kongkong,

633
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,040
you are really an immortal.

634
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:36,100
Can I ask you a question?

635
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,680
Please go ahead.

636
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,560
You're right.

637
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,530
I came from another world.

638
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,040
On the day I came,

639
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,000
I was hit by a plaque

640
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,200
on my head.

641
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,160
When I woke up, I was here.

642
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:58,320
My mom was with me when I was hit.

643
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,670
Did she get hurt?

644
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,880
She must be worried as I disappeared.

645
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,440
You're the Star of Rebellion.

646
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,330
It's your destiny.

647
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,710
You and your family have a predestined relationship.

648
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:12,210
They are fine now.

649
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,160
Just like your family here,

650
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,790
they are also your family.

651
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,470
I'm relieved, then.

652
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,730
But...

653
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,960
But I can't stay here forever.

654
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,920
My mom can't live without me.

655
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,560
Can I reject to be the Star of Rebellion?

656
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,240
Is there any way to send me back?

657
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,520
It's your fate,

658
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,610
which can't be changed by your willingness.

659
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:39,560
It is said that

660
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:43,410
the Star of Rebellion will connect the two worlds.

661
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,680
People from another world will appear in the world.

662
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,240
The scattered Four Treasures will be found.

663
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,470
Four Treasures?

664
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:52,960
What are they?

665
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,040
Nine-turn melodious bell.

666
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,880
Black Wood Human-shaped Sword.

667
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:59,220
Meridian Gate and Heavenly Pearl.

668
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:02,400
If you can gather the Four Treasures,

669
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,870
you can open the passageway between the worlds

670
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,800
and open the gate of time and space.

671
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,410
The gate of time and space?

672
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:13,080
Do you mean the time tunnel?

673
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:15,240
Can I go home if I open it?

674
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,530
Amitabha.

675
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,490
How can I find Four Treasures?

676
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:23,130
Love, hate, and severance.

677
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,790
Master Kongkong,

678
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,970
can you give me more specific instructions?

679
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,160
There will be nine revolutions of reincarnation in this life.

680
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,200
The spirit of black wood will overturn the sky and earth.

681
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,280
One's wishes made at the Meridian Gate will come true.

682
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:41,440
It's hard to make the sky clear when the sun is covered by clouds.

683
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,080
Does anyone else know that I'm the Star of Rebellion?

684
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,410
Can anyone help me find the Four Treasures?

685
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,100
[Kongkong]

686
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,730
Miss,

687
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:54,980
you can't disclose your identity as the Star of Rebellion.

688
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,830
Otherwise, you will be killed.

689
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:02,930
The gate of time and space will be closed, and you will have a random time travel.

690
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,520
A random time travel?

691
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,420
Are you saying

692
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,240
I won't know where I'll travel to?

693
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,640

694
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,400
In this strange world,

695
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,960
I have to change my fate on my own.

696
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,970
Amitabha.

697
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,290

700
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,750
don't worry.

701
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,300
Wait for me patiently.

702
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,580
I'll go back.

704
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,090
Are we leaving before offering incense?

705
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,050
The sky has changed.

706
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:51,250
We need to hurry back.

707
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,880
It was not easy for me to get the chance to go outside.

708
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,520
I didn't offer incense but was beaten by others.

709
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,070
I'm miserable.

710
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:56,970

711
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,610
Don't call me by my name.

712
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,220
Okay.

713
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,000
I'll be careful.

Xing Si,

00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,160
who attacked you?

717
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,370
Judging from the movement,

718
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:11,230
it was Ruan Siqiong from Xiling, the world's most powerful master.

719
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,429
If you meet him again,

720
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,760
you should avoid fighting with him.

721
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,860
Why?

722
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,199
Why?

723
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:17,920
Because

724
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,850
you're too weak.

730
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,650
I have something important to do today.

731
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:42,679
I'll leave first.

732
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,360
I'll leave you to it.

733
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,570
Please give my regards to Magistrate Du.

734
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,100
Thank you.

736
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,300
You don't want to leave?

No, no.

No.

An assassin committed a crime in the inn.

740
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:08,370
If you find this criminal, you will be rewarded.

741
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,320
Look at the portrait carefully.

We might have to wait for a while.

747
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,960
We've been searching for a criminal.

748
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,360
Every carriage and everyone must be inspected.

Let your master get out of the carriage.

750
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,480
My Lady,

751
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,730
the soldiers want to check our carriage.

752
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,930
Please get off.

753
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:32,770
Okay.

754
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,580
Don't move.

755
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,290
Tell your maid you won't get off.

756
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,400
You...

757
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,400
Who are you?

758
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,040
Say it!

759
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,560
Dong...

760
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:50,220
Dong...

761
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:51,850
Dongxi,

762
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:54,190
can I stay in the carriage?

763
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:54,830
Well...

764
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,050
My Lady,

765
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:57,720
the soldiers are searching for the criminal.

766
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,770
Please open the curtain and let them have a look.

767
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:00,460
No.

768
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,760
I'm a noble lady.

769
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,390
I can't show my face in public.

770
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,720
I don't believe it.

771
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,600
Sir, sir!

772
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,570
She is the daughter of

773
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:11,350
the vice president of the Changqing Chamber of Commerce.

774
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:12,410
She is a noble lady.

775
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,210
Do you insist on inspecting the carriage?

776
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,730
I was wondering who it was.

777
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:19,160
We won't inspect her if she's the daughter of our magistrate.

778
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,880
How dare a merchant's daughter domineer over us?

779
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,640
We must investigate the carriage today.

780
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,800
You heard that.

781
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,440
My social status isn't high enough.

782
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,170
How about you

783
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,130
going to another carriage?

784
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:29,690
Shut up.

785
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:34,360
There are many carriages.

786
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,220
Why do you insist on bothering me?

787
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:41,250
We have to check it.

788
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,200
Sir!

789
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:43,360
Get out of my way!

790
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,140
It's you.
