00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,920
The Authorities?

197
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,590
Father.

198
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,680
Mr. Gu.

199
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:51,160
Did you mean Magistrate Du?

200
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,340
Magistrate Li.

201
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,960
I've lived in Changqing for years

202
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,400
and never heard of a Magistrate Du.

203
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,060
Mr. Gu.

204
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,830
The usual spot.

205
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,570
Welcome.

206
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,069
Please come in.

207
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:05,890
Okay.

208
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,079
Why are you here?

209
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:31,710
What's up?

210
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,670
Who's she?

211
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,870
Why's her hair all white?

212
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,160
How should I know?

213
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,850
Go cook.

214
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,730
I'm cooking.

215
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,580
Leave now.

216
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,990
[Li Residence]

217
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,000
[Li Residence]

218
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,470
Sky lanterns...

219
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,370
Predecessor Ruan.

220
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,110
Rest in peace.

221
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:59,750
Uncle Ruan.

222
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,490
We'll meet again in the next life.

223
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:14,910
Duan Yu.

224
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,250
Where are you?

225
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,950
Miss, what are you doing up there?

226
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,550
I left something up here.

227
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,510
I just need to check.

228
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,510
Please come down.

229
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,830
It's very dangerous.

230
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,350
Amitabha.

231
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:37,860
Miss,

232
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,900
please come down.

233
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,250
Master.

234
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:43,830
I'm sorry.

235
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,740
Go help her check.

236
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:47,830
Yes.

237
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,990
Miss.

238
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,390
There's nothing here.

239
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,290
Miss,

240
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,320
did you hear that?

241
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:07,650
Please

242
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,190
check again.

243
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,430
Miss.

244
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,060
There's really

245
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,310
nothing here.

246
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,270
Miss,

247
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:20,450
what exactly did you leave behind the signboard?

248
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,740
It's...

249
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:23,900
It's...

250
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,360
Nothing.

251
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,460
Miss,

252
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,550
I'm sorry we couldn't help.

253
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,430
Amitabha.

254
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,660
Is this real-life Avatar?

255
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:50,240
This tree must be thousands of years old.

256
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,110
About 1,300 years.

257
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,420
It was dead

258
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,290
but somehow began to flourish again

259
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,390
after many people made wishes here.

260
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,000
Reviving a dead tree...

261
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,190
That's amazing.

262
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,590
What's written on it?

263
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,460
"With one heart, with one person,

264
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,350
never parting until death."

265
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,050
What about this one?

266
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,380
"White hair promise,

267
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,550
to continue our bond in the next life."

268
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:29,410
It's probably written for someone who passed away.

269
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,540
Miss Gu, what's wrong?

270
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,580
Nothing.

271
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,830
I just suddenly thought of

272
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,850
two elderly people, holding hands

273
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:43,380
and making wishes under this tree.

274
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,600
How romantic.

275
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,310
Duan Yu.

276
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,550
Let's leave our birth dates here too,

277
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,880
and pray for blessings.

278
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,590
Okay.

279
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,660
Why are you hesitating?

280
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,990
Give me your birth date.

281
00:21:58,970 --> 00:21:59,450
Nice!

282
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:18,910
Done.

283
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,520
Duan Yu?

284
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,790
My name is indeed Yu.

285
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,520
Great!

286
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,390
You're alive!

287
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:45,910
Miss!

288
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:46,730
Miss.

289
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:48,290
Miss.

290
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,910
Please maintain propriety.

291
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,240
This is inappropriate!

292
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,870
Please behave yourself.

293
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,910
Please behave yourself.

294
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,240
These past days, where have you been?

295
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,470
I looked for you in Changqing for so long.

296
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,330
I thought I'd never see you again.

297
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:00,870
Miss.

298
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,790
I'm not Duan Yu.

299
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:04,870
My name is Song Yu.

300
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,270
Impossible.

301
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:08,410
You're Duan Yu.

302
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,740
You look exactly like him.

303
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,600
I'm not mistaken. You are Duan Yu.

304
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:13,590
Miss,

305
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,730
you really got the wrong person.

306
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:16,840
My last name is Song.

307
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,900
My first name is Yu.

308
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,080
It means "precious jade

309
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,650
from Kunlun Mountains."

310
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:23,930
No way.

311
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,980
Even if Lu Zizheng changed the past,

312
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,820
Duan Yu's family background wouldn't change.

313
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,650
Miss?

314
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:35,980
Do you remember me?

315
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,080
I'm Gu Qingqiao.

316
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,800
Miss, I really don't know you.

317
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:49,310
My mother is calling me home for dinner.

318
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,200
I must take my leave.

319
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,020
What did you say?

320
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,450
You promised yourself to her?

321
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,130
Father.

322
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,120
We...

323
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,770
We've been intimate.

324
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,760
I must take responsibility.

325
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,470
You...

326
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,740
You're driving me crazy!

327
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,670
You've only just met her!

328
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:19,940
I hugged him.

329
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:24,640
You...

330
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,070
What have you learned from all your studies?

331
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,580
Father, please calm down.

332
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:31,380
You!

333
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,430
Honey.

334
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,550
Are you alright?

335
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,260
Yu!

336
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,300
Look at you.

337
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:39,190
You've really upset your father.

338
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,230
Honey.

339
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,430
Don't be angry.

340
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,060
Could I have really mistaken him for someone else?

341
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,150
Why isn't there any trace of Duan Yu?

[Changqing Poetry Collection Song Yu]

343
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,670
Miss!

344
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,000
Miss!

345
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,350
I'm sorry.

346
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,030
Sorry.

347
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,180
It's fine.

348
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,890
How's your father doing?

349
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:19,110
The doctor said it'd take about six months for him to recover.

350
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,040
Six months?

351
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,680
Should I go apologize to him?

352
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,910
No, no,

353
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,110
please don't.

354
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:29,370
Miss, please sit down.

355
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,120
May I know your name?

356
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:43,500
After all, we are to be married.

357
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:44,870
My name is Gu Qingqiao.

358
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:47,240
You can call me Qiao.

359
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,640
Qiao?

360
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:50,930
Qiao.

361
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,790
My name is Song Yu,

courtesy name Zijun.

363
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,420
I studied at Yuyou Academy

364
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:58,030
and have read the Four Books and Five Classics.

365
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,140
My dream is

366
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,190
to pass the government examination.

367
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,050
What about you?

368
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:04,900
Me?

369
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,530
Win a gold medal.

370
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:13,130
I just think

371
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,760
since we've only just met,

372
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,820
we should get to know each other better

373
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,230
since

374
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,810
we are to be married.

375
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,370
You have a point.

376
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,080
Even though I'm called Gu Qingqiao,

377
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,090
my real name is Qi Chunjiao.

378
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,800
I'm from the 21st century

379
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:34,420
and came to your world by chance.

380
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:38,110
But I need to gather the Four Treasures to go home.

381
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,890
In our past life, we were engaged.

382
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,080
You come from

383
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:47,220
the Duan family in Changqing

384
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,960
and have an older brother named Duan Yan

385
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,250
and a nephew.

386
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,270
What's wrong?

00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:04,870

how long have you been in this condition?

390
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,540
What condition?

391
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,120
The classics teach us

392
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,230
to remain unshaken by poverty

393
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,620
and uncorrupted by wealth.

394
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,490
Don't worry.

395
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,070
Even if

396
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,850
I achieve high honors,

397
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,540
I won't abandon my wife.

398
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,960
What are you talking about?

399
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,820
Simply put,

400
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,520
even if your madness can't be cured,

401
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,390
it

402
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,970
can be controlled.

403
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:43,550
You're the one who's mad!

404
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,950
Your whole family is mad!

405
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,390
Mad!

406
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,490
Mad!

407
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,270
Mad.

408
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,140
-Mad.
-I...

409

414
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,880
such an unknown girl?

415
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,280
And her white hair

416
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,910
—it's an ill omen.

417
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:12,230
Did you really become intimate with her?

418
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,350
Yes.

419
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,660
But not really.

420
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,150

421
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,380
Just what?

422
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,110
She looks somewhat...

423
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,120
Never mind.

424
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:25,460

425
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:26,800
She's a nice person.

Could this

430
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,790
be fate?

431
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,090
Miss, are you asleep?

432
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,640
No.

433
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,830
Come in.

434
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,030
Miss,

435
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,960
you're not properly dressed.

436
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:19,030
I...

437
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,730
I am dressed.

438
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,430
You should wear your outer robe as well.

439
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,910
You're so troublesome.

440
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,850
We're going to be living together.

441
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,710
If there are so many rules,

442
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,880
how can we live happily?

443
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,170
You're right.

444
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,390
It's my mistake.

445
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,030
So,

446
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,440
what's the matter?

447
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,110
Miss,

448
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,880
how many betrothal gifts do you want?

449
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,940
What betrothal gift?

450
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,810
The betrothal gift for marriage.

451
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,670
Tomorrow, I'll find a matchmaker

452
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,450
to arrange our engagement.

453
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,650
There's no need for such trouble.

454
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,120
This is basic etiquette.

455
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,210
Don't worry.

Our family is quite wealthy.

458
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,270
So,

459
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:14,350
what are you willing to give me?

460
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:15,690
Well...

461
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,200
It depends on what you want.

462
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,150

465
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,640
I want to grow old with you,

466

467
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:40,810
and be happily in love together for a lifetime.

to join the Sacred Blood Sect.

Everything is going as you predicted.

490

The eldest son of the Xu family is frail

491

and can only survive by relying on our Blood Technique.

However, I believe that

495
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:56,010
because Xu Xin is from

496
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,460
one of the Four Noble Families,

00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,060
Miss.

583
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,230
Miss.

584
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,150
Weren't you the one

585
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,910
who promised to grow old with me?

586
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:56,110
Why are you leaving?

587
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,720
If you mind what others say,

588
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:58,790
we can move to another county

589
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,030
after we get married,

590
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,400
as long as

591
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,240
you don't mind.

592
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,360
Young Master Song.

593
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,450
I just tricked you yesterday.

594
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,940
I didn't expect you to take it seriously.

595
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,390
Tricked me?

596
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,650
Don't you get it?

597
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,600
I was lying to you.

598
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,310
I came here

599
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,910
to scam some money and leave.

600
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,980
But you took it too seriously,

601
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,410
making things complicated.

602
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,040
But you said

603
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,780
you wanted to grow old with me

604
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,270
and have many children.

605
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,830
My hair has always been white.

606
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:36,150
How can I grow old with you?

607
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,750
Of course, I was lying to you.

608
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:39,160
You're such a bookworm.

609
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:41,120
Be more cautious next time.

610
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:44,010
If Song Yu lives with you,

611
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,960
he will be plagued by gossip all his life.

612
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,330
He is good at his studies.

613
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:52,090
We are counting on him to pass the imperial exam.

614
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,670
But now,

615
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:55,450
with your unknown background

616
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,820
and white hair,

617
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,090
you'll be a burden to him.

618
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:01,160
I will be good to him.

619
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,070
I will take care of him for life.

620
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,830
Silly girl.

621
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,880
Do you know how long a lifetime is?

622
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,080
Marrying Song Yu

623
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,950
means taking care of his livelihood.

624
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,610
Look at your frail condition.

625
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:14,520
Can you handle it?

626
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,800
You're right.

627
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:24,710
I can't take care of him

628
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:27,110
for a lifetime.

629
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,880
I'm doing this for your own good.

630
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,240
The mismatched marriage

631
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,880
will only bring suffering.

632
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,280
Think about it.

633
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,970
Marry a girl better than me in the future.

634
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,370
Don't be deceived again.

635
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,390
But you have no relatives.

636
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,520
Where can you go?

637
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,470
The world is so big.

638
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,080
I'll find a place to stay.

639
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,160
Stop clinging to me.

640
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,800
That girl is sensible

641
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,300
and has agreed to leave.

642
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,660
What more do you need to worry about?

643
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,140
Yu is so muddled.

644
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,430
How can I trust him with the family business?

645
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,670
When will you

646
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,700
tell him

647
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:23,530
about those matters?

648
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,310
Not yet.

649
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:31,020
The Sacred Blood Sect is growing stronger.

650
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,210
Knowing it now would be dangerous for him.

651
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:37,110
I'll wait a while.

652
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,580
At this time,

653
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,620
you still want to organize those scholars

654
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,750
to oppose them.

655
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:45,670
I'm really worried.

656
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,740
The Sacred Blood Sect uses people to practice the Blood Technique

657
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,540
and occupies private property.

658
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,300
If I don't organize resistance,

659
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:57,380
it will only get harder in the future.

660
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:00,290
Fine. Fine. Fine.

661
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:01,650
You're right.

662
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,960
It's already late.

663
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,470
Why isn't Yu back yet?

664
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,850
Are you Song Chengming?

665
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,960
I should've had dinner before I left.

666
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:59,450
No matter what, I can't sell it.

667
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,260
Bear with it.
