a young woman gambles on liquor and donates grain.

00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,870

that he threatens his son's marriage with such an important matter.

14
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,350

How is that possible?

I've done everything I could,

112
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,350
and I've collected all the grain nearby.

113
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,310
Where did he get the provisions?

I'm also curious.

But if his family weren't that rich,

116
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,590
he wouldn't have dared to do that.

Actually, I’m here to tell you that

after Mr. Miao left,

149
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,670
some other tavern owners came to me,

150
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,830
saying they're willing to suspend their business and donate grain.

151
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,870
Really?

00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,070

I've never seen a woman

Smile more from now on.

158
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,040
An idea occurred to me

159
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,310
when you were drunk.

160
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,800
I've figured out about the grain problem.

161
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,030
Since we can't buy or see any grain,

162
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,890
someone must have stored grain.

163
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,160
If we can find that person,

164
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,360
the grain problem will be solved.

165
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:29,180
I knew it.

166
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,350
What?

167
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,190
Handsome people are smart indeed.

By the way, Young Master Duan,

169

I've been doing nothing at home all day.

How about we go out for a walk?

171
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,790
Now?

172
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,430
Yes.

173
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,990

That's right.

Isn't this the perfect time?

178
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:57,690
Okay.

179
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,600
You can come with me to a place.

184
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,210
Of course.

185
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:24,160
Of all the young ladies in Changqing, you're the best at making tea.

186
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,380
Sadly,

189
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,630
Cuckoo.

190
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,640
Shaoyi.

191
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:41,230
Where are we going?

192
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,060
Come again.

193
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:51,940
No problem.

194
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,510
Chairman.

195
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,400
What brings you here today?

196
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,540
Manager Yang.

197
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,690
Aren't you short of grain recently?

198
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,150
But your restaurant's business is thriving.

199
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,150
Did

200
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,710
you change your menu?

201
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,990
It's all for the people.

202
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,990
Only I know how hard my life is.

203
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,790
I have to silently endure it all.

204
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,040
What brings you two here today?

205
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,000
Of course we're here to eat.

206
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,840
You must be joking, Chairman.

207
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,490
We only have a few dishes here.

208
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,270
I'm afraid you won't like it.

209
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,280
Manager Yang.

210
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,050
Are you worried that we'll eat up all your food?

211
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:22,900
Of course not.

212
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,530
It's not like you won't pay.

213
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,830
Since I'm here, I'm your guest.

214
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,990
There's no need to stand on ceremony.

215
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:27,530
Let's go and

216
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,190
fill a table for Manager Yang.

217
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,590
Please come in.

218
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,470
Please come in.

219
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,860
Are we really here to eat?

220
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,700
Do they look like

221
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,940
they're here to eat?

222
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,180
So why are we here?

223
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,050
Let's leave.

224
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,940
I'll leave, and you'll stay.

225
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,870
Keep an eye on Yang Chunfeng for me.

226
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,880
Why did Chairman leave?

227
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,430
He...

228
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,500
He needs to pee.

229
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,840
Ruoyun, what's wrong?

230
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,700
I have something to tell Duan Yu,

231
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:02,770
[Baoyin Restaurant]

232
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,790
but I can't make up my mind.

233
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,920
Then don't tell him.

234
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,270
He's not here anyway.

235
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,870
Where did he go?

236
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,390
I don’t know.

237
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,790
Is he with Miss Gu?

238
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,950
If so, there's no need to tell him.

239
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:16,750
That's right.

240
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,500
Let's not tell him anything from now on.

241
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,490
[Baoyin Restaurant]

242
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:21,890
Ruoyun.

243
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,230
Do you want to go to the pavilion for a drink?

244
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,910
Aren't you afraid that Duan Yu will scold you?

245
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,790
He didn't.

246
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:31,260
He asked someone to clean up the pavilion instead,

247
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,870
and he asked me to spend more time with you.

248
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,180
What did you tell him?

249
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,470
Nothing.

250
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,230
Let's go.

251
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,870
Let's buy some snacks

252
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,440
and have a drink at the pavilion.

253
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,140
My Lady.

254
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,490
If Master finds out,

255
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,550
he'll kill me.

256
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,110
He's become a dishonest person because of Manager Yang.

257
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,560
He won't care what we do.

258
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,260
Your father's become a dishonest person because of Manager Yang?

259
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,630
Enjoy your meal.

260
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,590
Let me know if you need anything.

261
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,360
Uncle Yang.

262
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,280
Let's talk.

263
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,200
Talk?

264
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,520
What's there to talk about?

265
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,140
If you are not satisfied with the dishes,

266
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,580
you can leave.

267
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,080
I'm satisfied.

268
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,130
It's just the rice.

269
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,520
The rice is not that good.

270
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,580
It's good enough to have rice to eat.

271
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,480
Do you have any connections

272
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,270
to get rice?

273
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,120
What do you mean?

274
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,610
Watch what you say.

275
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,300
You'll be punished for selling rice in private.

276
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,470
Boss.

277
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,440
There's no problem, right?

278
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,520
Yes.

279
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,550
I have connections

280
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,550
for rice.

281
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,280
Don't talk big.

282
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,630
Why should I trust you?

283
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,660
Uncle Yang.

284
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,510
I even call you Uncle.

285
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,060
All the grain Duan Yu's been selling

286
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,420
comes from me.

287
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,880
So that's why Duan Yu suddenly got the upper hand.

288
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,850
What does it have to do with me?

289
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,070
Don't you know?

290
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,930
Duan Yu is a very rigid person.

291
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,070
Selling...

292
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,430
Selling grain at a low price

293
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,280
is such a loss.

294
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,900
We are businessmen.

295
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,280
Duan Yu is not

296
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,470
that smart.

297
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,490
Tell me your plan.

298
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,180
We both do catering.

299
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,850
Let's work together

300
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,180
to make a great fortune.

301
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,380
Tell me more details.

302
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,570
I'll provide the grain, and you'll provide human labor.

303
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,780
The price-setting is up to you.

304
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,690
We'll split the profit 10 ways, 9 for me and 1 for you.

305
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,820
You're even more
unscrupulous than your father.

306
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,310
What are you talking about?

307
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:55,870
Chairman.

308
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:56,930
It took you so long.

309
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,200
Do I need to inform you how long I'll be gone?

310
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,100
No... No need.

311
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,970
You two...

312
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,750
Alright.

313
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:08,780
Enjoy your meal.

314
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,390
So Chunfeng Restaurant is really selling grain in secret.

315
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,720
What do you mean really?

316
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,090
To stall him,

317
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:23,800
I lied that I wanted to work with him and sell grain to him without telling you,

318
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,060
but it seems he's really been selling it.

319
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,380
That's so bold of you.

320
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,710
How dare you lie like that?

321
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:29,870
What if he finds out?

322
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,150
Besides,

323
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,130
why would Yang Chunfeng trust you?

324
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,390
That old fox is so patient.

325
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,910
It's been many days since we got the word out,

326
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,150
and he just started taking action.

327
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,000
If it takes one more day,

328
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,650
the Duan Residence will have no grain to sell.

329
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:46,500

330
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,260
Thank you for today.

331
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,750
It's nothing.

332
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,330
He's just a profiteer.

333
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,360
He forgets everything when he sees something profitable.

334
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:55,830
Besides,

335
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,090
why should I be afraid?

336
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,360
I've got you.

337
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,630
I told him

338
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:03,190
the Duan Residence's grain was actually bought through my connections.

339
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,590
He was stunned by it.

340
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,780
A couple of the same mind can overcome any difficulty.

341
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,410
What?

342
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,100
You don't have to explain to me.

343
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,760
We are not from the same world.

344
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,660
I wasn't going to explain to you.

345
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,360
So are you here to see me,

346
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,750
or him?

347
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,750
None of your business.

348
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,480
Fine, it's none of my business.

349
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:37,030
So we're still friends?

350
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,840
I don't have a friend like you.

351
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,670
My Lady.

352
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,550
What happened?

353
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,100
Go get Duan Yu.

354
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,070
Tell him I have something important to tell him.

355
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:04,900
Miss Du.

356
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:09,730
[Yuelai Inn]

357
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,750
What do you want to see me for?

358
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,050
I know Yang Chunfeng has grain,

359
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,440
and I know where it is.

360
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,730
How do you know?

361
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,620
That's none of your business.

362
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,960
I'll tell you.

363
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,390
But on one condition.

364
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,500
You have to say yes.

365
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,270
Okay, I'll say yes.

367
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,830
Ask Xing Si to take Wuyi Guards to West Mountain to see me.

368
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,280
I'll leave marks along the way.

369
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,990
Go back to Chunfeng Restaurant immediately after reporting to me.

370
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:47,430
Okay.

Qiao.

372
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,030
Go with Miss Du

373
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,570
to Chunfeng Restaurant and keep an eye on Yang Chunfeng.

374
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,350
If he goes out,

375
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,410
ask Shaoyi to inform me immediately.

376
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,470
I don't need her company.

377
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,060
I want to go with you.

378
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:58,660
I...

379
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,420
I'll go with you then.

380
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,070
Qiao.

381
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,390
Don't come with me.

382
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,950
You'll be in danger.

383
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,740
It's because it'll be dangerous that

384
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,990
I must go with you.

385
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,030
If we share the danger,

386
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,390
each of us will only need to bear half of it.

387
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,070
Fine.

388
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,570
Let's go together.

389
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,390
That's right.

390
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,230
A couple of the same mind can overcome any difficulty.

391
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,980
Happiness comes so suddenly.

392
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,760
Shush.

393
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,370
Looks like we were right.

394
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,800
The grain barn is nearby.

395
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:46,510
Let's go.

396
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:46,990
I...

397
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,990
I've been starving for a while.

398
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,990
Why isn't the replacement here yet?

399
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,470
Hang in there.

400
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,160
He'll be here soon.

401
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,160
I didn't know there're guards here.

402
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,840
Looks like they're hiding a lot of grain here.

403
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:08,970
Wait for me.

404
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,230
I'll

405
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,730
take them all down.

406
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,790
Don't alert them.

407
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,660
I have an idea.

408
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,310
Qiao.

409
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,570
What is that?

410
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:34,350
Let's go.

411
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,350
Let's have a look.

412
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,060
Let's go.

413
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,640
He's gone too far.

414
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,550
How immoral.

415
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,090
If an official does not put the people first,

416
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,760
he might as well go home and sell sweet potatoes.

417
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,290
Shush.

418
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,110
Let's go back.

419
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:22,720
Let's go.

420
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,110
Hurry.

421
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,710
This...

422
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,800
Master said

423
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,260
a liter of rice costs one tael of silver now.

424
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,070
If we sell it in the city,

425
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,010
it would cost more than 100 taels.

426
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,610
We've been guarding this cash cow,

427
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,230
but we earn so little.

428
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,290
Rice is even more valuable than human lives.

429
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,450
This bag of rice

430
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,790
is damaged.

431
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,630
Let's take it out and sell it secretly.

432
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,070
This way, our time as guards won't be a waste.

433
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,890
You're right.

434
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,190
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

435
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:02,790
Come on.

436
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:03,450
Be careful.

437
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:06,960
Qiao.

438
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,460
They left.

439
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,870
Wait a bit longer.

440
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,520
Isn't... Isn't it too late?

441
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,650
I think we should go.

442
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:22,740
You first.

443
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:23,470
No.

444
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:24,740
I'm nearer.

445
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,910
There's no mechanism.

446
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:38,110
Looks like the stone gate can only be opened from outside.

447
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,480
Is there enough oxygen in here?

448
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,900
We won't suffocate to death here, will we?

449
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,740
I hope Xing Si can get here soon.

450
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,990
Look, the rice bags here are piled up.

451
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,500
There's enough food for us until we're old.

452
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,380
With you here,

453
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,060
I have nothing to worry about.

454
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,350
If we spend the rest of our lives here,

455
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,500
it's not bad either.

456
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,350
Spend the rest of our lives here?

457
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,960
Grow old together in the rice bag piles?

458
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,390
I mean,

459
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,390
given the current situation,

460
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,000
it's a blessing

461
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,750
if we can die in the rice pile.

462
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,020
You think too much.

463
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,350
Xing Si will come to save us soon.

464
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,200
So literal-minded.

465
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,790
I'm hungry.

466
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,070
Looking at this fire.

467
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,240
I wish there was a sheep.

468
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,390
Sheep?

469
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,910
Sword Roast Whole Lamb.

470
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,710
All you care about is food.

471
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,350
Yes.

472
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,120
If I can't be an athlete

473
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,650
when I go back,

474
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,950
I'll open the best barbecue restaurant.

475
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,120
I'll name it

476
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:47,750
Glory of Meat.

477
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:48,450
Go back?

478
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,450
To where?

479
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,210
When?

480
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,630
Yeah...

481
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,620
When can I go back?

482
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:58,420
If I go back,

483
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,980
what about you?

484
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,560
Qiao.

485
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:14,690
What's wrong?

486
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,330
There's wind here.

487
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,070
Wind?

488
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,830
There is indeed wind.

489
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:25,880
That means

490
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,940
this is the mouth of the cave.

491
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,140
If we follow the wind's direction,

492
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,340
we will find the exit.

493
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,840
Let's move these.

494
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:08,220
Let's go.

495
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,380
We're finally out.

496
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:20,920
Over there!

497
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,080
Quick!

498
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:23,780
Qiao.

499
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:26,530
It's Xing Si.

500
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,100
Xing Si.

501
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,230
Young Master.

502
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:39,640
[Commerce]

503
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,450
Have you found the grain supply?

504
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,400
We've found them.

505
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,400
I estimate it to be

506
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,950
40,000 dan.

507
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:51,960
Duan Yu,

508
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,430
you won't...

509
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,160
Don't worry.

510
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,710
I will keep my promise.

511
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,760
Sir, the dishes are ready.

512
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,570
Enjoy.

513
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,500
The food here is good.

514
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,240
Chairman, since we are here,

515
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,440
let's eat.

516
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,310
When Chairman Duan was 15, he established the Chamber of Commerce.

517
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,390
Manager Yang,

518
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:12,390
have you heard of a saying?

519
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,480
What saying?

520
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,120
When talking about an issue

521
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,210
you don't have to start from the day you got the dog.

522
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:20,800
Since we're eating at such a fine restaurant,

523
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,350
let's make it quick.

524
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,730
Everyone is in danger because of the grain shortage.

525
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:29,270
I think the nearby grains were acquired in advanced

526
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,490
by some merchants just as a precautionary measure.

527
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,910
But since the rumors are causing unrest,

528
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,110
they dare not sell it.

529
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,130
With your prestige,

530
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,950
if you work with those merchants

531
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,690
you'll not only relieve the people's plight

532
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:42,870
but also gain from it.

533
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,190
Isn't that great?

534
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,680
Manager Yang,

535
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,980
you're talking about what happened at the cave in the west of the city, right?

536
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,110
Well...

537
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,950
It's grain stored by multiple merchants.

538
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,230
How do we divide the profit?

539
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,470
Just say it.

540
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,010
Marvelous, Chairman.

541
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,060
40,000 dan of grains.

542
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:05,520
According to the current rice market price

543
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,930
the total value amounts to four million taels of silver.

544
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,290
If I can work with you

545
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,100
to resolve the grain shortage.

546
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,010
I’m willing to pay you one million taels of silver.

547
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,390
What do you think?

548
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,570
Manager Yang.

549
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:18,970
Listen carefully.

550
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,210
The Chamber of Commerce will buy all of your supply with 200,000 taels,

551
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,470
not a penny more.

552
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,660
Chairman, are you kidding me?

553
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,720
If Magistrate Du finds out about this,

554
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,970
it might not be good for you.

555
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,130
What do you mean?

556
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,170
If there is civil unrest in Changqing,

557
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,980
he will be the first to be implicated.

558
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,170
How are you sure he won't change his mind

559
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,430
and settle the problem with your grains?

560
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,770
By then,

561
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,830
no one will come to buy your grains like me.

562
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,090
That makes sense.

563
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,380
The most righteous person in Changqing

564
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,580
is Duan Yu.

565
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,710
You two are ganging up against me.

566
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,700
If you're not sincere,

567
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,860
I'll take my leave then.

568
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,310
Manager Yang.

569
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,290
Think about it.

570
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,060
At this time,

571
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,310
putting money into your pocket

572
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,720
is your best choice.

573
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,240
Fine.

574
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,120
I'll give you another chance.

575
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,050
Let's make a bet.

576
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:18,760
Let's see if Magistrate Du wants to keep his position

577
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,540
or your money.

578
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,070
You came here suddenly

579
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,640
just to show me this?

580
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,260
Yes.

581
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,760
This is a copy of the grain transfer order.

582
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,350
Where did you get this?

583
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,910
The grain from nearby provinces

584
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,630
were sold out in a short time.

585
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:45,670
In fact, it was done with the support of the grain transfer order.

586
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,330
Therefore,

587
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,450
even the cautious Administrator of Yuzhou

588
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,580
can only cooperate.

589
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,420
This is the real reason

590
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,130
behind Changqing's grain shortage.

591
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:57,330
The grain transfer order only belongs to the Magistrate.

592
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,510
It has always been in my mansion.

593
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,010
This was what Manager Yang

594
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,570
handed to me personally.

595
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:04,620
Why should I believe you?

596
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,120
I made a bet with him.

597
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,860
Whether you want to keep your position or...

598
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,070
his money.

599
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,670
How dare you!

600
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,010
How dare you threaten me?

601
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:17,010
It wasn't me who threatened you,

602
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,350
but the grain sacks with the Magistrate's seal

603
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:21,010
found in the cave located in the west of the city.

604
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,360
You found the grains?

605
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:24,510
Yes.

606
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:27,390
40,000 dan in total.

607
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:31,190
Is it worth my bet with him?

608
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,360
No hurry.

609
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:37,770
Everyone has a share.

610
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,010
Here you go.

611
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:40,640
Thank you.

612
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,130
Thank you.

613
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,510
Line up.

614
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,070
Line up at the back.

615
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,110
Thank you.

616
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,150
Thank you.

617
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:47,940
Thank you.

618
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,970
Thank you.

619
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,390
Line up.

620
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,590
Everyone has a share.

621
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,510
You scared me.

622
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,730
I nearly lost my senses.

623
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:10,110
I made delicious braised pork to reward you.

624
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:10,670
Sure.

625
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,680
But come with me first.

626
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:13,870
Let's go.

627
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:18,010
I broke your hairpin.

628
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,550
Pick one.

629
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:21,860
This one.

630
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:27,390
Okay.

631
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,270
My hand?

632
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:45,350
Why did you return

633
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:46,700
what I gave you?

634
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:49,310
The ring symbolizes locking a heart.

635
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,670
When two people each wear a ring,

636
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,900
it represents locking each other in a mutual commitment.

637
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,960
You must wear it.

638
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,610
This is a declaration of sovereignty.

639
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:09,230
This little thing declares sovereignty?

640
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,270
Yes.

641
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,940
It means you already have someone in your heart.

642
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,600
You're not available.

643
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,270
You

644
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,730
have such weird ideas.

645
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,750
It's a sense of ritual.

646
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,950
This is the sense of ritual in love.

647
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,230
Qiao.

648
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,150
Why did you give me a ring?

649
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:30,270
If you wear the ring here, it is connected to the heart,

650
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,840
it means that our hearts are connected.

651
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,100
I've never heard of that.

652
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,100
Of course.

653
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,350
This is...

654
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,010
a saying from my hometown.

655
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,430
Hometown?

656
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,310
There is no such saying in our hometown.

657
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,110
What?

658
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:46,850
You don't want it?

659
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:47,580
Give it back.

660
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:49,950
Since you gave it to me,

661
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,210
you can't take it back.

662
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:52,910
Pretentious.

663
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,350
This wine tastes sweet.

664
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,960
It's very special.

665
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,660
This is the Yangmei wine made by the Qi family.

666
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,770
It's sweet and sour.

667
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:17,650
If you like it,

668
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,330
I can make it for you every day.

669
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:20,990
Sure.

670
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,710
A toast for you.

671
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:26,990
Bottoms up!

672
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:30,110
For you.

673
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,910
Bottoms up!

674
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,710
No, no.

675
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:35,850
You drank too much.

676
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:41,710
Duan Yu.

677
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,110
Let me tell you a secret.

678
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,550
♫Petals ask about the passing years♫

679
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,700
♫Are you still nostalgic?♫

680
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:13,300
♫At the first glance♫

681
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:16,140
♫I write down our fate♫

682
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:19,670
♫A lifetime of longing♫

683
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,210
♫Living freely with a clear mind♫

684
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:24,270
♫Who dances gracefully in the small tower?♫

685
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,150
♫In the moment you look back♫

686
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,800
♫Waiting for time to write the story♫

687
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,190
♫The signature is faint♫

688

♫Sleepless nights because of you in this world♫

689

696

What's going on?

697
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:19,850
Young Master Duan.

698
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,150
Duan Yu.

699
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:26,710
Am I back?

700
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:28,870
Mom.

701
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,110
Mom.

702
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,950
What happened?

703
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:39,640
Father.

704
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:41,630
Dongxi.

705
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,670
Da.

706
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,990
Where are you guys?

707
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:54,320
Is anyone there?

708
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:56,750
Where are they?

709
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:12,870
Duan Yu.

710
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,060
You...

711
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:15,790
What's wrong?

712
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:32,470
My watch.

713
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:33,230
Watch.

714
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,600
My watch.

715
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,010
My watch!

716
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,580
Where is my watch?

717
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:46,030
It was a dream.

718
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,460
That dream.

719
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,870
Is it

720
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,790
predicting that Lu Zizheng will kill me?

721
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,440
The Nine-turn Melodious Bell is the sacred relic of the Mantra Sect.

722
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,450
Don't let anyone know about it.

723
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,460
Otherwise, you will be killed.

724
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:12,730
Especially be careful of your future husband.

725
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,580
Lu Zizheng just likes to bluff.

726
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,210
What's there to be afraid of?

727
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,179
He's always playing tricks.

728
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:25,190
I don't think he knows anything.

729
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,489
He's insane.

730
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,260
He should be the one

731
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,469
to be careful.

732
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,770
My Lady, you're awake.

733
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,750
You got drunk at Qingfeng Restaurant last night.

734
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,070
How are you feeling today?

735
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,110
I'm fine.

736
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,469
I just have a headache.

737
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,610
Qingfeng Restaurant?

738
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:52,670
Let me think.

739
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,790
Let me remember what happened.

740
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:55,380
Qiao.

741
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:56,230
Here.

742
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:57,840
Have some hangover tea.

743
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,320
No.

744
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,160
I don't want bitter tea.

745
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:04,300
Bubble tea is the best in the world.

746
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:07,330
You've never seen me wear lipstick for the first time.

747
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:09,960
Even a discus-throwing girl like me can have spring.

748
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,030
You look good in white.

749
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,940
Do you know the appeal of wearing a white shirt?

750
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,350
You can only wear it in front of me in the future.

751
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:22,910
I'm the Star of Rebellion.

752
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,220
Oh no.

753
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:25,950
This...

754
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,710
I didn't lose it,

755
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,340
but I was too talkative.

756
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,950
Why did I drink so much?

757
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:31,470
I...

758
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,070
My Lady.

759
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,280
My Lady, are you alright?

760
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:37,310
Would you like some tea to sober up?

761
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,410
Dongxi.

762
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,260
What do you think

763
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:43,630
about the title of the Star of Rebellion.

764
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,170
How does it sound?

765
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,710
The stars in the sky...

766
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:51,590
I think it sounds grand.

767
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,310
What do you mean by grand?

768
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,640
A deity who descended to the mortal world?

769
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,630
The reincarnation of a spiritual pearl?

770
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,090
Possessed by a demon king?

771
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,270
Does it sound like a bad person?

772
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,420
I think so.

773
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,750
Oh no.

774
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,840
I'm sure they thought I was a bad person.

775
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,240
But it may also mean something that could

776
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:10,790
bring hope to the poor.

777
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,030
Yeah.

778
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,030
Dongxi.

779
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:15,070
You are such a good girl with positive energy.

780
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:17,070
My Lady, are you alright?

781
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,140
Let me get you some tea to sober you up.

782
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,210
No, no need.

783
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
It's indeed a strange contraption.

784
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,790
But why did you

785
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,630
have to be the Star of Rebellion?

786
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,000
You're the Star of Rebellion?

787
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,140
Hush.

788
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,600
Keep your voice down.

789
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,150
Don't let others know.

790
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,810
This is one of the Four Treasures.

791
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,930
What is that?

792
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,770
How would I know?

793
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:52,030
I only know that I can only go home with it.

794
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,070
I still don't understand.

795
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,920
Isn't your home in Changqing?

796
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,710
To be honest,

797
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:03,590
I...

798
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,850
I'm not from this world.

799
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:10,000
I'm not the daughter of a restaurant owner.

800
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,350
I used to...

801
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,470
I used to be

802
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,110
an ordinary person.

803
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:18,030
Besides throwing discuses,

804
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:19,890
I can't do anything else.

805
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,100
My happiest thing every day

806
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:26,590
is drinking a cup of bubble tea.

807
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,140
And

808
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,110
taking the bus home every night

809
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:33,880
while looking at the trees outside the window

810
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,280
flying past me.

811
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,190
Then...

812
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:40,230
my arm got injured.

813
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:45,510
I couldn't be a discus athlete anymore.

814
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:49,270
Then I really became a nobody.

815
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:52,390
No career, no future, no love.

816
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:54,010
If I'm not the Star of Rebellion,

817
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:54,870
who could it be?

818
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:55,780
Qiao.

819
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,400
Your arm right now...

820
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,730
It was injured before I came here.

821
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,000
But now I know

822
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:10,560
in order to meet you here,

823
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,390
I spent all my luck.

824
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,210
To get engaged with you

825
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,830
and be your wife.

826
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:22,360
I didn't even dare to think about these before.

827
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,190
But now,

828
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,980
you're by my side.

829
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,870
What Four Treasures?

830
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:33,880
I don't bother to look for it.

831
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,680
It's okay as long as you're here.

832
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,630
You are my dream.

833
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,590
I don't need anything else.

834
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,850
I don't need anything.

835
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:44,280
You mean I'm your dream?

836
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:45,730
For me,

837
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:48,010
you can give up being the Star of Rebellion

838
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:49,340
and the Four Treasures?

839
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:51,700
It's okay.

840
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:52,450
It's okay.

841
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,900
Don't feel pressured.

842
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:54,350
I...

843
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,350
♫In the bustling place♫

844
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:56,670
I won't cause you any trouble.

845
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:58,510
This was my own decision.

846
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,840
♫That transient looking back♫

847
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,040
I just want to be with you.

848
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:02,030
I'll be by your side and no matter what you do

849
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:04,140
♫You raised your head♫

850
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:03,450
I'll be with you.

851
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,260
I know

852
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:07,540
♫The fireworks flew past the night sky♫

853
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,830
you have a great sense of responsibility.

854
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,140
No matter what happens

855
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,620
you always carry the burden alone.

856
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:11,260
♫The night breezes played music gently♫

857
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,690
♫Even flying birds stopped♫

858
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:13,810
But don't worry, from now on,

859
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:16,620
♫To review your gentleness♫

860
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:14,620
I'm here.

861
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:16,350
I'll shoulder it with you.

862
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,880
We'll shoulder everything together from now on.

863
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,810
♫I'm most afraid that in my dreams, I can't see♫

864
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:22,080
♫Your smile♫

865
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,270
With me here,

866
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:24,170
I won't let you be alone.

867
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:25,900
♫Until the end♫

868
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,170
Cheers.

869
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,140
♫Love doesn't need to be put together♫

870
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:32,470
♫Feel it with your heart♫

871
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,200
♫Whether it's autumn and winter, I've been missing you♫

♫Even when we've reached the end of time♫

873
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,370
Qiao, you're drunk.

874
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,400
I won't take

875
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,070
what you said today seriously.

876
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,050
No.

877
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:42,500
♫Meeting you♫

878
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:45,350
♫Is all my reason♫

879

I'm not drunk.

880
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,770
I've never told anyone about this.

881
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:47,120
♫With you in the crowd♫

882
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:47,390
This is the first time I told anyone about this.

883

♫I persist in it♫

884
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:48,990
I only told you.

♫No matter how long the journey is♫

886
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,410

♫We'll be with each other.♫

888
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,730
your family will be my family

889

Your ambition is my ambition.

890
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:02,430
Your responsibility is my responsibility.

891
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:04,990
As a couple,

892
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:07,510
we'll overcome all challenges.
