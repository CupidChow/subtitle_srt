[Her Fantastic Adventures]

3
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,390
I think you've got a good brain.

4
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,900
But you

5
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,390
are not a talker.

6
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:48,550
Don't you forget to make jokes about me at this point?

7
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,789
Aren't you afraid that they'll come in and hit us?

8
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:51,870
Don't worry.

9
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:52,789
They won't.

10
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,670
We are both useful to them.

11
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,670
Before they figure it out,

12
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,750
they won't do anything to us.

13
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,870
Take things as they come.

14
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,670
Stay calm.

15
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,970
Don't mess up our plan.

16
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,190
That's a great attitude.

17
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,180
Very healthy.

18
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:11,550
When those people from the Mantra Sect tried to kill you,

19
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,150
your performance was impressive.

20
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:13,870
But

21
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,150
you also need to explain clearly to me

22
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,079
about your situation with Duan Yu.

23
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,700
Once you clarify what you gave to Duan Yu.

24
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,760
I mean the thing they wanted from you,

25
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,880
then we can find a way to escape.

26
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,850
Your tongue is sharp.

27
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:33,750
Oh my god.

28
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,190
Are you even human?

29
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,190
What are you saying?

30
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,550
I picked it up when I was kicked.

31
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,010
Took me a while to break it.

32
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,510
I told you. I have more experience than you.

The remnants of the Sacred Blood Sect.

35
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,360
If you can't exterminate the Duan family today,

36
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,440
I will kill you all.

37
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,950
Sir.

38
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,790
Sir, are you alright?

39
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,350
I'm fine.

40
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,630
You haven't left your room for three days.

41
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,660
Do you want some food?

42
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,590
Three days?

43
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,660
No.

44
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,230
It's too late.

45
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,730
If brother comes back,

46
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,390
Qiao will die.

47
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,089
Who is Gu Qingqiao that

48
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,029
Magistrate Du mentioned?

49
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:18,829
His Lordship.

50
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,620
She is the daughter of the owner of Qingfeng Restaurant.

51
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,820
I knew this.

52
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,430
She is the girl that Young Master likes.

53
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,400
Ridiculous!

54
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,950
How could Duan Yu act so recklessly?

55
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,540
His Lordship.

56
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,690
Miss Gu and Young Master have been through a lot together.

57
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,020
And she helped Young Master solve the grain shortage problem.

58
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:36,870
They

59
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,620
fell in love with each other and their love is genuine...

60
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,990
Enough, stop talking.

61
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,030
No need to say more about these things.

62
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,110
Duan Yu must

63
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,200
marry the daughter of Magistrate Du.

64
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,280
How come I've never heard of

65
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,310
such an outstanding woman in Changqing?

66
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,470
I think...

67
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,500
I don’t know.

68
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,120
If what Yang Chunfeng said is true,

69
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,030
that Gu Qingqiao colluded with the Mantra Sect to kidnap Shaoyi.

[Duan]

71
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,590
Her goal is my entire Duan family.

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,620
[Duan]

73
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,030
What a grand scheme she has.

74
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,390
I bet the Gu family is involved too.

75
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:09,790
I'd like to see

76
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,760
who this Gu Qingqiao really is.

77
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,300
She deceived Duan Yu like this.

78
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,670
His Lordship.

79
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,070
Mr. Qi.

80
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,910
His Lordship.

81
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,460
I'm back late.

82
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,880
How did you get hurt?

83
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,970
I'm fine, just a minor injury.

84
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,100
[Duan]

85
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,790
Did you find anything?

86
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:26,830
His Lordship.

87
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,510
As you expected, the Sacred Blood Sect disciples have reappeared

88
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,580
and have been secretly active.

89
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,659
My injury

90
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,960
was left when I fought with a disciple.

91
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,470
Unfortunately, I didn't find any survivors.

92
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,270
The Sacred Blood Sect really appeared again.

93
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,850
[Duan]

94
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,200
And Mr. Qi, you got injured too.

95
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,920
They're stronger than before.

96
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,150
Right.

97
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,230
That’s what worries me the most.

98
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,790
The Sacred Blood Divine Skill is only passed down to disciples of the inner altar.

99
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,850
But the person I met

100
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,630
didn't seem to be particularly skilled in martial arts.

101
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,990
Due to the enhancement of Blood Technique,

102
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,270
his power has multiplied.

103
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,330
If their disciples

104
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,350
all practiced the Blood Technique,

105
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,070
wouldn't it lead to a catastrophe for all living beings?

106
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,830
Now the Star of Rebellion has appeared in this world.

107
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,720
[Duan]

108
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,550
The Sacred Blood Sect will take more action in the future.

109
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,100
When Duan Yu returns from the Divine Palace,

110
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,070
he will surely bring guidance to the Duan family.

111
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,740
Yes.

112
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,070
But why

113
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,910
did Shaoyi get kidnapped by the Mantra Sect

114
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,430
just as Duan Yu went to the Divine Palace?

115
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,610
Could it be Gu Qingqiao and the kidnapper...

116
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,070
Crap.

117
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,780
Could it be that they are in cahoots with the Sacred Blood Sect,

118
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,430
so they used diversion tactics?

119
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,550
From what I know,

120
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,500
Miss Gu has nothing to do with the Sacred Blood Sect.

121
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,790
From what you know?

122
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,990
Can you really see through the secrets

123
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,550
a woman wants to hide?

124
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,909
If she really belongs to the Sacred Blood Sect,

125
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:44,030
our Duan family

126
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,270
is at risk.

127
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,659
Based on what I know,

128
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,830
the Sacred Blood Sect

129
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,710
still dares not act rashly against Young Master Shaoyi.

130
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,070
But we have to remain vigilant.

131
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,659
Yes.

132
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,620
Gu Qingqiao.

133
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,110
I need her alive.

134
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,510
No matter who she is,

135
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,700
I will expose her true colors.

136
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,400
Gu Qingqiao.

137
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,230
Your love story really captivates people.

138
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,490
No wonder Ruoyun likes dialogue novels.

139
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,230
That braised pork.

140
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,590
I wish I had ordered one
at Qingfeng Restaurant to try it out.

141
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,720
As long as we can safely get out of here,

142
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,570
you can eat as much as you want.

143
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:24,870
But

144
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,510
I feel strange thinking that

145
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,350
you'll be my aunt.

146
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:31,940
It's okay.

147
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,010
Don't feel pressured.

148
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,480
There's a saying that goes, "We have our own family relationship."

149
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,430
After I married Duan Yu,

150
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,030
you two are still uncle and nephew.

151
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,950
We are still brothers for life.

152
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,310
No, that doesn't sound right.

153
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,280
Brother and sister.

154
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,680
Anyway, that's how it is.

155
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,350
Well.

156
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,710
Sisters, brother and sister, uncle and nephew.

157
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:53,990
It's getting weirder.

158
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,830
Let's not dwell on it.

159
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,560
Given the current situation,

160
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:02,110
we need to figure out how to get out quickly.

161
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,150
Actually,

162
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,700
I do have an idea.

163
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,040
But I'm not sure if it will work.

164
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,630
I need your courage and cooperation.

165
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,250
Do you want me to die?

166
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,150
Do you have a better plan?

167
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,470
Fine.

168
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,030
It's better than waiting for death here.

169
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,080
I prefer

170
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,910
to have control over my own fate.

171
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,710
Let's go.

172
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,990
Get your look back first.

173
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:34,789
Or

174
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,600
we might be finished

175
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,030
before the plan starts.

176
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,920
Remember to tie me loosely.

177
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,310
You wanted to see me.

178
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,470
Did you think it through?

179
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,130
There are six of them in total.

180
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,710
I only saw five.

181
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,770
Where did the other person go?

182
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,260
Are you dumb?

183
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,110
My big brother is asking you.

184
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,590
I came to ask

185
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,790
when you're planning to let us go.

186
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,670
Are you going to hide in the cave forever?

187
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,490
You're an interesting woman,

188
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,310
daring to speak to me like this.

189
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,510
You are bold.

190
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,390
Tell me, how did you and the Right Guardian

191
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,590
contact each other?

192
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,030
We didn't contact each other.

193
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,470
You didn't contact each other?

194
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,270
Did you use secret codes, marks,

195
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,460
or specific places?

196
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,540
We've never communicated or contacted each other.

197
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,860
We've never met or known each other.

198
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,670
Do you understand now?

199
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,470
Do you think I'll believe you if you say that?

200
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,390
He stole the sacred object and hid in your house last time.

201
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,980
Were you also involved in

202
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,070
setting the trap at Qingfeng Restaurant?

203
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,790
Now you say you have no connection.

204
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,120
Who would believe that?

205
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,830
Tell me.

206
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,150
Where did the Right Guardian hide the sacred object?

207
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,510
If you tell me,

208
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,360
I'll consider letting you go.

209
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,860
Brother,

210
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,190
I really don't know where it is.

211
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,390
I'm here to talk this through.

212
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,510
If you let us go,

213
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,870
I can help you find the thing.

214
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,440
I think you're trying to get yourself killed.

215
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,470
You

216
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,300
and the Right Guardian are a perfect match.

217
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,030
You are both sharp-tongued.

218
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,830
I'll grant your wish

219
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,070
and bury you together.

220
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,590
Move!

221
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:26,870
Hurry up!

222
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,070
Sir,

223
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,500
please have mercy.

224
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,070
The person inside is very valuable.

225
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,990
If he dies,

226
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,790
you'll have trouble explaining.

227
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,150
Cut the crap.

228
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,190
Go back!

229
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,310
Fine.

230
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,190
Shaoyi!

231
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,790
Shaoyi, what’s wrong?

232
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,070
Oh my god!

233
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,590
Shaoyi, are you dead?

234
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,140
Oh my god.

235
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,390
I did it!

236
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,550
I was so nervous.

237
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,710
I did it.

238
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,280
Remove him from me!

239
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,710
I'll be crushed to death!

240
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,310
Is this really your first time?

241
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,020
Yes.

242
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,140
I promised I didn't lie to you.

243
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,950
It seems that you're a martial arts genius.

244
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,030
Not really.

245
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,710
Since arriving in Changqing,

246
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,270
I've become incredibly strong.

247
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,470
I wouldn't have been confident before.

248
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,790
B-But you did like this,

249
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,590
his neck would break.

250
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,190
Just now in the cave,

251
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,700
I saw there are six of them.

252
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,550
Apart from the two who beat us,

253
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,590
there are two guarding the entrance.

254
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,140
A-And him.

255
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,710
There's another man...

256
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,990
So there should be another exit.

257
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,830
Really?

258
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,990
What if it's not an exit?

259
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:47,470
We'll be

260
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,230
trapped in a dead end.

261
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:52,190
The entrance is guarded by two people.

262
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,780
We definitely can't get out.

263
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,040
By then, Archie and the others will come.

264
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,500
So our only hope

265
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,740
is another exit.

266
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:00,840
We can take a risk.

267
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,750
I felt a breeze just now in the passage.

268
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,780
This can't be a dead end.

269
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,770
Dead ends don't have wind.

270
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,180
Put on his clothes.

271
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,750
Let's go try it.

272
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,960
Your iron fist is impressive.

273
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,870
It seems to always work.

274
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,860
It's almost the ultimate technique.

275
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,620
Cut the crap. Be sensible.

276
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,270
Let's go.

277
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,030
Can you teach me your ultimate technique?

278
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,590
Run, or they'll find out.

279
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:28,790
Help!

280
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,420
Help!

281
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,710
They ran away.

282
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,410
All right, that's enough.

283
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,030
Let's go.

284
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,310
This is my home.

285
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,650
Why are you preventing me from going out?

286
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,050
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu.

287
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,310
My Master has ordered

288
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,710
that until Young Master Shaoyi is found,

289
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,640
no one is allowed to enter or leave.

290
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,110
How ridiculous!

291
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,450
What does your Young Master's disappearance

292
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,640
have to do with us?

293
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,160
I'm going out to find my daughter.

294
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,670
If you won't let me leave,

295
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,660
don't blame me for being rude.

296
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,830
Yes, step aside.

297
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:12,910
Sorry, Mr. Gu.

298
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,030
Tie him up.

299
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,590
What are you doing?

300
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,350
Don't move.

301
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,270
What are you doing?

302
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,790
What are you doing?

303
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,990
Gu Xingwu, I didn't expect you to experience this.

304
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,790
Let's see how you'll do business in Changqing.

305
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:34,660
Wait.

306
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,070
Wait.

307
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,510
No.

308
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,670
-I can’t run anymore.
-No, we can’t rest.

309
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,670
They martial artists run fast.

310
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,000
They will catch up soon.

311
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,580
No, I can't run anymore.

312
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,710
I can't run anymore.

313
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,190
Why are you so delicate, Young Master Shaoyi?

314
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,910
I’m not.

315
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,110
You're injured.

316
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,590
I was scared just now.

317
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,850
I didn't feel any pain.

318
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,070
Your leg must have been hurt when we came out just now.

319
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,310
You know how to bandage wounds?

320
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,270
I learned it from TV.

321
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,910
I didn't expect it would come in handy.

322
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,430
What kind of book is TV?

323
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,430
An encyclopedia.

324
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,470
Do you know you look weak right now?

325
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,300
Let me carry you.

326
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:12,990
No.

327
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,350
How can I let a woman carry me?

328
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,310
I'm not just a woman. I'm your aunt.

329
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,150
Let's go.

330
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,260
Hurry.

331
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,840
Someone's injured.

332
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,020
They won't get far.

333
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:34,990
Let's go.

334
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,650
You're burning up.

335
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,800
Leave now.

336
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:50,900
If you don't leave,

337
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,090
neither of us can escape.

338
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:52,830
No, no.

339
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:53,930
With our intelligence,

340
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,150
we can definitely escape.

341
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,430
No matter who runs first,

342
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,030
saving life is the priority.

343
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,350
Brother, look over there.

344
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,380
There seems to be someone over there.

345
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,580
Let's go check it out.

346
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,070
Come here!

347
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,160
Come here.

348
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,780
What's wrong?

349
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,870
Have you seen two people run past here?

350
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,150
No, really.

351
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,230
You two go that way.

352
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:15,750
Yes.

353
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,110
I don't believe they can fly.

354
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,270
Where did this blood come from?

355
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:29,910
Stop!

356
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,260
Chase them!

357
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,670
Stop!

358
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:35,950
Stop!

359
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:41,990
Young Master.

360
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,610
Young Master.

361
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,870
-Young Master.
-Xing Si.

362
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,630
Why are you here?

363
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,420
Young Master, I've been waiting for you here.

364
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,270
Something big has happened at home.

365
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,270
Sir.

366
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,150
Who are you?

367
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,030
You...

368
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,500
If I've offended you in any way,

369
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,100
please tell me, I can change.

370
00:15:59,310 --> 00:15:59,750
I...

371
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,800
I can give you all my money.

372
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,510
My first wife, second wife, third wife,

373
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,230
take your pick if you're interested.

374
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:05,790
Sir.

375
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,010
Don't be nervous.

376
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,450
I have something to ask you.

377
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,390
Go ahead.

378
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,230
I'll tell you everything I know.

379
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,220
Gu Qingqiao.

380
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,750
Gu Qingqiao and the Mantra cultists

381
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,350
kidnapped Young Master Shaoyi.

382
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,830
It was clearly planned in advance.

383
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:25,350
But before that, Young Master Shaoyi tried to kidnap her.

384
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,390
She turned the tables

385
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,890
and kidnapped him instead.

386
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,310
But she and those Mantra cultists.

387
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,830
It's obvious that they knew each other before.

388
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,110
They're clearly in league with each other.

389
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,750
This has nothing to do with me at all.

390
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,630
You must believe me.

391
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,020
I'm telling the truth.

392
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:36,830
Sir.

393
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:38,440
Sir!

394
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,280
Where are you? Say something.

395
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:44,150
Sir, I'll be uneasy if you don't make a sound.

396
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,470
Please don't kill me.

397
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,190
If you kill me, your hands will be dirty.

398
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,540
Sir, if you come to my restaurant,

399
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,740
I'll give you 20% off.

400
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,260
Or 30% off.

401
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,070
If it doesn't work, 40% off.

402
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,530
How about 40% off?

403
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,940
I'll lose money if I give you 50% off.

404
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,119
Tell me.

405
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,359
Where did you hide Duan Shaoyi?

406
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,790
With your intelligence,

407
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,230
you'll never know.

408
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,360
Duan Shaoyi is already injured.

409
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,630
He can’t go far.

410
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,340
My men will catch him.

411
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:38,790
You're going to all this trouble just to find me, aren't you?

412
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,120
Why bother finding him?

413
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,430
If anything

414
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,790
happens to him,

415
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,350
the Duan family will crush your Mantra Sect.

416
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,380
Can you handle that?

417
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,350
Gag her!

418
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,990
The reinforcements of the Mantra Sect are on the way.

419
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,550
We'll wait

420
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,980
and see.

421
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:04,980
Help me.

422
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,360
-Are you alright?
-Help me.

423
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,870
No.

424
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,110
Young Master Shaoyi.

425
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,530
-Shaoyi.
-Young Master Shaoyi, are you alright?

426
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:24,110
Shaoyi.

427
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:24,830
Uncle.

428
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,190
Go save...

429
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,550
-Shaoyi.
-I want to avenge Young Master Shaoyi.

430
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,470
Ruoyi. Ruoyi

431
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,050
Keep him alive.

432
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,200
Take Shaoyi away immediately.

433
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,430
My Lord, we are followed.

434
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,930
My Wuyi Guards are all around here.

435
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,750
Do you think you can escape?

436
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,390
Release Miss Gu and surrender.

437
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,410
I'll spare your lives for now.

438
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,030
You know Gu Qingqiao is in our hands.

439
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,270
If you're smart,

440
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:18,910
let my men go.

441
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,350
We each take a step back

442
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,280
and pretend nothing has happened.

443
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,390
Take a step back?

444
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,940
Nothing has happened?

445
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,140
My nephew is still unconscious and his life is uncertain.

446
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,630
I haven't killed you.

447
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,830
I've already taken a step back.

448
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,670
When I helped you untie earlier,

449
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,190
I didn't see the Nine-turn Melodious Bell.

450
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,510
Has Archie already taken it away,

451
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,670
or have you hidden it?

452
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,910
I have hidden it.

453
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,030
You're quite smart.

454
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,820
Cut the crap.

455
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,430
Let's go save people quickly.

456
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,030
How can you be so ungrateful?

457
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,030
If it weren't for me saving you,

458
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,310
how would you plan to escape?

459
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,310
Still thinking about saving people?

460
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,910
I'm afraid you'd be a dead man.

461
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,350
Fine. I owe you another favor.

462
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:01,910
Let's go.

463
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,990
Slow down. Who are you going to save?

464
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,510
Duan Shaoyi.

465
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,350
He was injured.

466
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,510
When we separated,

467
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,860
he had a fever and passed out.

468
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,260
We must find him quickly.

469
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,380
It seems like after I left,

470
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,150
a lot of things happened between you
and the Duan family of Changqing.

471
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,270
When did you get so close to the Duan family?

472
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,070
Let's go now.

473
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,070
It's not the time for this.

474
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,510
If we don't go now, he might not make it.

475
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,830
Where is the Nine-turn Melodious Bell?

476
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:23,760
Take me to get it.

477
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,320
After I get it, we'll

478
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,550
go our separate ways.

479
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,150
And then you can save whoever you want.

480
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:28,660
You...

481
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,610
Can you stop causing trouble?

482
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,230
I shouldn't have given you that thing in the first place.

483
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,710
Asking you to return it is for your own good.

484
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:35,910
Why did you go back on your word?

485
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,240
How is it for my own good?

486
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,750
What did I say when I gave it to you?

487
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,550
Have you forgotten everything?

488
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,230
I don't remember.

489
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,400
You don't remember?

490
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,310
Look at your current situation.

491
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,430
Don't you understand?

492
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,230
I told you

493
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,540
if anyone finds out about its existence,

494
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,030
they'll kill you.

495
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,230
But...

496
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,750
But I'm fine now.

497
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,700
Didn't you just say Duan Shaoyi's life

498
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,110
is hanging by a thread?

499
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,320
It's because of you.

500
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,660
Nonsense!

501
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,510
But...

502
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,870
What?

503
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,310
Give it back to me.

504
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:09,870
I...

505
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,710
I can't give it to you.

506
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,750
Where did you put it?

507
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:17,230
I...

508
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,310
I gave it to Duan Yu.

509
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,740
What's going on?

510
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,190
It's a signal from the Mantra Sect.

511
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,720
It seems their reinforcements have arrived.

512
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,830
We need to go inform the Duan family quickly.

513
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,030
I don't want anything to happen to Duan Yu

514
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:41,950
Don't bother.

515
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,520
He's right at the entrance.

516
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,090
Duan Yu is here.

517
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,070
I knew he would come to save me.

518
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,030
No.

519
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,470
He's in danger now.

520
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,390
I'm going to find him.

521
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,550
Are you stupid?

522
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,290
He's here to catch you.

523
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,990
I warned you earlier to be cautious of him,

524
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,250
but you didn't listen.

525
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,470
If you keep acting like this,

526
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,990
you'll end up killing yourself.

527
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,230
How could that be possible?

528
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,790
Duan Yu is not that kind of person.

529
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,250
I'm very clear about that.

530
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,500
I'll give you one more chance now.

531
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,820
I don't want the Nine-turn Melodious Bell

532
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,910
for now.

533
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,460
Leave with me.

534
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,310
Saving your life is more important now.

535
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,910
We'll come back to get it when there's a chance.

536
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:24,780
Okay?

537
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,550
If I leave with you like this,

538
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,430
it will harm Duan Yu.

539
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,870
No, I can't go with you.

540
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:31,990
I promised him that no matter what happened,

541
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,710
we would face it together.

542
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,630
Even if I die,

543
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,150
I want to die with him.

544
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,870
Could you be any more stupid?

545
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:38,710
I told you

546
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,230
you'll die if you go back.

547
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,430
He's here to catch you.

548
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,190
He won't die.

549
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,510
Only you will die.

550
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,980
I believe in myself.

551
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,760
You're even dumber than a pig.

552
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,940
You're not going?

553
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,190
I'll go by myself.

554
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,350
Duan Yu.

555
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,220
Did you take something you shouldn't have?

556
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,670
Just hand it over.

557
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:18,870
I can spare your life.

558
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,750
What a joke.

559
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,070
I never take anything from others.

560
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,660
It's you

561
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,480
who dare not show your face.

562
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,430
What difference does it make?

563
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:29,670
We

564
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,990
are old friends.

565
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,830
It's you.

566
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,710
Loser.

567
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,310
Hand over Qiao.

568
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,550
I can spare your life.

569
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,510
The tables have turned.

570
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,110
Don't be so arrogant.

571
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,390
I won't let you take Gu Qingqiao away.

572
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,950
Don't try to hurt her.

573
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,950
I'm afraid you're the one who wants to hurt her.

574
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:50,510
Nonsense!

575
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,270
You deceived Gu Qingqiao and took her Nine-turn Melodious Bell.

576
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,150
What's your intention?

577
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,230
I didn't deceive her.

578
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,140
Cut the crap.

579
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,460
Hand her over.

580
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,430
If you want her,

581
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,430
give me the bell to exchange,

582
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,510
or defeat me.

583
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:37,790
Duan Yu.

584
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,670
Are you blind?

585
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,150
I'm here.

586
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,580
It seems you're smart.

587
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:54,950
Too bad.

588
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,620
You're going to die here today.

589
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,280
Or you can give me the Nine-turn Melodious Bell,

590
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,870
I'll consider sparing your life.

591
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,830
Ghost Wall.

592
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,990
It must be Lu Zizheng's trick.

593
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,670
You can't trust your eyes.

594
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,110
Duan Yu is not here.

595
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,050
We're counting on you, Mr. Qi.

596
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:00,770
Yes.

597
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,430
Qiao.

598
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,780
Qiao, why are you here?

599
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:23,980
Are you hurt?

600
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,230
Duan Yu, you wanted to kill Gu Qingqiao?

601
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,000
I think you're tired of living.

602
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,290
Draw the sword!

603
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,610
You can't escape!

604
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,880
Star of Rebellion.

605
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,750
You can't escape!

606
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,450
We've gone through so much trouble

607
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,990
to catch this woman.

608
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,870
Don't underestimate her.

609
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,150
She may look harmless,

610
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,710
but she has quite a background.

611
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,670
I heard that she's a jinx.

612
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,410
If we keep her, the whole Changqing will suffer.

613
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,970
I think she'll be beheaded.

614
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,070
Stop it.

615
00:29:59,070 --> 00:29:59,590
It's unlucky.

616
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,150
Fine.

617
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:03,470
The identity of the Star of Rebellion must not be revealed.

618
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:06,420
Otherwise, you will be killed.

619
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:10,060
I'm the Star of Rebellion.

620
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,980
I warned you earlier to be cautious of him,

621
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,870
but you didn't listen.

622
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:14,470
If you keep acting like this,

623
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,350
you'll get yourself killed sooner or later.

624
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,750
Was I wrong

625
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,030
from beginning to end?

626
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,470
Star of Rebellion.

627
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,350
Surrender now!

628
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:31,110
What are you doing? Are you confused in the fight?

629
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,750
It's me, Gu Qingqiao.

630
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,610
Stop it.

631
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,700
If you take another step forward,

632
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,700
I'll kill you.

633
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,860
Are you serious?

634
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,750
Duan Yu, don't scare me.

635
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,010
Let's talk things out.

636
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,620
Are you Gu Qingqiao?

637
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,610
Who are you

638
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:55,220
to interfere when I'm talking to Duanyu?

639
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,030
How dare you!

640
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,030
This is my elder brother.

641
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,030
Duan Yan, the Master of the Duan family.

642
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:00,910
Star of Rebellion.

643
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:03,570
Stop deluding yourself and acting recklessly.

644
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,150
My brother may spare your life.

645
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,150
Move.

646
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,350
You were fine when you left.

647
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,590
What happened to you on the way here?

648
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,550
Didn't we agree

649
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,950
to have noodles together

650
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,830
and be together forever when you come back?

651
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:27,550
We'll face and bear everything together.

652
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,640
Have you forgotten?

653
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,040
Don't be silly.

654
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,590
All those

655
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,310
were lies.

656
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:41,430
I only did it to stabilize you and test you.

657
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:44,740
No, you're lying.

658
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,380
I can feel it.

659
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:47,990
You like me.

660
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,120
We're getting married.

661
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,230
Stop being stubborn.

662
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,290
You're the Star of Rebellion.

663
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:04,150
You're an accomplice to the enemies of my Duan family.

664
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,670
How could we get married?

665
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,300
What enemies' accomplice?

666
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,130
Explain yourself.

667
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:16,110
Women are so naive.

668
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,720
Enough, Duan Yu.

669
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,230
Stop wasting your breath with her.

670
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,760
Tie her up and take her away.

671
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,960
Tie Gu Qingqiao up!

672
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:37,910
Yes.

673
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,150
Duan Yu, explain to them.

674
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,580
Have you misunderstood?

675
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:42,920
Magistrate Du.

676
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:45,230
She has kidnapped my son.

677
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,220
Leave her to me.

678
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,280
There's no need to bother you.

679
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:54,410
How can protecting people from suffering be considered a bother?

680
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:57,750
Gu Qingqiao has committed numerous wrongdoings,

681
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,630
colluded with the Mantra Sect,

682
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,950
and disturbed the peace of Changqing.

683
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:06,470
We are not aware of other crimes she might have committed.

684
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:09,430
I must take her back for thorough questioning.

685
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,990
Thank you for your cooperation

686
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,850
to bring her to justice.

687
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,270
The support from the Duan family

688
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,870
is truly a blessing for Changqing.

689
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:23,530
All right.

690
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,470
Take her away.

691
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:28,580
Move!

692
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:32,590
Young Master.

693
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,910
Miss Gu is in the prison.

694
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,230
It's already a stroke of luck in the midst of misfortune.

695
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:38,110
Think about it.

696
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,350
When the Master

697
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:41,390
didn't know Miss Gu's identity,

698
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,220
he already laid into her.

699
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,910
Now that her identity as the Star of Rebellion has been exposed.

700
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,770
If she falls into Master's hands,

701
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,790
then she really would be in grave danger.

702
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,550
That's why

703
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,150
I asked you to take Magistrate Du with you.

704
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,150
It's all my fault.

705
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:01,030
My plan wasn't thorough enough.

706
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,750
The situation was too complicated.

707
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,750
I didn't expect

708
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,460
him...

709
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,310
Master to do it himself.

710
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,710
I regret so much now.

711
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:10,790
I couldn't find Qiao earlier.

712
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,679
And I wasted too much time with Archie.

713
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:15,790
Now,

714
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,030
I even regret not letting the Right Guardian

715
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,469
to take her away.

716
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:23,830
Young Master, don't blame yourself too much.

717
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,750
You've done a lot.

718
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:27,190
Besides,

719
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,710
if she had really been taken away by the Right Guardian,

720
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:32,239
what about the prophecy of the Divine Palace?

721
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,550
Divine Palace.

722
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:44,280
You are indeed the destiny I can't escape.

723
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,270
Farewell.

724
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,630
Remember.

725
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,830
All things are connected.

726
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,230
The true answer

727
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:57,790
must be found by yourself.

728
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:01,870
No.

729
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,110
This isn't the end.

730
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,350
There must be a way.

731
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,350
Our priority

732
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:09,130
is to find a chance to save her.

733
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:11,900
But this is too difficult.

734
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,720
We have to evade the government's detention,

735
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:17,410
and we have to stabilize Master at the same time.

736
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:18,270
Besides,

737
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:21,110
Miss Gu seems to know nothing.

738
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,630
The way you treated her that day.

739
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,990
I'm afraid you've broken her heart.

740
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,410
It's better than losing her life.

741
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,230
Once her heart is broken,

742
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,350
she will have no further relations with me.

743
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,150
Young Master.

744
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,470
She is innocent.

745
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:42,270
I don't want her to be involved in this.

746
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,270
You are right. Young Master.

747
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:46,230
Otherwise, Master will be suspicious again.

748
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,630
Miss Gu's personality

749
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,470
is not a good thing for Master.

750
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:50,790
Besides,

751
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:53,640
she always speaks those weird languages.

752
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,830
It also proves that she's not an ordinary person.

753
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:56,710
Xing Si.

754
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,790
Only if she hates me more,

755
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,390
will I have more chances to save her.

756
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:03,940
After all,

757
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,670
there's nothing more important

758
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,870
than saving her life.

759
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,100
I hope

760
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,320
she can understand one day.

761
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,550
I wonder

762
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:21,190
if there will be that day.

763
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,870
Qi, is this the pattern?

764
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:41,810
This is

765
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,840
on her feet.

766
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,790
When I got this pattern from the Divine Palace back then,

767
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:48,550
I was worried

768
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:51,020
that I wouldn't be able to understand its secrets in advance,

769
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:54,150
and I couldn't find the Star of Rebellion before the Sacred Blood Sect did.

770
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,980
I was worried about the downfall of the Duan family,

771
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,590
and the suffering of the world.

772
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,400
Now it seems

773
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:03,790
you have already found the trail of the Sacred Blood Sect.

774
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:06,050
Duan Yu has caught the Star of Rebellion.

775
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,730
It seems that heaven is helping our Duan family.

776
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,990
The most important thing now

777
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,910
is to figure out the purpose of the Star of Rebellion,

778
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,020
and then

779
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,750
quickly eliminate the Sacred Blood Sect

780
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,070
to prevent future troubles.

781
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,070
But right now, the Star of Rebellion has been put

782
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,300
in the prison.

783
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:22,250
It is quite inconvenient.

784
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:25,020
I know what Du Huaichang is thinking.

785
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:27,550
At first, he acted like he was terrified

786
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,030
to help us analyze the situation where my son was kidnapped.

787
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:32,140
Then, he relied on the power of the Duan family's Wuyi Guards

788
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,400
to pacify the trouble of the Mantra Sect.

789
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,130
When everything was settled,

790
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:37,710
he showed up.

791
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:41,420
And he took away Gu Qingqiao under the pretext of colluding with the Mantra Sect

792
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,680
and kidnapping my son.

793
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:43,750
The hunter

794
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:46,990
becomes the hunted.

795
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,430
And he was trying to restrain me.

796
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:53,230
Since he dares to do this,

797
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,230
he probably has already planned it out.

798
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:58,790
Yes.

799
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,670
As long as he wants something,

800
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,100
we can take him down.

801
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,390
I'll

802
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,590
have Gu Qingqiao.

803
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,190
I'll give Du Huaichang

804
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,510
the respect he wants.

805
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:11,950
After all, our families will be in-laws in the future.

806
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:16,270
He just wants to show off

807
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,550
that he's a magistrate.

808
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,090
And he's too good for our Duan family.

809
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:24,590
Young Master is a rare talent among men.

810
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,280
While you were away,

811
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,470
he was managing the Chamber of Commerce and addressing the famine.

812
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:30,710
The people have been full of praise for Young Master.

813
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:33,570
And our Duan family's reputation has been soaring.

814
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:36,870
I think we're too good for Magistrate Du.

815
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:38,350
When I returned to Changqing,

816
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,060
I heard many rumors

817
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,470
about Duan Yu and Gu Qingqiao.

818
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,390
It seems that a lot has happened

819
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:44,670
during my absence.

820
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:45,670
Just rumors.

821
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,310
They're not true.

822
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:49,070
Master, don't take them seriously.

823
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,500
You still don't know my younger brother enough.

824
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,790
He seems cold,

825
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:55,230
but he's actually a loyal person.

826
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:59,350
If he only tested Gu Qingqiao,

827
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:02,640
why would he bring her to the Chamber of Commerce?

828
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:06,350
I'm worried that if he falls in love,

829
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:08,950
it could lead to a disaster.

830
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,210
I believe Young Master

831
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:13,550
is someone who considers the overall situation.

832
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:14,870
Do something for me.

833
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:19,670
My Lady.

834
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,420
How is it? Did you find out?

835
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,180
My Lady, don't worry.

836
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:25,670
The Duan family is doing well.

837
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,700
It's just that Young Master Shaoyi has been injured

838
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,710
and hasn't woken up yet.

839
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:30,510
He may need a few days of rest.

840
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,710
What about Duan Yu?

841
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:32,590
Is he alright?

842
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,350
He's fine.

843
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,630
Don't worry, My Lady.

844
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,630
Young Master Duan is safe and sound.

845
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,750
That's good.

846
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,530
I was afraid he'd get hurt.

847
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,910
Young Master Duan was uninjured.

848
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:44,590
It's said that he personally caught Gu Qingqiao.

849
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,790
He was holding a sword

850
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,020
to her throat,

851
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,430
like this.

852
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,670
Duan Yu personally caught Gu Qingqiao?
