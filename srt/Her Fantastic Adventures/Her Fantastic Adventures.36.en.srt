Did you light it?

14
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,930
It's very humid down here.

15
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,520
The torch couldn't be lit.

16
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,020

If he doesn't kill me,

00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,760
he wouldn't be willing to die.

00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,540

00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,960
I told you

194
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,680
when we bought it.

195
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,560
I gave it to you.

196
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,320
Why are you returning it to me?

197
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,570
The ring symbolizes locking a heart.

198
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,880
When we each wear a ring,

199
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:41,880
it means

200
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,840
we lock each other.

201
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,480
You must wear it.

202
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,160
This is a declaration of sovereignty.

203
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,800
This little thing declares our relationship?

204
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:52,680
Yes.

205
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,000
It tells others

206
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,760
that you have someone in your heart.

207
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,020
You're not available.

208
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,720
Qiao.

209
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,670
Why did you give me a ring?

210
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,200
If you wear the ring here,

211
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,830
it is connected to the heart.

212
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,330
It means that our hearts are connected.

213
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,640
I've never heard of that.

214
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,680
Of course.

215
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,740
This is...

216
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,310
a saying from my hometown.

217
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,400
Hometown?

218
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,320
There is no such saying in our hometown.

219
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,080
What?

220
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:18,920
You don't want it?

221
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,650
Give it back.

222
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,920
Since you gave it to me,

223
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,180
you can't take it back.

224
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:24,830
Pretentious.

225
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,860
Duan Yu.

226
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:36,930
I want you to call me Qiao again.

227
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,360
Can you?

228
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,150
Qiao.

229
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,340
Say it a few more times.

230
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,520
Qiao.

231
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,240
Qiao.

232
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,480
Qiao.

233
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,870
So nice.

234
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,270
It sounds beautiful.

235
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,810
Your voice is so beautiful.

236
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,450
Duan Yu.

237
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,280
You must live on.

238
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:10,360
For me...

239
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,150
Qiao.

240
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,180
Qiao.

241
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,800
Qiao, you can't sleep.

242
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,660
You can't sleep.

243
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:30,280
There are many things you haven't told me.

244
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,400
We still have...

245
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:37,440
We still have a long life to spend together.

246
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,630
Qiao.

247
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,280
Chunjiao!

248
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:56,440
Mom.

249
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,080
What brings you here?

250
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,840
Are you stupid?

251
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,570
Where else could I be?

252
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,350
I want to celebrate for you.

253
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,370
I...

254
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,820
I won the gold medal?

255
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,120
Look what's on your neck.

256
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,070
The first place.

257
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,230
It's really a gold medal.

258
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,290
Shouldn't I be in the Divine Palace?

259
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,630
Why am I here?

260
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,650
What Divine Palace?

261
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,680
Celebrating is the most important.

262
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,990
Chunjiao, come here.

263
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,610
Chunjiao.

264
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,400
Chunjiao!

265
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,340
Duan Yu.

266
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,210
Master Ruan.

267
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,720
Shaoyi.

268
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,450
What Master?

269
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,080
You've read too many martial arts novels.

270
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,850
Come on.

271
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,760
Stop talking.

272
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,610
Eat more meat.

273
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,360
Chunjiao.

274
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,450
Congratulations.

275
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,070
Thank you.

276
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,280
Here comes mutton skewers.

277
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,680
Everyone here today

278
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,400
are all Chunjiao's benefactors.

279
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,360
You all contributed to her gold medal.

280
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,160
So,

281
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,440
please enjoy yourselves.

282
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,720
Make yourselves at home.

283
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,280
-Come on.
-Okay.

284
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,040
-Okay.
-Enjoy.

285
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,470
Okay.

286
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,280
Eat more.

287
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,090
Thank you, Chunjiao's mom.

288
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,150
Thank you, Auntie.

289
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,250
Why are you looking at me like that?

290
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,480
Don't be too grateful.

291
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,200
I'm scared.

292
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,600
Who's thankful towards you?

293
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,320
Bad guy.

294
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,380
Qiao.

295
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,610
Qiao.

296
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,080
Wake up, don't sleep.

297
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,900
Wake up!

298
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,720
Chunjiao, what's wrong?

299
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,850
Mom.

300
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,900
I still have something to do.

301
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,920
What is it?

302
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:27,860
Mom.

303
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,400
Please wait for me.

304
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,760
It's not yet time for me to come back.

305
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:35,730
This is good.

306
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,600
It tastes good.

307
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,550
Try it.

308
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,900
Isn't it delicious?

309
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,940
Stop looking at me.

310
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,300
Looks like we don't have to wait anymore.

311
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:12,870
You...

312
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,850
You are still alive?

313
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,690
Qiao.

314
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:21,690
Qiao.

315
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,840
Put me down.

316
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:29,960
Qiao.

317
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,150
Did you think we would kill each other

318
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,440
in order to live?

319
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,650
Impossible.

320
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,600
Only one person

321
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,240
can get out of the Human Poison Pit.

322
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,370
I killed to leave the Human Poison Pit.

323
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,990
It's impossible.

324
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,420
There's always more than one way.

325
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,210
Whether you kill to leave alone

326
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,800
or

327
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,240
fight to live together.

328
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,240
It depends on a moment's thought.

329
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,170
The way out is right in front of you.

330
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,260
When you are desperate,

331
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,720
maybe turning back

332
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,530
can give you a slim chance of survival.

333
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,570
Turning back?

334
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,520
How is that possible?

335
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,640
Lu Zizheng.

336
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,720
Return the Nine-turn Melodious Bell to me.

337
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,250
Gu Qingqiao, let me ask you.

338
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,800
How am I inferior to him?

339
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,490
How is Duan Yu better than me?

340
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,320
Why?

341
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,080
Why do we have to go this far

342
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,740
no matter which life we're at?

343
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,760
I'll tell you in my next life.

344
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,320
In the next life?

345
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,600
My Lord.

346
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,840
Kill them.

347
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,180
Hand over the Four Treasures.

348
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,300
You have no choice.

349
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,390
Qiao.

350
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,360
Don't!

351
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,800
Qiao.

352
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,480
Here.

353
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:32,440
My Lord.

354
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,320
My Lord.

355
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,130
Are you okay?

356
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,080
I'm going to kill you!

357
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,020
Let her go!

358
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,320
Let her go.

359
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,400
Qiao.

360
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,640
Go now.

361
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,750
Go home.

362
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,450
Great!

363
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,880
You are all alive.

364
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,790
I thought you were dead.

365
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,000
I thought I would never see you again.

366
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,120
You scared me.

367
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,840
Big sis.

368
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,370
What are you talking about?

369
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,170
You were the one who almost died.

370
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,910
What?

371
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:32,800
Nothing.

372
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,720
I'm sorry.

373
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,730
Chunjiao.

374
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,960
You were knocked out.

375
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,760
You were in a coma for a long time.

376
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,550
It seems

377
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,760
she became dumb.

378
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,680
Lu Zizheng.

379
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,170
Chunjiao!

380
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:46,760
Chunjiao!

381
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,240
You're awake.

382
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,730
Mom.

383
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,370
I'm so worried.

384
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,080
Chunjiao.

385
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,940
We're leaving.

386
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,520

387
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,280
Have a good rest.

388
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:54,720
How are you?

389
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,720
We won't disturb you.

390
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,280
See you.

391
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,540
Talk to me.

392
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,770
I'm leaving.

393
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,760
Tell me what you remember.

394
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,320
What?

395
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,960
Was everything that happened before fake?

396
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,770
Was it just a dream?

397
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,150
Gu Qingqiao,

398
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,480
do you know why I killed so many people?

399
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,920
I'm the Leader of the Sacred Blood Sect.

400
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,040
You are my destined bride.

401
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,440
This is destiny.

402
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,680
That's why you have the power

403
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,040
to go back to the past

404
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,010
to relive all the good memories again

405
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:42,870
and no longer commit evil.

406
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:43,680
Impossible.

407
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,080
I'm not.

408
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,010
I'm not your accomplice.

409
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:47,720
Yes.

410
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,200
You are not my accomplice.

411
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,200
You are my bride.

412
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,100
For many lifetimes.

413
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,130
It's fate.

414
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,360
The moment the incense was burned at Shangqing Temple,

415
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,560
it has already begun.

416
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,260
You can't change it.

417
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,600

418
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,310
Don't be bewitched by him.

419
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,700
Everything

420
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,310
is an illusion.

421
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,580
No!

422
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:56,730

424
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,000
Mommy is here.

425
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,880
I'm here.

426
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,690
Did you have a nightmare again?

427
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,450
Don't be afraid.

428
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,330
The doctor said

429
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,610
as your brain activity recovers,

430
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:21,800
you'll get better.

431
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,100
Be good.

433
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,840
Cheers.

434
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,790
Here comes the braised pork.

435
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,420
That's enough, you're exaggerating.

436
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:44,970
Eat it while it's hot.

437
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:45,940
Auntie.

438
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,120
Did you make all these?

439
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,960
Of course.

440
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,480
It's not easy for you guys to get together.

441
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,710
I have to cook it myself.

442
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,610
Auntie,

443
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,420
I'm sorry for eating your braised pork

444
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,580
for so many years.

445
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,550
You did eat a lot.

446
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,320
But

447
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,220
Chunjiao said

448
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,510
she survived thanks to you.

449
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,370
So

450
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,150
you're all her lifesavers.

451
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,060
So

452
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,240
I don't mind

453
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:13,030
treating you to more pork.

454
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:16,320
Mom,

455
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,790
they are your shareholders.

456
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,740
Come on.

457
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,580
The Glory of Meat is yours.

458
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:21,290
I mean,

459
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,690
all of you.

460
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:25,450
The youth training center is mine.

461
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,770
The youth training center is mine too.

462
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,920
It's ours.

463
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,360
Chunjiao.

464
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,730
When you woke up after being in a coma,

465
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,120
we became your lifesavers.

466
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,630
And then we suddenly became shareholders of the Glory of the Meat.

467
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,390
Are you scamming us?

468
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,210
I didn't scam you.

469
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,120
You begged to invest.

470
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,470
It's all because you told us

471
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,770
the heartbreaking story of your dream about Changqing.

472
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:52,760
Tell me.

473
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,860
Are you scamming our money?

474
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,060
What?

475
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,440
You don't want to?

476
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,410
It's none of your business.

477
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,290
Fine.

478
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,960
You are all superstars and big designers now.

479

Fine, I was wrong.

480
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,630

Auntie.

487
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,300
People say that we should get married early.

488
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,340
Otherwise, we'll be left behind.

Look at you.

494
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,560
I'm not going to nag you.

495
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,560
You should be more sensible.

496
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,000

I need to talk to you.

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,760
opening a branch.

563
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,640
I missed the right timing to say some things,

564
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,570
so I don't want to say them anymore.

00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,330

What's wrong with you today?

573
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,720
Because Shaoyi is getting married,

574
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,880
it triggered our past issues.

575
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:15,160
What do you truly think?

576
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,410
I haven't decided yet.

00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,970
Duan Yu has been back for almost a year.

580
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,280
Don't you know

581
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,200
who you want?

582
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,780
One day,

583
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,870
the ducks will fly away

584
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,040
and you'll be the only one left.

585
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:39,090
Lu Zizheng grew up with me.

586
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,560
In front of him,

587
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,640
I can burp,

588
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,280
fart, get angry,

589
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,760
and be myself.

590
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,640
But I know

591
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,730
that's not love.

592
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,760
Say it.

593
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,040
For Qi Chunjiao.

594
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,450
I know.

595
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,430
I know you're only back for a project

596
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,530
and you'll go back sooner or later.

597
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:58,600
So,

598
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,270
I want you to think about

599
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:02,120
your relationship with Chunjiao.

600
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,280
Don't worry about me.

601
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,230
Mind your own business.

602
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,740
You're busy with fan signing every day

603
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,340
and taking care of your fans.

604
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,880
You're no better than me.

605
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,160
But I am always by her side.

606
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,330
I am within her sight.

607
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,370
Do you know

608
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:19,280
what she saved my contact as on her phone?

609
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,560
Don't show off just because you have some money.

610
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,500
Don't forget.

611
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,920
I'm also a shareholder

612
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,880
of Glory of Meat.

613
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,920
My name on her phone

614
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:27,880
is The Creditor.

615
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:29,720
She saved my name as that

616
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,850
not because I'm rich

617
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,240
and also not because I invested

618
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,090
in Glory of Meat.

619
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,280
It's because the moment she had a phone,

620
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,640
she saved my name as that.

621
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,800
Where were you then?

622
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,640
Do you know

623
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,800
what it means to have your name saved as The Creditor

624
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,000
from such a young age?

625
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,840
Because as long as I had one yuan,

626
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,000
she would have 50 cents.

627
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
As long as I have a bite,

628
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,130
she would have half.

629
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,370
I helped her with her homework

630
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,940
and took the blame for her.

631
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,000
Besides fighting,

632
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,530
she needs my help every single moment.

633
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:57,630
Duan Yu,

634
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,050
back then, you chose to reject Chunjiao

635
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,200
because of your studies

636
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,280
to study abroad.

637
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,320
You have no idea how sad she was.

638
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,590
You will also give up on her

639
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,040
for your career.

640
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,270
So,

641
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,630
I won't allow you to hurt her again.

642
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:14,670
You don't like Duan Yu?

643
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,840
I do.

644
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,500
I've liked him since I was a kid.

645
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,920
I liked him in my dream.

646
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,600
I still like him now.

647
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,320
But just like what he told me,

648
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,230
he won't change his decision

649
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,710
for anyone.

650
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,600
I don't want him to change his dream

651
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,530
because of me.

652
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,440
What should you do then?

653
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,770
You can't stay single forever.

654
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,650
I can choose not to marry.

655
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:45,660
Mom,

656
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,760
why are you so eager to

657
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,200
get me married?

658
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,360
I want to stay with you for a few more years.

659
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,800
Actually,

660
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,300
I've always liked her.

661
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,040
I liked her since I was in school.

662
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,000
But my family and relatives

663
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,240
are abroad.

664
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,040
Shaoyi and I are the only ones here.

665
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,430
We must go back.

666
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,930
We were destined to leave.

667
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,320
So at that time,

668
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,960
I couldn't lie to her.

669
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,950
Stop your pitiable affection for her.

670
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,200
If you hadn't rejected her,

671
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,840
she wouldn't have argued with her mother

672
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,960
like a lunatic every day

673
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,880
and got hit.

674
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,160
Her mind

675
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,120
stuck in the dream of Changqing

676
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,050
which is full of life and death?

677
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,600
You are a coward and selfish jerk.

678
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,000
You’re worse than Duan Shaoyi.

679
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,080
Even Duan Shaoyi is getting married.

680
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,800
But we don’t know

681
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,160
what we want.

682
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,200
Yes.

683
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,730
Shaoyi is getting married.

684
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,840
Why can’t I?

685
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,160
You can't.

686
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,210
As long as I'm here,

687
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,320
I won't let you lay a finger on her.

688
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,040
Dream on!

689
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,680
Silly girl.

690
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,080
Then you can only

691
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,430
hurt yourself.

692
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,100
Aren't you afraid that if you cherish them for too long,

693
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,150
you'll lose everything

694
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,340
and can't even be friends with them anymore?

695
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,200
Mom.

696
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,200
Having you guys

697
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,040
makes me the happiest person in the world.

698
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,280
Since my dad passed away,

699
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,330
when I woke up from the coma,

700
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,990
I especially cherish

701
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:20,880
everyone around me.

702
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,970
When I think of someone leaving me,

703
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,280
I feel so sad.

704
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,640
Chunjiao.

705
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,360
I know

706
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,240
you still haven't woken up from that dream.

707
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,920
It's all my fault.

708
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,610
Mom.

709
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,720
You are the best mother in the world.

710
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,200
I will never

711
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,240
ever leave you.

712
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,470
Mom.

713
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,880
I don't have to get married, right?

714
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,400
Silly girl.

715
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,520
When you see fireworks outside,

716
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,930
smell the scent of food from your neighbours,

717
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,330
and witness families holding hands on the street.

718
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,520
If you can hold back your tears,

719
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,520
then you can.

What a pity.

760
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,970
You don't remember.

761
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,360
Of course I remember.

762
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:03,680
You wore a checkered dress

763
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,810
a hair band

764
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,830
