00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,270
You think the holy relic

193
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,810
of the Fire Crane Tribe is just a thing.

194
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,770
Please leave.

195
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,530
We will never sell

196
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,330
the holy relic of the Fire Crane Tribe.

197
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,460
Bad news!

198
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,820
Lord Witch Doctor.

199
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,080
Someone from the Moon Wolf Tribe is here.

200
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,850
Lord Witch Doctor, why are you...

201
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:28,250
Please protect the Fire Crane Tribe.

202
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,700
The Moon Wolf Tribe will be here soon.

203
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,490
You're wasting time.

204
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:32,970
Hush.

205
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:33,960
Show some respect.

206
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,490
You...

207
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,370
Shaoyi.

208
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,760
Here.

209
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:39,900
I have an idea.

210
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,530
Kill them!

211
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:05,980
There's an ambush!

212
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,990
Retreat!

213
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,020
It's Duan Yu.

214
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:26,570
Okay.

215
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:27,470
They left!

216
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,980
They left! That's great!

217
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,300
Great!

218
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,100
Great!

219
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,380
Great!

220
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,810
The Moon Wolf Tribe will definitely seek
revenge.

221
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,880
They will come back again.

222
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,790
For the Fire Crane Tribe,

223
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,410
the purpose of the holy relic

224
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,020
is to protect our people

225
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,820
when the Moon Wolf Tribe attacks.

226
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,630
If I can stop the Moon Wolf Tribe,

227
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,540
could you give us the holy relic?

228
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,690
You really care about your nephew.

229
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,940
However,

230
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:15,300
I don't need to worry since the holy relic
will protect our tribe.

231
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,540
I give it to you.

232
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,090
When I first met Wu,

233
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,230
she was being sold as a slave.

234
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,450
If the holy relic could really protect your
people,

235
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,380
why would she fall into the hands of the
bandits?

236
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,820
But she survived.

237
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,000
But many people didn't survive.

238
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,220
Do you want to see your people

239
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,980
live a life without any clothes or food?

240
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:40,110
I'm really touched by what you said.

241
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,460
However,

242
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,620
I have a request.

243
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,010
Please go ahead.

244
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,770
You must

245
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,720
use your own power

246
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,380
to stop the Moon Wolf Tribe

247
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,780
from attacking the Fire Crane Tribe

248
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,160
once and for all.

249
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,930
Our people believe in fate.

250
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,930
If you can defeat the Moon Wolf Tribe,

251
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,450
I have reason to believe that the holy relic

252
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:12,500
belongs to a powerful person like you.

253
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,380
Okay.

254
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,930
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

255
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,250
Uncle.

256
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,250
Uncle.

257
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,780
Do you have to go?

258
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,340
Let's find another way.

259
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,800
The Moon Wolf Tribe has a power army.

260
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,730
You're going to die if you go alone.

261
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:34,900
Shaoyi.

262
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,730
The Lord Witch Doctor told me,

263
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,540
the holy relic is called Meridian Gate.

264
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,660
It's one of the the Four Treasures.

265
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,500
I must get it for Qiao.

266
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,420
Don't worry about me.

267
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,260
Don't worry.

268
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,760
Young Master.

269
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,300
I’ll go with you.

270
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,460
I won't be worried if you protect Shaoyi.

271
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,260
Young Master.

272
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,090
Enough.

273
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,540
I still have something important to do.

274
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,610
I won't die easily.

275
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,010
What?

276
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,580
Your uncle went to the Moon Wolf Tribe
on his own for the holy relic.

277
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,380
That's right.

278
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,980
I'm very worried about him.

279
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,010
I want to help him.

280
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,750
Why does he have to get the holy relic?

281
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,190
Didn't he recover already?

282
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,780
Because of his loved one.

283
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,060
For the one he loves,

284
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,580
he'd rather sacrifice his own life.

285
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,540
I didn't get it in the past.

286
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,660
But since I met you,

287
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,100
I understand.

288
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,940
If it's for you,

289
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,780
I'm willing to do it too.

290
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,490
Then,

291
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,060
if your uncle dies,

292
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,690
will you be sad?

293
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:50,320
Yes,

294
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,860
it'll be worse than my own death.

295
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:58,520
Don't worry.

296
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,550
Your uncle will come back safely.

297
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,140
Wu!

298
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:06,540
Wu!

299
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,170
So boring. Let's not wait any longer.

300
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,050
Bai. Bai.

301
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,340
Don't worry about it.

302
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,600
Wait for the good show.

303
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,210
What if she doesn't know how to dress up?

304
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,860
If she couldn't do it,

305
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,850
I'll think about

306
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,040
letting Bai dress up as a girl.

307
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:42,700
No,

308
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,900
whoever proposed it should do it.

309
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,780
Stop arguing.

310
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,420
Don't you have any confidence in Fu Rong?

311
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,210
Yeah.

312
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,260
Junior Lu,

313
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,540
isn’t she always beautiful?

314
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,550
You’d better dress yourself as a girl.

315
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,540
I can think of someone.

316
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,100
Who is it?

317
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,300
Master Ruan.

318
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,560
Master Ruan.

319
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,460
Senior Fu Rong,

320
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:15,740
Get out of my way.

321
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,900
is a natural beauty.

322
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,300
She looks so pretty with a little makeup on.

323
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:19,820
Qing.

324
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,760
Senior Fu Rong, you’ve changed your
appearance.

325
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,480
You.

326
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,160
So annoying.

327
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:25,900
Go away.

328
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,370
Didn't Qing say

329
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,550
that I'm a natural beauty?

330
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,580
Yes.

331
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,970
Don't say it if you don't know what to say.

332
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:34,620
Nonsense!

333
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,580
Ridiculous!

334
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:36,370
What?

335
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,520
What honey trap?

336
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,290
That's inappropriate.

337
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,150
Go change it back.

338
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,250
None of your business.

339
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,220
I want to do it.

340
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,580
Do you want get beaten?

341
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,530
It's my business.

342
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,820
Beat me if you want.

343
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,720
Do you want get beaten?

344
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,300
Come on!

345
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,780
Yes, it's my business.

346
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,460
-How dare you!
-Beat me if you want.

347
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,130
What's wrong with him?

348
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:56,330
This is probably the sense of crisis of
male creatures.

349
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,660
I'm having a bit of deja vu here.

350
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,780
Where are you going?

351
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,740
I know.

352
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,070
Don't you think

353
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,010
they look like Bai and our Junior?

354
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,740
So beautiful.

355
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,130
[Xiling Sect]

356
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,260
Miss,

357
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,650
are you here to see a doctor?

358
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,580
I've heard a lot about you.

359
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,100
I'm here to see you.

360
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,070
How are you feeling unwell?

361
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,260
My heart hurts.

362
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,100
Come on.

363
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:44,940
Sit.

364
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,980
Second Senior, you're in my way.

365
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,060
I can't see.

366
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,630
He touched her.

367
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,340
That bastard is touching her!

368
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,220
Hold on.

369
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,070
Senior, you must endure it.

370
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,350
Miss,

371
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:02,080
your liver is not very good.

372
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,550
You get angry easily, right?

373
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,000
The weather is dry.

374
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,380
Maybe I have inflammation.

375
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:14,069
Your pulse is getting faster.

376
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:16,060
Are you feeling nervous

377
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,900
because of me?

378
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,420
By the way,

379
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,730
there's something wrong

380
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,500
at the spa center recently.

381
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,820
I had a lot of red rashes

382
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:35,140
after I took a bath at the spa center.

383
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,340
Can you help me?

384
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,980
I can,

385
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,140
but

386
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,020
how are you going to repay me?

387
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,770
Sir, you'd better tell me first

388
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,090
why there are rashes.

389
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,740
It's because the water there is not clean.

390
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,170
Since it's the water problem,

391
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,340
I don't need to see the doctor anymore.

394
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,620
I'll tell you the truth.

395
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,580
Actually,

396
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,990
you are poisoned.

397
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,580
And I'm the only one

398
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,840
who have the antidote.

399
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,780
If you want to treat the rashes,

400
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,650
let me take a look.

401
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,380
I need to see the antidote first.

402

Only by verifying the antidote,

403
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,320
I will believe you are not a fraudster.

404
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,340
How can I be a fraudster?

405
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,900
Let me ask you.

406
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,340
Are those rashes itchy?

407
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,220
They have blisters in the middle.

408
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,820
The poison is called lovesickness.

409
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,390
Just a little bit of this poison,

410
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,330
and you'll feel very itchy.

411
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:34,090
Why do you know so much about this poison?

412
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,790
Because this poison is

413
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,530
a specialty of the Herbal King Valley.

414
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,640

there was a thief at the Tianshan Residence.

The Senior's medicine got switched.

491
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,670
He's always nervous about medicine.

492
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,100
He thought

493
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:28,450
the thief was careless

494
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,350
when searching for something.

495
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,230
Could it be he didn't remember correctly?

496
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,180
I told him the same thing.

497
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,010
But I think,

498
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:43,260
someone did sneak into Tianshan Residence.

499
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,930
That's a pretty bold thing to do.

500
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,900
How could he break into Master's Tianshan Residence?

501
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,340
So I was thinking,

502
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,980
is it possible that the thief

503
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,890
is at my place right now?

504
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,620
No thief would dare to break into top
residence in the world.

505
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,950
Why would he want to die?

506
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,430
Just in case.

507
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,920
I'm prepared.

508
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,590
Already prepared?

509
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,250
What did you prepare?

00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:32,910

536
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,530
Exactly.

Ruan Siqiong is suspecting that we are
looking for the sword,

but he doesn't have any evidence.

548

What should we do?

552
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:31,830
Should we run away?

553
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,380
I'll figure something out.

554

You didn't come back last night.

561
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,900

00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:12,660
Nothing.

570
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,540
It's really you.

571
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:21,830
No.

572
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,010
You're so handsome.

573
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:23,750
No.

574
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,570
Qing.

575
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,050
Master Ruan.

576
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:44,610
Why are you here again?

577
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,800
Just looking around.

578
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,330
I haven't seen Bai for several days.

579
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,820
The weather is so nice today.

580
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,220
It might rain soon.

581
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,730
I'll put away my clothes.

582
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,880
Brother.

583
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,580
Brother!

584
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,150
Brother!

585
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,990
Brother!

586
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,100
Brother!

587
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,260
Are you laying eggs?

588
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,220
Is this an appropriate time?

589
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,610
You are still in the mood to joke?

590
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:17,740
Master Ruan is looking for you everywhere.

591
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,690
The scent on me is getting stronger.

592
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,980
I can't be in public anymore.

593
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,180
If it doesn't work,

594
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,230
let's run away.

595
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,210
Just wait.

596
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:27,930
You should avoid meeting Ruan Siqiong.

597
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,130
Be careful.

598
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,260
It's finally quiet.

599
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,070
Why isn't this pool divided for men and
women?

600
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,600
It's separate.

601
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,030
Which one is for men and which is for women?

602
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,610
Men on the left and women on the right.

603
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,900
I think Qing said that before.

604
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,620
Qing said that?

605
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,810
When did I ever say that?

606
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,770
Master, what a coincidence.

607
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:58,870
We meet again.

608
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,220
It's quite inappropriate

609
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:04,540
to meet like this.

610
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:07,460
Yes.

611
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:08,930
By the way, the temperature

612
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,850
of that small pool is warmer.

613
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,980
Why don't you two change to that one?

614
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,220
Sure.

615
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,310
Why don't you leave first?

616
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:18,740
I can't leave.

617
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,740
I'm on duty today.

618
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,930
If you don't leave,

619
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:24,140
how can we get to that pool?

620
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:24,740
Well.

621
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,020
That's right.

622
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,640
I better get going.

623
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,240
Let's go.

624
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,210
Master Ruan,

625
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:35,180
do you want to...

626
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,100
You...

627
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,960
I'm sorry.

628
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:40,420
I...

629
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,940
Can you say everything at once?

630
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,900
No need. I'll stop talking.

631
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,020
I'll do it.

632
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,210
Take a look.

633
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,660
Did she really leave?

634
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,540
Yes, she did.

635
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:04,580
She's gone.

636
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,080
Why are you back?

637
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,220
I brought you a bath towel.

638
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,050
We...

639
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,460
We don't need this.

640
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,340
It's up to me to bring it or not.

641
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,380
It's up to you to use it or not.

642
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:28,150
Master Ruan,

643
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:30,170
what's with the scar on your chest?

644
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:31,430
Is it caused by a sword?

645
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,600
It's an old injury.

646
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,800
Where are you from?

647
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,990
Where are you going?

648
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,730
Warrior, I came from the Central Plain.

649
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,410
I wanted to sell this fine spirit

650
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,140
to the warriors in the savanna.

651
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,800
We are the best warriors in the savanna.

652
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,270
The men of the Moon Wolf Tribe

653
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,730
are warriors like wolves.

654
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,810
Looks like your wine

655
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:16,320
can only stay with us.

656
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,180
It's my honor

657
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,090
to serve wine to the warriors.

658
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,190
Okay.

659
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,240
Follow me.

660
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:23,850
Okay.

661
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:35,460
Come on, cheers.

662
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,620
Cheers.

663
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:39,190
Warrior, you're a good drinker.

664
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:39,840
Here.

665
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,550
You are a smart guy.

666
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,180
When the wine has been offered to the Chief,

667
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,040
I could give you some good horses,

668
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:48,260
so you can return to the Central Plain
safely.

669
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,740
I really hope you can recommend me

670
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,900
to meet the Chief.

671
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,620
Don't worry.

672
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,070
It won't be a problem.

673
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,530
Let me fill your cup.

674
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:56,080
Okay.

675
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:57,740
Boss.

676
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,480
I caught a spy.

677
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,400
Where have you been?

678
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:05,920
I spent a lot of money to buy you,

679
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,200
but you ran away.

680
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,590
Thank you for helping me find her.

681
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,920
I will punish her.

682
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,980
So she's your slave.

683
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,140
She's quite pretty.

684
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,090
How about

685
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:20,930
letting us play with her?

686
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:21,850
Good.

687
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,140
Come on.

688
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,710
Have a drink with me.

689
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,180
What are you waiting for?

690
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,300
Go pour some wine.

691
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,240
What are you doing?

692
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,100
Go, feed the horses.

693
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:40,820
Stop!

694
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,540
Warrior!

695
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,340
Just a slave.

696
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,970
This woman

697
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,520
looks quite familiar.

698
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,020
You look like the woman who ran away.

699
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,460
You abducted me and sold me.

700
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,940
You are a devil.

701
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,000
It's really you.

702
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:09,030
You are the one who came to us today.

703
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,460
Brother,

704
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,270
he is our enemy.

705
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,400
Guys.

706
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,500
Kill them!

707
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:49,690
Don't move!

708
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,740
Your hand...

709
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,300
It's okay.

710
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,490
It's my fault for holding you back.

711
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,060
I wanted to help you.

712
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:20,150
Does Shaoyi know you are here?

713
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,420
No.

714
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,820
Then why did you follow me?

715
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,900
He said if you died,

716
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,280
it would be worse than his own death.

717
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,460
Shaoyi also said

718
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:29,300
that he could sacrifice his own life

719
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,970
for the one he loved.

720
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,740
You guys from the Central Plain can do that.

721
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,500
So can I.

722
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,580
You're such a sincere girl.

723
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,020
Wu.

724
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:38,750
Change of plan.

725
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:39,930
Follow me.

726
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,010
I need your help.

727
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,460
What are we eating today?

728
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:52,470
What are you thinking?

729
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:56,500
You...

730
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,640
Why did you come out here?

731
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,620
Don't you need to hide from Master Ruan?

732
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,500
It's okay now,

733
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,780
so I can come out.

734
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,200
What's the matter?

735
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,020
Nothing.

736
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:05,740
I just have a bad feeling.

737
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:07,820
In a few days,

738
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,020
it would be okay.

739
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,420
You solved it?

740
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,219
How did you solve it?

741
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:15,690
Don't try to stop me.

742
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:16,179
You can't go in there.

743
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,739
Someone from Xiling must have stolen it.

744
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:19,460
Don't try to stop me.

745
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,179
Ridiculous!

746
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:21,900
Why would a Xiling disciple steal from you?

747
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,420
What's wrong?

748
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,520
What's going on?

749
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,040
You came at the right time.

750
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:27,130
You're the Grand Steward of Xiling Sect.

751
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:28,730
I want to report a complaint.

752
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,380
A disciple of Xiling Sect

753
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,260
stole my poisonous Immortal Not Saving You.

754
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,820
Who knows if you're the thief or not?

755
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,489
Exactly.

756
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:37,540
Immortal Not Saving You.

757
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,300
Isn't it the most poisonous poison in the
world?

758
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,100
That's right.

759
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,040
That's the most poisonous poison in the world.

760
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:45,340
I urge you to give it back to me.

761
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,340
If someone use it to harm people,

762
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,250
even I can't help them.

763
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,810
Did you take it?

764
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,630
Shut your mouth, Sausage Head.

765
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:56,050
Did you steal it?

766
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,150
What are you doing?

767
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,540
-Get out!
-What are you doing?

768
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:01,300
Who stole my Immortal Not Saving You?

769
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,330
Give it back!

770
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:03,930
Let's go.

771
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:05,730
Qing, what's the urgent matter?

772
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:09,460
I'm thirsty.

773
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,800
I'll get you another cup.

774
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,530
Master Ruan.

775
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,220
Qing.

776
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,680
What are you doing?

777
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,050
This tea set is a bit old.

778
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,550
Let me get you a new one.

779
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,920
That's oolong tea from early spring.

780
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,230
It's not poisonous.

781
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,620
What?

782
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,100
What poison?

783
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:33,250
How could your tea be poisonous?

784
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,060
Qing.

785
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:39,700
Are you here for the Black Wood Human-shaped
Sword?

786
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,900
Master Ruan, what are you talking about?

787
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,030
I don't understand.

788
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:45,690
If there's nothing else, I'll be going.

789
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,500
You opened the forbidden area.

790
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,530
You went to the Tianlu Pavilion in the
middle of the night.

791
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:53,330
You sneaked into the Tianshan Residence
and dome.

792
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:56,860
Don't you want know where

793
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,820
the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword is?

794
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,650
Master Ruan,

795
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,180
Go.

796
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,610
No, you can't defeat him.

797
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:06,940
I'm asking you to leave.

798
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,100
Brother!

799
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:28,660
Idiot!

800
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,780
Didn't I ask you to leave?

801
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,580
Why do you want the Black Wood Human-shaped
Sword?

802
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:34,850
If I told you,

803
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,750
would you let my brother go?

804
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:41,410
I promise you.

805
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:44,820
Okay. Go.

806
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:56,640
Fine.

807
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,310
Master Ruan.

808
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,170
I believe you're a man of your word.

809
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:02,220
I want the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword

810
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,370
to save lives.

811
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,340
Save lives.

812
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,940
Someone told me

813
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,020
if I get the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword,

814
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,220
I can save her life.

815
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,290
Who is that person?

816
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:11,820
My

817
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,620
My mom.

818
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,500
Dongfang Qiushuang.

819
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:19,340
I see.

820
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,730
Okay, I got it.

821
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:25,270
I'll help you find the Black Wood Human-shaped
Sword

822
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,590
What did you say?

823
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,670
Did I hear you right?

824
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,620
Are you trying to deceive me

825
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:34,930
before killing me?

826
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,500
What can I do to make you believe

827
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:41,530
that I really want to help you find the Black
Wood Human-shaped Sword?

828
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:42,650
How about writing

829
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,100
a pledge first?

830
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:48,860
I, Ruan Siqiong,

831
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:56,100
is willing to help Qing find the Black Wood
Human-shaped Sword,

832
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,540
and promise

833
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:00,130
I will not hurt Qing.

834
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:04,180
And I won't let her get hurt.

835
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,410
Your real name is Qing?

836
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,340
It's my nickname.

837
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,560
Master Ruan, put your fingerprint on it.

838
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,180
Wait.

839
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:19,620
I don't think the language is precise
enough.

840
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:28,610
Ruan Siqiong will keep Qing safe.

841
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:33,500
And the ownership of the Black Wood
Human-shaped Sword

842
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,780
belongs to Qing.

843
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,570
The final explanation of this agreement

844
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,540
belongs to Qing.

845
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,850
The agreement is valid

846
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,130
indefinitely.

847
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:52,930
Do you promise?

848
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,530
If you promise, Master Ruan,

849
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:57,060
you should put your fingerprint on it too.

850
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,100
I have to keep you safe.

851
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:02,060
It's for additional security.

852
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:08,890
[The agreement is valid indefinitely]

853
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:10,710
Master Ruan,

854
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,970
this is so childish.

855
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,460
I learned it from you.

856
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,930
When are we going to get the sword?

857
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:18,880
Not to hurry.

858
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:20,260
Why?

859
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,220
Didn't you promise

860
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,340
you'll give me the Black Wood Human-shaped
Sword?

861
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,570
You just signed the contract and you want
to breach it?

862
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:26,140
No.

863
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,060
The Black Wood Human-shaped Sword is in the
Jiuqing Secret Cave.

864
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,530
Only my master, the head of Xiling Sect,

865
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:37,220
Zhang Sifeng can open it.

866
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:38,930
When will the Great Master come back?
