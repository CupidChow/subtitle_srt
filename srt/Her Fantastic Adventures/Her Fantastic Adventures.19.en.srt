How could you pass away?

00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,310
You were so young.

Master Ruan.

10
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,130
I think it's fishy.

11
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,480
Why?

12
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,160
If Senior Guan wanted to commit suicide,

13
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,360
why did he plan to visit a patient today?

14
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,640
I think there's something fishy about this too.

15
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,970
But if Senior Guan didn't commit suicide,

16
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,600
that means someone deliberately put his shoes by the river

17
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,600
and made it look like a suicide case.

18
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,030
Could it be

19
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,530
a murder?

I think

24
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:46,630
we should investigate it completely.

26
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,590
When I went down from the mountain,

27
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,190
I've sent a letter to Master.

28
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,470
Maybe Master has already returned to Xiling.

00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,970
If we set off now,

30

00:02:57,829 --> 00:03:00,160
Master Ruan, are we talking about the same thing?

32
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,620
I'm talking about the murder of Senior Guan.

33
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,440
We have to find out the truth.

34
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,870
What if you miss the chance to get the sword

35
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,260
because of the investigation?

36
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,590
We will have another chance

37
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,630
to get the sword.

38
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,550
Senior Guan died for no reason.

39
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,710
I feel sorry for him.

40
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,820
Although you came for the sword,

41
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,640
you have struck up a close friendship with the disciples of Xiling.

42
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:23,829
I'm very pleased.

43
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,570
I hope you can protect Xiling

00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,970
after getting the sword.

45
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,500
Protect Xiling?

46
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,710
It's not my turn.

47
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,590

00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,470
Don't be nosy.

58
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,470
His death has nothing to do with us.

59
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,510
Why?

60
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,430
He is our Senior.

00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,830
I never treated him as my Senior.

63
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:07,790
Why are you so heartless

64
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,230

Didn't you say we would bury the coffin in seven days?

97
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,310
Why are you in such a hurry now?

98
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,570

00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,840
we should let him rest in peace as soon as possible.

Yesterday, the government officials and coroners

103
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,630

If we ask for their help,

108
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,260
they will give Guan a more thorough autopsy than coroners.

109
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,110
I'm willing to guarantee with my life.

110
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,250
If I find out who killed Junior Guan,

111
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,960
I will avenge his death.

Guan Mu is a member of the Xiling Sect.

113
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:57,630

114
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:58,810
Fine.

115
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,120

117
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,780

118
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,800
Please stand up.

119
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:10,930
Please stand up.

120
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,360
This is the yard where we used to feed the animals.

121
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,490
Now it's deserted.

122
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,350
You may put the coffin here.

126
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,110
please don't let the guests know

127

that there is a dead man here.

128
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,850
Don't worry.

129
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,000
Can you stop walking in circles?

130
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,659
I feel dizzy even if you don't.

131
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,590
Why don't you give them a hand?

132
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,330
Aren't you ashamed to be idle here?

133
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,650
Why should I help?

134
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,290
Aren't they capable?

Humans have been living in groups since we were monkeys.

Upper Cave Men, our ancestors,

138
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,970
evolved by helping each other.

139

You're always alone.

140
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,230
Think about it.

141
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,100

No, I won't.

143
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,630
Who told you

144
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,800
that humans were evolved from monkeys?

145
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,790
And what are cavemen?

146
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,280
Can you stop talking nonsense?

147
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,090

Master Ruan, where are you going?

152
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,110
Master Ruan, what are you going to do?

153
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,260
I think Guan Mu

154
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,430
might have died from a strange movement in martial arts.

155
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,740
What movement?

156
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,840
Someone I know

157
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,720
might be able to give us the answer we want.

158
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,170
Here we are.

159
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,270
Your friend

160
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,950
lives in a remote place.

161
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,590
Let's go in.

162
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,540
Why is there a tombstone here?

163
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,760
[Here lies Shan Yao, my beloved wife]

164
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,510
This is the tomb of Senior Shan Yao.

165
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,630
Senior?

166
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:34,510
Fifteen years ago,

167
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,549
the Great Master led seven masters to fight against the Sacred Blood Sect.

168
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:39,409
They suffered heavy casualties.

169
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,990
After the battle, five masters passed away

170
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,400
while two were missing.

171
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,490
Only my master

172
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,010
survived because he didn't join the fight

173
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,670
due to his injuries.

174
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,520
I remember Senior Bao said

175
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,630
two masters of Xiling were missing.

176
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:54,570
That's right.

177
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,500
But we didn't lose their whereabouts.

178
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,840
After the battle with the Sacred Blood Sect,

179
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,900
they decided to live in seclusion.

180
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,190
Who's there?

181
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,280
Senior.

182
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:08,250
It's me.

183
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,790
Why are you here?

184
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:11,970
You are not welcome here.

185
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,290
Master.

186
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,100
Greetings from Qing of Li San Hall.

187
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,440
Although I've just become a member of Xiling,

188
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,600
I've heard a lot about other masters.

189
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,750
Back then, seven masters worked together

190
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,320
to repel the Sacred Blood Sect

191
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,650
in exchange for the peace of Xiling today.

192
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,920
A disciple of Xiling died tragically recently.

193
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,650
Do you really want to ignore it?

194
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,180
Please leave.

195
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,100
Master Ruan.

196
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:53,930
Is he Master Song Qi who is said to be missing?

197
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:58,390
It seems he doesn't want to see you.

198
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,350
Junior.

199
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,620
There must be a reason for Master

200
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,870
to choose you.

201
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,780
You need to believe in yourself.

202
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,970
You can support the future of Xiling.

203
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,070
Compete with me.

204
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,090
One more round.

205
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,920
Junior,

206
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,310
you are still young.

207
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,760
It's normal to lose to Qi.

208
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,790
Okay.

209
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,300
Let's stop.

210
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,000
The exchange martial arts skills

211
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,400
stops at where it should.

212
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,710
One more round.

213
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,260
That's all for today's training.

214
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,910
Dismiss.

215
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,040
Master Ruan.

216
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,300
What should we do next?

217
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:56,620
Let's wait here.

218
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,150
If you're tired,

219
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,120
go back and rest.

220
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,280
I'm not tired.

221
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,970
Good morning, Master Song.

222
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,390
You...

223
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,290
We bought you hot steamed buns.

224
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,600
If you like it,

225
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,200
I'll send it to you every day.

226
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,530
Are you threatening me?

227
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,480
I dare not.

228
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,450
I've never seen you before.

229
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,980
I would like to seize every chance

230
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,570
to take care of you.

231
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,270
What a bootlicker!

232
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,220
Let's go inside.

233
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,180
[Dear Shan Yao, now I am accompanied only by my shadow. Why couldn't we die together?]

234
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,440
Have a try.

235
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,010
It smells so good.

236
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,680
Master Ruan, let's try it.

237
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:04,120
This tea is made from dried bamboo leaves.

238
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,810
My wife taught me this method.

239
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,590
The person in the painting

240
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,110
is your wife, right?

241
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,160
She's so beautiful.

242
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:12,630
Yes.

243
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,710
[Dear Shan Yao, now I am accompanied only by my shadow. Why couldn't we die together?]

244
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,550
She is the most beautiful woman in my heart.

245
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,270
Unfortunately,

246
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,450
she passed away ten years ago.

247
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,250
The tomb in the yard

248
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:22,720
is hers.

249
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,040
Master Song.

250
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,070
I'm sorry.

251
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,630
I didn't mean to mention it.

252
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,440
It's okay.

253
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,200
It happened many years ago.

254
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:30,850
By the way,

255
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,350
how is First Senior?

256
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,070
Master is fine.

257
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,110
He enjoys being strict with us.

258
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,770
Fortunately, I joined in Xiling not long ago,

259
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,350
which spared me many hard trainings.

260
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,470
First Senior

261
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,480
was the biggest trouble maker back then.

262
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:46,940
I didn't expect

263
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,380
he could be Master now.

264
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,520
How time flies!

265
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,420
Master Ruan was the youngest disciple among you in Xiling, right?

266
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,300
When you entered the Sect,

267
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,180
Shan Yao said

268
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,450
you would be extraordinary in the future.

269
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,510
Not surprisingly,

270
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,360
you've become the best martial artist in the world.

271
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,620
Thank you for your care

272
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,190
when I was young.

273
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,650
The dead can't be revived.

274
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,370
It's useless to talk about it.

275
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,170
Tell me.

276
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,710
What do you want me to do?

277
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,440
Senior.

278
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,050
A disciple of Li San Hall died from homicide.

279
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,990
I would like to invite you

280
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,910
to check the body of that disciple.

281
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:36,110
Maybe we can find out what kind of martial art he died from.

282
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,260
I don't care about the Martial Arts World anymore.

283
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,600
I don't want to get involved in disputes anymore.

284
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,400
Senior.

285
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,360
Have some tea.

286
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,020
Master...

287
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,310
Master Song is such a devoted man.

288
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,820
He even set his wife's tomb at home.

289
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,730
He planned to die with Shan Yao.

290
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,460
I stopped him.

291
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,260
He's doing his best

292
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,730
to stay alive now.

293
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,360
I saw many kites

294
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,530
and flowers being watered in Master Song's house.

295
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,390
He knows how to live a better life.

296
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,030
Senior Shan Yao

297
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,160
liked kites and camellias the most.

298
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,630
Everything in Senior Song's house

299
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,350
is maintained

300
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,620
as it was when Shan Yao was alive.

301
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,180
Only in this way

302
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:42,070
can Senior Song let go of the pain in his heart temporarily.

303
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,190
Master Ruan.

304
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,830
Why did Senior Shan Yao die?

305
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,130
Because of me.

306
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,830
Master, please show some mercy.

307
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,960
Please save Shan Yao.

308
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,840
Senior.

309
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,360
Master is in retreat.

310
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,020
Shan Yao is seriously ill.

311
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:08,800
I heard

312
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,070
only Black Wood Human-shaped Sword

313
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,330
could extend her life.

314
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,700
But this sword

315
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,660
is stuck in the Jiuqing Secret Cave

316
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,640
where only Master can enter.

317
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,490
Junior.

318
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,880
Master likes you the most.

319
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:21,820
I beg you.

320
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,750
Please ask Master to come out from his retreat

321
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,790
and save Shan Yao.

322
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,040
Using Black Wood Human-shaped Sword

323
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,640
is not as simple as you think.

324
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,880
Junior.

325
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,430
Yao treats you

326
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,170
like her younger brother.

327
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,260
How can you stand by and let her die?

328
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,820
Master.

329
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:37,740
I know

330
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,570
you must be hating us for leaving the Sect.

331
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,430
That's why you don't want to help us.

332
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,830
As long as you can save Shan Yao,

333
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:46,420
I'm willing to apologize with my death.

334
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,470
Master.

335
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,030
Leave here.

336
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,060
I can't give you the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword.

337
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,990
Siqiong, see the guest off.

338
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,250
Please go back now, Senior.

339
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,349
Master, please open the Jiuqing Secret Cave.

340
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:10,230
Don't I want to save Shan Yao?

341
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,720
If Shan Yao wants to live,

342
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:15,579
she must give her heart to the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword.

343
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:16,470
If so,

344
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,180
you will die.

345
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,329
Senior Shan Yao and Senior Song Qi have helped me a lot.

346
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:22,589
It'll be my way to repay their kindness

347
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:23,670
if I can sacrifice myself

348
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,260
and help them.

349
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,770
How can life be calculated like this?

350
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:31,480
It's wrong for me to take you into the Jiuqing Secret Cave.

351
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,340
I can't let the curse of the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword

352
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,750
continue.

353
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,110
Even if Shan Yao can live,

354
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,410
she will become a walking dead

355
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,200
like you.

356
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,030
Senior Shan Yao.

357
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,390
What are you doing here?

358
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,720
What are you doing here?

359
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,700
Song Qi.

360
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,700
Song Qi.

361
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:07,540
Shan Yao.

362
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,460
Shan Yao.

363
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,070
Song Qi.

364
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:10,750
I'm here.

365
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,110
You must promise me.

366
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,480
Okay, I'll promise you.

367
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,550
Don't blame Master.

368
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:22,430
He must have his reason for not saving me.

369
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,190
Fine.

370
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:23,950
Song Qi.

371
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:24,770
I'm here.

372
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,370
I want to fly kites with you again.

373
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:37,630
Shan Yao.

374
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,670
Shan Yao.

375
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,780
Shan Yao.

376
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,070
Shan Yao.

377
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,510
Wait for me on the Abyss Bridge.

378
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,910
I'll come to you soon.

379
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:54,640
Senior Song.

380
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:55,770
Senior Song.

381
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,060
Fire! Run!

382
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,480
Senior Song, run!

383
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,100
Shan Yao!

384
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,860
-Go! Senior Song! -Shan Yao!

385
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,830
Let's go! Senior Song!

386
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:08,870
-Let go of me! -Let's go.

387
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,940
Shan Yao! Shan Yao!

388
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,870
Shan Yao! Shan Yao!

389
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,950
Although I saved Senior Song Qi,

390
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,290
he turned into a different person

391
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,670
living the same life day after day.

392
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,790
After I met you,

393
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,880
I've kept thinking about what happened back then.

394
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,960
I often feel the pain I had never felt before.

395
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,200
I hate what I did.

396
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,890
But everything has happened.

397
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,430
There's no turning back.

398
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,410
Master Ruan.

399
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,980
I once heard that

400
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,460
everyone dies three times in a life.

401
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,090
A person dies for the first time

402
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,070
when his heartbeat stops.

403
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,370
That means he dies biologically.

404
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,790
He dies for the second time

405
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,230
when his friends go to his funeral

406
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,590
to express condolences.

407
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:02,470
At that time, he dies in society.

408
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,000
He dies for the third

409
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,230
and the last time

410
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,830
when everyone once remembered him

411
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,710
forgets him.

412
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,300
That will be the real death.

413
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,140
You mean...

414
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,870
I mean

415
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,580
if Master Song Qi has never forgotten Senior Shan Yao,

416
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:21,030
she is not really dead.

417
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,430
Only by cherishing every day of life

418
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,960
can you remember those who we lost better.

419
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,030
Thank you.

420
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:29,950
Qing.

421
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,580
I hope you will never experience my regret.

422
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,750
Please allow my curiosity.

423
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:43,170
Can the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword really save people?

424
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,760
I don't know.

425
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,600
But I hope it's true.

426
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:49,900
In this way,

427
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,780
maybe you don't have to

428
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,600
be as helpless as I do

429
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,170
when you see your beloved ones pass away.

430
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,700
Master Ruan, actually I...

431
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,700
Actually, I just want to say

432
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,580
maybe we should go eat something.

433
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,200
Yes.

434
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,350
Have you found him?

435
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,020
No.

436
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:12,590
And you?

437
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:13,710
-No. -No.

438
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:14,480
What about you?

439
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,680
-No. -Where can he go?

440
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,920
What's wrong?

441
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,510
Master Ruan.

442
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,080
Junior Bai hasn't come back.

443
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,250
I'm worried about him.

444
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,270
My brother hasn't come back yet?

445
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:22,870
No.

446
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:23,570
It's late.

447
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:24,450
Junior Guan

448
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,920
died strangely not long ago.

449
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,520
We want to go out and find him.

450
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,200
Go ahead.

451
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,960
I'll go with you.

452
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,550
Okay.

453
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:32,720
Let's go.

454
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,390
Let's go.

455
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,110
Let's go.

456
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:35,680
Let's go.

457
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,460
Junior Bai.

458
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:37,900
Brother.

459
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,750
-Bai. -Bai.

460
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,150
-Junior Bai. -Junior Bai.

461
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,110
-Brother. -Junior Bai.

462
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,870
-Junior Bai. -Bai.

463
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:43,750
-Brother. -Junior Bai.

464
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,910
-Bai. -Junior Bai.

465
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:45,870
This won't work.

466
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,090
Fu Rong, let's go there.

467
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,470
Split up and search.

468
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:49,510
-Okay. -Okay.

469
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,350
Let's go.

470
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,840
Let's go this way.

471
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,830
-Let's go. -Junior Bai.

472
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,630
-Junior Bai. -Bai.

473
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:55,720
-Junior Bai. -Where is he?

474
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,790
Junior Bai.

475
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,390
Brother.

476
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,000
Bai.

477
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,390
Junior Bai.

478
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,190
Junior Bai.

479
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,540
So annoying!

480
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,430
Brother.

481
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,090
It's already dawn.

482
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,280
Go back and rest.

483
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,060
My brother is skilled in martial arts.

484
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,920
He will be fine.

485
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,550
It's fine.

486
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,090
Let's have some food and water.

487
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:25,090
Then we'll continue to look for him.

488
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,530
I'll go.

489
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:27,510
I'm energetic.

490
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,780
You may have a rest now.

491
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,380
Take it.

492
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,820
At this moment,

493
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,500
my brother is still causing trouble for us.

494
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,000
It's okay, Junior Qing.

495
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,240
Junior Bai keeps everything to himself.

496
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,770
He might be sad,

497
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,260
but we didn't care about him enough.

498
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,910
Don't you think you are out of line?

499
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,020
We looked for you everywhere,

500
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,710
but you're eating here.

501
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,610
I came back just now.

502
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,200
Just now?

503
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,470
Why didn't you tell me?

504
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,700
He's here. He's here.

505
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,180
What?

506
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,490
You weren't here just now.

507
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,520
We've been looking for you all night.

508
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,380
We kept calling your name.

509
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,600
Didn't you hear us?

510
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:12,630
No.

511
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,070
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

512
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:14,550
Enough.

513
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,990
Don't make a fuss early in the morning.

514
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,550
Here, have some.

515
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:19,470
Junior Bai.

516
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,170
Where have you been all night?

517
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,760
We've been looking for you.

518
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,790
I just want

519
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,560
to find a quiet place to be alone.

520
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,370
Be alone?

521
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,850
What's wrong with you?

522
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:29,980
All right.

523
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,360
Since Junior Bai is back,

524
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,490
we can rest assured.

525
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:33,710
Let's take a rest.

526
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,710
Let's take a rest.

527
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,900
Go back. Go back. Go back.

528
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:42,630
Here.

529
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:46,230
Have some.

530
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,140
I thought you left me behind.

531
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,300
I really planned to.

532
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,880
But then I thought about it.

533
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:54,890
I was worried

534
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,270
if you were left behind.

535
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,330
Really?

536
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,230
No.

537
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,500
I chose to stay

538
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,070
to find out the truth of Guan Mu's death

539
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,470
and go back to Xiling to get the sword.

540
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,800
What else is in your mind

541
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,280
besides the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword?

542
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,580
Where did you and Ruan Siqiong go last night?

543
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,690
We went to find Master Song Qi who lived in seclusion.

544
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,120
I heard that he was skilled in martial arts.

545
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,450
We wanted him to help us find out the cause of Guan Mu's death.

546
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,270
But for some reason,

547
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:23,950
he didn't want to come with us.

548
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,970
There's something fishy about Guan Mu's death.

549
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,170
If he was murdered,

550
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,750
I suspect the murderer is here for Xiling

551
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,430
or for us.

552
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,650
Find a way to get close to Song Qi

553
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,410
and find out the truth.

554
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:43,630
We've asked everything.

555
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,960
They all said they didn't see Junior Guan.

556
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,650
Could it be possible

557
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:50,050
that someone deliberately hid something?

558
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,790
Did you ask the people of Herbal King Valley?

559
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:54,920
What do you mean?

560
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:57,950
Maybe people from Herbal King Valley know something.

561
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,510
Besides,

562
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,960
aren't they still visiting patients in Qingshui Town?

563
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,280
Let's go.

564
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,160
Wait for me.

565
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,390
Tell me.

566
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,740
What's your symptom?

567
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:30,990
[Herb]

568
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,710
Bai?

569
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,250
Fu Rong?

570
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,120
Why are you here?

571
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,030
What are you looking at?

572
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:36,990
Shen You.

573
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,910
I want to ask you something.

574
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:39,740
I know.

575
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,450
I loved you.

576
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,050
I'll beat you if you make fun of me again.

577
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:44,760
Lord Shen.

578
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:46,350
Have you seen Junior Guan?

579
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,030
Yes.

580
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:47,610
You did?

581
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,990
Or no?

582
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,790
Shen You.

583
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,390
Junior Guan was killed two days ago.

584
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,780
Someone saw you talking to him by the river.

585
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,310
Yes.

586
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,830
I did talk to him.

587
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,060
What's wrong?

588
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,660
What did you say to him that day?

589
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,570
I said...

590
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,850
Why should I tell you?

591
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,260
I think you really want to be beaten.

592
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,610
Actually, not that much.

593
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:07,370
Then tell us.

594
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,830
I saw him.

595
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,510
I told him that you were looking for him.

596
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,030
He said he would visit a patient.

597
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:13,600
After that,

598
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,900
we said goodbye.

599
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,070
When was that?

600
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:19,240
Around dawn.

601
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,940
I remember it was still early.

602
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,710
The sun just started to rise.

603
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:26,230
If we had gone down the mountain earlier,

604
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:29,470
Junior Guan wouldn't have been killed.

605
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,640
How can you be sure

606
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,900
that it's homicide rather than suicide?

607
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,350
Didn't you say he needed to visit a patient?

608
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,130
Master Song Qi.

609
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,580
We're here to show our condolences to Senior Shan Yao.

610
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,360
She is kind-hearted.

611
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:54,760
She's quite similar to Shan Yao.

612
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,800
Yes, she is.

613
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,790
I really don't want her

614
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:02,050
to experience what we have experienced.

615
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:05,830
Senior.

616
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,200
Please help me

617
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,470
for the sake of our friendship.

618
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,510
Master Song.

619
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:18,180
I know it'll be difficult for you to go back to the Martial Arts World,

620
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,740
but we can't

621
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,000
let Senior Guan die for nothing.

622
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,420
Even if there is a glimmer of hope,

623
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,820
we must find the murderer

624
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,580
so that he can rest in peace.

625
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,190
Please grant our wish.

626
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:31,390
Kid.

627
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,900
Let's talk inside.

628
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,110
Master Song.

629
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,860
If you don't agree,

630
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:40,370
I'll stand in front of Senior Shan Yao's tomb

631
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,590
until you say yes.

632
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,420
You...

633
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,470
Fine.

634
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:51,690
I will

635
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,630
go with you.

636
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,400
Thank you, Master Song.

637
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,440
I should thank you.

638
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:59,180
The camellias you brought are beautiful.

639
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,060
I'm sure Shan Yao will like them.

640
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,240
Sorry for your death.

641
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,030
My condolences.

642
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,110
Master Ruan, who is this?

643
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,740
He's a master of the Qianyi Hall.

644
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,840
Song Qi.

645
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,210
Didn't Master Song Qi, together with Senior Shan Yao, lose contact with us

646
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,380
after the battle with the Sacred Blood Sect?

647
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,910
They're in seclusion here.

648
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,680
In order to find out the cause of Guan Mu's death,

649
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,320
I invited Master Song here.

650
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,450
Master Song.

651
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:43,710
There seems to be a red spot near Guan Mu's temple.

652
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,480
There is indeed a bleeding point.

653
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,120
How did you find it?

654
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:56,070
I found it with my eyes.

655
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:59,160
But he had this red spot before he died.

656
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,520
To find out what kind of martial arts Guan Mu died from,

657
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,520
we have to dissect his body.

658
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,580
We still need to guard his spirit tonight.

659
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,920
Please wait for another night.

660
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,450
There's no rush.

661
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,450
Since we have a solution,

662
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,490
it's not too late to do the autopsy tomorrow.

663
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,020
Fine.

664
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,830
I need to prepare too.

665
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,480
Take turns to guard the spirit.

666
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:23,720
Yes.

667
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:44,780
Senior.

668
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,600
What are you thinking about?

669
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:50,630
When I see the disciples of Xiling helping each other,

670
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,490
I am touched.

671
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:55,070
Recently, I often recall

672
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,850
the time we spent in Xiling.

673
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,460
Back then, we were young

674
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:01,910
and Senior Shan Yao was still alive.

675
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:05,650
And we didn't go through the battle with the Sacred Blood Sect back then.

676
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:06,770
That was great.

677
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,150
Senior.

678
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,270
I'm really sorry

679
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,090
about Senior Shan Yao's death.

680
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,690
We cannot go back anymore.

681
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,270
We can never go back.

682
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,660
[Fengtang Inn]

683
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:34,970
[Fengtang Inn]

684
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:35,540
Si.

685
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,070
Uncle.

686
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,750
How's your hand?

687
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:43,790
Much better.

688
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,240
Shall we go to the doctor?

689
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,780
I am tired because of the journey,

690
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,380
so it's hard to recover soon.

691
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,530
I'm fine.

692
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,670
But Witch Doctor said

693
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:53,540
if you couldn't recover soon,

694
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,340
you wouldn't be able to shoot anymore.

695
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,160
Don't worry.

696
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:57,640
I'll be careful.

697
00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:58,970
How about

698
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,510
staying here for a while?

699
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,330
No.

700
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,470
I can't stay in a place for a long time

701
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,830
when I am anxious.

702
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,730
Only when you're calm can you heal yourself.

703
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,770
Didn't you say that?

704
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:16,550
To keep a law key and seize the chance.

705
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,300
That's the quality of a man.

706
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,150
What?

707
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,010
Say it again.

708
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,620
To keep a law key.

709
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:22,650
-And seize... -What?

710
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:23,810
To keep a law key.

711
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:24,550
And seize...

712
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,110
To keep a low key.

713
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:27,920
You didn't learn it well.

714
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:28,880
Look at you.

715
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,170
You need to grow up.

716
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,940
I've grown up long ago.

717
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,600
Only you treat me like a child.

718
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,200
You don't let me do anything.

719
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:36,920
Shaoyi.

720
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:39,560
I need your

721
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,590
help.

722
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:44,220
Go ahead.

723
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,690
I know where Qiao is.

724
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:48,030
But I need you to stall Mr. Qi.

725
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,210
Got it.

726
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,080
Young Master Shaoyi, what's wrong?

727
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:55,950
-Are you not feeling well? -I'm fine.

728
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:56,760
What's wrong?

729
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,220
Shaoyi.

730
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:00,530
Shaoyi.

731
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,200
Mr. Qi.

732
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,930
Young Master.

733
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,330
Young Master Shaoyi suddenly vomited and had diarrhea.

734
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,590
So serious?

735
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,010
He was fine just now.

736
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,190
Take him to see the doctor.

737
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:16,890
No delay is allowed.

738
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:17,330
Okay.

739
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:18,750
After I settle Young Master Shaoyi down,

740
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,660
I'll meet up with you to look for the Star of Rebellion.

741
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,360
Wait.

742
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,730
Stay out of this matter for the time being.

743
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:26,130
Go back to Changqing when Shaoyi recovers.

744
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:29,120
Yes.

745
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,310
Don't come over!

746
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,190
Don't come over!

747
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,110
I command you.

748
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,260
Supreme Lord, save me!

749
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,860
Qing, what are you doing?

750
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,860
Senior Bao, can you make some noise

751
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,240
when you walk?

752
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,670
What are you mumbling about?

753
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,080
I said that would you stop scaring me.

754
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,340
Please.

755
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,240
You're so timid.

756
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,190
How can you be a disciple of Xiling?

757
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,000
You are bold.

758
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:48,910
Go over there.

759
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:50,520
No problem.

760
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,560
What's there to be afraid of?

761
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,110
Guan...

762
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,700
Guan... Guan... Guan...

763
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,840
Junior Guan.

764
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,670
What?

765
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,540
You must be calling the wrong person.

766
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,070
Don't...

767
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:07,210
Don't...

768
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,000
Don't scare me again.

769
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,270
-What are you doing? -Don't come over.

770
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,600
Senior Bao, help!

771
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,770
Senior?

772
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:38,880
Senior Bao.

773
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:41,940
First Senior.

774
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,070
First Senior.

775
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:45,900
Senior Bao, help me!

776
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,139
What's going on?

777
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:54,909
Senior Guan.

778
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,570
Please rest in peace.

779
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,290
What's going on?

780
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,040
This is Junior Guan.

781
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,040
Can I hit him?

782
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:24,820
Yes.

783
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:26,100
Hit the vital part.

784
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,060
We have to do the autopsy tomorrow.

785
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:44,970
We can't afford it

786
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:46,160
if we destroy his body.

787
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,110
No, we can't beat him.

788
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:47,870
If we beat him to death,

789
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:48,790
both of us

790
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,130
will be blamed.

791
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,050
Senior Bao, are you alright?

792
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,070
Fu Rong.

793
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:07,930
Fu Rong.

794
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,000
Fu Rong.

795
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,030
Fu Rong, are you alright?

796
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:16,890
Guan...

797
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,130
Senior Guan.

798
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:19,600
Senior Guan.

799
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,270
Junior.

800
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:45,270
Your Prajna Palm destroyed his pulse.

801
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:47,360
I think I need some time

802
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,470
to figure out

803
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,460
what brought him back to life.

804
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,210
It's quite strange.

805
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,430
Thank you, Senior Song.

806
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:56,710
Master Song.

807
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,550
Did he really become a zombie?

808
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,940
There are many strange tricks in the Martial Arts World.

809
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,630
I don't have a conclusion yet.

810
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:07,780
I don't understand.

811
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:09,870
If there's really a manipulator,

812
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,840
why should he do this?

813
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:12,990
What does he want?

814
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,470
It's Senior.

815
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,340
Junior.

816
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,730
Junior.

817
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,620
Junior.

818
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,190
Brother.

819
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:35,140
Why?

820
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:38,180
Junior.

821
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,190
Junior.

822
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,660
Senior.

823
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,200
Man Tianxing.

824
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,140
Give her life back!

825
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:56,030
Fu Rong.

826
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,650
Something is wrong.

827
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,890
Don't be impulsive.

828
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,070
How could this happen?

829
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:07,700
Did anyone come here just now?

830
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,910
Did anyone set you up?

831
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,360
You didn't kill Senior, right?

832
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,130
Explain it!

833
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,550
Tell everyone.

834
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:18,500
Tell them what happened just now.

835
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,230
Junior Bai, tell us.

836
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:21,900
I killed her.

837
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,220
Why?

838
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:25,060
Why did you kill her?

839
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:26,500
Because she wanted to kill me.

840
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,270
Why would she kill you for no reason?

841
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,900
How would I know what's wrong with her?

842
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,220
No matter what happens,

843
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,410
you can never fight against your fellow disciples.

844
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:35,210
Junior Bai, have you forgotten?

845
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,420
She wanted to kill me.

846
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,890
Should I stand here and wait for her to kill me?

847
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:40,530
No matter what happened,

848
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:43,060
at least you should stall for a moment,

849
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,540
even for a second.

850
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,620
It might be enough for us to come here.

851
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:48,800
What if you were late?

852
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,490
If you were late for even a second,

853
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:51,690
I would have died.

854
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,560
Nonsense!

855
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,050
What about you?

856
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,840
You're just pretending to be righteous.

857
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,280
If this happens to any of you,

858
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,550
I don't believe you will do nothing

859
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,990
but wait to be killed.

860
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,200
I can tell you.

861
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,690
If something like this happens again,

862
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:08,720
I will kill

863
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,150
whomever it will be.

864
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,450
Master Ruan.

865
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,410
Do you want to avenge Senior's death?

866
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:18,710
Killing a fellow disciple

867
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:19,890
is an unforgivable crime.

868
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:22,020
Please spare my brother, Master Ruan.

869
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,030
Don't beg him.

870
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:24,030
I did nothing wrong.

871
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,760
You still don't want to repent.

872
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,240
Brother.

873
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,120
Beg Master Ruan

874
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,680
to spare your life.

875
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,100
Do you also think I'm unforgivable?

876
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:40,790
No matter what,

877
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:43,500
it's true

878
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:45,490
that Senior is dead.

879
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,320
How ridiculous.

880
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,190
I was even soft-hearted for a moment.

881
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,430
Come on.

882
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:53,810
Kill me

883
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,570
and avenge your fellow disciple's death.

884
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,720
But don't forget

885
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,140
I'm also a disciple of Xiling.

886
00:39:59,140 --> 00:39:59,940
If you kill me,

887
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:03,120
you can't escape from the crime of killing your fellow disciple.
