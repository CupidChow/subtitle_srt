00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:42,950
My Lord.

4
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,580
What happened to Ruoyun?

5
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,729
The doctor said that Miss Du lost her appetite

6
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:47,720
due to excessive anxiety.

7
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,670
He prescribed some soothing prescriptions.

8
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,800
Excessive anxiety?

9
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,030
My Lord.

10
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,190
Miss Du seems to have something on her mind lately.

11
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,229
No matter how I asked her,

12
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:58,830
she didn't tell me anything.

13
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,070
Come here.

14
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,780
You must tell me

15
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,100
everything that Ruoyun does from now on.

16
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:11,780
Got it.

[Episode 31]

18
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,200
The priest came at a strange time.

19
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,340
I heard he showed up in the government office

20
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,890
and reversed the case for Gu Qingqiao.

21
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,570
The Divine Palace has its own rules.

22
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,900
Priests do not interfere with things in the outside world.

23
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,270
But Mr. Lu

24
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,930
seems different.

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,880
Indeed.

26
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,530
All signs indicate

27
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,810
that he seems to care

28
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,690
about Miss Gu very much.

29
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,070
Did Gu Qingqiao say anything?

30
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,520
Miss Gu is not against his care.

31
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,810
Don't tell the Priest our plan for now.

32
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,470
She's been sleeping in the dungeon these days.

33
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,480
I think Miss Gu

34
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,170
is also on guard against him.

35
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:17,820
My Lord.

36
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,640
Young Master is back.

37
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,490
Brother.

38
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,240
How is the investigation?

39
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,120
As we expected,

40
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,230
Magistrate Du

41
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,950
has something to do with the Sacred Blood Sect.

42
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,180
Be gentle.

44

Let's go.

45
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,930
Slow down. Slow down.

46
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,080
Bury it well.

47
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,600
Take care of everything.

48
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,520
If you fail, you'll be punished.

49
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,330
Young Master Duan?

50
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,150
Didn't you go to Xiling?

51
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,260
It seems that something is wrong with the information you got.

52
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,459
I didn't go to Xiling.

53
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,190
Maybe I got it wrong.

54
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,140
If there's nothing else,

55
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,020
I gotta go.

56
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,980
Why are you so nervous, Chief Inspector Jin?

57
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,310
Is there anything shady

58
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,610
in the box?

59
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,030
Just a few prisoners

60
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,630
who died of acute illness.

61
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,990
Guard Xing.

62
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,780
You'd better stay out of this.

63
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,110
What if I don't?

64
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,430
Young Master Duan.

65
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,170
I advise you to think carefully.

66
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,670
This is complicated.

67
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,300
Chief Inspector Jin.

68
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,260
Do you know

69
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,170
you are helping the evil?

70
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,170
I'm under Magistrate Du's order.

71
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,260
How could you say that I helped the evil?

72
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,190
I'll prove it to you now.

73
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:04,840
Young Master.

74
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,570
The eyes of the people inside are really red.

75
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:07,770
Chief Inspector Jin.

76
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,200
All these prisoners

77
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,990
died of the Blood Technique.

78
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,270
The Blood Technique?

79
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,000
You mean

80
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,270
they were killed by the Sacred Blood Sect?

81
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,340
How is that possible?

82
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,150
He is...

83
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,440
Looks like you've figured it out.

84
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,700
Young Master Duan.

85
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,150
I really don't know

86
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,260
Magistrate Du is from the Sacred Blood Sect.

87
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,570
He asked me for these people,

88
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,040
saying that they were for toxicity tests.

89
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,720
I thought they were poisoned.

90
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:31,870
Young Master Duan.

91
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,000
Help me.

92
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,510
Please help me

93
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,600
If you want to live,

94
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,680
you have only one choice.

95
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,270
No wonder.

96
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,020
Brother,

97
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,230
now we have witness and evidence.

98
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,840
Please give the order to arrest Magistrate Du.

99
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,790
Pass my order.

100
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:50,230
Capture Du Huaichang alive

101
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,450
at all costs.

102
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,010
What should we do?

103
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,659
My Lord.

104
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,760
What happened?

105
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:58,030
We heard a scream

106
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,080
so we came to check.

107
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,680
But Miss Du doesn't let us in.

108
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,260
You may leave.

109
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,670
Yes.

110
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,830
Ruoyun?

111
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:24,630
Don't come near me!

112
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,850
It wasn't me.

113
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,710
I didn't mean it.

114
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,170
Father.

115
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,080
I didn't mean it.

116
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,680
I know nothing.

117
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,080
I didn't kill Yuanhua on purpose.

118
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,380
I became like this after I woke up.

119
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,350
I don't want to join the Sacred Blood Sect.

120
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,980
I just want to be an ordinary person.

121
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,110
Ruoyun, don't be afraid.

122
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,000
I'll handle everything.

123
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,450
As long as the Sacred Blood Sect is restored,

124
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,040
you will be Priestess.

125
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,260
No matter what kind of a person you are,

126
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,330
others will only admire you.

127
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,770
I don't want others' admiration.

128
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,030
I don't want to join the Sacred Blood Sect.

129
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,710
I don't want to be Priestess.

130
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,990
I just want to be ordinary.

131
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,230
Priestess has supremacy.

132
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,810
You are a miracle.

133
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,530
You are the hope of the Sacred Blood Sect.

134
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,650
The Leader will value you very much.

135
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,330
Father.

136
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,980
I don't want to be Priestess.

137
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,350
I just want to go back to my normal life.

138
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:39,860
Father.

139
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,980
Father.

140
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,400
You don't want anything anymore?

141
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,350
You really don't want anything?

142
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,730
No.

143
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,080
I want neither the Sacred Blood Sect

144
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,900
nor the position of Priestess.

145
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,630
They have nothing to do with me.

146
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:08,690
Ruoyun.

147
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,480
Are you willing to leave this place forever

148
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,790
and start over?

149
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,050
Father, let's go.

150
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,490
Let's go to a place

151
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,060
where no one knows us.

152
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,940
Just we two.

153
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,900
I don't want to see these people

154
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,370
and think about these things.

155
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,260
Okay.

156
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,210
Now Duan Yan has suspected me.

157
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,880
We are in danger in Changqing.

158
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,179
I'll prepare a carriage.

159
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:33,909
You

160
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,230
pack up.

161
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,710
We'll leave the city immediately.

162
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,950
Many servants in the Du Residence are ordinary people.

163
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,200
Don't hurt them accidentally.

164
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,780
Yes.

165
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,050
Young Master, one more thing.

166
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,600
What is it?

167
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:47,820
Priest is here.

168
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,070
Lu Zizheng?

169
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,430
Where are the guards?

170
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,390
I knocked Wuyi Guards out.

171
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,990
Duan Yan went to arrest Magistrate Du.

172
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,830
It is the best time to escape now.

173
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,130
Escape?

174
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,130
I don't think it's a good idea

175
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,590
for me to escape now.

176
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,390
I haven't gathered the Four Treasures yet.

177
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,120
It's not appropriate to go back

178
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,230
to the Divine Palace with you.

179
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,430
I've figured out the locations of

180
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,750
the Nine-turn Melodious Bell and Black Wood Human-shaped Sword.

181
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,910
Duan Yan has the last treasure map.

182
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,290
I'll take you out first.

183
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,950
Then I'll figure out the rest.

184
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,450
The treasure map?

185
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,770
How do you know about the treasure map?

186
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,110
When you went back to the Divine Palace,

187
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,770
we didn't know anything about the treasure map.

188
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,150
Because I'm Priest.

189
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,940
Of course I know the secrets of the four noble families.

190
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,050
Besides, what happened in Jizhou Academy has spread.

191
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,200
It's easy to find out.

192
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,520
Even if you know the secrets of the four noble families,

193
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:49,300
it's impossible for you to know that Duan Yan has the treasure map.

194
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,560
Are you suspecting me?

195
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,090
Gu Qingqiao.

196
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,510
I've risked my life for you for so many times.

197
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,840
How dare you suspect me?

198
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:56,810
No, no.

199
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,460
You misunderstood me.

200
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:01,210
I just think the situation is complicated.

201
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,510
We should act cautiously.

202
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,650
Duan Yu?

203
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,070
Mr. Lu.

204
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:13,580
What do you mean?

205
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,270
It's none of your business.

206
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,880
Qiao is my fiancée.

207
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,470
Of course it has something to do with me.

208
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,180
Looks like you've been on good terms as before

209
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,950
after the trip to Jizhou, right?

210
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,390
Mr. Lu knocked out my Wuyi Guards

211
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,780
and broke into the dungeon.

212
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,730
What do you want?

213
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,640
Why should I explain to you?

214
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,190
Stop arguing.

215
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,560
Duan Yu, you misunderstood.

216
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,510
Lu Zizheng is here to save me.

217
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,690
Mr. Lu, you don't have to do anything.

218
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,720
I will protect Qiao.

219
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:46,910
Please

220
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,190
leave here.

221
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,510
Young Master Duan.

222
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,390
I have one more question.

223
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,230
You kept saying that you would save her.

224
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,630
Why did you wait until now

225
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,660
and let her suffer

226
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,260
so much?

227
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,040
I don't need to explain to you.

228
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,460
I'll say one more thing.

229
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,110
Gu Qingqiao is my friend.

230
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,110
If you dare to hurt her,

231
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,300
I'll protect her no matter what,

232
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,510
even if it means losing my position as Priest.

233
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,600
Lu Zizheng.

234
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,270
Sorry, I lied to you.

235
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,920
Qiao.

236
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,910
You lied to me?

237
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,610
What do you mean?

238
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,630
Actually,

239
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:26,210
the whole thing was planned by Duan Yu and me.

240
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,480
We suspected that Magistrate Du was from the Sacred Blood Sect.

241
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,910
To lure him into the trap,

242
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,830
I pretended to break up with the Duan family.

243
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,880
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

244
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,370
You inflicted injury upon yourself to gain trust.

245
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,090
That was too confidential.

246
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,290
And I didn't want to get you involved.

247
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,800
How is Magistrate Du now?

248
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,920
Chief Inspector Jin has confirmed his identity.

249
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,440
The evidence is solid.

250
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,060
I see.

251
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,500
In that case,

252
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,030
I'm willing to help you

253
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,930
catch Magistrate Du.

254
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,190
No need.

255
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,390
Let's go together.

256
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:05,200
Search again.

257
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,000
Go over there.

258
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,630
Yes.

259
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,600
Go.

260
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:12,730
Over there.

261
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:13,990
Go.

262
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,020
Where are you going?

263
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,280
Go! Hurry!

264
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,030
My Lord.

265
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,140
We've searched everywhere.

266
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,150
The servants said

267
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,940
Magistrate Du asked for a carriage early in the morning

268
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,940
to send Miss Du back to her hometown.

269
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,210
I think

270
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,190
Magistrate Du must have heard the news

271
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,110
and left early.

272
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,230
Chase him!

273
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,570
Catch him no matter what.

274
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,310
Yes.

275
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,840
Magistrate Du.

276
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,320
Where are you going?

277
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,120
I'm too old

278
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,280
to stay in the court.

279
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:13,090
I've already told the court that I'm returning to my hometown and will retire soon.

280
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,230
What's wrong, Young Master Duan?

281
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,030
Is this also within your duties?

282
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,990
So you're returning to your hometown.

283
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,140
I have a gift for you.

284
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,780
Bring it here.

285
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,500
Magistrate Du.

286
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,790
You'd better surrender.

287
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,320
They have found the bodies of the prisoners

288
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,020
and identified that you are from the Sacred Blood Sect.

289
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,470
You are framing me.

290
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,290
Mr. Du.

291
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,190
You know if it's a frame-up

292
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,590
better than me.

293
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,670
Since we've known each other for years,

294
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:48,420
please go back to Changqing with me for trial.

295
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,180
Father.

296
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,700
Are you okay?

297
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:22,830
I'm fine.

298
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,010
Ruoyun, listen to me.

299
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,580
Don't come out.

300
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,950
Ruoyun is in the carriage, right?

301
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,000
Yes.

302
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,230
Ruoyun has nothing to do with this.

303
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,350
Duan Yan.

304
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,520
If I can tell you the whereabouts of the Sacred Blood Sect,

305
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,940
will you let her go?

306
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,690
You know the whereabouts of the Leader of the Sacred Blood Sect?

307
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,080
Be careful.

308
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,640
Ruoyun!

309
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,630
Father!

310
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,190
It's the Blood Technique!

311
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:42,870
Catch him alive!

312
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:43,660
Miss Du.

313
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:45,740
Tu Jia and Ruoyi.

314
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,510
Protect Miss Gu!

315
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,180
Shaoyi.

316
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:49,290
Yes.

317
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,650
Father!

318
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,270
Miss Du.

319
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,440
Are you alright?

320
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:11,710
Duan Yu.

321
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,360
Aren't you going to kill him?

322
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,120
He knows the whereabouts of the Leader of the Sacred Blood Sect.

323
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,180
Capture him alive.

324
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,420
Miss Du.

325
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:24,400
Close your eyes.

326
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:29,430
No.

327
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,610
How dare you touch my daughter!

328
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,300
Father!

329
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,390
No!

330
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:44,900
Father!

331
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,870
Father!

332
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,130
Miss Du.

333
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,020
Father!

334
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,520
Father!

335
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,500
This is the last thing you can do

336
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:15,430
for the Sacred Blood Sect.

337
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,930
You...

338
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,420
Look.

339
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,220
What is this?

340
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,690
The Meridian Gate?

341
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,190
He is the Leader of the Sacred Blood Sect.

342
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:42,840
Why?

343
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,570
This is one of the Four Treasures.

344
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,080
I saw this necklace on the Leader.

345
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:54,620
I didn't expect Magistrate Du to be the Leader of the Sacred Blood Sect.

346
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,310
Then I'll return it to its owner.

347
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,390
My Lord.

348
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,810
What about Miss Du?

349
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,340
Wait.

350
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,570
Father.

351
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,840
Ruoyun is innocent.

352
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,390
She saved your life before.

353
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,380
Brother.

354
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,630
Bring Ruoyun

355
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,620
back to our residence first.

356
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,070
Okay.

357
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:26,540
Wait.

358
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,030
Miss Du.

359
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,200
If I look like this now,

360
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,640
will you still take care of me?

361
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,500
Ruoyun.

362
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,920
Why are you...

363
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,110
I have half of the blood of the Sacred Blood Sect.

364
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,120
Why don't you kill me too?

365
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:43,790
My Lord.

366
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,070
Don't leave any trouble.

367
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:45,790
No!

368
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,640
Father.

369
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,360
She is different from those people from the Sacred Blood Sect.

370
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,180
Since she only has half of the blood of the Sacred Blood Sect,

371
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,250
she might be able to transform back.

372
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,350
My Lord.

373
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,860
Miss Du is innocent.

374
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,370
She has never hurt anyone.

375
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,740
Magistrate Du is dead.

376
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,690
Ruoyun doesn't know the Blood Technique and martial arts.

377
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:02,570
Let's take her

378
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,750
back to the Duan Residence first.

379
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,000
Okay.

380
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,140
Thank you, Father.

381
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,570
Miss Du.

382
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:10,820
Ruoyun.

383
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,970
-Let's go.
-Come on.

384
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,340
Let's go.

385
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:21,110
Fortunately, I left the Four Treasures to you.

386
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,040
But I still don't think it's real.

387
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:29,360
How come the Leader of the Sacred Blood Sect died so easily?

388
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,160
Magistrate Du didn't have any guard around him before he died.

389
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,380
It's not like how the Leader of the Sacred Blood Sect acted.

390
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,650
There's something I don't understand.

391
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,540
Why did Magistrate Du escape?

392
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,880
Shouldn't he stop Lord Duan from killing me?

393
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,480
If I died,

394
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,840
how could he restore the Sacred Blood Sect?

395
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,290
Maybe he found out

396
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,780
that we suspected him,

397
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:56,190
so he had no choice but to leave.

398
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,490
Even if he wanted to escape,

399
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,390
he should have brought the treasure map.

400
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,460
We only found the Meridian Gate on him.

401
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,510
What about the treasure map?

402
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,660
Where is it?

403
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,200
I'm also confused about this.

404
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,140
I've sent Xing Si to investigate the Du Residence thoroughly.

405
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,470
There will be news soon.

406
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,350
I hope so.

407
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,030
All right.

408
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,410
That's all for now.

409
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:17,510
Here.

410
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,940
I'll put the Meridian Gate on for you.

411
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,980
The portrait in the Meridian Gate is the photo you mentioned, right?

412
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,940
Unfortunately, we don't have cameras in this world.

413
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,720
Otherwise, we can have a group photo too.

414
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,790
Qiao?

415
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,040
I am fine.

416
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,310
I was abent-minded.

417
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:53,910
Lu Zizheng?

418
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,770
Why are you here?

419
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,790
I'm waiting for you to return to the Gu Residence.

420
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,540
Don't bother, Mr. Lu.

421
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,600
[Notice]

422
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,640
I'll send

423
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,050
Qiao back.

424
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,140
Young Master Duan, you are busy.

425
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,220
The Leader of the Sacred Blood Sect died not long ago.

426
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,080
I think you have more things to do.

427
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,060
Let me send Qiao home.

428
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:12,990
Let's go.

429
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:16,320
Master Ruan.

430
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:18,060
Master Ruan, what's wrong?

431
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,590
The Sword Spirit?

432
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,210
Mr. Lu, you don't know yet, do you?

433
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,770
[Notice]

434
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,150
Mr. Ruan's Sword Spirit appeared again.

435
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,400
Master Ruan.

436
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,260
Why are you overacting when you see Lu Zizheng?

437
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,300
I think it's because I was expelled by Mr. Ruan before.

438
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,460
Now we meet again,

439
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,170
and he still feels sorry for me.

440
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:42,150
Master Ruan, it's okay.

441
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,850
It was a misunderstanding.

442
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,510
Lu Zizheng is my good friend.

443
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,010
He won't hurt me.

444
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,800
Let's go back.

445
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,220
I haven't been back for so long.

446
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,680
My father must be worried.

447
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:57,820
Let's go.

448
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,130
How is she?

449
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,730
Her pulse is very weak.

450
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,430
Duan Yu.

451
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,250
You should know

452
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,830
that with her current physical condition,

453
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,760
she doesn't have much time to wait.

454
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,110
Qiao.

455
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,740
-My Lady.
-What's wrong with Qiao?

456
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,880
Mr. Gu, don't worry.

457
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,310
She just fell asleep.

458
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:32,700
Dongxi.

459
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,010
Take Qiao to her room.

460
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:34,870
Let's go.

461
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,080
Mr. Gu,

462
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,190
I have a prescription to calm her nerves and nourish her vitality.

463
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,790
Please send someone to get herbs accordingly.

464
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,890
♫The distant bagpipe song♫

465
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:20,080
♫Where does the heart settle?♫

466
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:25,800
♫Memories are like shackles, tormenting us♫

467
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:34,360
♫Who rushes into confusion?♫

468
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:38,260
♫Can't see the truth♫

469
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:42,360
♫Promises shatter in an instant♫

470
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,290
♫Leaving blurry dream♫

471
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:46,370
♫And longing♫

472
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:50,280
♫The world turns into a vortex of sorrow♫

473
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,450
♫Swallowing your silhouette♫

474
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:58,020
♫I will seal everything and return it♫

475
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:01,710
♫Before dawn♫

476
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,670
♫For your forgetfulness♫

477
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,710
Young Master Duan.

478
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,090
My Lord wants to see you.

479
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,420
Young Master Duan.

480
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,020
Actually...

481
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:19,550
Qiao told me

482
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,710
that she was

483
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:22,950
the Star of Rebellion.

484
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:23,810
I didn't expect

485
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,120
that you already knew.

486
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,060
But for me,

487
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,310
no matter she's Qi Chunjiao or anyone else,

488
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,230
she's my daughter.

489
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,270
As long as she is my daughter,

490
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:36,270
I can't let anything happen to her.

491
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,680
People say that a father's love is as stable as a mountain.

492
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,160
I can see that you love her very much.

493
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,350
I think you've seen it.

494
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,870
Much of Qiao's hair has turned gray.

495
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,610
Young Master Duan.

496
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,450
I can only beg you.

497
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:53,650
Please help my daughter.

498
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,800
Mr. Gu, don't worry.

499
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:57,980
I won't let anything happen to her.

500
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,390
Thank you.

501
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,890
Thank you, Young Master Duan.

502
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,700
Search carefully.

503
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,310
Yes.

504
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,730
The treasure map should be hidden in a secret chamber.

505
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:09,930
You must find it.

506
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,680
Yes.

507
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,480
Xing Si.

508
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:13,850
Young Master.

509
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:14,690
Any clues?

510
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:15,600
Not yet.

511
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:38,590
Xing Si.

512
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,360
Young Master.

513
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:06,540
It's empty here.

514
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:11,150
Looks like they've already taken precautions.

515
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,400
Young Master, we've searched everywhere.

516
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,130
No treasure map has been found.

517
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,770
Seal the Du Residence.

518
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:19,370
No one is allowed to enter or exit.

519
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,010
Yes.

520
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,180
What's wrong with me?

521
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,080
Why did I suddenly come home?

522
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,660
You were asleep.

523
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,490
You were sleeping as tight as a pig.

524
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:29,690
Talk nicely.

525
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:34,630
Drink it.

526
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,070
It's specially made for you.

527
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,310
The greatest nurishment.

528
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:38,910
Thank you.

529
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,950
Lu Zizheng.

530
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,170
Do you think Magistrate Du

531
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,230
was the Leader of the Sacred Blood Sect?

532
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,220
He had the Meridian Gate on him.

533
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,600
Naturally, he was the Leader.

534
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,950
But we didn't find the treasure map on him.

535
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:54,980
I'm still worried.

536
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,650
If I can't find the map,

537
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,580
I can't find the Heavenly Pearl.

538
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,610
Then I won't be able to go home.

539
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:02,500
Stop thinking about it.

540
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,850
Have a good rest today.

541
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:05,980
I'm so sleepy now.

542
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,430
I'm really afraid

543
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,480
that I'll never wake up again.

544
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,730
Don't worry.

545
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,660
You will go home.

546
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,480
If I died,

547
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,860
you would come to my funeral, right?

548
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,390
No.

549
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,550
I will forget you

550
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,360
and you will be alone

551
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,430
during festivals.

552
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,720
That way, you won't dare to die.

553
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,200
Your way of comforting people is so unique.

554
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:40,780
Sleep tight.

555
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,390
This time,

556
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,970
I'll see how you can escape.

557
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,060
Miss Du.

558
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,280
Has Mr. Du ever mentioned

559
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,670
the treasure map?

560
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,110
Young Master let me to ask.

561
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,210
My father never tells me these things.

562
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,180
You can stay here as before.

563
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,630
If you need anything,

564
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,880
you can tell me.

565
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,890
Can I ask you a question?

566
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,080
Go ahead.

567
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,510
Where will I be sent to?

568
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,130
Do you have relatives?

569
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,700
People want to eliminate the Sacred Blood Sect.

570
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,350
Look at me now.

571
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,970
No relatives would like to take care of me.

572
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,480
There must be a way out.

573
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,870
Don't worry, Miss Du.

574
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,750
You have

575
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,820
Young Master Shaoyi and I.

576
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,270
Don't worry.

577
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,340
We won't let you suffer.

578
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,370
My father used to say the same thing

579
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,730
that he wouldn't let me suffer.

580
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,270
To you,

581
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,770
he was from the Sacred Blood Sect

582
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:22,030
and he deserved to die.

583
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,370
But to me,

584
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,510
he loved me the most in the world.

585
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,770
He was ready to retire

586
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,440
and live a normal life.

587
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,160
Why can't you...

588
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,010
Why can't you let him go?

589
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,840
Miss Du.

590
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,870
I know there's hatred in your heart.

591
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,000
But there's still a long way ahead.

592
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,640
Don't be trapped by the current situation.

593
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,200
The Du family is gone.

594
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,190
My father died.

595
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:54,570
What's the use of my life?

596
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,750
Xing Si.

597
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,640
I want to tell you a secret.

598
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:03,990
What?

599
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,720
I killed

600
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:08,720
Yuanhua.

601
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:10,290
What?

602
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,910
I lost my mind at that time.

603
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,560
When I woke up,

604
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:18,010
Yuanhua had been killed by me.

605
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,790
If I tell Lord Duan,

606
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,680
do you think he will kill me?

607
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,840
Miss Du.

608
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,010
I'll pretend that I didn't hear

609
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,410
what you said.

610
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,320
Don't mention it to anyone else.

611
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,480
Chunjiao.

612
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,610
Why are you still here?

613
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,870
The race is about to start.

614
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,450
I'll practice a little longer.

615
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,240
I might not be able to do it anymore.

616
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,550
You're still young.

617
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,410
What are you saying like that?

618
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,620
I've tried my best,

619
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:57,510
but my scores are still not high.

620
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,800
Don't worry.

621
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,990
If you train too hard, you'll flare up your old injuries.

622
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:02,910
No.

623
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,650
It must be because I haven't worked hard enough.

624
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,710
I finally got the qualification for the competition.

625
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:08,170
I can't let everyone down,

626
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,790
especially my dad.

627
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,640
Chunjiao.

628
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,630
The result is not the only thing that you should care about.

629
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,180
Just do your best.

630
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,710
Besides the gold medal,

631
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,310
everything is meaningless.

632
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,450
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

633
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:48,740
Bravo!

634
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:50,600
Bravo!

635
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:03,250
Chunjiao.

636
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:04,140
Dad!

637
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,340
Dad!

638
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:09,870
Dad!

639
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,260
Dad. Mom.

640
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,670
I miss you so much.

641
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,040
My Lady.

642
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,190
Are you awake?

643
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,020
Come in.

644
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,090
Black sesame paste.

645
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,430
Black soy milk.

646
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,540
Tuber fleeceflower cake.

647
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,800
Have some before they become cold.

648
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,230
What did you cook?

649
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,660
My Lady.

650
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,290
I don't know martial arts

651
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,310
and I am stupid.

652
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,660
I can't help you much.

653
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:02,720
Trivial things like cooking are all I can do for you.

654
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:05,080
How is it a trivial thing?

655
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:06,790
Dongxi.

656
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:09,000
Come and give me a hug.

657
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,540
If you are happy,

658
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,830
I will be happy.

659
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,150
Xing Si.

660
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,380
These are...

661
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,900
Most of the assets in the Du Mansion have been confiscated.

662
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,320
I can only keep these items for you.

663
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,270
I'm no longer a noble lady.

664
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:36,560
I'm afraid

665
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:39,110
I can't wear silk clothes anymore.

666
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:39,890
Miss Du.

667
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,430
You have never changed

668
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,300
in my heart.

669
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,150
Xing Si.

670
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,880
I'm no longer the same Du Ruoyun as before.

671
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:51,980
Now, people see me as a disciple of the Sacred Blood Sect who is unforgivable.

672
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,610
Why are you so nice to me?

673
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:54,850
Miss Du.

674
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,310
Whether you are the daughter of Magistrate Du

675
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:58,770
or a disciple of the Sacred Blood Sect,

676
00:33:58,770 --> 00:33:59,700
you are Du Ruoyun

677
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,580
in my heart.

678
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:03,740
I'm afraid you're the only one

679
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,870
who can tell me this.

680
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,040
I've been thinking a lot these days.

681
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,199
You said there's still a long way to go.

682
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:15,020
But I really can't move on.

683
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:17,050
After I leave the Duan family,

684
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,670
I don't know how miserable my life will be.

685
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:23,020
Miss Du.

686
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,650
If His Lordship keeps you in the Duan family,

687
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:27,159
you won't be bullied again.

688
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:27,900
Stay here?

689
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:28,750
That's right.

690
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:31,739
But what can I do to stay?

691
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,570
Miss Du.

692
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:33,949
Please think about it.

693
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,360
If they find the treasure map,

694
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,440
His Lordship won't give you a hard time.

695
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,320
But I really don't know what the treasure map is.

696
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,120
Young Master.

697
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,260
Miss Du said she didn't know what the treasure map was.

698
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,699
Does she know where Magistrate Du often went

699
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:47,710
and whom he met?

700
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:48,650
Young Master.

701
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,070
Forgive me for saying this.

702
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:50,900
I suspect

703
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:52,280
the treasure map might have been destroyed

704
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,600
since Magistrate Du

705
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,949
planned to

706
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:56,489
leave Changqing.

707
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,380
Impossible.

708
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,880
Keep looking for it.

709
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,200
There must be clues.

710
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,440
Look into Yang Chunfeng.

711
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,110
He is close to Magistrate Du.

712
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,050
Maybe he knows something.

713
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,010
Yes.

714
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,870
I brought you some delicious food.

715
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:14,680
Qiao?

716
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,070
Are you tired?

717
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:28,620
Yes.

718
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:29,940
But I can still

719
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,190
hang in there

720
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,990
after seeing you.

721
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,490
Since you're so sweet,

722
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,160
please say more.

723
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:41,140
Did you sleep well last night?

724
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,110
Very well.

725
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,270
And I had a dream.

726
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:49,340
I participated in a special competition.

727
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,530
My dad even put on the gold medal for me.

728
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,250
Was it the discus competition you mentioned?

729
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,280
But why did you get the gold medal

730
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,040
in a discus competition?

731
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,080
And then?

732
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:08,390
And...

733
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,300
Nothing else

734
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:11,960
but "the process".

735
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,800
The process?

736
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:15,310
That was

737
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,950
a banner I saw

738
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:20,780
in the competition.

739
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,610
It said,

740
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,310
"Enjoy the game,

741
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,730
then you'll have no regrets."

742
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,260
I was inspired then.

743
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:28,900
It's right.

744
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:31,530
I've done my best.

745
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:34,830
The effort without regret is the greatest gain.

746
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,230
When I regained my calm mind,

747
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,310
I broke my best record.

748
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,700
Enjoy the game,

749
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,560
then you'll have no regrets.

750
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,430
Duan Yu.

751
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,550
Let's not stress ourselves out.

752
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:58,400
The Leader of the Sacred Blood Sect is dead.

753
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,940
The Duan family is safe.

754
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,650
Even if

755
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,510
I can't go back,

756
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,910
I won't mind.

757
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,620
Besides,

758
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,840
when all my hair turns grey,

759
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,710
it will be another way for us to grow old together.

760
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,450
Qiao.

761
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:40,720
We will get better.

762
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,510
Everything

763
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,400
will be fine.

764
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:46,800
Like you said,

765
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,460
grow old together.

766
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,540
I'll be with you.

767
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:55,980
Father.

768
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:58,950
Can't you let Ruoyun stay for longer?

769
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,520
She's from the Sacred Blood Sect.

770
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,550
She's also a young lady.

771
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:04,610
It's not appropriate to let her stay in the Duan family.

772
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,470
Can't you help her?

773
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,960
It's my greatest tolerance to not kill her.

774
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:10,590
What else do you want me to do?

775
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,110
If there's nothing that you can do,

776
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:12,970
I'll marry her.

777
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:14,430
You're ridiculous.

778
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:15,640
I'm not.

779
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,260
I want to protect Ruoyun.

780
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,100
Listen.

781
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:20,190
Don't even think about it.

782
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:21,500
Father.

783
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:23,330
You are so heartless.

784
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,740
I don't want to see you anymore.

785
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,560
Come back!

786
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,930
Ruoyun.

787
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,770
Why are you here?

788
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,550
I suddenly remembered something important.

789
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,430
But now I think

790
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,620
I remembered it wrong.

791
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:50,510
Ruoyun.

792
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,470
How could I hope

793
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:56,310
that the person who killed my father would protect me?

794
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:57,490
How ridiculous.

795
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:01,510
Since there is no place for me in this world,

796
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:02,890
I must

797
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,730
take this secret to the ground.

798
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:11,790
Your father just died.

799
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:12,730
You haven't avenge his death.

800
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,480
How could you commit suicide?

801
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,400
It has nothing to do with you.

802
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,010
Why didn't you tell Duan Yan

803
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:23,910
that your father was not the real Leader of the Sacred Blood Sect?

804
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,760
What do you mean, Mr. Lu?

805
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,630
You knew

806
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:31,250
your father had hidden someone before he died.

807
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:34,730
And that person is the real Leader of the Sacred Blood Sect.

808
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:35,620
And you

809
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,870
didn't tell the Duan family.

810
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,120
How did you know?

811
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:43,650
Because that person

812
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,010
is me.
