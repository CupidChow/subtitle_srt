that you are the calamity of the Duan family.

24
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,150

I've been thinking lately.

29
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,530
If time could stop at that time when that boy was running towards me

30
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,750
in the rain at that bus stop,

31
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,340
that would be so perfect.

32
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,300
Who is that boy?

33
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,780
A boy who can skip stones.

34
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,230
I can do it too.

35
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,520
Great.

I'll teach you.

38
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,820
Are you sure you want to teach me?

39
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,740
Yes.

42
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,940
My Dad taught me that.

43
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,950
When I was little, whenever I wasn't happy,

44
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,000
my Dad would take me and my Mom to picnic by the water.

45
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,380
He told me the more I skip the stones,

46
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,470
the faster my worries disappear.

I loved you.

00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:34,909
I won't eat.

64

It's delicious.

Then I'll leave first.

77

Master.

78
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:47,830
I remember when I was a child,
you said fish soup is good for the brain.

79
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,300
Senior Shan Yao often went to Yunmeng forest

80
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,080
to catch fish and cook it for me.

81
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,610
You two have been the kindest to me.

82
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,010
Stop talking.

83
00:05:57,409 --> 00:05:59,370
Don't mention that person's name.

84
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:02,080
I made the fish soup myself.

85
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,660
It's my first time cooking since I grew up.

86
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,770
Master.

87
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,120
You once said that

88
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,110
being without heart, desires,

89
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,230
tastes and pain

90
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,930
is the curse of the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword upon me.

91
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:49,460
It's the taste I had when I was a child.

92
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,680
You taught Senior Shan Yao to make it.

93
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,780
Today, I made it based on my own memories.

94
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,590
After drinking this soup,

95
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,230
you should know that the curse is gone.

96
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,080
You should believe

97
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,770
the power of the sword seeker.

98
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,260
Nowadays, the young disciples of Xiling are inexperienced,

99
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,980
and there are many elderly disciples.

100
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,690
A minor conflict

101
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,370
would put Xiling in an irreparable situation.

102
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,390
Even Herbal King Valley dared to make trouble.

103
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,020
Maybe

104
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,360
pulling out the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword

105
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,240
will protect Xiling.

106
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,710

That's called an old tortoise.

Didn't you say you hated birthdays the most?

125

I hate birthdays,

but I just hate you guys celebrating birthdays.

128
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,430
When did I say I hated celebrating my own birthday?

129
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,140
That makes sense.

130
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:07,830

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,520
What are you doing?

193
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,850
Qiao.

194
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,880
What a coincidence!

195
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,990
Xing Si suggested that

196
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,650
we accompany you to buy things.

197
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,030
-I didn’t say that.
-Listen to me.

198
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,590
No.

199
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,150
That's right.

200
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,120
He said it.

201
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:51,970
I didn't.

202
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:52,990
He said it.

203
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,640
Nonsense!

204
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,440
I really didn't agree to go.

205
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,640
I have a stomachache.

206
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,200
Lazy as a slug.

207
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:02,780
I...

208
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,970
Why are you being

209
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,180
so harsh?

210
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:06,680
You...

211
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,430
What's wrong with me?

212
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:07,830
Okay.

213
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,150
Enough. Stop arguing.

214
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:09,830
I'll go.

215
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,630
I'll go.

216
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,860
Then let's go together.

217
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,080
After all, my wanted posters are all over the street.

218
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,010
So the more people, the safer it is.

219
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,460
Be sensible.

220
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:24,630
I...

221
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,640
Master.

222
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,560
Master.

223
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,810
Come out.

224
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,820
You haven't eaten all day.

225
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,410
You can't hold it anymore because of your age.

226
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,650
Master.

227
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,050
Senior.

228
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,010
What are you doing here?

229
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,320
Why don't you go in?

230
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,350
Junior.

231
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,460
Master has been in a bad mood these days.

232
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,050
He hasn't come out since this morning.

233
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,770
Senior.

234
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,050
Why has Master been asleep all this time?

235
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,450
Master is old.

236
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,840
Old people are afraid of falling.

237
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,530
This time he hit his head,

238
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,750
so it's inevitable that he'll be affected.

239
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,610
You have to be mentally prepared.

240
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,810
This is the prescription Master gave me before he fell.

241
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,010
Ice Grass?

242
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,280
I don't know where this prescription comes from.

243
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,980
We need to check it out.

244
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:46,390
Let’s go.

245
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,890
[Radix Asparagi] [Clove]

246
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:58,130
You little brat.

247
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,200
I'm gonna teach you a real lesson.

248
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,840
We bought colored paper.

249
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,790
We bought pastries

250
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,420
and birthday gifts.

251
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,090
Now we just need alcohol.

252
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,070
It's the Great Master's birthday.

253
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,110
We should buy some alcohol to celebrate.

254
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,310
You want to buy more?

255
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,520
Let's go.

256
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,180
I'll go with you.

257
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,080
But...

258
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,170
[Alcohol]

259
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,280
Watch your step.

260
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,120
My leg is broken.

261
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,290
Brother!

262
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,260
-Brother!
-Brother!

263
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,070
Brother.

264
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,470
What's wrong, brother?

265
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,150
My leg is broken.

266
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:50,590
Stop howling.

267
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,990
Just a little girl stepped on your foot.

268
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,790
You broke my brother's leg.

269
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,800
Give me the medical expenses!

270
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,150
Wait a minute.

271
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,300
It should be that foot.

272
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,660
The scam is also popular in ancient times.

273
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,870
What are you talking about?

274
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,710
What scam?

275
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,100
You broke my brother's leg.

276
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,030
Give me the medical expenses. Hurry up.

277
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,270
Forget it.

278
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,260
Let's go.

279
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,000
Stop!

280
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:25,600
Run!

281
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,030
You two leave now.

282
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,560
Brother.

283
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,660
-Let me...
-You brat!

284
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,720
How dare you hit me!

285
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,880
Help!

286
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,230
Catch him!

287
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,150
Don't let them escape.

288
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:39,950
Crap!

289
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,330
Wait for me!

290
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,750
-Hurry!
-Stop! Stop!

291
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,590
Stop! Stop!

292
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,670
-Stop!
-Stop!

293
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,540
You two really ran away.

294
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,650
You must be hungry.

295
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,560
Wait.

296
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,030
What do you want to eat?

297
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,770
You like sweet food.

298
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,500
How about a bowl of sweet soup?

299
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,460
Order something you like.

300
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,190
Well.

301
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,640
I'll have the sweet soup too.

302
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,360
Okay.

303
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,100
This is not a bowl of sweet soup.

304
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,240
It's obviously a bowl of poisonous vinegar.

305
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,340
How about a toast?

306
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,220
No need.

307
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,850
I'll drink this bowl of poisonous vinegar myself.

308
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,980
Help yourselves.

309
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,260
Help yourselves.

310
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,020
You want a bowl of sweet soup?

311
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,660
Wait.

312
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,410
The rings symbolize the lock of the heart.

313
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,810
When we each wear a ring,

314
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:37,350
it represents locking each other in a mutual commitment.

315
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,150
Qiao.

316
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:57,530
This is our second time watching fireworks together.

317
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:42,660
Although it was only a few months ago,

318
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,390
it feels like a lifetime ago.

319
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,150
A long time ago,

320
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,010
I once copied a sentence.

321
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,450
I tucked it into a book.

322
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,240
I wanted to give it to the boy

323
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,560
waiting in the rain at the bus stop.

324
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,500
But I didn't have the courage.

325
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:02,950
Now,

326
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,460
I can finally give this sentence to you.

327
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:13,650
At that moment, I raised the windhorse flag.

328
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,830
Not for blessings,

329
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,520
but to wait for your arrival.

330
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,990
That's a good sentence.

331
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,600
I'll give it to you too.

332
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,760
To wait for your arrival,

333
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,340
the windhorse flag

334
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,690
will stay in my heart forever.

335
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,660
Wait.

336
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,500
Come here.

337
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,030
Sweet soup?

338
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,620
You may leave.

339
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,960
So sweet.

340
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:16,970
Second Senior.

341
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,700
The Great Master is sick.

342
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,890
I thought about it all night.

343
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,870
I remembered a story about the Grand Master.

344
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,900
In the Grand Master's daily routine record,

345
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,510
it says there is a herb

346
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,360
called Ice Grass.

347
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,340
It's right at the top of our Xiling Mountain.

348
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,780
This herb is mild,

349
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,910
and it has the effect of opening up blood vessels.

350
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:40,770
It's very suitable for Master's current symptoms.

351
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,800
I'll go find it.

352
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,280
I haven't finished yet.

353
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,760
The Ice Grass is only recorded in books.

354
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,980
I've never seen it before.

355
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,670
And it's the freezing season on the mountain now.

356
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,680
There will be a snowstorm at any time.

357
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,750
Even if you go,

358
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,510
you may not find it.

359
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,140
Whether I can find it or not,

360
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,530
I have to try.

361
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,390
Wait.

362
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,190
The top of the mountain is very spacious.

363
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,650
You will take a long time to

364
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,130
find it on your own.

365
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,100
I'll go.

366
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,210
-I'll go too.
-I'll go.

367
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:08,880
-I'll go.
-I'll go.

368
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,300
I'll go too.

369
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,360
-I'll go.
-I'll go.

370
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,030
Master.

371
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,330
We'll go with you.

372
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,880
It must be freezing to wear this on a snowy mountain.

373
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,680
Please wait a moment, everyone.

374
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,520
This is the protective gear prepared by my Young Master.

375
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,900
The road is slippery on a snowy day.

376
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,830
To prevent everyone from falling.

377
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:26,620
Duan Yu.

378
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,120
Why are you here?

379
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,590
I have been to the snowy mountains in the Western Regions.

380
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,710
Maybe I can help.

381
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,530
You just recovered from your hand injury.

382
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:40,730
I'm afraid it's not suitable to go up the mountain with us.

383
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,930
It's a hand injury.

384
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,270
I can still walk.

385
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:46,210
Don't worry, Predecessor Ruan.

386
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,970
Thank you, Young Master Duan.

387
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,620
Predecessor Ruan, you're welcome.

388
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,570
Young Master Duan, you are thoughtful.

389
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,530
You must be careful.

390
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,670
Okay.

391
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,140
You too.

392
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,480
Everyone.

393
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,170
Stop.

394
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,940
Young Master, what's wrong?

395
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:19,990
Master.

396
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,950
After climbing this mountain for so long,

397
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:24,440
why haven't we found a single Ice Grass?

398
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,790
The Ice Grass should be somewhere higher.

399
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,470
It's cloudy and the clouds are thick.

400
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,740
There may be a snowstorm.

401
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,210
Let's find some shelter.

402
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:31,770
Okay.

403
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:36,870
Thank you. Si.

404
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:37,820
You're welcome.

405
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:38,530
By the way,

406
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,540
don't forget to help me

407
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:43,300
write a letter of recommendation for Mr. Jia Cuo.

408
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:47,990
I want to raise a windhorse flag for my boy.

409
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,730
Xing Si, stop right there!

410
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:58,010
There's a stele here!

411
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,950
This is the stele left by the Grand Master.

412
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,310
If the Grand Master's stele is here,

413
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,380
the Ice Grass should be nearby.

414
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,420
Very likely.

415
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,780
Let's split up.

416
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,550
Meet here before dark.

417
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:13,910
Yes.

418
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,350
Let's go.

419
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:25,980
Qiao!

420
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,430
Qiao.

421
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,130
The snowstorm is too heavy.

422
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,160
It's not right.

423
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,310
We need to find a place to take shelter.

424
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,330
Master, be careful!

425
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,510
Okay.

426
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:07,720
Duan Yu!

427
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,190
Duan Yu!

428
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,390
Hold on to me!

429
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,300
Qiao.

430
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,210
Let go.

431
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,460
I can climb up by myself.

432
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,300
No!

433
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,120
Let go!

434
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:22,350
Master, come and save us!

435
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,270
Master!

436
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:30,130
Hold on tight.

437
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,430
I'll pull you up.

438
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,100
-Are you okay?
-It was too dangerous.

439
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,770
Master, thank you so much.

440
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,990
Predecessor Ruan.

441
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:55,850
Thank you.

442
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,200
As long as you're okay.

443
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,850
I see a cave not far away.

444
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,150
Let's hurry and go there to take shelter.

445
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:07,010
The snow outside is too heavy.

446
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,580
Luckily we found this cave.

447
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,150
I brought this.

448
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:16,730
I planned to put the Ice Grass in it and take it back.

449
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,680
But it came in handy here.

450
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,330
Duan Yu, where's my bag?

451
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:21,090
Here.

452
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:27,950
Wait.

453
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,570
I'll get you something warm.

454
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,070
Qiao.

455
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,100
Wet clothes must be uncomfortable.

456
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,060
It's cold.

457
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,400
Make do with it.

458
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,130
I'll feel better once it's dry.

459
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:51,850
Master Ruan.

460
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,500
Have a cup of decoction.

461
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,360
Drink this before going to bed.

462
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,600
Even if it's cold, we'll feel relieved.

463
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,740
Thank you for bringing these.

464
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:11,690
By the way,

465
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,360
I want to do something

466
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,900
if you don't mind.

467
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,700
I can endure the wet clothes.

468
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,860
But it's too uncomfortable if my shoes and socks are wet.

469
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,190
It's not easy to get sick when they're dry.

470
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,350
Predecessor Ruan.

471
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,570
Don't be rude.

472
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,800
Why are you still so reserved?

473
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:33,940
I...

474
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,650
In Xiling,

475
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,310
there's no such rule.

476
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,900
Master Ruan took it off.

477
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,310
You don't have to be so reserved.

478
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,140
I...

479
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,950
It's really warmer.

480
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,210
I don't know how Second Senior and the others are doing.

481
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:07,430
They grew up in Xiling Mountain.

482
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,440
They should know how to avoid snow.

483
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,580
Don't worry.

484
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,080
Help!

485
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,340
It's all because Qing didn't let us go to avoid the snow.

486
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,170
I'm going to die!

487
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,610
Who knew it would be a snowstorm?

488
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,160
Stop arguing!

489
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:38,580
Hold on tight!

490
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,800
The disciples behind!

491
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,190
Move forward!

492
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,670
Keep up!

493
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,040
Hua.

494
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,810
Let's go.

495
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,990
You can't block the wind by yourself.

496
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,910
Predecessor Ruan, do you know about

497
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,540
my relationship with Qiao?

498
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,260
Of course.

499
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,430
You once had an engagement with her.

500
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,640
Qiao told me

501
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,020
that you agreed to give her the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword.

502
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:34,990
Is that true?

503
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,330
Of course.

504
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,650
But the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword is the treasure of Xiling.

505
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,650
Why are you willing to give it to her?

506
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,740
Qing is the Duan family's enemy.

507
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:47,400
Why are you still protecting her?

508
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,660
What's going on between you two?

509
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,540
How could you catch a cold after sleeping for one night?

510
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,410
I'm fine.

511
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:29,840
Let's go.

512
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,600
Let's go now.

513
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,430
Qiao!

514
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,140
Qing!

515
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,390
Qiao!

516
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:05,390
Qiao.

517
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:05,990
Qing.

518
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:06,910
Are you okay?

519
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:07,670
I'm fine.

520
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,790
Don't come near.

521
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,790
You two are too heavy.

522
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,380
I'll die if you come closer.

523
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,670
I'll crawl on my own.

524
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:24,310
Qiao.

525
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,450
Let me save you.

526
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,130
Hold on tight.

527
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,480
Slow down.

528
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:46,980
Wait.

529
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,800
Qiao.

530
00:30:58,890 --> 00:30:59,950
What are you doing?

531
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,470
What are you doing?

532
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,390
May the Bodhisattva bless me. May the Bodhisattva bless me.

533
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,250
Bodhisattva.

534
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:10,830
Qiao!

535
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,790
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

536
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,160
Hold on to the rope.

537
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,230
Qing!

538
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,140
Qiao!

539
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,170
Master, we're back.

540
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:04,890
Master, we're back.

541
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:05,590
How is it?

542
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,750
Have you found it?

543
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,830
I haven't found it.

544
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:09,100
I knew it.

545
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,700
But Qing has found it.

546
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,910
M-Master.

547
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,840
Administer the medicine to Great Master.

548
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:26,960
Good girl. Good girl.

549
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,910
Let's go, let's go now.

550
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,220
Go, hurry.

551
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,420
Let's go.

552
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,960
You're an adult.

553
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,920
How come you cry at the drop of a hat?

554
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,070
Master.

555
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,400
You scared me these past two days.

556
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,460
If anything happens to you,

557
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,990
what should I do?

558
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,980
What about Xiling?

559
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,440
I've been in a stupor these past two days.

560
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,120
You've handled things well.

561
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:10,190
Although you have been crying,

562
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,650
you've managed calmly.

563
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,010
Xiling will rely on you in the future.

564
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,940
I feel reassured.

565
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,420
Master.

566
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,070
Enough.

567
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,080
Stop crying.

568
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,500
You've smeared your snot all over me.

569
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:28,880
Hurry up.

570
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,140
Help me up.

571
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:36,420
What are you up to again?

572
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,360
Go check on your junior.

573
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:40,660
[Dome]

574
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,350
Master.

575
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:45,880
When she saw the Ice Grass,

576
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,940
Qing disregarded her safety,

577
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:49,880
broke through the ice with her hands,

578
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,340
and took out the Ice Grass.

579
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,860
When I saved her,

580
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,840
her heart had stopped beating.

581
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,920
And you gave her your internal force

582
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,390
and draw the cold air into your body.

583
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,720
Then do you know that?

584
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,950
If Young Master Duan

585
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,790
hadn't used his internal force to expel the cold air,

586
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,900
you would have died.

587
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,860
Master.

588
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,350
My life will eventually be sacrificed for her.

589
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:17,300
If not this time,

590
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,540
then next time.

591
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,040
Sooner or later.

592
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:24,600
It's just that I owe Young Master Duan a debt now.

593
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:27,630
Qing thought that gathering the herb to feed me

594
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:29,580
was saving my life.

595
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,679
So you pretended to be sick

596
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,850
to get the Ice Grass?

597
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:42,150
Drink this herbal soup.

598
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:42,969
Why?

599
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:45,659
I'll tell you after you drink it.

600
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,570
The Ice Grass

601
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:02,060
is the catalyst to pull out the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword.

602
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,820
It has a spiritual essence.

603
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,270
Only the sword seeker can see it.

604
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,970
Since Qing has done it,

605
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,100
it must be fate.

606
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,070
Even if I can stop it this time,

607
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,020
I cannot stop it next time.

608
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,450
But why do you want me to drink this?

609
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,010
Only when the sword guardian drinks the herbal soup obtained by the sword seeker,

610
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:27,980
then they can pull out the sword.

611
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,880
Yu didn't save Senior Shan Yao back then

612
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,830
just because there was no sword seeker.

613
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,430
And so she couldn't be saved.

614
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,140
Master.

615
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,390
I'm sorry.

616
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,770
We misunderstood you.

617
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,330
If Young Master Duan agrees to

618
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:46,610
bind the Duan family and Xiling together forever,

619
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:48,220
sharing blessings and hardships,

620
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,640
I will agree to pull out the sword for you.

621
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,160
Master, you're worried that if the Star of Rebellion pulls out Xiling's sword,

622
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,620
it will anger the Duan family.

623
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,480
The Star of Rebellion is the fate of the Duan family.

624
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:01,180
It's just a matter of how to resolve it.

625
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:08,390
But now Xiling can't afford any more trouble.

626
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,650
I understand your good intentions.

627
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:18,090
It's just that you sacrificed yourself for Xiling in the end.

628
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,280
Protecting the sword,

629
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,960
and becoming the only martial-arts grandmaster in the world are my wishes.

630
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,840
That's enough.

631
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,340
Pulling out the sword

632
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,140
and dying for Xiling

633
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,630
are still good.

634
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,420
Master, didn't you always say

635
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,000
that as long as it's for the sake of the people,

636
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,360
sacrificing oneself is the highest sacred duty?

637
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,360
When do you plan

638
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,660
to pull out the sword?

639
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,960
The sooner, the better.

640
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:43,050
Why the rush?

641
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:45,290
She doesn't have much time left.

642
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,460
If we can pull out the sword as soon as possible,

643
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:50,210
she will have more time to gather the Four Treasures.

644
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,210
Does she know

645
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:55,060
that your power comes from the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword?

646
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,240
If you pull out the sword,

647
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,910
you will die.

648
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:02,670
I didn't tell her.

649
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:19,860
First Senior.

650
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:21,510
This is the last time

651
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,370
I'm bringing you delicious food.

652
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,840
Don't scold me.

653
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:29,870
[Tomb of Beloved Disciple Man Tianxing] [Tomb of Beloved Disciple Bao Quancai] [Tomb of Beloved Disciple Guan Mu]

654
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,560
I really can't

655
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,190
let Master

656
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,190
die for me.

657
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,900
Anyway,

658
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,680
I've died once before.

659
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:41,390
Maybe when I open my eyes,

660
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,800
I'll see another world.

661
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:47,570
[Tomb of Beloved Disciple Man Tianxing] [Tomb of Beloved Disciple Bao Quancai]

662
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,290
Right?

663
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,100
Senior Bao.

664
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:49,890
Senior Man.

665
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,270
Senior Guan.

666
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:00,450
Thank you for taking care of me during this time.

667
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,260
This is our last meeting.

668
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,360
I hope you will always remember

669
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:15,100
the Qing who brought you joy.

670
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:26,200
[Xiling] [Martial Arts]

671
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,710
I wonder why Predecessor Ruan invited me

672
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,390
to the martial arts arena?

673
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:33,000
I've heard so much about the Duan family from Changqing,

674
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,450
but I've never had the chance to see your skills.

675
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,760
I wonder if I have the chance today.

676
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:40,670
I will accept it.

677
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,320
You're indeed the martial-arts grandmaster in the world.

678
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,650
Your skills really put me to shame.

679
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:19,310
The only martial-arts grandmaster.

680
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:21,290
Just some reputation.

681
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,400
Many things

682
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,430
are still beyond my control.

683
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:26,110
You are being too modest.

684
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,300
Duan Yu, you once asked me

685
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,570
why I agreed to help Qing

686
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:33,070
pull out the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword.

687
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:35,690
I will answer that question for you now.

688
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,750
The Great Master of Xiling has a mission.

689
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,880
To guard the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword

690
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,540
until the sword seeker comes.

691
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,270
And Qing

692
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,980
is the sword seeker.

693
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,420
Why are you so sure about this?

694
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,560
Fifteen years ago,

695
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:51,890
in order to protect Xiling Sect,

696
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,720
I chose to sacrifice my heart

697
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:57,020
to the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword in exchange for power.

698
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:57,930
Since then,

699
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:00,690
although I became the only martial-arts grandmaster in the world,

700
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,740
I can no longer perceive

701
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,430
the joy and sorrow of the world.
