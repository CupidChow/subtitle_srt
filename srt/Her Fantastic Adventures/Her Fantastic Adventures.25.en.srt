Don't worry, Uncle.

As long as we don't involve Magistrate Du in our story,

194
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:23,830
Guards!

195
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,950
Make her sign it.

196
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:26,780
Wait.

197
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,350
Duan Shaoyi,

198
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,870
I'm goint to treat you with justice.

199
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,080
Please listen to me.

200
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,870
Nowadays, residents in Changqing

201
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,630
think that our Duan family is bullying people

202
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,020
because we're a big family with money.

203
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,360
So I'm asking you

204
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:43,750
to give me an opportunity

205
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,030
to tell people

206
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,020
what really happened.

207
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,140
So they'll learn

208
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,050
the truth.

209
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,220
Of course you can do that

210
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,110
after I close this case.

211
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,310
It was a peaceful afternoon.

212
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,590
[Order] [Sentence]

213
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,000
I was walking with Gu Qingqiao on the street.

214
00:08:59,070 --> 00:08:59,780
Suddenly,

215
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,310
[Order] [Sentence]

216
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,270
several suspicious people

217
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,310
came at us.

218
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,290
It happened so fast.

219
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,750
Mantra followers was

220
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:08,150
about to chop my head off with the daggers.

221
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:12,650
[Fairness and integrity]

222
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,870
It was her,

223
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,350
Miss Gu Qingqiao,

224
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,920
who risked her life to save me.

225
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,830
Not only is she not a Mantra follower,

226
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,150
but she is also my savior.

227
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,390
So that was what happened.

228
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,350
Miss Gu is a good person.

229
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,270
A retrial!

230
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,750
Don't kill a good person.

231
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,070
A retrial!

232
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,600
Don't kill a good person.

233
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,740
A retrial!

234
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,200
Don't kill a good person.

235
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,230
A retrial!

236
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,950
Silence!

237
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,030
Don't kill a good person.

238
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:32,990
A retrial!

239
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,300
You're full of nonsense.

240
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,360
I'm telling the truth.

241
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,190
Duan Shaoyi.

[Order] [Sentence]

243
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,430
So you didn't come here to sue Gu Qingqiao today.

244
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,910
You're obviously helping her.

245
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,790
That's right.

246
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,990
How can I let my family

247
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,350
have such a bad reputation?

248
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,310
How can I treat my savior like that?

250
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,230
So

251
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,790
I must speak up

252
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,510
in this court.

[Order] [Sentence]

254
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,270
Lord Magistrate, please

255
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,430
clear Gu Qingqiao's name.

256
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,020
It was

257
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,510
just a misunderstanding.

258
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,150
I see.

259
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,030
Young Master,

260
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,790
how did Magistrate Du get convinced so quickly?

261
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,630
Something is wrong.

262
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,430
Chief Inspector Jin.

263
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:11,790
Yes.

264
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,910
Bring me Duan Shaoyi’s testimony.

265
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,590
Yes.

266
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:15,440
A testimony?

267
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,720
What testimony?

268
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:27,040
Your family identified Gu Qingqiao

269
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:30,130
as your kidnapper in the past

270
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,870
and provided a testimony

271
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,440
signed by you.

272
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,530
If you deny it now,

273
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,430
this will become a false testimony.

274
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,040
Duan Shaoyi, think carefully.

275
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,260
If you want to prove Gu Qingqiao is innocent,

276
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,000
you will commit perjury.

277
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,740
I… I didn't write this.

278
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,070
-Yes.
-You didn't write it?

279
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,710
Did someone forge it?

280
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,150
You'll be exiled

281
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,310
if you commit perjury.

282
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,640
You're not talking,

283
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,400
so I'll take it that you just

284
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,300
felt sorry for Gu Qingqiao.

285
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,020
We'll use your first testimony.

286
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,530
Agreed?

287
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,510
My first testimony

288
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,390
was signed when I was unconscious.

289
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,590
It… It doesn't count.

290
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,510
So

291
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,880
you committed perjury?

292
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,310
I...

293
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,170
Magistrate Du.

294
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,190
I, Duan Yu have something to say.

295
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,190
Well, here comes another one.

296
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,030
Let Duan Yu come to the court.

297
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:36,320
[Fairness and integrity]

298
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,430
Lord Magistrate.

299
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,190
Duan Yu.

300
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,910
As the victim of this case,

301
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,960
you guys are determined to protect Gu Qingqiao.

302
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,350
You reported the crime.

303
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,070
And now you want to withdraw the charges.

304
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,920
Do you think the law is a joke?

305
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:56,870
No, I don't.

306
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,210
But Lord Magistrate,

307
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,550
Shaoyi was indeed unconscious.

308
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,310
Therefore, according to the law,

309
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,930
the first testimony should be void.

310
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,310
According to you,

311
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,850
all convictions could be overturned.

312
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,800
Duan Yu,

313
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,140
if you want to overturn Gu Qingqiao's conviction,

314
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,590
Duan Shaoyi's testimony is not enough.

315
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,790
Lord Magistrate, what do you mean?

316
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,420
Unless you can find a new witness

317
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,780
to prove Gu Qingqiao's innocence…

318
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,870
All of the Mantra followers are dead.

319
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,070
How can I find someone to prove

320
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,400
that I know none of them?

321
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,790
I can prove it.

322
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,110
Who are you?

323
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,470
How dare you barge into the court?

324
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,150
I'm the one you're looking for.

325
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,150
I'm the witness who can prove Gu Qingqiao

326
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,280
has nothing to do with the Mantra sect.

327
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,020
You're wearing

328
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,670
clothes from the Divine Palace.

329
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,440
Yes.

330
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,590
I am the Priest of Divine Palace.

331
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,990
The… The Priest?

332
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,750
The Divine Palace never cares about worldly things.

333
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,590
I didn't expect you to show up in Changqing.

334
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,750
I'm visiting

335
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,110
and I found something related to me.

336
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,750
So I have to tell the truth.

337
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,790
How can you prove

338
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,720
that you really are the Priest?

339
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,490
[The Priest]

340
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,080
This is the token of the Priest.

341
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,670
It's similar to the token gifted to the noble families

342
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,130
by the Master of the Divine Palace years ago.

343
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:22,050
I remember the Duan family of Changqing has one too.

344
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,860
You can validate

345
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,480
[The Priest]

346
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,830
my identity with it, Duan.

347
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,080
It is true.

348
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:28,870
Good.

349
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,150
Priest,

350
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,910
what is the truth you're going to tell?

351
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,290
I saw it with my own eyes

352
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,080
that Gu Qingqiao and Duan Shaoyi

353
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,870
were abducted by the Mantra followers.

354
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,590
Therefore,

355
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,920
Gu Qingqiao has nothing to do with the Mantra followers.

356
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:43,750
My Lord,

357
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,150
We don't know who he really is.

358
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,600
Don't be fooled by them.

359
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,340
Shut up!

360
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,430
Priest,

361
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,950
in my opinion,

362
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,510
even if you saw it with your own eyes,

363
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,480
I can't just buy what you said.

364
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,350
The Divine Palace has always been neutral.

365
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,960
If you question me,

366
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,710
you are questioning the dignity of the Divine Palace.

367
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,990
That's not what I meant.

368
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,270
Well, then…

369
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:18,840
Lu Zizheng.

370
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,150
The Right Guardian.

371
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,280
You are the Right Guardian of the Mantra sect?

372
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:24,590
Yes.

373
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,830
I was entrusted by the Master of the Divine Palace

374
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,030
with the task of witnessing a prophecy.

375
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,910
To avoid suspicion,

376
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,070
I had to impersonate the Right Guardian of the Mantra sect.

377
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,730
If you still don't believe me,

378
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,950
you can come with me to the Divine Palace for the evidence.

379
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,230
That's not necessary.

380
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,960
Now that I have your testimony,

381
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,560
I can close this case.

382
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,710
So

383
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,180
I'm free now?

384
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,160
I announce

385
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,190
that Gu Qingqiao is now acquitted.

386
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:57,050
That's great!

387
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,200
That's great!

388
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,610
How great!

389
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:16,590
[Honesty]

390
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,950
-Miss Gu.
-Qiao!

391
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:14,630
Father.

392
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,710
I'm so sorry

393
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,830
to have worried you.

394
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,110
I'm glad you're fine.

395
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:20,590
Young Mr. Duan,

396
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,250
thank you for saving her life.

397
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,790
I failed to protect her.

398
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,040
From now on,

399
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,660
I swear with my life

400
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,360
I won't let anyone hurt you.

401
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,410
You saved my life again.

402
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,590
I'm used to it.

403
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:41,710
How did you suddenly become the Priest?

404
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,650
I can't just disclose my identity.

405
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,780
But this time, I have to because of you.

406
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,190
What about me?

407
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,400
I helped you as well.

408
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,510
You… You always make trouble.

409
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,620
[Government of Changqing]

410
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,640
Wasn't the engagement cancelled?

411
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,880
Why does it look like a family reunion?

412
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,270
Our Duan family has been associated with the Divine Palace,

413
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,070
but we've never met you, Priest.

414
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,070
I took the order from the Master of the Divine Palace

415
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,630
to travel around throughout the year.

416
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,220
It's common that

417
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,170
you haven't met me before.

418
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,830
I have another question.

419
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,790
Since you already knew that Qiao was framed,

420
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,050
why didn't you testify

421
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,070
in Changqing that day?

422
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:25,270
Gu Qingqiao is destined to encounter this calamity.

423
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,530
Otherwise, how can she make it to Xiling?

424
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,520
So

425
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,280
you already knew her identity?

426
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,790
You don't need to probe.

427
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,190
I'm the Priest.

428
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,110
The Divine Palace knows everything in the world.

429
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,030
Of course I know Qiao's identity.

430
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,870
What are you guys doing there?

431
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,070
My dad wants you to join us for dinner.

432
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:40,730
Hurry up.

433
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,510
You are my guest.

434
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,590
After you, Priest.

435
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,390
After you.

436
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,470
After you.

437
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,440
Qiao and I are siblings with different surnames.

438
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,870
You first, Mr. Duan.

439
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,000
Siblings with different surnames?

440
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,330
You didn't know that?

441
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,470
I went to Xiling with Qiao.

442
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,870
You seem to have a lot of free time, Priest.

443
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,069
What are you two doing?

444
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:07,700
The dishes are getting cold.

445
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:09,510
In that case,

446
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,270
I'll go first.

447
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,810
Let's go together.

448
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,829
Here. Please sit.

449
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,530
By the way, I plan to stay at your home.

450
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,590
Stay at my home?

451
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,190
Yes.

452
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,700
It's hard for me to go anywhere since I'm penniless.

453
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,960
You don't mind, do you?

454
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,580
I have plenty of rooms in the Duan Residence.

455
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,480
Priest,

456
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,100
why don't you stay in the Duan Residence temporarily?

457
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,630
Gu Qingqiao owes me a favor.

458
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,830
I'd like to give her a chance to repay me.

459
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,630
Besides, I have

460
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,770
lived here in the past.

461
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,310
Qiao, are you okay?

462
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,580
I'm fine.

463
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,110
Duan Yu, let him stay here.

464
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,350
I have something to talk with him.

465
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,270
He's a man.

466
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,630
It's inconvenient for him to stay at your home.

467
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,630
How about you stay at my place?

468
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,870
No, I want to stay here.

469
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,750
Priest.

470
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:10,910
I have a name.

471
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,190
My name is Lu Zizheng.

472
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,350
By the way,

473
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,120
you can also call me Bai.

474
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,750
She gave me this name.

475
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:18,830
Right?

476
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,110
Qing.

477
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,790
No. No.

478
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,070
Well,

479
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,230
I did that for convenience.

480
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,790
I like this name a lot.

481
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,150
Priest,

482
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,430
please show some respect.

483
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,890
Don't overthink it, Duan.

484
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,830
Qiao and I are siblings.

485
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,350
and we are fellow disciples.

486
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,830
Also, we had the most dangerous experience together.

487
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,070
That's why our connection is deep.

488
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,110
Stop explaining it, please.

489
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,160
Alright. Alright.

490
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,110
Knock it off.

491
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,910
If Priest hadn't show up

492
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,190
to testify for Qiao,

493
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,810
she won't be able to clear her name so easily.

494
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:56,390
Priest, if you don't mind,

495
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,150
please stay.

496
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,790
I don't mind at all.

497
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:02,230
Back then, Gu Qingqiao and I traveled around the world.

498
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,880
It's getting late.

499
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,710
Duan Yu, let me see you off first.

500
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,550
You two are close.

501
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,350
We're like brothers.

502
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,670
He helped me a lot.

503
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,620
Looking back,

504
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:17,910
he must have broken

505
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:20,040
many rules of the Divine Palace for me.

506
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,520
I'm grateful to him.

507
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,390
It seems that you went through a lot

508
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,350
with him while I was away.

509
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,230
Yes, I did.

510
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,310
Although you cleared your name,

511
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,970
you should still be cautious.

512
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,470
The Fire Crane Tribe's south gate was taken by the Holy Blood sect.

513
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:36,200
Maybe the Blackwood Sword will be the next target.

514
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,230
I understand.

515
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,070
I will protect myself.

516
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,030
Besides, Lu Zizheng's martial arts is excellent.

517
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,430
Everything will be fine.

518
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:44,830
Don't worry.

519
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,190
Go home now.

520
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:47,910
Get out.

521
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,150
You. Stop.

522
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:50,990
-I’m sorry.
-What are you doing?

523
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:51,910
Wrong again.

524
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,080
Look carefully.

525
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,070
If we can't find her,

526
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,530
we will all take the balme.

527
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,410
Yes, Chief Inspector Jin.

528
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,470
It's late.

529
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,270
What's the matter?

530
00:19:59,270 --> 00:19:59,930
Guard Xing.

531
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:00,710
Forget it.

532
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,010
There's an emergency.

533
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,870
Let's talk some other time.

534
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,550
See you.

535
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,120
Right.

536
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,830
Miss Du.

537
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,860
[Golden House]

538
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,830
Sir, may I ask…

539
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,240
It really is you.

540
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:24,980
Go away.

541
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,090
It's late.

542
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,640
Let me send you home.

543
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,790
Mind your own business.

544
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,000
How about I send them a message?

545
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,290
What if they can't find you?

546
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,470
I told you to mind your own business.

547
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,400
Can I just read

548
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,160
some books by myself?

549
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,130
I suddenly want to read a book as well.

550
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,240
Take your time.

551
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,160
Miss Du,

552
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,560
where are you going now?

553
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,190
I’m going home.

554
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,630
The Du Mansion is that way.

555
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:08,790
You're going the wrong way.

556
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,180
I know. I did it on purpose.

557
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,270
I'm going to the makeup store over there.

558
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,070
The makeup store

559
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,940
has already closed at this hour.

560
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,790
And I heard the officers are looking for someone nearby.

561
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:18,520
How about

562
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,950
I send you home?

563
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:20,670
No.

564
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,960
I can go back myself.

565
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,170
Well, this is me.

566
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:34,990
Leave.

567
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,840
I don't want anyone to see us together.

568
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,870
I'll leave after I see you go in.

569
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,420
Didn't my words work?

570
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,070
No.

571
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,080
You should tell me now.

572
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,870
After I left,

573
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,270
what happened in Xiling?

574
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,190
It's you again?

575
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,970
Can you go home now?

576
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,960
Why are you haunting me?

577
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,100
I told you to stay out of my business.

578
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,630
Fine.

579
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,260
I'll leave you alone.

580
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,820
Why are you following me?

581
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,380
I'm going in the same direction as you.

582
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,270
Can you tell me now?

583
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,770
I don't want to go home.

584
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,350
Why not?

585
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,750
It's all Duan Yu's fault.

586
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,670
He wanted to break off the engagement as soon as he came back.

587
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,000
He even reversed the case for Gu Qingqiao.

588
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,150
Now,

589
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,100
everyone in Changqing

590
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,030
is probably waiting to laugh at me.

591
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,190
My father ignored my feelings

592
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,710
and forced me to marry him.

593
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,430
Miss Du,

594
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,260
no one will laugh at you.

595
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,800
Young Master Duan will handle it well.

596
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,830
It's too late to say anything now.

597
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,520
I'm too ashamed to face anyone.

598
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,820
But it's late.

599
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,550
It's not safe for you to be alone outside.

600
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,290
I'll be fine.

601
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,070
I...

602
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,210
I will just walk around.

603
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,390
How about

604
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,990
I book a room for you at an inn?

605
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,250
No.

606
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,670
My father will find me.

607
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,850
But you need a place to spend the night.

608
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:38,960
So

609
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:42,010
all this was set up by Shen You and Song Qi?

610
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,270
To force you to hand over the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword?

611
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,110
Yes.

612
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:47,440
Lu Zizheng, I'm sorry.

613
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,310
We shouldn’t have blamed you

614
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,250
for Man Tianxing's issue.

615
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,450
It's okay.

616
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,600
It's all in the past.

617
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:58,390
Shen You manipulated others with the puppet strings.

618
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,780
At first, it was you who found

619
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,790
there was blood on Senior Guan's head.

620
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:04,000
If we could find out the truth earlier,

621
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,500
maybe

622
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,050
they wouldn't die.

623
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,310
The Divine Palace believes in destiny.

624
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,030
The deaths of First Senior, Senior Guan,

625
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,590
Senior Man and even Master Ruan

626
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,390
are destined to happen.

627
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:21,860
Even if I stayed,

628
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,270
nothing would change.

629
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,270
It's all in the past.

630
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,330
The survivors can only look forward.

631
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,110
Don't be too sad.

632
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:31,430
I'm not used to

633
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,690
you talking so seriously all of a sudden.

634
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,660
Lu Zizheng, tell me.

635
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:38,270
Are you really

636
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,710
an official of God?

637
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,110
Of course, I am.

638
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,510
What kind of official are you?

639
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:49,670
I am the envoy who helps the Chief of the Divine Palace.

640
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,830
Does the Divine Palace have a Chief?

641
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:52,810
Is she pretty?

642
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,710
The Chief is the owner of the Divine Palace,

643
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:55,630
who can foresee

644
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,040
and knows the world.

645
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,350
As an official of God,

646
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:01,150
I am in charge of witnessing the chief's prophecy

647
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,990
and making sure everything goes according to the prophecy.

648
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,230
That's amazing.

649
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,940
Can he help me see where the Four Treasures are?

650
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:12,630
The Chief gives prophecies based only on his thoughts.

651
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:14,190
No one can manipulate his foresee.

652
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,230
I'm afraid he cannot help.

653
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,410
According to you,

654
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,430
he's still a man of principle

655
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,000
when it comes to prophecies.

656
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,630
Principles?

657
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:21,460
What principle?

658
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,270
Everything depends on his mood.

659
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,550
That makes sense.

660
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,070
Then I'll rely on myself.

661
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,890
Not really.

662
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,450
You also have me.

663
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,950
As an official of God,

664
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,430
although I have no prophecy ability,

665
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,710
I can help you avoid evil,

666
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,110
and gather the Four Treasures as soon as possible.

667
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,110
Yes, you are quite something.

668
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,020
Let me take you back to your room.

669
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,190
Si.

670
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,140
Why are you sleeping here?

671
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,380
I drank too much.

672
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,110
Young Master Shaoyi,

673
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,480
why are you here?

674
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:02,990
I couldn't fall asleep.

675
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,320
I want to sleep with you.

676
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:04,950
Well,

677
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,960
you're an adult.

678
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,190
How can you sleep with me?

679
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,350
What's the big deal?

680
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,720
I have slept with you before.

681
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,750
What's the fuss?

682
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,550
Well,

683
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:15,710
I haven't cleaned my room for days.

684
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:16,890
It's so messy.

685
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,200
Was your room clean before?

686
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,220
By the way, Young Master Shaoyi,

687
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,070
aren't you going to have a meal at Qiaotou?

688
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,670
Let's go. I'll take you there.

689
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:24,470
Do we need to go this early?

690
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,190
It's not early at all.

691
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:25,990
Nothing will be left later.

692
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:26,950
Let's go.

693
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:27,730
My pillow.

694
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:32,590
Let's go.

695
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,650
What are you doing?

696
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,310
Why are you sneaking around?

697
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,030
This morning,

698
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,470
Si took me to eat all the booths

699
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,290
at Qiaotou.

700
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:48,910
All booths?

701
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:49,590
Yes.

702
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,990
This iron cock is very generous today.

703
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:55,510
Xing Si.

704
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:56,690
Yes, Young Master.

705
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,870
Xing Si.

706
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,200
You must have done

707
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,710
something bad.

708
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,690
No, I really didn't.

709
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:10,020
The Publishing House gave me some money.

710
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:14,950
No way.

711
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:17,230
No, Young Master.

712
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,510
I swear I didn't lie to you.

713
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,390
How dare I lie to you?

714
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,060
Am I right?

715
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:25,550
What?

716
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:26,550
Money?

717
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,230
Didn't we agree that

718
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,030
if the Publishing House pays, we'll share evenly?

719
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,840
The payment...

720
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,670
I spent all of it.

721
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,500
Young Master.

722
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:37,990
It's all in here.

723
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:39,830
Fine.

724
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,920
It has nothing to do with you.

725
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,700
[IOU]

726
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,070
Again?

727
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,350
Listen carefully, Xing Si.

728
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,800
I have a lot of the IOU.

729
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,150
The exact numbers are not even written down.

730
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:56,850
No.

731
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,810
If you dare to do anything bad,

732
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:03,680
I'm gonna make you lose everything you've got,

733
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:06,660
and you'll never get a wife.

734
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,570
Is something bothering you?

735
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,640
I don't know how to tell my father.

736
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,310
If I gather the Four Treasures and open the gate of time and space,

737
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,550
I'm leaving him.

738
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,310
It will work itself out.

739
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,910
We'll keep it from him as long as we can.

740
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:18,940
Yes.

741
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,230
It's shameful to escape,

742
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,550
but it's very useful.

743
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:24,480
Now I need to pull myself together.

744
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,710
The key now is to find the Four Treasures

745
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,950
and open the gate of time and space.

746
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,540
Speaking of the Four Treasures,

747
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,990
do you have the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword?

748
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,340
I'm afraid I'll lose it,

749
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,630
so I left it to Duan Yu.

750
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:38,070
Looks like you've completely forgiven him.

751
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,670
My life is about to end, so I only want to be kind.

752
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,440
It was a misunderstanding.

753
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,420
No one needed to be forgiven.

754
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,830
It's all in the past.

755
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,360
Why don't you stay and marry him?

756
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,590
What are you talking about?

757
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,910
I'll lose my life soon.

758
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,320
See?

759
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,830
Can you stop lifting your dress?

760
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,350
It's inappropriate to let others see your leg.

761
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,470
But we're close.

762
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,000
I don't have much time left anyway.

763
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,070
In the future,

764
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,990
I'll live a happy life.

765
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,870
I can help you gather the Four Treasures.

766
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,350
Are you willing to come with me?

767
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,340
Go with you?

768
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:19,710
The people of the Sacred Blood Sect are eyeing the Four Treasures.

769
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:22,090
They are ruthless and inhumane.

770
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:24,480
I don't want to implicate you anymore.

771
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,840
You don't want to implicate me?

772
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,510
So you'd rather get Duan Yu involved.

773
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,870
No, I'm not willing to.

774
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,370
But he...

775
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,480
All right.

776
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,230
Just pretend I didn't say anything.

777
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:37,790
Wait.

778
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,320
I have something to tell you.

779
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,890
Go ahead. What is it?

780
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,150
Great Master said

781
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,260
you might become the Sword Spirit.

782
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,200
The Sword Spirit?

783
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,350
Grand Master of Xiling

784
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:54,710
once became a Sword Spirit by chance.

785
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,590
Duan Yu and I have seen it before.

786
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:59,150
But Master Ruan is still asleep in the sword.

787
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,670
I don't know how to make Sword Spirit appear.

788
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:02,790
I see.

789
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,110
I might be able to help.

790
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,230
Really?

791
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,390
Do you know how to awaken the Sword Spirit?

792
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,650
I am an official of God.

793
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:10,540
So I

794
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,590
know something about divine power.

795
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:13,790
Bring me the sword.

796
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,110
I can give it a try.

797
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,390
The sword is at Duan Yu's.

798
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,720
I'll take you to see him.

799
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:19,620
Si.

800
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:23,280
Why do you look absent-minded too?

801
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:25,430
What's wrong?

802
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:26,030
Well,

803
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,430
is it because my uncle is too tired?

804
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,830
Is it so urgent about the Chamber of Commerce?

805
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,550
Young Master is not tired,

806
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,920
but worried.

807
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,630
You saw it yesterday.

808
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:37,750
The official of God who helped Miss Gu clear her name

809
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,780
is his old friend.

810
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,270
He's the Right Guardian of Mantra Sect.

811
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,570
An official of God?

812
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,110
Is there something fishy going on?

813
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,110
Something fishy?

814
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,000
I mean he's hiding something.

815
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,530
Greetings, Young Master.

816
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:52,970
Have a seat.

817
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:57,950
Not many people in the world know about the Divine Palace.

818
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,010
He has the token of the Divine Palace,

819
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,630
and he's so familiar with it.

820
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:04,730
He must be a real official of God.

821
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:07,270
By the way,

822
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,470
is there any news about Master Kongkong?

823
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,490
Not yet.

824
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,790
But I've sent someone

825
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,160
to search for other prefectures.

826
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,350
There might be clues.

827
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,310
Let's hurry up.

828
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,590
We must find him before my brother comes back.

829
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,110
Yes.

830
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,390
And...

831
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:21,960
What else?

832
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:28,030
Your engagement with Miss Du?

833
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,190
It's my engagement.

834
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,820
Why are you so enthusiastic?

835
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:32,670
No.

836
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,290
I got the news last night

837
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,150
that Miss Du didn't go home last night.

838
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:39,010
Magistrate Du secretly sent people to look for her.

839
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:39,750
What?

840
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,890
Ruoyun is missing?

841
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,950
She didn't return all night.

842
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:43,990
What's going on?

843
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:44,750
Well...

844
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,390
I don't know the details.

845
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,140
Ruoyun is naive.

846
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,220
She's outside alone.

847
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,640
I'm afraid something might happen to her.

848
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,630
I have to look for her.

849
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:55,350
Wait.

850
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,040
Let's wait a little longer.

851
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,820
Maybe Miss Du will come back.

852
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:02,270
I can't wait.

853
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,880
She never stayed out all night.

854
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,270
I'm afraid something dangerous will happen to her.

855
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:05,990
Shaoyi,

856
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,290
go look for her.

857
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,630
But remember to keep a low profile.

858
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:12,910
Magistrate Du may not want us to interfere.

859
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,270
Understood.

860
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,110
Ruoyun was hurt

861
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,920
by two-minded men like you two.

862
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,640
If anything happens to her,

863
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,150
I'll see how you live.

864
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:32,990
Miss Du,

865
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,310
I brought you some food.

866
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,950
Only these steamed buns?

867
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:45,530
The food I can provide isn't as good as it is in the Du’s Mansion.

868
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,260
Let me send you home.

869
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,700
But I'm hungry now.

870
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:52,090
The steamed buns are quite tasty.

871
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:55,950
Miss Du,

872
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,520
we had a deal yesterday.

873
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,350
I can only take you in for one night.

874
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,350
After you finish,

875
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,740
I'll take you home.

876
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,020
Let's talk after I finish.

877
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:10,530
Guard Xing.

878
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,060
Guard Xing.

879
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,110
Come with me.

880
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:17,920
Tu Jia.

881
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,540
You're a girl.

882
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,390
I've told you many times

883
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,670
not to come in.

884
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,950
Get out now!

885
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,520
Left foot.

886
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,200
And your right foot.

887
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,670
Step backward one by one.

888
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,470
When did you become so particular?

889
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,270
Now.

890
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:33,390
From now on,

891
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,740
no one can enter my room

892
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:38,210
without my permission.

893
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,110
Fine.

894
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,230
Can you come with me now?

895
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,470
Something bad happened.

896
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,030
Really?

897
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:43,950
Let's go right away!

898
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:54,550
You have a way to make the Sword Spirit appear?

899
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,230
I'll try my best.

900
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:00,390
Mr. Lu,

901
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:03,950
you are quite something.

902
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,310
Even the head of the Xiling Sect, Zhang Sifeng,

903
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,970
and the abbot of Shangqing Temple can't make it.

904
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,989
But you can?

905
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,230
You don't trust me?

906
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:14,920
I'm just afraid that if something goes wrong,

907
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,000
the Sword Spirit will get hurt.

908
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:17,739
Duan Yu.

909
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:18,870
Let him try.

910
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:20,110
The sword belongs to Qiao.

911
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,370
Although Qiao said so,

912
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,510
you still won't let me do it.

913
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,280
What's your motive?

914
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,989
Lu Zizheng, don't throw gasoline on the fire.

915
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:29,070
I'm just being cautious.

916
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:31,870
But you're being so aggressive.

917
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,389
Don't turn the fire on me.

918
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:34,310
Qiao,

919
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,070
don't let someone with evil intentions

920
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,219
get

921
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,350
this Black Wood Human-shaped Sword.

922
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:42,830
I'm not the one anyway.

923
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,800
Say it again.

924
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,389
I sincerely urge that we need love and peace.

925
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:50,880
Let go of prejudice

926
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:52,980
and let's cooperate.

927
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,430
Are you two little boys?

928
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:00,790
You fight whenever you meet.

929
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,190
Can you be more mature?

930
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,470
Duan Yu.

931
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,350
Just let him try.

932
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,560
It will be fine.

933
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:17,810
And you.

934
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:19,750
Don't hurt Uncle Duan.

935
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,690
I know what to do.

936
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:23,940
Follow me.

937
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,710
So this is the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword?

938
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,370
Mr. Duan, do you want me to try it or not?

939
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:35,470
It's okay.

940
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,340
Let him try.

941
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:40,640
I knew it.

942
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:41,580
Take a look.

943
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:44,110
How to make Uncle Ruan's Sword Spirit appear?

944
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,630
His three immortal souls and seven mortal forms

945
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,550
are controlled by this sword.

946
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:50,400
Even if the soul is attached to the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword,

947
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,400
it's very likely to be backfired.

948
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:54,700
If I want to draw the Sword Spirit out,

949
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,160
I need to suppress

950
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,970
the power of Black Wood Human-shaped Sword first.

951
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:00,230
Otherwise, even if Master Ruan shows up,

952
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,590
he'll be in danger.

953
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,190
Then...

954
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,100
what should I do?

955
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,950
You're the Star of Rebellion.

956
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:08,580
I think your blood can control the Four Treasures.

957
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,420
I need your blood as an ingredient.

958
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,410
My blood?

959
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,080
Duan Yu, see, I was right, wasn't I?

960
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,450
My blood really works.

961
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:19,250
Mr. Lu, are you sure you want to use Qiao's blood?

962
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:23,350
It's worth a try.

963
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:24,870
For Master Ruan,

964
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,330
I'm willing to try.

965
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:26,930
Come on

966
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:27,950
Qiao.

967
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,600
Uncle Ruan.

968
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:05,810
Uncle Ruan.

969
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:11,520
Lu Zizheng, what should we do next?

970
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,650
Did Master Ruan sense us?

971
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:15,290
It seems he's responding.

972
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:17,550
Uncle Ruan.

973
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,370
Uncle Ruan.

974
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,550
I'm Qing.

975
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,850
Can you hear me?

976
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,360
What's wrong?

977
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,410
I can't sense the Sword Spirit.

978
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,390
But...

979
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,860
Great Master told Duan Yu

980
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,670
he would use the spirit of the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword

981
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,670
to become the Sword Spirit.

982
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,450
We didn't find it, did we?

983
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:52,440
Try again.

984
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,600
Maybe

985
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:56,430
your Great Master said that to comfort you.

986
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,590
Mr. Lu,

987
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,070
please watch your mouth.

988
00:37:59,070 --> 00:37:59,790
Duan Yu.

989
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:03,150
Sometimes lying is not necessarily a good thing.

990
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,750
If I were you,

991
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,440
I would tell Qiao the truth.

992
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:08,910
Duan Yu,

993
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:11,390
did Great Master say so?

994
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:12,220
Yes.

995
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,350
Great Master Zhang did tell me

996
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:18,230
that Predecessor Ruan may become a Sword Spirit

997
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,630
like the founder of Xiling did.

998
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,070
But it might not.

999
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:22,870
Lu Zizheng.

1000
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,630
I'm also a disciple of Xiling.

1001
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,630
I also hope Master Ruan can survive.

1002
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:32,590
I heard that the night market in Changqing is very lively.

1003
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:34,000
Why don't we go out for a walk?

1004
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,910
I'll take you to buy

1005
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,310
something interesting.

1006
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,790
It's a long day for me.

1007
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:39,670
Let's take a rain check.

1008
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,470
Miss Du,

1009
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:44,000
Mr. Duan said he would be waiting for you outside.

1010
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,140
Qiao,

1011
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,090
there's a place

1012
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,670
where I want you to go with me.

1013
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,090
Qiao feels tired today.

1014
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:57,030
You should go back and rest.

1015
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,750
I prepared sky lanterns.

1016
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:01,850
I didn't expect you to remember.

1017
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,300
Sky lanterns?

1018
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:06,470
I haven't seen them for years.

1019
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,700
Do you mind if I go with you?

1020
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,660
Mr. Lu,

1021
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,590
it's a special day today.

1022
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:14,190
I just want to take Qiao alone.

1023
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,160
I'll be back soon.

1024
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,870
Lu Zizheng, go back and rest.

1025
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,460
Do you remember when I first went to Xiling,

1026
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,060
I saw the disciples of Xiling

1027
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:44,080
flying the sky lanterns for the dead disciples.

1028
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,310
This is the tradition of Xiling.

1029
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,730
If someone dies,

1030
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:50,910
we will  light a sky lantern for him.

1031
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,410
Disciples of Xiling believe that

1032
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,950
the sky lanterns can deliver the faith of the living

1033
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:59,110
to the dead.

1034
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,100
I didn't expect

1035
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:04,600
that you still remember these.

1036
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:08,540
I was deeply touched

1037
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:10,830
although I didn't stay Xiling for long.

1038
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,960
Master Ruan has taken care of you a lot.

1039
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,920
I know how much he loved you.

1040
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:18,790
But now he's gone.

1041
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,780
Tell him what you want to say

1042
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,080
with the sky lanterns.

1043
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,470
Duan Yu.

1044
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,630
I don't want to believe

1045
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,570
that Master Ruan is gone till now.
