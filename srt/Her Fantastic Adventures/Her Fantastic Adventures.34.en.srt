3
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:42,670
Why did you...

4
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,930
I've thought about it.

5
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,530
The Buddha said, "If I don't go to hell, then who will?"

6
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,660
Instead of letting you keep hurting people,

7
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,789
it's better for you to harm me
so that I can save everyone else.

8
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:54,650
You can hurt me as much as you want!

9
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,560
All you want are just money and a way to make a living,

10
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,060
and I happen to have both.

11
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,240
If you need them,

12
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,850
you can just take them.

13
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,490
Why are you so silly?

14
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,090
Aren't you looking for a fool?

15
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,840
Well, that's me.

16
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,000
We're a perfect match.

17
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,380
Miss,

18
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,190
did I say something wrong again?

19
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,620
I...

20
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,320
I was just being honest.

21
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,190
I...

22
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,740
What happened to that girl?

23
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:37,950
I...

24
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,470
Miss.

25
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,890
It's all my fault.

26
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,630
It's my bad.

27
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,540

[Episode 34]

29
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,720
You've only known me for two days.

30
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,380
Why are you being so nice to me?

31
00:02:58,810 --> 00:02:59,470
Is this...

32
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,200
I've been wearing it since I can remember things.

33
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,750
Ever since I was a kid,
I've dreamed of the person in the portrait.

34
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,920
When I first saw you,

35
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,570
I thought you looked just like her.

36
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,980
Even though we've just met,

37
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,960
it feels like we've known each other for years.

38
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:21,430
Maybe this is what they call "destiny."

39
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,490
Meridian Gate?

40
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,810
This is destiny.

41
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,380
You really are Duan Yu.

42
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,100
What is the Meridian Gate?

43
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,760
Meridian Gate is this necklace.

44
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,990
It's one of the the Four Treasures.

45
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,390
In your previous life, in order to send me home,

46
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,480
you went through countless hardships

47
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,829
to find it.

48
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,860
Forget it.

49
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,470
If I continue,

50
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,270
you'll think I'm crazy again.

51
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,030
No, I won't.

52
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,710
I said something wrong earlier.

53
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,500
Miss, please forgive me.

What happened to your parents?

57
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,150
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

58
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,100
As long as I can remember, I've been called Song Yu.

59
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,829
But it doesn't make sense.

60
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,360
Well...

61
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,330
that Duan Yu

62
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,290
must be very important to you, right?

63
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,470
Yes, he is.

64
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,630
He's someone

65
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,880
I really, really like.

66
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,190
I like him so much that even after two lifetimes,

67
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,110
I still only like him.

68
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,070
Do I really look like him?

69
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,460
Exactly the same.

70
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,510
He practices martial arts and you're more into studying.

71
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,770
But I'm sure you're him.

72
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,320
If I knew martial arts,

73
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,920
and also liked you a lot,

74
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,430

Mr. Song, do you recognize this collection?

80
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,500
You asked scholars to print this book,

81
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:32,000
claiming the Sacred Blood Sect uses living people
to practice the Blood Technique,

82
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,730
and urged the people to fight against the Sacred Blood Sect.

83
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,520
Mr. Song, how dare you!

84
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,090

00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,700
I hope you can get what you want.

Just leave while it's still dark.

118

What danger?

120
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,470

00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,910
I'll tell you then,

but you mustn't panic.

128
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,560
I heard that

They're dead?

139
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,510
Right.

00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,220
It can't be wrong.

143
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,680
They didn't have a pulse!

144
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:49,980
It's impossible.

145
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,170
They were fine when I went out,

146
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,830
how could they be dead?

My goodness.

152
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,120
Why do you think

153
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,030
I took such a huge risk to bring you here?

154
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,390
Once the Sacred Blood Sect finds out that

155
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,590
Song Chengming's son got away,

156
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,720
do you really think they'll let you go?

157
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,890
How could this happen?

00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,140
It's my fault.

161
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:21,170
I'm so sorry I couldn't be there to see you one last time.

162
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,320
It's not your fault.

163
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:26,720
Song Yu.

164
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,830
Listen to me.

165
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,020
Get out of here before they find you.

166
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:30,880
No.

167
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,210
The Sacred Blood Sect ignores the law

168
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,390
and kills innocent people.

169
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,990
My parents can't die in vain.

170
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,360
I must report this to the authorities!

171
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,960
I must seek justice for them!

172
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,340
You're so naive.

173
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,080
The local authority is on Sacred Blood Sect's side.

174
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,620
If you go, you're just walking into a trap.

175
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,850
Madam Zhu is right.

176
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,250
The Sacred Blood Sect is everywhere now.

177
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,990
We need to get out of Changqing as soon as possible.

178
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,990
Staying alive is what matters most.

179
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:55,870
It's all my fault.

180
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,360
I'm useless.

181
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,970
I've read countless books,

182
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,360
but I'm still too weak.

183
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,790
I couldn't even protect my family.

184
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,150
I can't face my parents in the afterlife.

185
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,410
As long as you stay alive,

186
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,430
we still have a chance to get revenge.

187
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,330
Remember,

188
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,410
you're not alone.

189
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,200
I'll always be here for you.

190
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,720
Song Chengming and his wife are already dead.

191
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,310
Good.

192
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,710
Have you noticed any other unusual things?

193
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,500
The dragon pendant?

194
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,610
It's Duan Yu's dragon pendant.

195
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,630
This was found in the Song's Residence.

196
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,670
I don't think it's Song Chengming's stuff.

197
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,880
Are there any other members of the Song family?

198
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,230
Song Chengming had a son,

199
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,870
but he wasn't home at the time

200
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,900
and probably has nothing to do with the collection.

201
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,230
Bring his son back to me.

202
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,140
No matter where he is,

203
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,960
you must bring him to me.

204
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,690
Understood.

205
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,480
Stop right there.

206
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,070
What's in the cart?

207
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,670
It's just some goods.

208
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,660
Unpack them.

209
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,190
It's all my fault.

210
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,570
Because I didn't know martial arts,

211
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,030
I could only escape

212
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,170
after knowing my parents get killed.

213
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,560
Song Yu.

214
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,970
It's not your fault.

215
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,710
It's the Sacred Blood Sect's fault.

216
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,400
Don't be too hard on yourself.

217
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,030
Miss,

218
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,490
I'm a fugitive now,

219
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,320
and being with me will only put you in danger.

220
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,710
Now that we're outside the city,

221
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,430
it's best

222
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:49,760
we part ways here.

223
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,140
Where can you go by yourself?

224
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,470
I said I'd stay with you,

225
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,260
so I will keep my promise.

226
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,940
But I...

227
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,860
Let's go.

228
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,700
I know a safe place

229
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,220
where people will protect us.

230
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,200
Where?

231
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,170
Xiling Sect.

232
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,380
My Great Master, Zhang Sifeng, is now in Xiling Sect.

233
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,630
my Master Wang Tianshan,

234
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,530
and Ruan Siqiong, the No. 1 master hand in the world.

235
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,250
Even Lu...

236
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,300
Even the Leader of the Sacred Blood Sect can't beat him.

237
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,970
I didn't expect you to know such a master.

238
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:28,660
Okay.

239
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,790
Let's go to Xiling Sect.

240
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,750
I want to learn martial arts from a master

241
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,990
so that I can avenge my parents one day.

242
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,360
Here, your tea.

243
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,620
Thank you.

244
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,020
Here.

245
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,710
Have you seen a highly skilled young man

246
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,220
in his 20s?

247
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,350
There are some young men.

248
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,240
But highly skilled?

249
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,560
I can't tell that.

250
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:54,830
You.

251
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:55,990
Stand up.

252
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,390
I'm talking to you.

253
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:03,870
Turn around.

254
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,910
What's your name?

255
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,670
His name is Xing Si.

256
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,840
Xing Si?

257
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,970
He looks like this person.

258
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,940
Long live the Sacred Blood Sect.

259
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,310
Long live the Leader!

260
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,270
Long live the Sacred Blood Sect.

261
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,250
Long live the Leader!

262
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,810
Look, bro.

263
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,110
We are on the same side.

264
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,640
We also have a flag.

265
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,630
We believe

266
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,090
the Sacred Blood Sect will bring us to light.

267
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,870
Since we are all on the same side,

268
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,050
why make it hard for us?

269
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,830
But...

270
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,550
he...

271
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,490
Bro, you look smart.

272
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,770
He doesn't look like someone who knows martial arts.

273
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,170
He's definitely not the person you're looking for.

274
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,090
Why don't you try?

275
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:58,860
Bro.

276
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,910
It seems he's really not the one.

277
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,640
Miss,

278
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,410
are you sick again?

279
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,150
Yes.

280
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,660
Maybe my tuberculosis has relapsed again.

281
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,790
How dare you come out with tuberculosis?

282
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,230
Tuberculosis?

283
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,190
Let's go.

284
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,310
-Let's go.
-Hurry.

285
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,770
Miss, you know what?

286
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,740
You were so smart just now.

287
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,540
Let's go.

288
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,030
If they found out something was wrong,

289
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,430
they will come back to us.

290
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,000
Okay.

291
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,230
Miss.

292
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,860
Let me carry you.

293
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:47,750
Here.

294
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,350
It's okay.

295
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,030
I can do it.

296
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:49,510
Come on.

297
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:50,910
Hurry.

298
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,630
Forget it.

299
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,630
Forget it.

300
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,280
I'm too heavy.

301
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,620
No, no.

302
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,760
I didn't stand firm, and my legs were weak.

303
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,840
You're not heavy.

304
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:09,980
Come on.

305
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,230
Let me try again.

306
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,460
-Come on.
-It's okay.

307
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,230
Let's hurry.

308
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:17,910
Miss,

309
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,940
how about we rent a carriage?

310
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:21,970
Well,

311
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,590
do you have money?

312
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,830
Maybe you can pawn something.

313
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,160
You...

314
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:38,980
No.

315
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,690
Not this.

316
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,700
Duan Yu gave it to me.

317
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,740
So it's from Young Master Duan.

318
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,920
I guess Young Master Duan

319
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,590
really loves you.

320
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,030
What?

321
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,870
Are you jealous?

322
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,830
No.

323
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,000
How could I be jealous?

324
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,970
I'm not jealous.

325
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,620
Let's go.

326
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:17,830
Be careful.

327
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,290
What are you doing?

328
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,880
Who…

329
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,570
Who are you?

330
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,880
[Loyalty]

331
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,510
Why did you capture us?

332
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,070
Good question.

333
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,340
[Loyalty]

334
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,860
We...

335
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,030
We are…

336
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,710
Shaoyi?

337
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:42,860
You're Duan Shaoyi?

338
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,450
Woman?

339
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,270
Shut up!

340
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,440
I haven't finished.

341
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,440
Duan Shaoyi.

342
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,980
I'm Gu Qingqiao.

343
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,830
Don't you remember me?

344
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,360
Should I?

345
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,400
I don't think so.

346
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,460
There are no women in Heihu Mountain.

347
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,790
That's right.

348
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,430
How do you know my name?

349
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,720
You aren't my mother, are you?

350
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,700
Nonsense!

351
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,210
How can I have a child as old as you?

352
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:11,680
Right.

353
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,290
I thought it was the romantic entanglement that the old Chief got into.

354
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:17,670
Woman,

355
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,320
it's none of your business.

356
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,220
That man...

357
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,590
Where are you from?

358
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,870
I'm from Changqing.

359
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,040
Look, am I right?

360
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,540
You two are really from Changqing.

361
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:34,980
Duan Shaoyi.

362
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,510
What are you doing?

363
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:37,860
I...

364
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,570
As the Chief of Heihu Mountain,

365
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,620
I must fulfill the old Chief's last wish:

366
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,480
Take down Changqing,

367
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,470
replace the Sacred Blood Sect,

368
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,710
and let the reputation of Heihu Mountain

369
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,750
resound throughout the whole martial arts world.

370
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,810
Really?

371
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,690
Of course!

372
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:02,080
You two are my captives.

373
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,220
Lead the way.

374
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,180
Help me

375
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,130
take down Changqing.

376
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:08,510
If you can eliminate the Sacred Blood Sect,

377
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,859
you will be my savior.

378
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,140
Savior,

379
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,420
I'll kowtow to you.

380
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:13,650
You can't!

381
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:16,619
Why not?

382
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,540
You are uncle and nephew.

383
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,470
You are his uncle.

384
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,680
How can you kowtow to him?

385
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,480
He should kowtow to you instead.

386
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,500
What?

387
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,730
This sissy

388
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,230
is my uncle?

389
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,380
Who's a sissy?

390
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,350
Don't take advantage of me.

391
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,110
-I'm not taking advantage of you.
-Stop arguing.

392
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,910
I'm not lying.

393
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,090
I'm telling the truth.

394
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,440
You liked him so much.

395
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,670
You even admired him.

396
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,640
Chief,

397
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,230
she's insulting you.

398
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,910
I think you're right.

399
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,810
Take them away.

400
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:43,940
Let them work.

401
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,190
Come on, brothers.

402
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,030
Take them away.

403
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:46,510
Yes.

404
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,590
Take them to work.

405
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,260
-Go!
-I…

406
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,800
Miss. Miss.

407
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,330
Let me do it.

408
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,210
Go and rest.

409
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,750
Call me Qiao from now on.

410
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,270
Qiao is your name.

411
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,910
It's not appropriate for me to call you that.

412
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,340
We are friends of life and death.

413
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,570
Let's not be so polite.

414
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,190
Okay.

415
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,230
Qiao.

416
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,630
Is Duan Yu

417
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,610
that good?

418
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,860
So that is how women are.

419
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:41,930
Chief.

420
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:44,950
What are you thinking?

421
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,140
Let me ask you one thing.

422
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:47,870
Go ahead.

423
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,160
Do all women have gray hair?

424
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,470
We've never seen a woman

425
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,630
in Heihu Mountain.

426
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,930
I don't know, either.

427
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,060
She must have suffered internal injuries.

428
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,950
So pitiful.

429
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,990
Should I go check on her?

430
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,780
We still need them to lead the way.

431
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,210
Hope they won't die here.

432
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,160
That makes sense.

433
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,870
Let me help you.

434
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,470
There are so many dirty clothes.

435
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,600
How can you finish them?

436
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,590
No need.

437
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,150
These are men's clothes.

438
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,400
Let me do it.

439
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,630
Well...

440
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,910
I heard you got hurt.

441
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,370
I'm here to check on you.

442
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:42,990
Am...

443
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,230
Am I hurt?

444
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,980
Am I hurt?

445
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,420
What are you doing?

446
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,150
Chief.

447
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,350
What do you mean?

448
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,430
She's the only woman in such a big fortress.

449
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,430
So what if I look at her?

450
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,310
Qiao is

451
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,390
my fiancée.

452
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,030
Others are not allowed to look at her.

453
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,080
So, you can marry a woman as your wife.

454
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,740
How could I forget that?

455
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,550
This woman...

456
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,980
How about I marry you?

457
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,540
You...

458
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,280
Move!

459
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,780
I'll fight you to the end!

460
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,410
I didn't expect that you'd have such guts,

461
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,790
though being so weak.

462
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,730
Shaoyi,

463
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,280
I didn't know your level of martial arts had improved.

464
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,940
But you can't beat your uncle.

465
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,800
What uncle?

466
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,120
Let me tell you again.

467
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,340
I don't have an uncle.

468
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,580
I was adopted by the old Chief of Heihu Mountain.

469
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,830
I have no family.

470
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,230
Adopted?

471
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,170
That's right, then.

472
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,120
Your name is Duan Shaoyi. Your surname is Duan.

473
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,140
My surname is Duan?

474
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,020
It's true.

475
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,290
Your name is Duan Shaoyi.

476
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,980
You came from the Duan family of Changqing in your previous life.

477
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,510
You are Duan Yan's only son.

478
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,080
You like inventing and creating things.

479
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,810
And you're good at mechanisms.

480
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,060
When did she go crazy?

481
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,640
I...

482
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,150
She's right.

483
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:10,800
It's all true.

484
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,980
You two

485
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,300
are a perfect match

486
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,290
because you're both crazy.

487
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,830
But don't worry.

488
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,450
As long as you lead the way,

489
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,090
and after I kill the Leader of the Sacred Blood Sect,

490
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,690
you two will be meritorious.

491
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:27,330
At that time, no one will dare to call you crazy.

492
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,300
I'll go with you.

493
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,760
I want to

494
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:33,870
avenge my parents.

495
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,420
You...

496
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,000
What martial arts do you know?

497
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,580
I...

498
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,210
What was I in my previous life?

499
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,570
A legendary archer.

500
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,130
That's right.

501
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,630
So cool!

502
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,830
Looks like he's quite something.

503
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,230
Just wait and see.

504
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,880
You can't even shoot an arrow.

505
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,410
Put it away.

506
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:00,980
Let's go.

507
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:02,160
Wait.

508
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,430
If you were indeed Duan Shaoyi in your previous life,

509
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,680
you should have

510
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,580
sleeve arrows.

511
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,220
That's it.

512
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,790
What a coincidence.

513
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,740
Me?

514
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,520
That's a coincidence, isn't it?

515
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,510
I told you he's a legendary archer, didn't I?

516
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,660
Give it to me.

517
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:36,910
Give it to me.

518
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:42,780
You're not trying to fool me, are you?

519
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,510
Shoot again.

520
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,230
Shoot again!

521
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:45,830
Come on.

522
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,650
No.

523
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:07,750
You...

524
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,880
Did you know how to shoot arrows from the very beginning?

525
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,350
Qiao,

526
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,150
my hand seems to be scratched.

527
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,850
There's no callus on your hand.

528
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,490
Are you really an archer in your previous life?

529
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,630
What was I in my previous life?

530
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,250
An inventor.

531
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,590
You know mechanisms.

532
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:30,920
Then...

533
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,590
besides this,

534
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,790
what have I invented?

535
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,650
She's insulting you.

536
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,470
I can feel it.

537
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,740
How are you going to attack the Sacred Blood Sect?

538
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,750
You two

539
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:59,690
take me to find the location of the Sacred Blood Sect,

540
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:00,670
and we'll charge in.

541
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:01,700
Then, it'll be done.

542
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,390
D…

543
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,150
Done?

544
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,370
Yes, done.

545
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,850
Do you have tens of thousands of soldiers?

546
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:10,370
All the elites of Heihu Mountain are here.

547
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,640
That...

548
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:15,340
Well...

549
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,020
It seems a bit dangerous.

550
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,240
It is very dangerous.

551
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,110
The foundation of the Sacred Blood Sect is in Changqing.

552
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,880
The flags of the Sacred Blood Sect are everywhere,

553
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,380
which means they have many disciples.

554
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,040
If we, only scores of people, go there,

555
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,260
we'll die.

556
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,850
So what if we die?

557
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,110
After 18 years, I'll be a hero again.

558
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:32,670
How can you

559
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,330
take your life so carelessly?

560
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:36,950
W-What's wrong?

561
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:39,950
Are you so weak that a gust of wind could knock you over?

562
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,650
I was pissed off by you.

563
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:42,590
Qiao.

564
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,740
Why don't you take a rest now?

565
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,460
No.

566
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,400
I'm not finished.

567
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,160
Shaoyi,

568
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,890
we can't just go and throw our lives away like that.

569
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:50,960
We need a plan.

570
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,170
We need tactics.

571
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,470
What tactics can there be?

572
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:55,120
Okay.

573
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,650
Here's the thing.

574
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,200
There are Four Creatures in this world.

575
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,220
They are Nine-turn melodious bell,

576
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,580
Black Wood Human-shaped Sword,

577
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,080
Meridian Gate, and the Heavenly Pearl.

578
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,500
As long as we gather all the Four Treasures,

579
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,190
we can open the gate of time and space

580
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,050
and go to any space or time we want.

581
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,900
So, as long as we open the gate of time and space,

582
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,550
we can

583
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,050
restore the world to its original form.

584
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,360
The original form?

585
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:15,350
What is the original form like?

586
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,000
The previous life I mentioned.

587
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,330
Your Duan family of Changqing

588
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:21,010
is the head of the four noble families in the Martial Arts World.

589
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:22,450
So powerful?

590
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,400
But I've never heard of

591
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,720
the Four Treasures.

592
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,330
The Four Treasures are like this.

593
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:33,660
It's something you don't have in your era.

594
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,150
Don't touch it.

595
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,810
Qiao wears it close to her.

596
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,230
The painting inside looks just like the real things.

597
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:41,910
Brothers,

598
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,100
come and take a look.

599
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:47,160
Stay away.

600
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:47,960
Don't touch it.

601
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,950
Don't touch it.

602
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,430
Why are you so stingy?

603
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,980
What's so special about it?

604
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,230
Chief.

605
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,270
Bad news!

606
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,110
[Weihu Mountain]

607
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,270
I'll go meet them.

608
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,430
Chief! Chief!

609
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,310
Calm down.

610
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:41,910
No.

611
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,510
The Sacred Blood Sect knows the Blood Technique.

612
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,170
You can't go.

613
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,300
What should I do then?

614
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,390
Men of Heihu Mountain won't run away.

615
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,030
Chief,

616
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,150
they are really fierce.

617
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:51,080
Our men can't withstand the attack anymore.

618
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:51,920
Why don't you run away first?

619
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,070
I'll take my men to cover you.

620
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:53,630
No.

621
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,030
I can't leave you here.

622
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,020
Chief,

623
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,910
you are the only hope of Heihu Mountain.

624
00:27:58,910 --> 00:27:59,750
As long as you escape,

625
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,540
you can avenge us.

626
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:00,940
Run!

627
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:01,620
Let's all run!

628
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,530
Don't leave anyone behind.

629
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:03,100
Yes.

630
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,410
Don't leave anyone behind.

631
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:04,990
Let's go.

632
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,610
[Loyalty]

633
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,000
Chief.

634
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,160
I'll lead our men to hold the line.

635
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,550
Come on, bros. Follow me.

636
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,280
[Loyalty]

637
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,430
-Go!
-Go! Go!

638
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,510
Erhu!

639
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,610
Brother!

640
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:24,400
Let's go.

641
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,230
Hush.

642
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,420
Honey.

643
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:30,990
Go!

644
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:32,110
Go!

645
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:32,590
Yu.

646
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,470
Father!

647
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:34,930
Father!

648
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,010
Father…

649
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:39,550
Sister-in-law,

650
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,310
what about my brother and the others?

651
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,580
We can't care about that now.

652
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,610
You must remember,

653
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:44,430
when everything is calm,

654
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,960
you must escape with Shaoyi

655
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,290
and grow up well.

656
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,140
Run!

657
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,030
Shaoyi, don't cry.

658
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,750
The bad guys are coming.

659
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,330
Uncle.

660
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,820
I can't run anymore.

661
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,250
Come on. Let me carry you.

662
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,100
No!

663
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,390
Uncle.

664
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:25,740
Uncle!

665
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,550
Whose child is this?

666
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,700
How did he get hurt so badly?

667
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:32,410
I found him on my way to go life drawing.

668
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:34,810
What a poor child.

669
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,320
Honey,

670
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,870
we've been married for so long,

671
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,600
but we don't have our own child.

672
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,510
Why don't we adopt him?

673
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,540
If we can't find his parents,

674
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,550
we'll adopt him.

675
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,630
Look, this child looks so pretty.

676
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:51,880
Honey,

677
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,500
why don't you give him a name?

678
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,620
The jade pendant he's wearing

679
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,750
looks valuable.

680
00:30:59,030 --> 00:30:59,880
How about

681
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:02,570
we call him Song Yu?

682
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,780
Song Yu?

683
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,070
Good name.

684
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,880
Duan Yu must be hiding here.

685
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:25,930
[Loyalty]

686
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:26,670
Keep looking.

687
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:27,870
We must find him!

688
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:30,370
Search!

689
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,390
There's noise over there.

690
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:36,870
After them!

691
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:37,590
Yes.

692
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,060
[Loyalty]

693
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:40,660
They're finally gone.

694
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,610
It's Ruoyun.

695
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,190
Let's go.

696
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,330
Go down the mountain now.

697
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:45,730
We can't miss the chance.

698
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:51,390
My Erhu!

699
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,820
My Sanlang!

700
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,580
I'm so incapable

701
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,130
that I couldn't save you.

702
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,150
Without you,

703
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,500
what should I do?

704
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,120
Shaoyi.

705
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,900
You still have me.

706
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,110
I remember everything.

707
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,350
My name is not Song Yu.

708
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,460
My real name is

709
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:28,750
Duan Yu.

710
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,520
Duan Yu.

711
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,720
You remembered everything?

712
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:36,580
Qiao didn't lie to us.

713
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,580
We're really from the Duan family of Changqing.

714
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,510
We originally lived

715
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,150
a stable and peaceful life,

716
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,300
but one day, the Sacred Blood Sect suddenly attacked us.

717
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,790
Father and Brother died in battle to protect us.

718
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:51,790
Your mother risked her life to let us escape.

719
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:56,250
But soon after we escaped, we had an accident.

720
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,310
I was only six at the time.

721
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,660
Since then, I've lost my memory

722
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,760
and been separated from you for 15 years.

723
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,970
R-Really?

724
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,990
Then, you're my only family.

725
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,420
That's right.

726
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,980
You must have suffered a lot in the past 15 years.

727
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:16,790
But what's the use of the Duan family?

728
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,740
I still can't defeat the Sacred Blood Sect.

729
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,940
I still watched my brothers die in vain.

730
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,090
I'm not capable.

731
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:25,590
I don't deserve to be the Chief of Heihu Mountain

732
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:28,220
or have this token.

733
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,880
The Heavenly Pearl?

734
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,240
Why didn't I think of it?

735
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,410
Duan Yu had the Meridian Gate,

736
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:37,600
so you must have the Heavenly Pearl.

737
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,310
What Heavenly Pearl?

738
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,420
This is the token

739
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,740
that only the Chief of Heihu Mountain can have.

740
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,140
Didn't I tell you about the Four Treasures?

741
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,550
This necklace is called Meridian Gate.

742
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,480
This is called the Heavenly Pearl.

743
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,430
Then, the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword

744
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,970
must still be in Uncle's hands.

745
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:55,800
Great.

746
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,320
This is from my old Chief.

747
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,260
What treasure?

748
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:01,950
Are you lying to me?

749
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:02,980
I'm not lying.

750
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,430
This is called the "gold medal" in our modern times.

751
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,000
Look.

752
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,270
There's English on it.

753
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,199
Have you seen it?

754
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:09,920
I'm an honest person.

755
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:11,679
Don't lie to me.

756
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,120
Could it really be that

757
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,840
you can change everything if you collected all the Four Treasures?

758
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,820
It's true.

759
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,590
That's what Lu Zizheng, the current Leader of the Sacred Blood Sect,

760

did.

00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:20,350
In the last life,

Besides, I've left the Duan family for a long time.

773
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,780
he wouldn't recognize me.
