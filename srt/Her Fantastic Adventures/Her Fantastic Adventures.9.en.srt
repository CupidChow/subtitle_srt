00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,880
Let me help you put this on.

4
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,530
Come on. Give me your hand.

5
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,490
Let me help you put this on.

6
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:47,509
You've

7
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,170
never seen this before, right?

8
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,550
This is called Nine-turn...

9
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,910
This is called Nine-turn Bell or something.

10
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:54,830
Do you mean

11
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,860
the Nine-turn Melodious Bell?

12
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,900
Anyway, this is...

13
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,410
This is a proof.

14
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,790
It's the evidence which proves that I'm the Star of Rebellion.

15
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,240
This is a small secret between us.

16
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,389
I've never told anyone about it before.

17
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:10,419
Someone who was

18
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,030
quite close to me gave this to me.

19
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,030
It has accompanied me

20
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,710
to get through many difficult moments.

21
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,850
You must keep it a secret.

22
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,970
Don't tell anyone about it.

23
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,600
Just remember that

24
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,360
life can be bitter,

25
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,370
but we can make it sweet.

26
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,000
Life can be bitter,

27
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,760
but we can make it sweet!

28
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,490

Xing Si.

32
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,900
What kind of person do you think Miss Gu is?

33
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:03,970
She's a good person.

34
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,350
Although she often talks irrelevantly,

35
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,890
I've noticed that she really

36
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,060
cares about you.

37
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,590
I can empathize with you and feel the warmth in my heart.

38
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,410
You'd better use your literature skills to write romantic dialogue novels.

39
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,070
Young Master.

40
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,329
I can sense that your affection for Miss Gu is sincere.

41
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,420
But you can't always torture yourself like this.

42
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,950
I feel sorry for you.

43
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,060
Besides,

44
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,770
if Miss Gu had really been a bad person,

45
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:29,100
she wouldn't have told you that she's the Star of Rebellion.

46
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,360
I think she's just so simple-minded.

47
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,150
That's why it's so hard.

48
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,220
If she was really a bad person,

49
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,880
I would just cut her directly,

50
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,040
and then everything would be over.

51
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,410
Liar.

52
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,620
You wouldn't bear to do that.

53
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,150
Do you dare to speak louder?

54
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,490
It is obvious that you two love each other.

55
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,890
There's no need to be shy.

56
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,880
Why don’t we talk to Miss Gu directly

57
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,140
to make things clear?

58
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,950
Shall we tell her that the Star of Rebellion is the accomplice of the Sacred Blood Sect

59
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,020
and the enemy of our Duan Family?

60
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,690
Or shall we tell her that this engagement is just a test for her?

61
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:59,300
Now that the lie has become the reality, I don't know how to deal with it.

62
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,340
It it said that

63
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,060
Young Master Duan

64
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,510
had a crush on Miss Gu for a long time.

65
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,940
Unfortunately,

66
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,880
he already had Du Ruoyun, the most beautiful woman

67
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,720
in Changqing.

68
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,400
The grain shortage was an urgent problem.

69
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,860
Even the dog, Huang, at the gate of the city...

70
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,420
Master, I have to get back to work.

71
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,800
It couldn't find food.

72
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,110
All the shops only wanted to protect themselves and were not willing to donate food.

73
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,910
-Master.
-Master

74
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,990
Even Duan Yu didn't know what to do.

75
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,700
At this moment,

76
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,070
Gu Qingqiao, the eldest daughter

77
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,940
of Mr. Gu, appeared in the Miao's Tavern.

78
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,140
She only said,

79
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,630
"I would drink all these

80
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,159
five jars of wine."

81
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,570
"Just regard me as your friend."

82
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,110
"But in exchange,

83
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,300
you have to donate the food."

84
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,290
Good! Good! Good!

85
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:51,390
In that case, Young Master Duan couldn't just sit there without doing anything.

86
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:55,810
Of course he had to stay with Miss Gu forever.

87
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,909
Get married!

88
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,710
In this case, he should propose a marriage, shouldn't he?

89
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,470
Get married! Get married!

90
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,840
What about Miss Du?

91
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,460
Speaking of Miss Du,

92
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,710
it depends on which of you

93
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,990
can marry this beautiful lady.

94
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:10,950
How dare you!

95
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,400
How can you guys talk about our lady?

96
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,030
Oh no!

97
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,290
I've incurred some trouble this time.

98
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,210
My elder brother will come out from seclusion soon.

99
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,280
If he knows that Qiao is the Star of Rebellion,

100
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,710
there will be a lot of trouble.

101
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,640
If my brother finds out about it first,

102
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,400
Qiao's life will be in danger.

103
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,730
How about we just lie to His Lordship?

104
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,530
Or you can truly marry Miss Gu

105
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,340
so that the Star of Rebellion can be used by our Duan Family.

106
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,320
In that case, His Lordship won't blame you.

107
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,380
What nonsense are you talking about?

108
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,820
That's irresponsible

109
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,680
both for Qiao and the Duan Family.

110
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:52,400
Young Master,

111
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,760
please calm down.

112
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,850
I'm just trying to help you analyze it in a clear-thinking way.

113
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,880
After all, you're His Lordship's younger brother.

114
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,740
I don't think His Lordship

115
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,340
will completely ignore your feelings, right?

116
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,340
It would be great if that was the case.

117
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,080
I can't believe that Young Master Duan came to the jewellery shop.

118
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,830
Which girl is he selecting the jewellery for?

119
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,400
I think it's for Miss Du.

120
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,680
It think it's for Miss Gu.

121
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,270
Chairman Duan.

122
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,960
This is the most precious product of our shop,

123
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,190
Red Glazed Bracelet.

124
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,970
Then take a look at this.

125
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,470
Manager!

126
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,310
Manager!

127
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,930
-Coming!
-Come and have a look.

128
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,500
Look. Look.

129
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,230
What's wrong?

130
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,250
All these gold wires are crooked.

131
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,230
Adjust them for me again at once.

132
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,130
You're really wasting my time.

133
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:33,659
Wait.

134
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,250
I want this.

135
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,440
Have you heard that

136
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,720
Young Master Duan is going to get married?

137
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,770
The girl he's going to marry is not Miss Du,

138
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:40,970
but Miss Gu.

139
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,120
Have you heard that

140
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,560
Young Master Duan is going to get married?

141
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,470
The girl he's going to marry is not Miss Du,

142
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,720
but Miss Gu.

143
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:52,650
Have you heard that

144
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,890
Young Master Duan is going to get married?

145
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:54,790
The girl he's going to marry is not Miss Du,

146
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,670
but Miss Gu.

147
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,140
Everyone! Everyone!

Young Master Duan is going to get married.

149
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,740
The girl he's going to marry is not Miss Du,

150
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,190
but Miss Gu.

151
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,790
The meat buns are free today!

152
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,590
My Lady.

153
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,190
Gu Qingqiao has gone too far.

154
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,740
Now everyone in Changqing is talking about it.

155
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,640
They're saying that you've been abandoned by Young Master Duan.

156
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,950
She also took all the credit for the grain shortage.

157
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,990
She even asked a storyteller to openly slander you in the restaurant.

158
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,930
Who knows how many bad things

159
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,640
she has done behind your back previously?

160
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,750
Let's go to the Gu Residence.

161
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,060
I want to personally ask her about it clearly.

162
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,260
Come on!

163
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,340
Come on!

164
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,900
They are free!

165
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,870
I'll go to see him.

166
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,960
I won't go to see him.

167
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,510
I'll go to see him.

168
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,070
I won't go to see him.

169
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,420
My dear daughter.

170
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,740
Why are you still sitting here?

171
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,430
Go get changed now.

172
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,180
What's wrong?

173
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,000
What's wrong?

174
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,720
Everyone in Changqing is talking about it.

175
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,320
Only you don't know about it.

176
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,370
Is Duan Yu going to place righteousness above our friendship?

177
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,630
Is he going to catch me?

178
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,670
I knew he was a gloomy boy.

179
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,409
Father.

180
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,020
I'll go pack up my luggage now.

181
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,020
What... What are you talking about?

182
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,750
My Lady, Guard Xing is here.

183
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,350
So soon?

184
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,880
Miss Gu.

185
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:05,440
I...

186
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,060
Guard Xing.

187
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,720
Mr. Gu.

188
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,290
Is there any important message

189
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,830
which you help Young Master Duan send here?

190
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,230
There is something important indeed.

191
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,460
Guard Xing.

192
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,290
I know.

193
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:16,860
I got it.

194
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,600
I understand.

195
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,430
I won't make things difficult for you.

196
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,890
Since we are good friends,

197
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,030
can you

198
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,880
let me see Young Master Duan for the last time

199
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,990
so that we can talk about breaking up face to face?

200
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,900
Young Master specially asked me to deliver this here.

201
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,020
After waiting for so long, I'll finally see the...

202
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,020
betrothal gift.

203
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,070
Fine.

204
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,900
He has even prepared a breakup gift.

205
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,700
Happiness is always transient.

206
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,860
Duan Yu is not gloomy,

207
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,170
but so vicious.

208
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,040
I can't believe that he wants to poison me to death.

209
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,950
Tell him that

210
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,880
it's all because I've misjudged him!

211
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,160
I won't let him off after I become a ghost!

212
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,940
Qiao!

213
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,320
Calm down! Calm down!

214
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,130
Guard Xing,

215
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,450
is there anything else that you haven't

216
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,800
taken out yet?

217
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,180
Stop hiding it.

218
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,730
I know everything.

219
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,760
Young Master knows that Miss Gu likes Pearl Milk Tea.

220
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,950
But as there was no precedent in Changqing which we could follow,

221
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,640
he explored it and made it personally for the whole morning.

222
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,460
He specially asked me to send it to Miss Gu to alleviate her hangover.

223
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,720
There is nothing else.

224
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:27,620
Milk...

225
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,200
Milk...

226
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,580
-Milk tea?
-Milk tea?

227
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,340
Guard Xing, thanks for bringing it here.

228
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,130
The milk is so fragrant.

229
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,060
There's also the fragrance of tea.

230
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,450
Young Master Duan is so considerate.

231
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,690
Look at these pearls.

232
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,430
They're round and smooth.

233
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,480
All of them are plump.

234
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,610
This one is so big.

235
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,870
Pearls?

236
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,960
Are these genuine pearls?

237
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,270
Do I really have to cut it?

238
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,820
Just cut it.

239
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,390
Cut it and take off the biggest one.

240
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,990
Could it be that

241
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,480
those pearls are from that Phoenix Coronet?

242
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:33,730
They're all here.

243
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,820
This is definitely the most expensive tea in the world.

244
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,750
They all show the sincerity of my young master.

245
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,470
I wonder if you like them, Miss Gu.

246
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,370
Yes, of course I like them.

247
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,290
But...

248
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,910
I'm afraid

249
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,350
it's not okay to eat them.

250
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,350
But the creativity shows his great sincerity.

251
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,140
I'll keep it well.

252
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,850
No, I'll cherish it well.

253
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:00,940
My lady is the person who is the most skillful at the arts of tea in the entire Changqing.

254
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,880
It looks like I came at the right time.

255
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,280
What novel thing is this?

256
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,660
Let me see it, too.

257
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:06,840
Miss Du,

258
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,680
since you are here,

259
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,490
I shall take my leave.

260
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,450
See you.

261
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:12,750
Guard Xing!

262
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,380
I have something to tell you.

263
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:15,950
You... You...

264
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,060
Ruoyun, you're here.

265
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,240
I was about to go to see you.

266
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,810
What?

267
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,770
You don't even let me take a look at the tea

268
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,030
which Duan Yu gave you.

269
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,490
No, no. It's not like that.

270
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,950
Guard Xing!

271
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,060
Guard Xing!

272
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,540
I've been calling your name.

273
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,480
Mr. Gu.

274
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,840
What's the matter?

275
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,440
I just want to ask

276
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,960
when the engagement

277
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,040
with the Duan Family can be settled.

278
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,010
As for this matter,

279
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,520
my young master will arrange it himself.

280
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,340
Mr. Gu, just go back and wait for the news.

281
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,180
I'm afraid there will be more trouble as time goes by, right?

282
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,370
Don't worry, Mr. Gu.

283
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,360
I'll take my leave first.

284
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:55,890
Guard Xing!

285
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,950
Please help to urge him more.

286
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,950
Sure. Sure.

287
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,060
Just now, you said that you wanted to come to see me.

288
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,120
What's the matter?

289
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,710
It's not quite convenient now.

290
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,330
Yuanhua, just go away first.

291
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,080
I've invited a few girl friends to have tea

292
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,330
at my mansion tomorrow.

293
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,670
Qiao, you can come, too.

294
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,970
Taste the precious tea in my mansion.

295
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,880
Ruoyun.

296
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,420
Are you not angry with me anymore?

297
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,960
What can I do if I'm angry with you?

298
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,320
If I'm not angry,

299
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,340
will you stop being with Duan Yu?

300
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,370
Forget it.

301
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,950
Just let it be like this.

302
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,660
Anyway, I've been quarrelling and fighting with Duan Yu since childhood.

303
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,260
He'll definitely let me win.

304
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,830
I quite envy you.

305
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,740
What's the use of envying me?

306
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,230
I have to go.

307
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,010
Don't forget to come early.

308
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,710
See you tomorrow.

309
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,460
Dongxi.

310
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,770
Do you think Ruoyun acted weirdly today?

311
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,230
Why do you think she acted weirdly?

312
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,720
I don't know how to explain it.

313
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,310
Then what should we do?

314
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,560
What else can we do?

315
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,790
Judging from her state like that, I think she's going to compete with me to the end.

316
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,430
Then...

317
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,350
will you compete with her?

318
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,750
How can I compete with her?

319
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,990
I'm just a nobody.

320
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,120
I'm not qualified to compete with her.

321
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,330
Anyway, just remember that in the future,

322
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,860
we should try to fawn on her.

323
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,590
My Lady.

324
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,830
Look. She didn't even dare to look straight at you today.

325
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,660
She was obviously guilty.

326
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,150
Yuanhua, you're right.

327
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,040
At first, Gu Qingqiao fawned on me,

328
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,100
which made me stop being vigilant.

329
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,110
Then she took the chance to play tricks behind my back

330
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,550
and take Duan Yu away.

331
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,670
Now she's openly forcing him to marry her.

332
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:53,570
I shouldn't have believed that she's a righteous and helpful person.

333
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:54,300
She's a liar.

334
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,610
It would be good if Young Master Shaoyi was here.

335
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,860
He would definitely come up with a great idea for you

336
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,220
and teach this arrogant

337
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,270
Gu Qingqiao a lesson.

338
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:04,680
How was it?

339
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,580
Did she drink the milk tea?

340
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,710
Did she say that it was delicious?

341
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,870
I don't know whether she drank it or not.

342
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,260
I was in a hurry, so I came out first.

343
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,430
What was wrong with you?

344
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,990
[Duan]

345
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,570
Couldn't you even do this small task well?

346
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,060
Well,

347
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,510
Miss Du suddenly came there.

348
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,090
I was worried that I might disturb them,

349
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,150
so I came out first.

350
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,940
It's not like you've never seen Miss Du before.

351
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,140
Why are you blushing?

352
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,270
The weather is hot.

353
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,240
The weather is hot.

354
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,030
Young Master.

355
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,000
Although I don't know whether Miss Gu drank it or not,

356
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,400
[Duan]

357
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,490
she personally said that

358
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,750
she liked it very much.

359
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,520
So don't worry.

360
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,000
Well,

361
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,350
then I'll leave now.

362
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,230
Well...

363
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,400
Just go back.

364
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:53,630
[Duan]

365
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,340
[Announcement] [Happy News]

366
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,750

367

00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,030
Congratulations, Miss Gu.

372
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,910
Miss Gu!

373
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,990
I wish you and Young Master Duan a happy marriage that will last forever.

374
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,150
Congratulations, Miss Gu.

375
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:15,910
Dongxi.

376
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,370
What’s going on?

377
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,100
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations, Miss Gu.

378
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,510
Tell me.

379
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,790
Is it because of my father?

380
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,430
My Lady.

381
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,940
I really don't know anything.

382
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,260
This tea cup is so beautiful.

383
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,730
These are just a few crude silver cups.

384
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,070
We're good friends. Don't stand on ceremony.

385
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,070
But this is the best-quality Peony Top Tea.

386
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,160
Is it made of peonies?

387
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,010
Peony Top Tea is white tea.

388
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,220
It's also the best type of white tea.

389
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,870
It can help to relieve summer heat.

390
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,930
It's also good for your eyes and skin.

391
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,790
How come there is so much knowledge about drinking tea?

392
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,720
Actually,

393
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,800
the more fastidious way is to use a silver pot to cook the tea

394
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,420
and then drink it after it becomes warm.

395
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,050
It will taste smooth, tender and delicate.

396
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,570
It'll make people feel refreshed and have the effect of promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis.

397
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,080
It means that different tea

398
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,550
should be drunk with different cups, right?

399
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,590
What you said is only half right.

400
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:25,860
Only half right?

401
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,910
A real good cup of tea

402
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:30,780
should be brewed with fully moistened tea leaves,

403
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,880
spring water collected from the mountains

404
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,490
and an appropriate temperature of the water through cooking.

405
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:37,090
Then pour it into a tea cup of a suitable shape.

406
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,130
With the warm tea and fragrance,

407
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,260
it's kind of okay.

408
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,300
I was reckless.

409
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:48,490
The tea utensils in front of you are all from famous official kilns

410
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,590
or specially-made golden cups,

411
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,290
silver cups, bronze cups, Jian cups,

412
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,310
celadon cups and Jun porcelain cups.

413
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,170
Ruoyun, you're really talented.

414
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,700
Not at all.

415
00:16:58,830 --> 00:16:59,910
As I like it,

416
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,780
I have some taste about this field as my hobby.

417
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,349
As the saying goes,

418
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,569
it takes only one second

419
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,910
for an interesting soul

420
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,310
to defeat all those ostentatious figures.

421
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:20,550
Dongxi.

422
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,750
Taste this tea. It's really delicious.

423
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,400
Miss Li from Jiangnan

424
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,600
is not as interesting as Gu Qingqiao.

425
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,580
My Lady.

426
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,470
Don't forget your purpose.

427
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,000
Don't be fooled by her.

428
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,150
Having seen her fawn on you so actively today,

429
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,870
I think she obviously had a guilty conscience.

430
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,850
You can't soften your attitudes.

431
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,050
Right.

432
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,630
I'm not what I used to be anymore.

433
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,550
I'm not that easy to coax.

434
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:54,700
Dongxi.

435
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,070
Massage my face now.

436
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,800
I've been smiling awkwardly all day.

437
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,640
My Lady.

438
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,430
Why did you have to do this?

439
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,110
It's all because of my father,

440
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,580
who made me bear the accusation of unkindness and injustice.

441
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,510
Now it's a tricky situation.

442
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,570
I don't even have a chance to explain.

443
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,690
Other people's tea tastes better indeed.

444
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:18,590
[Duan]

445
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,060
♫Whether it's autumn or winter, I've been missing you♫

446
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:33,510
♫Even if my hair turns grey as time goes by♫

447
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,320
♫Meeting you♫

448
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:37,160
♫Is all my reason♫

449
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,830
♫With you in the crowd♫

450
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,940
♫I persist in it♫

451
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,620
♫No matter how long the journey is♫

452
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:50,640
♫We'll stay with each other♫

453
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,370
Right.

454
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,270
Before my elder brother comes back,

455
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,990
I need to find a way to solve the problem

456
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,360
about the Star of Rebellion as soon as possible.

457
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,320
Young Master, you want to see me?

458
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,530
Yes.

459
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,850
I'm going out for a few days.

460
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,200
Okay. I'll pack up my luggage.

461
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:08,720
No need.

462
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,470
I'll go by myself.

463
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,280
My brother will be back soon.

464
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,240
Look after the Chamber of Commerce

465
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,040
and Duan Shaoyi for me.

466
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,190
Are you going somewhere far away?

467
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,130
I'm going to the Divine Palace.

468
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,330
You're going to the Divine Palace?

469
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,130
Young Master.

470
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,030
Those who go to the Divine Palace will lose all their martial arts skills

471
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,980
and become useless men.

472
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,860
You can't go.

473
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,440
Besides, His Lordship will come out from seclusion soon.

474
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,040
Yes.

475
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,270
I must figure out the truth about the prophecy

476
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,380
of the Star of Rebellion before my brother comes back.

477
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,380
Otherwise, there will be big chaos.

478
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,770
What if the Divine Palace predicts that

479
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,170
the Star of Rebellion will definitely die?

480
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:44,270
I still don't dare to think about this consequence yet.

481
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,040
Young Master, everything has its own destiny.

482
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:50,230
You can't force yourself when you're facing a problem.

483
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,290
It's not easy to meet someone I turly love.

484
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,930
I can't bear to see her die.

485
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,100
Young Master.

486
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,030
Don't try to persuade me anymore.

487
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,350
I've made up my mind to go there.

488
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:05,920
What?

489
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,870
Duan Yu is going to the Divine Palace?

490
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,380
Why is he going there in such a hurry?

491
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,910
He didn't mention the reason.

492
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,680
He only said that he wouldn't be back soon.

493
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,470
The Divine Palace is a place where ordinary people can't go, isn't it?

494
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,360
Right.

495
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,800
But your uncle

496
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,730
is not an ordinary person.

497
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:21,860
Mom.

498
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,710
Acutally, even untill now,

499
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,820
I still don't know how I got here.

500
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,260
But I will try my best

501
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,520
to find a way to go back.

502
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,310
You may have to wait a little longer.

503
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,030
You have to take good care of yourself.

504
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,720
I'm fine.

505
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,140
Don't worry.

506
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,750
Although I've met many strange people and things,

507
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,450
I've still been able to handle them so far.

508
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:48,290
By the way,

509
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,360
my arm has recovered.

510
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,340
It's stronger than before.

511
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,520
I'll be an excellent person again when I go back.

512
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,110
Buddha,

513
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,460
please bless my mother.

514
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,060
Please also bless that Gu Qingqiao

515
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,320
can be safe in everything.

516
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:11,620
Duan Yu?

517
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,810
Have you specially come here to see me?

518
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,550
I need to go somewhere far away.

519
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:27,080
It might take some days before I can come back.

520
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,510
Are you trying to hide from me deliberately

521
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,800
because I'm the Star of Rebellion?

522
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,610
Silly girl.

523
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,510
Why would I have come to see you if I was trying to hide from you?

524
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,020
I just want to remind you that

525
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,150
you have to take good care

526
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,810
of yourself when I'm not here.

527
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:39,510
You...

528
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,420
Why are you so serious?

529
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,800
You're talking as if it would be a farewell.

530
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,360
Are you going to do something dangerous?

531
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,500
I don't hope that I can't see you again.

532
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,710
It won't be dangerous.

533
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,740
Don't worry.

534
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,600
Everything will be fine.

535
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,500
Then remember to tell me in advance when you

536
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,300
go somewhere far away next time.

537
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,860
I can make dumplings for you.

538
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,650
Dumplings?

539
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,360
Getting into the car...

540
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:05,830
No.

541
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,180
Dumplings are for those who will travel far and noodles are for those who have come back home.

542
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,660
Eatting dumplings

543
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,740
means that I'm looking forward to your return and reunion with me.

544
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,640
You've never heard of it?

545
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,580
Is it a custom in your hometown?

546
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,490
Let's have noodles together when you come back.

547
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:20,940
It means being together forever.

548
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,350
Okay.

549
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:22,980
By the way,

550
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,330
this is for you.

551
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,230
I think you should keep it.

552
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,180
After all, this legacy was left to you by the person who was closest to you.

553
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,440
I think it's extremely important to you.

554
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:34,470
Now you are the most important person to me.

555
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:35,900
The most important thing

556
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,860
should be entrusted to the most important person.

557
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,860
This is my most important decision.

558
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,730
Just let it accompany you for me.

559
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,880
You are also the most important person to me.

560
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,920
Trust me.

561
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,490
No matter how big the difficulty is,

562
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,410
I will try all my best to face it.

563
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,150
I also hope that I can be with you forever.

564
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,500
Wherever you go,

565
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,860
you must come back safely.

566
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,510
I'll be

567
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,430
waiting for you here.

568
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,490
I believe that

569
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,740
I'll definitely find a win-win solution in the Divine Palace.

570
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:26,200
Then the overbearing young master fell in love with me.

571
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,660
Ruoyun.

572
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,280
What's the rush?

573
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,420
Duan Yu has gone to the Divine Palace.

574
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,940
Why has he gone to the Divine Palace?

575
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,740
I don't know.

576
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,610
It probably has something to do with Gu Qingqiao.

577
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,210
Gu Qingqiao.

578
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,470
Gu Qingqiao.

579
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,200
When can all this trouble be over?

580
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,290
Ruoyun.

581
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,050
Why don't you just forget Duan Yu?

582
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,790
It's not that I can't forget him.

583
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,520
I just can't accept the result.

584
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,590
Then I'll help you defeat Gu Qingqiao

585
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,210
when Duan Yu is away from home.

586
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:12,540
Then will you be able to accept the result?

587
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,480
Maybe.

588
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,230
I'm indeed a genius

589
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,650
and the top student of the Discus Team.

590
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,260
It's done.

591
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,260
Who's inside?

592
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,290
Why did you lock the door?

593
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,840
It's me.

594
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,270
Father, wait a moment.

595
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,000
I'll come soon. I'll come soon.

596
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:13,750
Right away.

597
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:20,970
Qiao.

598
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,570
What are you doing in my study room?

599
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,440
Why did you even lock the door?

600
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:29,590
I was creating a work in your study room.

601
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,880
When I closed the door,

602
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,320
I accidentally

603
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,270
locked it.

604
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,340
Creating a work?

605
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,350
What does creating a work mean?

606
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,750
Did you have to creat a work in my study room?

607
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,720
How come I feel so uneasy?

608
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,270
Father,

609
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,910
if you say that, you seem to treat me as an outsider, don't you?

610
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:49,080
Then I'll return the study room to you.

611
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,760
I'll leave now.

612
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,260
What's in your hand?

613
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,230
My... My painting.

614
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,760
Qiao!

615
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,530
Come back!

616
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,320
-Qiao!
-Close the door!

617
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,080
What's wrong, My Lady?

618
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,880
What's going on?

619
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,330
His Lordship has been calling your name.

620
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:18,380
I used several paintings of his to create a work.

621
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,830
He may not understand it for the time being.

622
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,150
Qiao!

623
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,460
Qiao!

624
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,760
Dongxi.

625
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,750
Find some nice clothes for me.

626
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,150
My Lady, where are you going this time?

627
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,020
I'm going to butter up my sister-in-law

628
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,830
and nephew.

629
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,800
How can you call her sister-in-law?

630
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,050
She's actually your love rival.

631
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:43,840
Alright.

632
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,340
I'll just flatter them.

633
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:47,920
Take good care of my father.

634
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:48,920
I have to go.

635
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,560
What should we do next?

636
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,440
If the enemy doesn't take action, I shouldn't take action, either.

637
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,680
Knowing your enemy well is the only way to win.

638

How is it going with Gu Qingqiao?

641
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,230
She has been staying at home without going out

642
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,060
in the past few days.

643
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,390
It is said that she's been creating a work.

644
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,110
What does creating a work mean?

645
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,670
Is she plotting something again?

646
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,360
I don't know, either.

647
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,550
I've heard that

648
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,460
if some people have come back to life,

649
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,270
they were sent back here by evil creatures

650
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,000
after being possessed by them.

651
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,430
Since she crawled out of the coffin,

652
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:30,290
many great changes have happened in Changqing.

653
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:33,980
Is she possessed by some sorcery?

654
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,170
Let's take measures according to the actual situation.

655
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:39,840
We won't be afraid of her, will we?

656
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,040
I just want to see what she's capable of.

657
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,080
Ruoyi, show me the way.

658
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,310
Let's go see the work she has created.

659
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,230
Don't bother, Young Master Shaoyi.

660
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,390
She's already here.

661
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,220
Really?

662
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:54,510
Well...

663
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,680
She came here to confront us so soon?

Si is entertaining her now.

665
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,260
She asked someone to send the message that

666
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,860
she would wait for you at the pavilion in the garden.

667
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,320
And she knows that Miss Du is also in our residence.

668
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,680
She wants to invite you two to go there together.

669
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,640
My Lady, will it be dangerous?

670
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,390
How about just not going there?

671
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,090
Let's go!

672
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,550
This is my Duan Residence.

673
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,940
I'm not afraid of an outsider like her making trouble.

00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:24,640
Go summon some Wuyi Guards here.

00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:26,860
Just in case.

Yes.

680
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,260
Why didn't I see so many

681
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,400
Wuyi Guards when I was in your residence before?

682
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,330
We're the only ones chatting here.

683
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,130
How about asking them all to leave?

684
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,780
Miss Gu, there's something you don't know.

685
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:46,240
These Wuyi Guards are all here to protect me.

686
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,450

Have you made trouble again?

690
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:55,120
No one would come to your home directly to hit you.

691
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,240
Isn't that quite stupid?

692
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,450
That's good if no one would do so.

693
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:58,060

00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,350
No.

918
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,580
I'm just walking around here casually.

919
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:50,920
Why is there no one in your restaurant?

920
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,280
It's not dinner time yet, is it?

921
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,720
When it's dinner time, there will be so many people.

922
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,280
Alright.

923
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:58,440
Give me a private room.

924
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,440
I'll have dinner here tonight.

925
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,670
Today, I'll prepare the dinner for you personally.

926
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,310
Waiter!

927
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,960
Take Young Master Duan Shaoyi to the best private room.

928
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,620
Young Master Shaoyi, please.

929
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,590
Shaoyi is so kind.

930
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:11,120
He still wants to support me at this time.

931
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,800
Dongxi!

932
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:14,140
Tonight, make some delicious food for...

933
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,110
Dongxi!

934
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:17,210
Dong...

935
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:19,820
Where is she?

936
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:22,640
The Gu Family contributed a lot during the period of grain shortage.

937
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,770
They offered congee and donated money.

938
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:25,980
It was not easy for my boss.

939
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,230
I didn't ask for my monthly salary.

940
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,690
You didn't ask for the montly salary?

941
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,260
Are you crazy?

942
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,200
I don't care.

943
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,340
The debtor has been urging me.

944
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,070
You must find some money for me.

945
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:35,090
Father.

946
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,170
I'm your daughter.

947
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,500
I'm not a private bank.

948
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:40,520
How dare you talk to your father like that?

949
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:44,110
My Lady.

950
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:45,660
Haven't you just got your monthly salary?

951
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,150
Buy a new one if it's old.

952
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,320
I quite like this one.

953
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:50,960
It's still wearable.

954
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,260
Miss,

955
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:56,060
your embroidery this time

956
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,990
is not as exquisite as last time.

957
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:59,590
I can only give you two taels of silver.

958
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,600
Just two taels?

959
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,510
Just two taels.

960
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,670
Gu Qingqiao.

961
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,460
Dongxi is so loyal to you.

962
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,710
What are you doing?

963
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,390
Am I asking for money for myself?

964
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,520
It's for your mother's debt, isn't it?

965
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:16,030
Your earrings are nice.

966
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:16,830
Give them to me

967
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,040
I can pawn them to get some money.

968
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,320
Father, You can't take them.

969
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,820
My lady gave them to me.

970
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,170
Your lady gave them to you?

971
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:23,630
Then they're more valuable.

972
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,260
Your lady is from a rich family anyway.

973
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,160
Ask her to give you another pair in the future.

974
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,020
Give them to me!

975
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,570
Father, how could you do this?

976
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,480
How can you be such a father?

977
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,470
My Lady.

978
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,760
It's red.

979
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,020
You've got the earrings.

980
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:38,690
Just go.

981
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,640
Thank you, My Lady.

982
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,740
Wait.

983
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,460
This is the last time.

984
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,770
Dongxi has signed the contract of selling herself.

985
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:47,950
As long as I still have the contract,

986
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,900
she's a member of our Gu Residence.

987
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,910
If I see you again next time,

988
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,570
we'll meet each other at the government office.

989
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:54,240
Yes, yes, yes.

990
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:54,770
Yes.

991
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,170
My... My lady.

992
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,750
These are your favorite earrings.

993
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,850
Silly girl.

994
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:12,930
Earrings are not as important as you.

995
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:15,330
I'm not a sill girl.
