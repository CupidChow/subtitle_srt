00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,270
Who is it?

193
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,190
Who's stealing food in the middle of the night?

194
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:30,760
Come out!

195
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,380
If you don't come out, I'll go in.

196
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,080
Who?

197
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,380
Come out!

198
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,470
Don't come out.

199
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,150
Wait.

200
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,040
It's me.

201
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,840
Why are you bleeding so much?

202
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,100
Where are you injured?

203
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,850
Let me see.

204
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,700
Keep your voice down.

205
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:24,790
Didn't I tell you

206
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,190
not to fight with others?

207
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,130
Why were you so impulsive?

208
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,390
Why didn't you listen?

209
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,700
What should we do now?

210
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,010
Let's go find Master.

211
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,070
He likes you so much.

212
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,000
He will save you.

213
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:36,870
Let's go.

214
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,830
Why didn't you tell me you were hurt?

215
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,290
If you keep doing this,

216
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,550
I won't find the sword.

217
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,750
What's the use of telling you?

218
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,150
Can you fight for me

219
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,310
or heal me?

220
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,700
Finding the sword is more useful than anything.

221
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,780
I'll find a way.

222
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:57,870
I won't allow you

223
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,390
to die so easily.

224
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,530
Don't worry.

225
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,690
The heaven doesn't

226
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,660
want to take my worthless life now.

227
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:05,680
Lu Zizheng.

228
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,340
I'm sorry.

229
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,500
I didn't notice you were hurt.

230
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,410
It's my fault.

231
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,180
I'm always a burden to you.

232
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,470
Exactly.

233
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,600
Just consider me willing.

234
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,780
I will remember everything you did

235
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,470
and never forget.

236
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,170
Don't cry.

237
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,080
So ugly.

238
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,030
What a nuisance.

239
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:31,820
Are you coming or not?

240
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,150
What about your injury?

241
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,030
We haven't asked Master to check your injury.

242
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,360
I have an exceptional physique.

243
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,270
I won't die.

244
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,230
Nonsense.

245
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,720
What are you thinking?

246
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,930
Are you still thinking about him?

247
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:01,990
Don't remind me.

248
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,770
I saw a pattern today.

249
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,000
I don't know what it means.

250
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,410
What pattern?

251
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,380
This is a heart.

252
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,870
It means love.

253
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,900
They drew it wrong.

254
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,310
The heart should be almond-shaped.

255
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,500
It's cute to draw like this.

256
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,180
Then why

257
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:36,750
call them clouds?

258
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,350
Because your name means the sky.

259
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,550
They hope to fly freely in your arms.

260
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,270
Don't you know this?

261
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,270
Thank you.

262
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,110
I like it.

263
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,570
You are fine now.

264
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,660
No one can stay in the past forever.

265
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,260
You should move on.

266
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,790
Don't.

267
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,890
It's me.

268
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,190
You scared me.

269
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,810
You hid yourself well.

270
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:44,960
I didn't even notice you.

271
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,470
I'm sure the witch doctor couldn't notice you either.

272
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,350
Of course.

273
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,830
I've been engaged in intellectual and physical confrontations

274
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,210
with Mr. Qi and Ruo Yi since I was young.

275
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,880
I am most skilled at concealing my tracks.

276
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,930
That's my slave.

277
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:53,670
Amazing.

278
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:56,850
I wonder

279
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,530
how long I can continue being your slave.

280
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,530
I'll tell the witch doctor

281
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,390
to let you stay.

282
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,680
Do you really not let me go?

283
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,480
My slave can't leave just like that.

284
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,920
Without your permission,

285
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,370
I'm not going anywhere.

286
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,530
All right, I'm leaving.

287
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,430
If the witch doctor finds out I'm here,

288
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,000
you will be kicked out again.

289
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,880
How about

290
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,310
leaving with me?

291
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,300
Why?

292
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,660
No reason.

293
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,990
How can a master leave with her slave?

294
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:49,350
How about I be the master

295
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,700
and you be the slave?

296
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,220
I disagree.

297
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,310
Shaoyi.

298
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:19,710
Do me a favor.

299
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,070
You look so serious.

300
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,750
Are you going to do something bad?

301
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,960
Be serious.

302
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,160
I must get the holy relic of the Fire Crane Tribe.

303
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,220
But I can't let Mr. Qi know about this.

304
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,710
So I want to do it in your name.

305
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,980
No wonder you decided to stay that day.

306
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,910
Is there something wrong with this?

307
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,520
I suspect

308
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,960
it's related to Qiao.

309
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,680
Really?

310
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:41,850
Could it be...

311
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:42,850
Just a suspicion.

312
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,840
I'm not sure.

313
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:44,860
Okay.

314
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,400
Okay.

315
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,240
Shaoyi.

316
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,460
Do you like Wu?

317
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,710
Do you know

318
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,010
there is a significant disparity

319
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,830
in your identities or statuses?

320
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,350
Aren't you and Gu Qingqiao the same?

321
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,950
You can do it.

322
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,000
So do I.

323
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:21,760
Okay.

324
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,120
Since you've made up your mind,

325
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,040
you must

326
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,150
persist until the end.

327
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,490
How could it be?

328
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:36,170
How could it not match?

329
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,130
First Senior.

330
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,190
What's up?

331
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,130
The lamp oil in Qianyi Hall is running out.

332
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:46,970
We need more.

333
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,260
I'm sorry.

334
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,510
We need to purchase lamp oil in bulk.

335
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,080
The warehouse's supply is insufficient.

336
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,800
I'm not blaming you.

337
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,940
But lamp oil is a commonly used item.

338
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,740
You should always keep in stock.

339
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:00,930
That's right.

340
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,590
You are right. First Senior.

341
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,390
I'll be more careful next time.

342
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,109
Negative ten.

343
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:22,579
Oh my god.

344
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:24,460
Financial deficit.

345
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,369
What should I do?

346
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,640
[Andun]

347
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,070
I have something to tell you.

348
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,350
Don't tell anyone.

349
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:31,990
Go ahead.

350
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,830
I spent all the money of Xiling.

351
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,000
Will Master expel me from Xiling

352
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,700
once he finds out?

353
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,050
You deserve it.

354
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:39,450
You...

355
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,870
What should I do?

356
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,580
How about we quickly go to the forbidden area

357
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,830
to find the sword before anyone finds out?

358
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,550
Once we find the sword,

359
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,150
we'll run away immediately.

360
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,550
Let's eat first.

361
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,260
Qing.

362
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,460
Uncle.

363
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:04,500
Okay, thank you.

364
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,810
I want to eat braised pork.

365
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,640
OK, Uncle.

366
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,220
I want some too.

367
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,910
Didn't I tell you just now?

368
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,370
I don't have much money.

369
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,330
Don't you know that?

370
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,890
I don't want to eat.

371
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,780
Whoever wants to eat, go ahead.

372
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,590
It's shameful to waste food!

373
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,570
What's wrong with him?

374
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,100
He is

375
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,950
going through menopause.

376
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,450
What is menopause?

377
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,610
I'll go get the braised pork.

378
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:03,220
[Forbidden Area]

379
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,350
Again?

380
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,190
First...

381
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,160
First Senior.

382
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,540
W-Why are you here?

383
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,760
I've been suspicious of you for a long time.

384
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,860
You're indeed trying to intrude into the forbidden area.

385
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,510
No, no, no.

386
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,870
It's not what you think.

387
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,200
Let me explain.

388
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,820
Okay?

389
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,180
Master.

390
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,640
Qing was trying to intrude into the forbidden area

391
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,170
and I caught her on the spot.

392
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:35,860
Master.

393
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,670
Uncle.

394
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,330
First Senior.

395
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,650
Please listen to my explanation.

396
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,190
I-I wasn't...

397
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,550
What are you explaining?

398
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,930
Did you run out of money of Xiling?

399
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,430
So you went to the forbidden area to steal treasures.

400
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,060
Master.

401
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,640
She should be expelled according to the rules.

402
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,550
Master, I didn't steal any treasures.

403
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,720
Don't chase me away.

404
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,780
I somehow managed to

405
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,890
spend all the money inexplicably.

406
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,150
How could you not know?

407
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,050
If you hadn't let those brats

408
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,890
light lamp oil every day,

409
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,530
and eat delicious food and drinks every day,

410
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,820
how could you spend the money for the past few months

411
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,110
in just a dozen days?

412
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,650
As the Grand Steward,

413
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,290
how can you not know these things?

414
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,620
How could you not think of that in advance?

415
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,270
People are different.

416
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,220
Some people are born to be smart.

417
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,930
Some people's brains are just decorations.

418
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,560
Isn't it unkind to say that about your sister?

419
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,110
Justice over kin.

420
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,510
If she did something wrong,

421
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,370
she has to bear the consequences.

422
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:33,750
I've never worried about these things.

423
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,200
Have you run out of money completely?

424
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,600
Then why did you go to the forbidden area?

425
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,010
I...

426
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,240
I wanted...

427
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,970
I wanted to go to the forbidden area

428
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,270
to check the hot spring.

429
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,700
I wanted to open the forbidden area to the public

430
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,270
and transform the hot spring into a bathing center.

431
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,300
This would solve

432
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,130
our sect's financial problems.

433
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,690
How did you know there was a hot spring in the forbidden area?

434
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:57,500
I...

435
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:58,820
I read it in the book.

436
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,160
Uncle can testify.

437
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,880
What are you reading?

438
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,030
Y-You walk so quietly.

439
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,060
You scared me.

440
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,080
What did you read?

441
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,300
[The Landscape of Xiling]

442
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,740
According to the book,

443
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,110
there's a hot spring in Xiling.

444
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,280
Ridiculous!

445
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,000
Xiling is a prestigious sect.

446
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,810
How can we stoop to doing business to survive?

447
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,190
Don't mention it again.

448
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,740
It brings disgrace to our ancestors.

449
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:39,900
But...

450
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,700
Stop it.

451
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,440
I have some ancient formulas here.

452
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,430
If there's no other way,

453
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,150
take it down the mountain

454
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,540
and pawn it.

455
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:51,590
Yes.

456
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:07,850
What?

457
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,860
What did you mean just now?

458
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:12,570
Nothing.

459
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:15,440
Forget it.

460
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,250
Since you've just recovered,

461
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,020
I don't want to argue with you.

462
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,180
Let's talk about something serious.

463
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,580
I've searched all over the Tianlu Pavilion,

464
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,780
but there's no sword.

465
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,190
The forbidden area exploration was blocked.

466
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,010
Luckily, I was quick-witted.

467
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,970
I persuaded everyone to develop the forbidden area

468
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:38,010
due to Xiling's economic crisis.

469
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:40,680
We can not only make money,

470
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,920
but we can also legitimately search for the sword.

471
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,700
You're so smart.

472
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:48,730
Convince your Uncle Ruan to help you find it together.

473
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,280
Why do you speak so strangely?

474
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,680
I can say whatever I want.

475
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,480
If you don't like it, don't stay here.

476
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,210
You're disturbing me fishing.

477
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,580
What are you doing?

478
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,660
You deserve it.

[Land Redevelopment Plan of Xiling]

480
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,530
Everyone,

481
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,490
after careful consideration,

482
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:20,530
I've finally come up with a great way to make money.

483
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,300
What does this mean?

484
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:24,900
[Land Redevelopment Plan of Xiling]

485
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,520
As you all know,

486
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,560
there is a hot spring in the forbidden area of Xiling.

487
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,470
This book

488
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,870
was written by the founder of Xiling.

489
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,010
It says

490
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,540
that in the south of Yunmeng forest,

491
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,360
and in the north of Xinglin residence,

492
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,110
there's a pool in the mountains.

493
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,220
This is the forbidden area of Xiling.

494
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,810
The pool is the hot spring.

495
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,660
So what does this have to do with

496
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,960
the land redevelopment

497
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,910
you mentioned?

498
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,510
The Article 135 in the Xiling Grand Steward's

499
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,630
Operating Guide states that

500
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,450
the Grand Steward of Xiling

501
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:03,130
has the right to plan the land of Xiling.

502
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,160
The forbidden area is also part of the land of Xiling.

503
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,000
Does that mean

504
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,090
I have the right to plan and manage it?

505
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,870
I plan to open the forbidden area of Xiling to the public,

506
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,810
and commercialize the hot spring

507
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:16,590
to attract a lot of high-quality customers.

508
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,750
Take the hot spring as a gimmick.

509
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,630

-Master has already refused

510
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:20,710

00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:21,730
Yes.

512
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,710
That's why I called everyone here.

513
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,320
As long as we work hard together,

514
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:27,990
I believe

515
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,160
we can do it.

516
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,060
I agree with Master.

517
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,870
I won't help you persuade him.

518
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:35,240
I think you should stop thinking about it.

00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,070
-First Senior.
-First Senior.

520
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,050
Don't mind him.

521
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,850
He's just a stubborn old man.

522
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,010
Junior.

523
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,760
I think it sounds promising.

524
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,510
Don't worry.

525
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,520

00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,500
Count me in.

We will support you.

528
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:53,900
Count me in too.

529
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,230
It sounds interesting.

530
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,690
I-If I can help...

531
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,880
Let's work together

532
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,980
to earn money together.

533
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,680
Earn money.

534
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,450
-Earn money.
-Earn money.

535
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,950
Earn money!

536
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,740
What Wang Tianshan said carries great weight.

537
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,870
Doing business is not allowed.

538
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,100
Master.

539
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,840
Think again.

540
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,690
Master.

541
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,270
Please think about it again.

542
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,100
Think about it.

543
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:34,740
If all the beauties from Qingshui Town come to soak in the hot spring,

544
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,540
can we still call it a hot spring?

545
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,340
It would be a fragrant bath.

546
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:38,790
Right.

547
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:39,750
-Is it true?
-Yeah.

548
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,110
Second Senior, you can't lie to me.

549
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,230
Of course it’s true.

550
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,230
It's true.

551
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,060
Junior told me herself.

552
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:47,110
Everyone will have a chance to soak in the hot spring.

553
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,180
And it can also increase the income of Xiling.

554
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,380
This is a great thing.

555
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,230
Yes.

556
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,330
Exactly.

557
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:56,480
I can't soak in the hot spring alone anymore.

558
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,010
This...

559
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,710
Uncle.

560
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:11,830
You can't eat that.

561
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,460
Have you really thought this through about

562
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,780
developing the forbidden area?

563
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,620
Yes.

564
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,530
I told Master.

565
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,040
But he didn't agree.

566
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,300
I wonder if you...

567
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:29,690
I agree.

568
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,710
I haven't told you the details.

569
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,260
You've always looked out for the disciples of Xiling.

570
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,140
I'm glad.

571
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,030
I believe you've made the right decision.

572
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,410
I trust you.

573
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,480
Uncle.

574
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,210
I'll steam the bacon for you.

575
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,880
Have you heard?

576
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,660
About what?

577
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:04,550
Really?

578
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,240
Uncle has agreed to develop the forbidden area.

579
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,160
Really?

580
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,430
Then I support it too.

581
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,150
I support it too.

582
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:11,980
I support it too.

583
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:12,500
Okay.

584
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,990
Now,

585
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,030
only Master and First Senior disagree.

586
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,810
Master dotes on Junior Bai the most.

587
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,030
If Junior Bai

588
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,620
is willing to persuade Master...

589
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,420
That's right.

590
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:25,940
Right?

591
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,230
My brother.

592
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,550
He's still in his rebellious phase.

593
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,950
Rebellious phase?

594
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,420
The more you let him do,

595
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:33,730
the less he'll do.

596
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:34,930
Don't count on him.

597
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,630
Got it.

598
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,880
Your brother is really a weirdo.

599
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,760
He seems to be deliberately opposing you all day long.

600
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,950
Who knows?

601
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,550
Junior.

602
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,950
Don't worry too much.

603
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,260
I'll take care of

604
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:47,670
First Senior.

605
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,870
If Master opposes again...

606
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,830
Then let's go

607
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,760
and beg him together.

608
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,830
For the future development of Xiling,

609
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:03,360
and the disciples' cost of living issues,

610
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:04,750
I agree.

611
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,110
The land redevelopment plan of Xiling

612
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,660
will be

613
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,350
led

614
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,760
by Qing.

615
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,470
All disciples should cooperate fully.

616
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,400
Didn't Master strongly oppose it?

617
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,340
Who knows what he's thinking?

618
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,360
If there's no objection...

619
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,400
I object.

620
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:26,950
Master.

621
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:27,430
Senior.

622
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,500
Didn't you say you'd take care of First Senior?

623
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,250
If we fall to the point of...

624
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,190
I've tried my best.

625
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,280
Other sects will laugh at us.

626
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,540
Let them laugh.

627
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,070
Let them laugh at us.

628
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,350
We do our job.

629
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,690
What if the Great Master blames us?

630
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,100
I'll bear it.

631
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,910
Quancai.

632
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:50,960
Now everyone has agreed.

633
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,750
Please be flexible.

634
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,190
Master.

635
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:55,970
Please forgive me.

636
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,550
I can't do as you say.

637
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:59,480
You...

638
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,280
First Senior.

639
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,240
Master.

640
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,240
First Senior is too stubborn.

641
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,210
That's right.

642
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:04,970
How could he do that?

643
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:05,680
It's okay.

644
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,110
Let's stick to the plan.

645
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:12,270
Shouldn't we pick an auspicious day on the almanac?

646
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,690
Master.

647
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:16,060
This matter should be done sooner rather than later.

648
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,430
Master, how about tomorrow?

649
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,690
Let's start tomorrow.

650
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:20,740
Bai is right.

651
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:21,880
Just listen to Bai.

652
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,520
Okay.

653
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,850
Let's start tomorrow.

654
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:25,380
Great!

655
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,350
[Forbidden Area]

656
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,980
We're going to build an entrance

657
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,180
in front of this forbidden area.

658
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:33,550
Pass through this entrance,

659
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:36,270
you can see the natural hot spring in Xiling.

660
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,150
We also plan to make three

661
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:41,380
special bathing pools with different effects.

662
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,740
What is a special bathing pool?

663
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,350
We use our own medicine

664
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,930
to make some unique formulas.

665
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,330
That's a good idea.

666
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:53,620
This is the prescription Master gave me.

667
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,430
Senior Guan.

668
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,920
Please make a medicine bag

669
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,270
according to this prescription,

670
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:59,570
so that it can be soaked in the soup pool.

671
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,530
Senior Fu Rong.

672
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,750
Could you please take seniors

673
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,730
to refurbish the bathing pools

674
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,070
and landscape the surrounding environment according to the blueprints?

675
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:11,160
[Forbidden Area]

676
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,250
I hope that when everyone comes to Xiling,

677
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,100
they can see our beautiful environment.

678
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,130
Okay. Okay.

679
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,120
Is there a time limit on this?

680
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,840
Can it be completed in three days?

681
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,010
I'll do my best.

682
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,560
Did everyone hear that?

683
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,930
It must be completed within three days.

684
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,390
Don't stand there.

685
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,460
Go to work with me. Go.

686
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,850
Let's go.

687
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:32,810
Let's go.

688
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:33,790
Hurry up.

689
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,740
Take your things.

690
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,590
Let's go over there.

691
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,650
Let's go together.

692
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,520
Let's go.

693
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,660
You helped me persuade Master?

694
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,540
What do you think?

695
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,010
Thank you.

696
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,560
No need to thank me.

697
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,210
What's wrong?

698
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,870
I've expressed my gratitude.

699
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,500
Why aren't you helping us with the work?

700
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,380
Why should I?

701
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,090
Brother.

702
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,990
Don't you know the deadline is very tight?

703
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,560
What does it have to do with me?

704
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,430
Do you not support my plan

705
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,230
to develop the hot spring?

706
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,320
Why should I support it?

707
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:02,930
Besides,

708
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,960
I'm not here to do manual labor.

709
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:11,590
Before we find the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword,

710
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,910
we must become good disciples of Xiling.

711
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,420
This is our public image.

712
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,950
I don't know about your image thing.

713
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,910
I only know that I convinced Master

714
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,130
to let you develop the hot spring.

715
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:23,290
Let them do the labor.

716
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:24,630
I'm leaving.

717
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:25,760
Where are you going?

718
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,350
I'm going back and have a good sleep

719
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,830
when no one is around.

720
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:31,220
Aren't you afraid that I'll break up with you?

721
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,570
I'll find a knife for you now.

722
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,530
What do you think of this name?

723
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,990
[Penglai]

724
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:40,710
Penglai Fairy Pool Bathing Center.

725
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,220
It sounds impressive.

726
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:43,950
I like it.

727
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,790
Penglai Fairy Pool

728
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,270
can prolong your life.

729
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,170
It's good for your skin.

730
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,600
You're right.

731
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,230
A soak in Penglai Fairy Pool

732
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:55,960
is better than the elixir.

733
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:56,710
That's right.

734
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,310
OK.

735
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:58,620
I have one.

736
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:01,680
Penglai Fairy Pool Bathing Center.

737
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:04,700
Welcome to Xiling.

738
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,320
I don't think that's a good idea.

739
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,680
Let's think about more

740
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:12,140
and write them down.

741
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,220
I also want to develop some peripheral industries.

742
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,240
Peripheral industries?

743
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,490
Traditional Chinese Medicine Picking Garden.

744
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,440
Health Lecture.

745
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,780
A day tour to Xiling.

746
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,850
I think it'll work.

747
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:26,590
Wait.

748
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:29,340
And our highly anticipated drink.

749
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,520
Xiling's Special Drink.

750
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,320
What

751
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,490
is a special drink?

752
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:38,960
Junior.

753
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,780
You can't take it.

754
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,180
This medicine is for fire poison.

755
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,220
I want to taste it.

756
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:51,990
You

757
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:54,370
weren't interested in anything.

758
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,260
But now,

you're curious about everything.

760
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,080
I have indeed changed a lot.

761
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:04,820
Maybe

762
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,200
this is a good thing.

763
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,410
Senior,

764
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:09,970
I agreed

765
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,730
to develop the hot spring.

766
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:14,240
It's about to open.

767
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:15,700
How could I not know?

768
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,330
Junior.

769
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,520
It's so late.

770
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,120
You came to find me just for this?

771
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,280
Senior.

772
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,730
Do you know where Master is?

773
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,770
Probably overseas.

774
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,380
Master has been looking for an elixir all these years.

775
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,910
I wonder if he has found it.

776
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:39,050
The forbidden area has been transformed.

777
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,540
I want Master to come back.

778
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,130
Do you have any way to inform him?

779
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,310
You're asking me?

780
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,520
I don't even know whom to ask.

781
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,110
Anyway, you agreed to it.

Where exactly is this sword?

784
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:02,190
Could it be in the hot spring?

Catch a tiger by the toe.

If he hollers,

789
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:19,980
let him go.

Look.

Right.
