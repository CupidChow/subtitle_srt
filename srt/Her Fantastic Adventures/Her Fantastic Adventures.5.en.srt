3
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,080
Why are you still standing here?

4
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,050
Call the doctor.

5
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,259
Young Master Duan said he's fine.

6
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,530
But it doesn't mean he's actually fine.

7
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,530
Go get the doctor.

8
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,000
Okay.

9
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,120
That's right.

10
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,650
Tighten the core. Adjust your breathing.

11
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,640
Faster.

12
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:18,770
Keep it up. Faster.

3 minutes and 39 seconds.

14
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,060
When I was about your age,

15
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,880
I ran much faster.

16
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:29,910
Alright.

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,400
I think it's good enough.

18
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,610
At least you did better than yesterday.

19
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,110
Chunjiao.

20
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,180
Going above and beyond is the biggest
breakthrough.

21
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:39,470
Come on.

22
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,470

Okay, hold on.

00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,030
Hang in there, Chunjiao.

26
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,790
Hurry!

27
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,310
-Mom.
-Hold on.

28
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,800
-It's too heavy.
-Hold on.

29
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
Don't talk.

30
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,960
You'll be deflated if you talk.

31
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,560
Don't lose the strength in your back.

32
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,610
Focus.

33
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,060
Or else you'll get hurt!

34
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,450
Dad. Help!

35
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,410
My mom is killing me.

Believe in yourself.

You can do it!

39
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,840
Come on! Try a bit harder!

40
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,280
Faster. Lift your feet.

41
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,240
Don't lose your strength.

42
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,140
Tighten the core.

43
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,100
Hang in there!

44
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,130
Dad.

45
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,829
I want to quit.

46
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:19,930
Can I just be your daughter?

47
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,050
Ok. Ok. Ok.

48
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,500
That's it for today.

49
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,210
Here, baby girl.

50
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,540
You did much better than your dad.

51
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,120
If your mom sat in the back,

52
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,520
I couldn't even pull her.

53
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,170
Let's leave aside your results for now.

54
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:36,910
Did you notice

55
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,210
that nothing in this world

56
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,850
can happen overnight?

57
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,120
Just like the bond between me and you

58
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,190
was cultivated over many lifetimes.

59
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,680
That's why

60
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,329
if you don't work hard, you won't succeed.

61
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,980
Do you understand?

62
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,330
I'll just simply change the time.

63
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:00,970
Right?

64
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,040
How dare you two come back at this time?

65
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,400
What time is it?

66
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,480
What time is it?

67
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,160
It's just past eight.

68
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,260
What did you say?

69
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,620
Can't you see there's no one on the street?

70
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,839
Well...

71
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,430
Maybe my watch is broken.

72
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,329
It says it's past eight o'clock.

73
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:20,279
You've got to be kidding me.

74
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,450
Stop pretending.

75
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,670
Don't you smell it?

76
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,130
It's fine that you went to have hot pot
until the place closed.

77
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,010
You didn't go to training this afternoon.

78
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,159
You even took her to ride a roller coaster.

79
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,290
How did you find out?

80
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,180
How many times have I told you?

81
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,210
She's an athlete.

82
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,290
Even a small injury

83
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,760
could impact her whole life.

84
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,380
Are you out of your mind?

85
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,200
Can't you behave?

86
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,760
Stop indulging her in food and games.

87
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,680
Stop spoiling her, okay?

88
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,250
It's like I'm the only bad one in the
family.

89
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,370
The kid needs to take a break sometimes.

90
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,520
What's the big deal?

91
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,380
How about this?

92
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,040
From now on, I'll be the bad guy with you.

93
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,530
Alright?

94
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,650
You are the bad guy.

95
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,680
Stay out of this.

96
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,850
-OK. I'm a bad guy.
-Let's go.

97
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,380
-I'm the only bad guy in the family.
-Hurry up.

98
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,500
Dad.

99
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,910
If I win this qualifying round,

100
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,850
I can bring glory to our ancestors.

101
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,170
What are you talking about?

102
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,900
You've always been our family's greatest
pride.

103
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,150
Dad,

104
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,980
don't be late this afternoon.

105
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,840
If I win,

106
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
can you reward me with a grand prize?

107
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,540
No problem.

108
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,170
I'll come home early today.

109
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,970
If you win,

110
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,920
I'll buy you a skirt, okay?

111
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:29,880
Dad.

112
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:30,930
Dad.

113
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,490
I don't want a skirt.

114
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,490
Can you please not go?

115
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,620
Stay at home with me.

116
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,610
It's getting late.

117
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,060
I got to get going.

118
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,650
Remember what I told you.

119
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,560
Come on. Come on.

120
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,560
I'm rooting for you.

121
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,230
Dad.

122
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,280
Don't leave.

123
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,659
I will never see you again if you leave.

124
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,200
Dad, please don't leave.

125
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,730
What are you talking about?

126
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,360
Don't forget what I said.

127
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,550
Great power produces miracles.

128
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,100
-I'm leaving.
-Dad.

129
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,320
Don't go.

130
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,810
Don't go.

131
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,160
My Lady, you're awake.

132
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,960
Where am I?

133
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,560
Why am I not home yet?

134
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:12,690
If I'm not at home,

135
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,480
who's going to help Mom change the gas
bottle.

136
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,440
My Lady.

137
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,850
You're at home. You're at home.

138
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,290
I'll tell Master that you're awake.

139
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,960
It's all my fault.

140
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,320
The thief who attacked Miss Gu escaped.

141
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,960
How is Miss Gu feeling?

142
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,930
I just received the news.

143
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,530
She's awake. She's alright.

144
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,090
She was just frightened.

145
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,280
But

146
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,409
it was dangerous for you

147
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,560
to tackle the Right Guardian alone last
night.

148
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,680
Looks like the Right Guardian was the one

149
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,610
who attacked me at the food festival.

150
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,600
Did the Right Guardian

151
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,240
stay in Changqing just to kill you?

152
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,900
He was injured by my Qilin Bow.

153
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,020
I think he must be holding a grudge.

154
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,560
But this person was able to

155
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,170
come and go in Qingfeng Restaurant freely,

156
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,520
and not be discovered.

157
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,400
He ought to be a pro.

158
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,130
Since he didn't get his way,

159
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,840
I'm sure he'll take revenge later.

160
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,500
We just have to be on our guard.

161
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:16,320
But this incident is related to Miss Gu.

162
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,620
Don't you think it's strange?

163
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,040
I need you to do something for me.

164
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,380
Guard Xing.

165
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,090
What's going on?

166
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,210
Chairman Gu,

167
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,850
Young Master has been worried about Miss Gu.

168
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,880
He was afraid that Mantra Sect would
come back,

169
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,250
so he sent these Wuyi Guards here

170
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,850
to protect the Gu Residence.

171
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,240
I see.

172
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,170
He is so considerate.

173
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,880
Thank you.

174
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,360
Dad.

175
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,500
I thought it's easy to come

176
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,680
so it would be easy to go back.

177
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,490
I guess I oversimplified it.

178
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,990
I'll have to pull myself together from
now on.

179
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,970
You should visit Mom more often when you
have the time.

180
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,770
After what I've been through, I believe
everything now.

181
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:20,850
You might be watching me somewhere now.

182
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,280
Take good care of Mom.

183
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,800
I might have gone too far this time.

184
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,289
I have to take the responsibility.

185
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,010
I'll ask Duan Yu to marry Gu Qingqiao,

186
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,309
and set up a successful business in Qingfeng
Restaurant before I go back.

187
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:43,530
My Lady,

188
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,140
what are you talking about?

189
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,960
Nothing. Nothing.

190
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,080
I'm planning for the future.

191
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,090
Why are you here

192
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:51,950
in such a hurry?

193
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,560
Young Master Duan sent a lot of Wuyi Guards here.

194
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,050
A lot?

195
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,280
I'll have to check it out.

196
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,210
They are everywhere.

197
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,690
Si.

198
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,410
Miss Gu.

199
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,430
Young Master didn't show up.

200
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,450
He's still investigating the Mantra Sect.

201
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,330
He told us

202
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,330
that you made a great contribution

203
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,410
in catching the Mantra Sect.

204
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,050
In order to prevent any more attack from
the remnants of the Mantra Sect,

205
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,290
he sent dozens of Wuyi Guards to come here

206
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,170
to protect you.

207
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,760
Dozens of Guards are here to protect me.

208
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,240
This is too much.

209
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,730
I just wanted to say

210
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,800
I really appreciate it.

211
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,250
If Miss Gu need anything,

212
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,400
they are at your disposal day and night.

213
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,450
Tu Jia, step forward!

214
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,100
Yes.

215
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,280
Hello, Miss Gu.

216
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,290
This is a female Wuyi Guard.

217
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,050
She masters martial arts and medicine.

218
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,570
It'll be easier for you to go anywhere
with her around.

219
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:44,410
OK.

220
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,000
Just call me Qiao.

221
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,760
It's just perfect

222
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,240
that I need a friend who's good at fighting.

223
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,720
At Qingfeng Restaurant last time, we were all
on our duties.

224
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,410
I wasn't able to take good care of you.

225
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,200
Thank you for your Chairman's kindness.

226
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,880
And thank you for protecting me.

227
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,590
From now on, we are a family.

228
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,160
If you need any food or clothes,

229
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,480
just ask the housekeeper.

230
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,850
It's me. Me.

231
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,930
Si.

232
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,460
I want to ask you something.

233
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:11,830
What's the matter?

234
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:15,630
Do you know Magistrate Du's

235
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,960
daughter, Du Ruoyun?

236
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,200
No, I don't.

237
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,290
Then your Young Master and her?

238
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,120
You are the only one

239
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,640
in his heart.

240
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,570
Are you sure?

241
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,920
Definitely sure.

242
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,370
Dongxi.

243
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,560
Get Xing Si a silver VIP card

244
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,960
of Qingfeng Restaurant.

245
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,000
Yes, My Lady.

246
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,610
Thank you, Miss Gu.

247
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,130
Shaoyi,

248
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,090
weren't you sent back to Jizhou Academy?

249
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:46,710
Yes.

250
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,850
Then why are you back?

251
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:48,730
I heard

252
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,370
you were kidnapped by Mantra cultists.

253
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,760
That's why I came back to see you.

254
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,040
Thanks to Miss Gu's help that day.

255
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,090
Or else you might never see me again.

256
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:57,920
My Lady.

257
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,490
Everything is ready.

258
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,170
Where are you going?

259
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,760
The Gu Residence to show our gratitude.

260
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,090
I'll go with you.

261
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,720
Why are you being so nice?

262
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,090
You even want to go with me.

263
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,960
I heard that Miss Gu

264
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,760
really wants to marry Uncle.

265
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,250
I want to see

266
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,330
who exactly she is.

267
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,400
They don't need to be dramatic.

268
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,260
Hello, Miss Gu.

269
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,480
Young Master Shaoyi.

270
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,920
Hello, Miss Du.

271
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,130
What a grand scene.

272
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,280
There are so many Wuyi Guards here to
protect you.

273
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:51,040
You are like a well-respected god.

274
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,480
Shaoyi.

275
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,850
That Shaoyi became this Shaoyi.

276
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,610
Miss Gu, what's the matter?

277
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,250
You are the Shaoyi who can't do

278
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,850
anything but cause trouble.

279
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,770
What did you say?

280
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,050
Your uncle said that.

281
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,290
No way.

282
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,810
My uncle wouldn't say something like that.

283
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,370
Who is your uncle?

284
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,870
Tu...Tu Jia.

285
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,130
Tell her who I am.

286
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,790
Yes, Young Master Shaoyi.

287
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:17,720
Miss Gu.

288
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,640
This is the Young Master of the Duan family.

289
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,930
Young Master Shaoyi's father

290
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,730
is Young Master Duan's brother.

291
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,450
How could you be Duan Yu's nephew?

292
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,600
What do you mean by that?

293
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,810
Are you crazy?

294
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,360
I'm really crazy.

295
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,250
I think both of you are crazy.

296
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,330
Xing Si.

297
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:39,660
I didn't expect you to be so knowledgeable.

298
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,460
Thank you for your compliment.

299
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,950
You're being too kind.

300
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,920
I meant you are flirtatious.

301
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,200
Young Master, it's getting late.

302
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,590
Let's go to Nanny Xu.

303
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,720
You're feeling guilty?

304
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,250
What are you talking about?

305
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,800
I just write dialogue novels to make a
living.

306
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,170
You mean I didn't give you enough money?

307
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,690
Of course not.

308
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:09,630
Alright.

309
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,520
Hit me or punish me.

310
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,150
I can take the blame.

311
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:17,440
I wrote that you and Miss Du

312
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,440
A perfect couple.

313
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,700
A hero and a beauty.

314
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,440
Xing Si.

315
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,320
You mentioned about a genius, an immortal,

316
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,370
and a hero.

317
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,760
Which one is referring to me?

318
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,370
The Duan and Du family of Changqing have
been family friends for generations.

319
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,540
Du Ruoyun is my sister.

320
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,890
What were you thinking?

321
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:34,880
Well...

322
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,200
What are you talking about?

323
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,660
I think the dialogue novel

324
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,130
was about yourself.

325
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,330
No. No. No.

326
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,330
Of course not.

327
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,280
Young Master, it's all imaginary.

328
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,090
Imaginary?

329
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,670
Why are you panicking?

330
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,730
I'm not panicking.

331
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,010
All right.

332
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,510
I'll stop teasing you.

333
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,200
I don't blame you.

334
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,960
Keep writing.

335
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,080
I...

336
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,570
But I have two conditions.

337
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,350
Don't worry about two.

338
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,850
Even if there's ten, I'll say yes.

339
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:57,320
Okay.

340
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:58,120
One.

341
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,800
Show me the dialogue novel first after
you finish.

342
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,240
Two.

343
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,220
I'll only take 90% of the money

344
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,570
from selling the dialogue novels.

345
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,370
Young Master,

346
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,040
I can show you the dialogue novel.

347
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,960
But the money...

348
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,560
50%.

349
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:13,880
Young Master Shaoyi,

350
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,640
I'm so sorry.

351
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,240
You looked like

352
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,530
an old friend of mine.

353
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,440
I was surprised at first.

354
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,610
I was so baffled.

355
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,330
What's baffled?

356
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,330
It means I was confused.

357
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,600
Yes.

358
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,030
It means a blackout happened in my brain.

359
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:36,400
It means suddenly you don't know what's
going on.

360
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,230
Miss Du is really smart.

361
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,330
You're rich, beautiful and smart.

362
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:44,720
Although your wordings confuse me,

363
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,510
it's really interesting.

364
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:50,590
So what brings you here?

365
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,240
I heard from Miss Ruoyun that you saved
her life.

366
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,440
We're here to thank you.

367
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,640
I came along with her.

368
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,240
Miss Gu faced the danger calmly at Qingfeng
Restaurant yesterday.

369
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,620
You saved my life.

370
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,160
I'm very grateful.

371
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,120
It was a natural reaction that day.

372
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,900
Don't worry about it, Miss Du.

373
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,440
It was a matter of life and death.

374
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,650
Anyone would help in that scenario.

375
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,190
I didn't expect

376
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,740
that although Miss Gu is not smart,

377
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,040
she's quite brave.

378
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,120
But there must be a reason

379
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,640
why so many people are protecting you.

380
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,680
Even if I'm not that smart,

381
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,970
I can tell the difference

382
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,480
between protection and surveillance.

383
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,730
Miss Gu,

384
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,730
I really like your personality.

385
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,250
If you don't mind,

386
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,650
we can keep in touch more often.

387
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,440
When I saw you at Qingfeng Restaurant
that day,

388
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,560
I liked you too.

389
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,440
But it was not appropriate to kiss up to

390
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,010
the daughter of a Magistrate.

391
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,130
Kiss up to?

392
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,920
It means it's not appropriate to flatter
you.

393
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,120
Miss Gu, you're treating me like a stranger.

394
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,600
You saved my life.

395
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,320
I'm willing to kiss up to you.

396
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,830
Let's kiss up to each other in the future.

397
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,650
OK.

398
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,480
I like straightforward gals.

399
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,280
We are about the same age.

400
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,340
Don't call me My Lady.

401
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:09,010
Just call me Qiao from now on.

402
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:09,890
I'll call you Ruoyun.

403
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:10,360
Okay.

404
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,210
Qiao.

405
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,640
You used to call me by my name.

406
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,610
Then you call me Gu Qingqiao.

407
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,560
I'll call you Duan Shaoyi.

408
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,260
OK.

409
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,180
I like straightforward gals.

410
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,090
Do you think I'm a unique

411
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,210
Qingliu here?

412
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,320
Then I'll call you Qingliu.

413
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,780
There's Qing in it anyway.

414
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,930
Qingliu,

415
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,800
I heard you were desperate to marry
my uncle.

416
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,370
Why is that the case?

417
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,760
I wasn't desperate.

418
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,840
You were the desperate one, weren't you?

419
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,480
I...

420
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,080
Shaoyi and I...

421
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,440
and Duan Yu and Xing Si grew up together.

422
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:46,770
When I was little,

423
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,700
I already decided to marry Duan Yu.

424
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,320
As I've gotten older in the past two years,

425
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,030
he showed less interest in me.

426
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,890
Duan Yu is so ungrateful.

427
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,680
How could he not be interested in a good
girl?

428
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,610
Who else could he be interested in?

429
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,050
Get out and study abroad.

430
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:01,810
A jerk.

431
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,050
Study abroad?

432
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,599
Jerk?

433
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,270
That...

434
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,910
That means he doesn't deserve Ruoyun.

435
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:13,589
That's right.

436
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,609
Jerk!

437
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,480
Ruoyun.

438
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,200
Do you think Duan Yu will change his mind?

439
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,349
No.

440
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,020
He will always treat me as his sister.

441
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,690
Love between a man and woman is destined.

442
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:27,890
We can't fight for it.

443
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,720
I know.

444
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,360
Why are you still clinging to him?

445
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,890
I'm doing it to piss him off,

446
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,660
and to deprive him of freedom.

447
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,640
Qingliu,

448
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,530
aren't you going to marry my uncle?

449
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,680
Why are you asking so many questions?

450
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,480
At first,

451
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,320
marrying Duan Yu was just a wish.

452
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,200
But things got more complicated.

453
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,010
I owe Gu Qingqiao an explanation.

454
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,100
What do you mean?

455
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,390
Nothing.

456
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,010
I'll explain it to you later.

457
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,800
But Duan Yu never said

458
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,000
he wanted to marry me.

459
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,630
My Dad arranged it.

460
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,480
Jerk!

461
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:08,900
[Arrest Warrant]

462
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,000
The government is making arrests again.

463
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,150
Look.

464
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,100
That's quite a lot of money as the reward.

465
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,000
What's that smell?

466
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,240
Why does it smell so good?

467
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,880
It's a naan.

468
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,130
Look, they're queuing up to buy naans.

469
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,040
My Lady

470
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,600
do you want to buy some naans?

471
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,600
In this way,

472
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:26,370
Da wouldn't need to

473
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,970
cook for the Wuyi Guards.

474
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:29,290
OK.

475
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:30,200
Let's buy some more.

476
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,930
Give some to Young Master Duan.

477
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,480
He stole money! Catch the thief!

478
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:41,730
Run!

479
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,530
Where do you think you are going?

480
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,390
The naan is too light.

481
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,430
Please forgive me. Spare me your life.

482
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,900
I didn't steal your money.

483
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,210
It's a really hard hit.

484
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,280
Cut the crap.

485
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,180
Changqing, Changqing. Changqing Forever.

486
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,390
When dealing with guys like you

487
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,610
who destroy the comfort and harmony
of Changqing people,

488
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,070
no one should be merciful.

489
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:19,880
Where is the money bag?

490
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,610
Give it to me.

491
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:25,880
Send him to a yamen.

492
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,680
Take him away.

493
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,290
Can you stop them from following me?

494
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,900
It's like hunting wolves.

495
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,770
Xing Si.

496
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,900
Yes, Young Master.

497
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,700
Everyone, follow me.

498
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,190
Yes.

499
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:45,970
Let's go.

500
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:46,880
My Lady.

501
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:49,630
Miss Gu.

502
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,180
Please.

503
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,890
Coming.

504
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,830
Auntie Xu, what's going on?

505
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,530
I'm coming.

506
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,960
Stay away from me.

507
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,790
Long story short.

508
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,420
I'm not good enough to check

509
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,090
the Four Pillars of Destiny between you two.

510
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,520
I can't tie or untie it.

511
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,760
How about

512
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,160
giving them back to you?

513
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,560
We'll each go our own way.

514
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,660
Auntie Xu, don't go.

515
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,450
What do you mean?

516
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,100
How could you return them?

517
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,890
Miss,

518
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:40,570
I returned them because you look like
a nice person.

519
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,000
But look at this pair of

520
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,880
strong legs I've had for years,

521
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,740
they are crippled because of you.

522
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:49,040
Why don't you do me a favor?

523
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,160
Please...just let me go.

524
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,460
-Be careful.
-Be careful.

525
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,100
Did you encounter any difficulties?

526
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,350
Just say it.

527
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,380
Alright.

528
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,400
Since we've come to this point,

529
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,320
I'll make it clear to you today.

530
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,470
But

531
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,660
give me back my cane first.

532
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,340
Since I got your Four Pillars of Destiny,

533
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,890
I've fallen flat on my face.

534
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:24,770
I got kicked by a horse.

535
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,560
Water got stuck in my teeth. I got choked by
the wind while talking.

536
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,250
Look how miserable I am.

537
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,080
Your Four Pillars of Destiny

538
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,370
are all from out of this world.

539
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,750
The combination

540
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,070
indicates a curse.

541
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,340
You can't untie it.

542
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,600
If you take different roads,

543
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,800
it will be a bigger curse.

544
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:42,910
You can't solve it.

545
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,040
So,

546
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,270
you two should find someone else.

547
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,150
I'm just not good enough for this.

548
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,760
You need to find a master.

549
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,220
Maybe there's a solution.

550
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,880
That's quite a profound statement.

551
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,260
But it may be just bad luck.

552
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,090
It's not as dramatic as you said.

553
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,440
Why don't you try again?

554
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,880
Miss,

555
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,000
you look like a nice person,

556
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,360
but your Four Pillars of Destiny show

557
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,900
that you would die young.

558
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,310
I heard you came back to life before.

559
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,250
I can't handle the case.

560
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,520
As for Young Master Duan,

561
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,130
your Four Pillars of Destiny are even more
powerful.

562
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,810
There's no Official Star in the year, month
and date pillar.

563
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,010
That means he has no marriage fortune.

564
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:22,800
The hour pillar brings the peach blossom
and wood. Seven kills end the life.

565
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,800
The God of Slaughter couldn't

566
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,960
be stopped by any God and Buddha.

567
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,480
The sign of early death is haunted by gods
and ghosts.

568
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,910
The God of Slaughter who orders seven kills
is still alive.

569
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,380
It sounds like a curse.

570
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:36,480
But I think

571
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,540
we are a good match.

572
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,400
You can't say that.

573
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,070
If you were to get married,

574
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,240
the marriage shall be unfortunate with both
of you suffering.

575
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,770
Bringing bad luck to the husband and wife

576
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,640
might also impact the people around you.

577
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,000
Look at me.

578
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,920
I am a living example.

579
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,850
I've never believed in gods or ghosts.

580
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:59,200
The Four Pillars of Destiny are just
a formality.

581
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,600
Don't you worry about it.

582
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:03,890
Auntie Xu,

583
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,400
do you have a way to solve it?

584
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,230
Miss,

585
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,600
I'd advise you to give up.

586
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,000
Auntie Xu, it's our fate to meet you.

587
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,670
If you don't give me a solution,

588
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,290
I'll come by to have tea with you every day.

589
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,040
Never mind.

590
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,090
In that case,

591
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:21,980
there is a solution.

592
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,930
I mean there is a possibility.

593
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,010
It may be possible or not possible.

594
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,330
Don't beat around the bush.

595
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,600
Just tell me.

596
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,370
The Acacia Tree on the east side of
the city.

597
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,690
It's spiritual.

598
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,570
But you have to pray by yourselves.

599
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,760
As for how it goes,

600
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,380
it really depends on fate.

601
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,690
Let's go.

602
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:51,940
The Acacia Tree.

603
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,830
The Avatar.

604
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,440
This tree must be thousands of years old.

605
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,620
It's over 1,300 years old.

606
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,960
The tree had originally died

607
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,000
but somehow,

608
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,530
when everybody made a wish,

609
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,600
it's silently growing again.

610
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,890
A withered tree comes to life again.

611
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:18,640
Amazing.

612
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,130
What does it say?

613
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,560
One heart, one person.

614
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,500
Not to part for ever.

615
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,780
What about this one?

616
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,070
Grey hair meets grey hair.

617
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,180
Let's meet again in the next life.

618
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,660
They were written for those who passed away.

619
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:48,920
Miss Gu.

620
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:50,470
What's the matter?

621
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,000
Nothing.

622
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,400
I was just thinking that

623
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,400
an elderly couple with grey hair

624
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,090
came to this tree to make a wish.

625
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,740
It must have been so romantic.

626
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,690
My Lady.

627
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,750
Let's put our Four Pillars of Destiny
under this tree,

628
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,000
and pray for God's blessing.

629
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,490
Okay.

630
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,520
My Lady.

631
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,400
My Lady.

632
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,190
I finally got it.

633
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,510
What a coincidence.

634
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,210
Dongxi.

635
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,410
You came just in time.

636
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,800
Everything is ready.

637
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,700
I just need to get down on my knees.

638
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,120
Don't look.

639
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,720
It won't work if you look.

640
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:53,460
Okay.

641
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:54,540
I won't look.

642
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,830
♫In the noise♫

643
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,280
Okay.

644
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,770
♫I glanced back briefly.♫

645
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:18,890
Why?

646
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,960
♫You looked up♫

647
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:24,340
♫The fireworks shine across the night sky♫

648
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:23,520
It absorbs the spirit of heaven and earth.

649
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,520
Didn't you see it?

650
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,130
The cloth hanging on the trees are exposed
to the wind and sun every day.

651
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,040
♫The night breeze blew gently♫

652
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,520
The words on the edges are fading.

653
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,540
♫Even the birds stopped flying♫

654
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,360
It's safer to bury them in the soil.

655
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:33,500
♫I remember how gentle you were♫

656
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,290
Bury it deep.

657
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,590
♫I'm afraid I won't see it in my dreams♫

658
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:34,870
What are you waiting for?

659
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:35,910
Give me our Four Pillars of Destiny.

660
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:38,850
♫Your smile♫

661
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,320
Okay.

662
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,220
♫Until the end♫

663
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,920
♫Love doesn't need to be pieced together♫

664
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:49,370
♫Feel it with my heart♫

665

♫Meeting you is all my reason♫

668
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:01,450
Done.

669
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:06,260
♫I'm obsessed with finding you in the crowd♫

670
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,670
♫No matter how far it is♫

671
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,490
Don't get on your knees.

672
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:15,210
♫I'll stay by your side♫

673
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:09,690
You're wearing white.

674
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:10,840
I'll kneel for you this time.

675
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,500
Next time, you'll do it for me.

676
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:27,560
♫Love doesn't need to be pieced together♫

677

♫Feel it with my heart♫

678
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,050
I just immersed myself in the essence
of the Holy Tree.

679
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,710
I feel so much more energized.

680
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,810
♫Missing you from autumn to winter♫

681
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:41,110
♫Even if I turned grey♫

682
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,960
I'm in such a good mood

683
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,130
after clearing up this problem.

684
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,960
I want to fly freely.

685
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,850

I want to fly a kite.

690
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:12,990
A kite?

691
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,540
Yes.

692
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,860
The paper kite.

693
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:17,960
OK.

694
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,860
I'll do whatever you want.

695
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,970
You bought this with a lot of money.

696
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,670
Do you like this dialogue novel?

697
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:26,360
Of course.

698
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,780
I cried and laughed every day reading it.

699
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,840
I want to tell you a secret.

700
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:32,770
Go ahead.

701
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,530
What do you want this time?

702
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:35,440
Nothing.

703
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,840
I'm thinking about the business of this
dialogue novel.

704
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,640
Tell me.

705
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,520
Do you know who wrote this?

706
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,130
Who?

707
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,360
Xing Si.

708
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,480
Xing Si.

709
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,840
Which Xing Si?

710
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,450
Who else could there be?

711
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,960
Our brother Xing Si.

712
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,280
That nerd knew how to write dialogue novels.

713
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,360
And it's so good.

714
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,620
Are you surprised?

715
00:28:58,730 --> 00:28:59,730
Are you amazed?

716
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,930
Oh my god.

717
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,050
By the way,

718
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,810
What was it Gu Qingqiao said?

719
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,360
It's Qingliu.

720
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:11,730
Duan Yu.

721
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,740
Let's compete.

722
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:16,140
Let's see whose kite flies higher.

723
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,650
The loser has to treat the winner

724
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,050
to some beer and skewers.

725
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,000
Some beer and skewers?

726
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,170
That's right.

727
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,230
It's about drinking and barbecuing.

728
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,040
I see.

729
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,050
Sword Roast Whole Lamb, right?

730
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,100
That's one of

731
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:31,880
my mom's specialty.

732
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,440
Miss Gu.

733
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:33,880
Sorry.

734
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:35,750
It's okay.

735
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,560
Mom.

736
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,240
Hang on.

737
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,250
I'll be back soon.

738
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,700
Duan Yu.

739
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,520
Come on.

740
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,290
Sure.

741
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:07,670
I won't have mercy.

742
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,400
That's cheating.

743
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,300
I forgot the ancient people knew how to
climb walls and fly.

744
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,170
See?

745
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,170
I told you.

746
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:44,830
A man with skills won't easily admit defeat.

747
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,060
My kite!

748
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,520
What happened to everything going well?

749
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,320
A broken kite will bring bad luck.

750
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,600
If you can't save it, just buy another one.

751
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,220
No.

752
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,090
Duan Yu, pull your kite.

753
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,920
Pull it.

754
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,320
Yes, that's it.

755
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,260
No.

756
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,190
It's too windy.

757
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,520
I can't hold it much longer.

758
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,510
Come and help me.

759
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,050
I can't hold it anymore.

760
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,010
Dongxi.

761
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,220
You are really good at embroidery.

762
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:37,920
You're very crafty.

763
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,130
Don't My Lady know how to embroider as well?

764
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,730
Why are you asking me to do it?

765
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,290
There's a lot to be said for giving a pouch.

766
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,120
What's the meaning behind it?

767
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,240
If a girl meets her soul mate,

768
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,640
she must embroider a pouch for him

769
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:52,330
to keep his heart.

770
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,170
This means Dongxi has a crush on someone?

771
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,720
My Lady, don't say that.

772
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,650
But I'm planning to make this pouch

773
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,120
for my mom.

774
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,280
Well,

775
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,930
I want to give one to my friend's Mom,

776
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,450
but my embroidery is too ugly.

777
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:13,600
It's not that presentable.

778
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,000
Could you do me a favor?

779
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,540
I'm happy to do anything

780
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:17,560
for My Lady.

781
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:20,940
It's secretly satisfying.

782
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:23,850
You even know this.

783
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,120
Dongxi, you're so cute.

784
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,970
I'll miss you.

785
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,960
You don't need to miss me.

786
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,840
I'll go with you when you get married.

787
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:34,490
You're so nice.

788
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,040
It's great to have you here.

789
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:40,190
The new My Lady is really nice.

790
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,730
The new Lady?

791
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,570
Was the old Lady not good?

792
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,360
Her health used to be quite fragile.

793
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,440
She didn't go out every day.

794
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,250
She coughed all night in winter.

795
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,800
I was heartbroken.

796
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:01,090
Madam Zhang was looking for medicine
everywhere.

797
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:03,090
We were worried about her every day.

798
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:05,620
Now,

799
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,430
My Lady who came back to life

800
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,960
is so energetic like a deer.

801
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,530
Even if your brain isn't working properly,

802
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:12,440
we are happy.

803
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,429
My...

804
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,739
Is my brain not functioning that well?

805
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:19,920
You don't remember anything from the past.

806
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,840
And you keep saying things we don't
understand.

807
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:23,880
So,

808
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,850
Master thought Young Master Duan was
interested in you.

809
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:29,040
He wanted to marry you off.

810
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,650
So you wanted to marry me off

811
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:37,880
because my brain wasn't working properly.

812
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,760
What else?

813
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:40,400
My goodness.

814
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,719
How could you say that?

815
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:47,600
One takes on the color of his company.

816
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,130
This idiom does make sense.

817
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,300
Why did Madam Zhang

818
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,960
go look for medicine everywhere?

819
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:57,000
Madam Zhang is Madam's dowry maid.

820
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,050
Madam had obstructed labour when giving
birth to My Lady.

821
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:01,840
Madam Zhang was entrusted with taking
care of

822
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,640
Master and My Lady before Madam passed away.

823
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,020
She said she could only leave

824
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:08,740
when Master marries again or My Lady marries.

825
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:12,270
But it turned out that Master didn't want
to marry again.

826
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,080
He said he was afraid that you could be
bullied by the stepmother.

827
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:15,890
Later,

828
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:18,090
Madam Zhang has been taking care of the Gus.

829
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:20,120
When Master was doing business during the
day,

830
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,450
Madam Zhang supported the family at home.

831
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,840
Everyone in the mansion respects her.

832
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,330
Even Master respects her a little.

833
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:32,160
Everyone in the Gu family is good,

834
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,480
so you're also a good person.

835
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,990
So,

836
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:40,960
I must make the Gu family happy.

837
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:42,800
Of course.

838
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,170
Oh, Dongxi.

839
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,840
What are you going to do?

840
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:51,010
My goodness.

841
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,120
Who's swearing again?

842
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,140
Or crossing the tribulation?

843
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,840
Eunuch Thunder and Grandma Rain.

844
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,840
Duan Yu asked me to come.

845
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,280
He is the one you should punish.

846
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,410
Please forgive me. Please forgive me.

847
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:27,880
Xing Si.

848
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,680
Young Master.

849
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:30,330
Thank you.

850
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,090
It's okay.

851
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,420
Young Master, is there any taboo on this?

852
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,970
A taboo?

853
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,770
What taboo?

854
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,640
Then why did the lightning strike me,

855
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:46,670
and why was the rain pouring on me?

856
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,650
You've done too many bad things during
the day.

857
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,000
Young Master.

858
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,010
Why did you want to dig this wish card?

859
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:58,010
What do you think?

860
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,360
Is it because Miss Gu is the Star of
Rebellion?

861
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,170
She wants to use the spiritual power of the
Acacia tree

862
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:05,700
to destroy the Duan family.

863
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,010
I'm just curious about

864
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:10,650
what wish she made.

865
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,220
[Life can be bitter, but we can be sweet]

866
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,790
[Have a baby soon]

867
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,630
Is there anything wrong?

868
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:28,850
No.

869
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,400
Miss Gu fell off the cliff.

870
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,640
I discovered that

871
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,970
she didn't know martial arts.

872
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:36,620
Young Master risked your life to save
Miss Gu.

873
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,960
Is it because

874
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,760
you like her?

875
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,310
What are you talking about?

876
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,720
I'm not as flirtatious as you.

877
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,610
Oh my.

878
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,520
See.

879
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,800
You're learning to talk like her.

880
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,720
What did you learn?

881
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,640
Flirtatious.

882
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:49,880
Cut the nonsense.

883
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,120
Give me the dialogue novel and the money
from it.

884
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:55,670
Young Master,

885
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:56,810
I'll go take a bath.

886
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,110
I'll get going.

887
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:03,960
I...

888
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,750
I need to take my conical hat.

889
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:18,560
Life can be bitter,

890
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,040
but we can be sweet.

891
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,640
Young Master asked me to bring you the kite.

892
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,060
It's exactly the same.

893
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,860
You found it?

894
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:50,070
It's a new one.

895
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,680
Is that for me?

896
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,600
Or is he asking me to fly kites again?

897
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,330
It is for you.

898
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,480
He didn't say he wanted to ask me out.

899
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,120
No.

900
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:58,440
Fine.

901
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,700
I'll bring a kite,

902
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:05,330
and invite Ruoyun and Shaoyi to go wild.

903
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:06,410
Invite Miss Du.

904
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,320
Go wild.

905
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,700
Why can't I?

906
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,620
You mean flying a kite, right?

907
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,910
What else?

908
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,090
Let's go wild.

909
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,560
Let's do it.

910
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,490
Can you stop making a fuss?

911
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,760
By the way Si,

912
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,370
could you go to the kitchen

913
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:24,770
to get some pastries from Da

914
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,770
to bring home for your Young Master?

915
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:35,450
It smells so good.

916
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,160
Chef Da,

917
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:40,530
Miss Gu asked me to pick up some pastries
for Young Master.

918
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:44,520
I... I'll get it ready.

919
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:45,800
Thank you.

920
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,720
Thank you.
