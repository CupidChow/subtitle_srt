It's the casino owner.

4
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,560
I saw him.

5
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,509
No wonder I ran into him at the door early in the morning.

6
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:48,970
Turns out he spent the whole night gambling.

7
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,479
And he reeked of alcohol.

8
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,840
How can such a person

9
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,110
be a teacher at the academy?

10
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,990
Mr. Guo does have some peculiar talents.

11
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,060
He has quite an insight into mathematics.

12
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,060
But he is odd,

13
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,750
and isn't popular.

14
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,560
He always has conflicts with Shaoyi.

15
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,350
He reports Shaoyi's improper conduct in class

16
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,430
several times a year to the academy.

17
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,090
Uncle Cheng has put in a good word for Shaoyi many times.

18
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,360
Do you think it could be Mr. Guo?

19
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,190
He can't stand Shaoyi opposing him,

20
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,320
so he kidnapped him.

21
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,150

22
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,310
Mr. Guo is a scholar.

23
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,360
He has no martial arts skills at all

24
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,240
and he's defenseless.

25
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,310
How could he possibly kidnap Young Master Shaoyi?

26
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,110
You're right.

27
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,790
But I think that we have no clues at all,

28
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,240
and we have no idea where to start looking for Shaoyi.

29
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,000
Since Mr. Guo seems suspicious,

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,900
let's keep investigating him.

31
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,680
Maybe we can find something.

32
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,350
Right now, Mr. Guo

33
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,630

Young Master Duan, what can I do for you?

55
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,550
I want to ask why you

56
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,870
went to the academy to see Mr. Guo today.

57
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,990
Since Young Master Duan asks,

58
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,440
I'll tell you everything I know.

59
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,630

Mr. Guo is a regular customer here.

65

He owes me a lot of money.

66
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,190

to collect the debts.

68
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,830
Did he and Shaoyi have any contact at the casino?

69
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,370
As far as I know,

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,640
they didn't have any contact.

71
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,700
Young Master Shaoyi is a student at the Jizhou Academy.

72
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,670
If his teacher found out he came to a place like this,

73
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,970
he'd be in big trouble.

74
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,830
Mr. Guo cares about his reputation.

75
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,310
Every time he comes here, he avoids people.

76
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:48,430
So they probably didn't have any contact.

77
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,430

Why would I carry the luminous pearl on me?

102
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,630
What if you turn your back on me,

103
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,920
and kill me like you did to Duan Shaoyi?

If anything happens to me,

108

someone will take out the luminous pearl

to prove you're the murderer.

So I advise you to give me the money obediently.

111
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,110

that the Principal they trust

I did not kill Duan Shaoyi!

The reason the body was dismembered

170

wasn't because the killer was cruel,

171
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,550

190
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,510
Qiao, don't be afraid.

191
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,560
I was overwhelmed

192
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,820
with debts

193
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,450
and couldn't face my family and students.

194
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,520
Inform the government.

195
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,920
What's all this mess?

196
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,680
Just as we had a lead on the dismemberment case,

197
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,010
now there's a gambler who hanged himself.

198
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,590
Wait.

199
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,490
Young Master Duan.

200
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,360
Is there any progress on the dismemberment case?

201
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,710
The victim is a woman.

202
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,170
But unfortunately, her appearance was ruined.

203
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:48,550
We will continue the investigation.

204
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,200
Okay.

205
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,430
Thank you.

206
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,790
Goodbye.

210
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,670
Why did you find Mr. Guo's body?

211
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,800
We found...

212
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,910
We found out that Mr. Guo and Shaoyi had conflicts

213
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,270
and suspected that Mr. Guo was hiding Shaoyi's whereabouts.

214
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,330
We came to inquire.

215
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,310
But when we arrived...

216
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,630
I heard he was overwhelmed with debts

217
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,830
and saw no way out.

218
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,830
Have you found any clues about Shaoyi?

219
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:21,710
No.

220
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,320
When we arrived,

221
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,520
he was already gone.

222
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,870
God will bless him.

223
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,160
Shaoyi is a good child.

224
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,510
He will surely be safe.

225
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,120
Since a murder just occurred here,

226
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,520
you shouldn't stay long.

227
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:35,270
I will handle things with the government.

228
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,230
Go back now.

229
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,110
Uncle Cheng.

230
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,120
You're not in good health.

231
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,590
Let's call some teachers from the academy to handle this.

232
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,920
It's a tumultuous time,

233
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,230
let's not burden others.

234
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,590
Go back. Don't worry.

235
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,510
I'll go in and take a look.

236
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,640
The Principal is really a good person.

237
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,670
But Shaoyi's trail has gone cold again.

238
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,830
There's always a way out.

239
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,200
We will find a solution.

240

[Jizhou Academy]

242
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,000
Mr. Guo has passed away.

243
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,030
Really?

244
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,790
I just attended his class two days ago.

245
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,880
This is too sudden.

246
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,910
Do you think there's something wrong

247
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,670
with our academy's feng shui?

248
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,750
The Principal's wife has been ill for a long time.

249
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,360
The Principal is weakening day by day.

250
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,710
Duan Shaoyi has mysteriously disappeared.

251
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,110
And now Mr. Guo has died.

252
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,430
The subjects on which the Master did not talk,
were extraordinary things, feats of strength, disorder, and spiritual beings.

253
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,350
Stop it.

254
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,310

From now on,

261
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,240
be extra careful when you go out.

262
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,880
Principal Cheng, what about Shaoyi?

263
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,140
Has Shaoyi been found?

264
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,190
His uncle questioned me a few days ago.

265
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,250
What did he ask you?

266
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,360
About the last time I saw Shaoyi.

267
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,270
I said he had an appointment.

268
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,390
He left in a hurry.

269
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,470
Do you know who he met and where he went?

270
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,670
I don't know.

271
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,510
Why didn't you tell Principal Cheng

272
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,970
about the luminous pearl?

273
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,900
I thought you trusted him.

274
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,670
Mr. Guo's death was suspicious.

275
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,870
We all know he used the luminous pearl to pay off his debts.

276
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,550
It's impossible for him to commit suicide over debts.

277
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,560
This means the murderer doesn't know where the luminous pearl is.

278
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,320
It's not that I don't trust Uncle Cheng.

279
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,720
But the luminous pearl is our only clue.

280
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,190
It's very important.

281
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,130
Then what should we do with it?

282
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,470
Hide it?

283
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,320
No.

284
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,320
I will return it to the casino.

285
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,040
If the murderer wants to hide his murders,

286
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,720
he will definitely find the luminous pearl

287
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,950
and don't let others have anything on him.

288
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,790
You want the owner of the casino

289
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,000
to spread the news about the luminous pearl

290
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,520
to lure out the person most concerned about its whereabouts.

we must pretend to give up looking for Shaoyi.

Only then will the killer lower his guard

295

and reveal himself.

She has always been nice to me.

I knew she doesn't have tuberculosis.

330
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,390
I was worried she might be in some trouble.

331
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,520
But you wouldn't let anyone visit her,

332
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,270
so I sneaked in to check on her.

333
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,829
I'm glad

334
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,270
you care about her.

00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,190
I went to the government.

350
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,630
And naturally I learned that you dismembered that woman

While you can fool others,

353
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,590
I could tell at a glance

354
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,550
that the one who used the Blood Technique was about to die.

355
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,600
Stop talking nonsense.

356
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,330
You know very well whether I'm talking nonsense.

357
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,590
What I want to say

358
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,000
is that I can save her.

359
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,990

00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,270
Of course.

367

I agreed to help you get the treasure map,

368
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,780

00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,520
How could you cooperate with him?

376
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,990
You and my grandfather are sworn brothers.

377
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,360
I've treated you as my own grandfather since young.

378
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,290
You cannot betray the Duan family.

379
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,440
Shaoyi.

380
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:05,560
I'm sorry.

381
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,910
What I can do now

382
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,430
is to save your life.

383
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,310
You care so much for your Madam, right?

384
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,510
She indeed doesn't have tuberculosis,

385
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,310
but she doesn't have long to live.

386
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,560
For your Madam's sake, I can only make you suffer.

387
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,110
As long as I get the treasure map,

388
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,990
I will let you go safely.

389
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,190
I will confess all the sins

390
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,270
and bear all the guilt then.

391
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,130
Grandpa Cheng,

392
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,510
you are the Principal of Jizhou Academy,

393
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,230
the head of the righteous sect,

394
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,590
and my Master.

395
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,350
Shaoyi, I'm sorry.

396
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,030
But there's no turning back.

397
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,550
She's indeed a member of my sect.

398
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,400
Cheng Mufei.

399
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,040
I didn't expect your wife

400
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,830
to be a member of the Sacred Blood Sect.

401
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,590
Xueniang is different.

402
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,320
She lost her memory long ago

403
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,110
and knew nothing about her identity.

404
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,960
No wonder she became so weak.

405
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,720
She was born with deficiencies

406
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,870
and needs the Blood Technique to supplement her vitality.

407
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,830
Last time Shaoyi interrupted her Blood Technique,

408
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,550
it backfired.

409
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,160
And she refused to use it again,

410
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,830
leading to her current condition.

411
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,670
I knew this long ago.

412
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,910
No wonder she hid here for over ten years

413
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:16,890
without being found.

414
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:20,240
It's because you've been nourishing her with your own blood.

415
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,430
Cheng Mufei,

416
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,030
I didn't expect you to be so devoted to her.

417
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:28,030
It's none of your business.

418
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,110
Cheng Mufei, join our sect.

419
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,510
Only as a member of the Sacred Blood Sect,

420
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,790
can you be on the same team and share life and death

421
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,230
with your wife.

422
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,520
Stop talking.

423
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,920
Here's the treasure map you wanted.

424
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,190
Hurry and save Xueniang.

425
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:51,990
I have a Biluo pill

426
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,830
that can alleviate the pain from the backlash of the Blood Technique.

427
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,590
As long as you let her eat this,

428
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,600
she will wake up

429
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,750
within three days.

430
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:14,950
But a single pill is not enough to save her.

431
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,160
What do you want me to do?

432
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,800
I want the treasure map in Duan Yan's hands.

433
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,760
Duan Yan's son is now in your hands.

434
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,640
Whether you kill him

435
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,910
or take advantage of him,

436
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,920
as long as you get the treasure map,

437
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,420
I'll give you another Biluo pill.

438
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,150
What if you break your promise?

439
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:32,270
Cheng Mufei, do you have any other choice?

440
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:34,470
Only I can save Xueniang.

441
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:38,600
Two Biluo pills

442
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:42,760
will ensure she is no longer controlled by the Blood Technique.

443
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,080
Isn't that what you want?

444
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,670
Young Master, everything is arranged.

445
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,190
The casino owner will release the news today

446
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:52,070
that he has a luminous pearl.

447
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,950
If anyone comes to ask about it,

448
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,880
he will record his identity.

449
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,190
I found

450
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,790
some signs of a struggle in Mr. Guo's house.

451
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,920
Someone must have been there before he died.

452
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,580
Should we urge the government

453
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,350
to investigate the cause of Mr. Guo's death again?

454
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,110
I went to mourn him and persuaded his family

455
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,950
to ask the government to reopen the case.

456
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,360
Perhaps this will force the murderer out.

457
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,340
Have you heard?

458
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,800
[Jizhou Academy]

459
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:17,120
The government has reopened the case.

460
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,960
Reopened the case?

461
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,310
Mr. Guo did not commit suicide.

462
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,280
It was a murder.

463
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:20,990
Murder?

464
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:21,660
Yes.

465
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:22,800
How is that possible?

466
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,120
I don't know.

467
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:38,390
Could it be

468
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,570
that it was hidden in the academy?

469
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:57,800
Uncle Cheng.

470
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,150
Why are you here?

471
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,350
The government said that Mr. Guo did not commit suicide,

472
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,480
so I came to see if there were any clues.

473
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,590
What if Mr. Guo's death is related to Shaoyi?

474
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,190
You thought the same as I did.

475
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,650
Did you find anything?

476
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,110
Most of Mr. Guo's belongings

477
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,670
were taken by his family.

478
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,110
I found nothing.

479
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,830
If you find anything,

480
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,240
please inform me immediately.

481
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,000
Sure.

482
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:24,200
The Master of the Duan family of Changqing is here to visit.

483
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,150
Is Principal Cheng here?

484
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:31,470
[Jizhou Academy]

485
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,320
Please come in.

486
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,580
His Lordship, please.

487
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,840
This way, please.

488
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:33,680
I was attacked on my way back a few days ago.

489
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,350
It seems that the Sacred Blood Sect has mobilized all their forces.

490
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,960
Thinking about your safety and that of the academy,

491
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,220
I'm really worried.

492
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,270
I haven't seen any traces of the Sacred Blood Sect in Jizhou yet.

493
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,680
Maybe their next target

494
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,030
is Xiling.

495
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,030
That's right.

496
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,400
I've already sent people to support Xiling,

497
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
but I haven't received any news yet.

498
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:51,750
By the way,

499
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:54,190
I haven't seen your wife.

500
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,750
How is she?

501
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,140
Xueniang still has the same old illness.

502
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,750
She just needs to rest.

503
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,400
Thanks for your concern.

504
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,920
I brought a lot of nutritious medicine here.

505
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,460
It might be useful to her.

506
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,560
There's one thing

507
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:10,040
you might not know yet since you came all the way here.

508
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:10,790
What is it?

509
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,030
I'm sorry.

510
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,310
Shaoyi...

511
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,190
He has gone missing.

512
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,040
What?

513
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,880
Duan Yu came all the way from Changqing to look for him,

514
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,950
but there has been

515
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,430
no progress these days.

516
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,490
Duan Yu is here too.

517
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:23,640
Where is he?

518
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,790
I've arranged for him to stay at the academy,

519
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:26,390
but

520
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,300
he brought a woman with him

521
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,790
who seems very close to him.

522
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:31,830
A woman?

523
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,670
It seems to be called

524
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,750
Qiao.

525
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,190
Miss Gu has not rested well

526
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,480
since she returned from Xiling.

527
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,630
It seems she is really tired.

528
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,670
Indeed, she has been very busy lately.

529
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,960
But she never says she's tired.

530
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,550
I neglected her.

531
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:02,670
Young Master.

532
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,830
It seems you and Miss Gu

533
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:07,150
have been getting along very well recently.

534
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:10,230
Are you and Miss Gu about to get married?

535
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,860
Keep your voice down. Don't wake her up.

536
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,360
Shush.

537
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,950
His Lordship, listen to me.

538
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:22,600
Mr. Qi.

539
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,800
Take down this incompetent person.

540
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:25,630
Yes.

541
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,200
-Kneel!
-Kneel!

542
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,230
Brother.

543
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:31,680
Duan Yu.

544
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:33,850
Hand over the Star of Rebellion!

545
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,290
How can you be so foolish?

546
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,400
Shaoyi's disappearance is certainly related to the Star of Rebellion.

547
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,060
You must have been used by her.

548
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:49,060
Qiao and I have been together all the time.

549
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,020
I can confirm

550
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,910
she has nothing to do with this.

551
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,830
How can you be so reckless?

552
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,040
Do you know that the Xu family, one of the four great families,

553
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,120
has betrayed us

554
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,510
and joined the Sacred Blood Sect?

555
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,880
Do you know I was attacked

556
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,510
by the Sacred Blood Sect on my way here?

557
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,840
The Sacred Blood Sect crisis is imminent,

558
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,780
yet you remain obstinate,

559
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,820
siding with the Star of Rebellion.

560
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,570
She has no collusion with the Sacred Blood Sect.

561
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,570
You must have been bewitched by her.

562
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:14,000
The Star of Rebellion is the enemy of the Duan family

563
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,510
and the key to the Sacred Blood Sect's return.

564
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,870
Since you can't do it,

565
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,800
I'll kill her myself.

566
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:23,000
Brother, please think twice.

567
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,350
Brother.

568
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,750
Our enemy is the Sacred Blood Sect.

569
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,750
Although Qiao...

570
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,990
Although Gu Qingqiao is the Star of Rebellion,

571
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,710
she has never done anything heinous.

572
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,240
Then why does she want to gather the Four Treasures?

573
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,590
She wants to gather the Four Treasures to return to her world.

574
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,770
She has told me all about her background and purpose.

575
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:40,600
She will never side with the Sacred Blood Sect

576
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,030
or become an enemy of the Duan family.

577
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,830
That's just her side of the story.

578
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,590
Step aside!

579
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,760
Don't blame me for being ruthless!

580
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:53,820
Young Master.

581
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:55,900
Duan Yu.

582
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,700
Star of Rebellion.

583
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,770
Lord Duan, it has nothing to do with Duan Yu.

584
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,510
Come at me if you have anything to settle.

585
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,390
Qiao.

586
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,050
Don't be reckless.

587
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,150
Master Duan,

588
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,200
I swear that I have never intended to

589
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,880
be an enemy of the Duan family.

590
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,710
Do you think I would believe you?

591
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,860
Shaoyi has encountered mishaps

592
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,450
several times after being with you.

593
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:18,700
Who would believe

594
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,270
it has nothing to do with you?

595
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,110
Qiao!

596
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,010
Master.

597
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:41,720
This is...

598
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,780
This is one of the Four Treasures.

599
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,920
Black Wood Human-shaped Sword.

600
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,270
Xiling gave the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword to her.

601
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,220
Not only that.

602
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,860
Qiao is also a disciple of Xiling Sect.

603
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,560
She's a disciple of Wang Tianshan.

604
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,810
This Black Wood Human-shaped Sword

605
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,200
was obtained for her

606
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,770
at the cost of Ruan Siqiong's life.

607
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:58,060
Ruan Siqiong is dead?

608
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:00,360
Didn't Xiling Sect know she is the Star of Rebellion?

609
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,310
Master Ruan knew.

610
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:05,240
But he also knew that I wouldn't use the Four Treasures to do bad things.

611
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,170
The treasure map.

612
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,630
The treasure map?

613
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,370
Fifteen years ago,

614
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,110
in order to quell the disputes in the Martial Arts World,

615
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:30,630
my father eliminated the possibility of the Sacred Blood Sect's resurgence,

616
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:32,040
and hid the Heavenly Pearl of the Four Treasures

617
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,830
in an unknown location.

618
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,000
He then drew a treasure map

619
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,690
of the hiding place,

620
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,370
divided it into four parts,

621
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,180
and entrusted each part to one of the four great families.

622
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,330
The piece she holds

623
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,510
is the one held by Xiling Sect.

624
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:44,780
But I didn't expect

625
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,110
Great Master Zhang to give it to her.

626
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:51,640
Wait.

627
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,460
If Great Master Zhang trusts Gu Qingqiao so much

628
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,090
to give her the treasure map,

629
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,580
it means Gu Qingqiao is very reliable.

630
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:20,140
Great Master Zhang is over a hundred years old.

631
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,490
Maybe he is senile.

632
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:23,400
Don't insult the Great Master.

633
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,630
You are quite protective of Great Master Zhang.

634
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,360
Xiling disciples are united.

635
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,780
Insulting the sect is the same as insulting me.

636
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,030
Don't think I will let it slide

637
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,590
just because you're Duan Yu's brother.

638
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,190
If you had endured silently,

639
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:39,090
I might not have spared your life.

640
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,080
But seeing how you protect them,

641
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,920
you have earned my respect.

642
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,070
Brother,

643
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,510
this is not the time for internal strife.

644
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,570
Shaoyi is missing,

645
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,990
and the Sacred Blood Sect is pressing hard.

646
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,470
Being on the same side

647
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,150
is actually a good thing.

648
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,540
To me,

649
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,790
the most important things are friends and family.

650
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,070
Shaoyi's disappearance

651
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,950
is surely related to the Sacred Blood Sect.

652
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,140
I cannot sit idly by.

653
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,710
The treasure map

654
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:12,760
will be more useful in your hands than in mine.

655
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:14,910
I'll give you the map.

656
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,230
Let's find Shaoyi together.

657
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:33,580
Aren't you afraid I will destroy the treasure map,

658
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,040
so you will never obtain the Four Treasures?

659
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:39,910
If that happens,

660
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,510
it's my fate.

661
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:42,790
For Shaoyi,

662
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,280
I accept my fate.

663
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,870
For the sake of Great Master Zhang,

664
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,370
I will spare your life.

665
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,630
Thank you, Brother.

666
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,830
Gu Qingqiao.

667
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:56,400
I didn't expect you to trust Duan Yu so much.

668
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,550
You handed the treasure map

669
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,410
to someone who wanted to kill you.

670
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,590
Calm down, My Lord.

671
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,440
The old fox Zhang Sifeng

672
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,660
hid the treasure map in the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword

673
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,260
but didn't tell Gu Qingqiao.

674
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,600
In this way,

675
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,630
he protected both Gu Qingqiao

676
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,380
and the treasure map.

677
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,080
What a cunning plan.

678
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,840
With the three pieces of the treasure map are at Jizhou Academy,

679
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,910
should we...

680
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,110
No hurry.

681
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,430
There are many masters at Jizhou Academy.

682
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,830
Don't take it by force if we can use wisdom.

683
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:25,790
Yes.

684
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,550
Cheng Mufei,

685
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,770
don't let me down.

686
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,100
It's disgusting.

687
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:40,790
How can anyone do such work?

688
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:44,750
Boss, look at this. What is this?

689
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,900
This looks familiar.

690
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,750
We believe the luminous pearl Mr. Guo used to pay off his debts

691
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,840
is actually Shaoyi's.

692
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,550
The murderer must have known about this oversight,

693
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,510
so they killed him.

694
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:58,590
Then

695
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,520
where is the luminous pearl now?

696
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,350
In the casino.

697
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,670
If anyone inquires about the origin of the luminous pearl,

698
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,930
he must have something to do with Shaoyi.

699
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,430
His Lordship. Young Master.

700
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,680
[Casino Entry Registration]

701
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,390
This is the list sent by the casino,

702
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,710
recording the people who inquired about
the luminous pearl in the past few days.

703
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:23,830
Is there anyone suspicious?

704
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:24,350
Yes.

705
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:24,990
And

706
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,790
it's someone unexpected.

707
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:27,480
Who?

708
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,600
Principal Cheng.

709
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,590
Principal Cheng.

710
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:33,580
Sheriff Song.

711
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,670
We've asked around.

712
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,900
Only the academy in all of Jizhou has such waist tokens,

713
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,630
so we came to ask

714
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,830
if any women have gone missing from the academy.

715
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,080
We have missing men,

716
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,430
but no women that I know of.

717
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:49,790
Even so,

718
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,750
please come by tomorrow

719
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,270
to identify the body,

720
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,320
just in case she is related to the academy.

721
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,150
Impossible.

722
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,910
Principal Cheng is highly respected.

723
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,600
He has had good relations with the Duan family for many years,

724
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,190
and treats Shaoyi like his nephew.

725
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,630
How could he harm Shaoyi?

726
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,250
There must be a mistake.

727
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,050
I was also very surprised.

728
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,070
But

729
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:09,990
only Principal Cheng had contact with the Young Master Shaoyi.

730
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,720
So I asked a few more questions.

731
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,640
The owner said

732
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,180
Principal Cheng inquired about the price for his wife's birthday.

733
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,150
This is normal.

734
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:18,690
But other visitors

735
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,990
only cared if the luminous pearl was real.

736
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:22,030
Only Principal Cheng

737
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:25,240
asked about where the luminous pearl came from.

738
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,680
Maybe

739
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,960
Principal Cheng was just curious.

740
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,670
After all,

741
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:34,090
most things in a casino are not coming from the right place.

742
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,710
I remember you told me

743
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,680
the last time you saw Mr. Guo,

744
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,080
he was arguing with Principal Cheng.

745
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:43,150
It might have been a regular argument.

746
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:45,480
It can't be evidence of murdering Mr. Guo.

747
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:48,150
I don't want to suspect Director Cheng.

748
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,690
For Shaoyi's sake,

749
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,030
we must remain vigilant.

750
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:53,910
Who could it be?

751
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:56,790
The academy doesn't even admit female students.

752
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:59,830
Could this waist token be left by the murderer?

753
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,030
What's going on?

754
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,050
Mr. Constable.

755
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,760
Young Master Duan, Miss Gu.

756
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,310
Any news on Shaoyi?

757
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,400
Today we're not here for him.

758
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:10,420
Then why are you here?

759
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:12,630
Young Master Duan, has there been

760
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,510
any woman missing from the academy recently?

761
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,710
The academy only admits male students.

762
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:19,120
Women are mostly students' servants,

763
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,550
or Principal Cheng's family.

764
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,760
Why do you ask about the missing woman?

765
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,590
Miss Gu, there's something you don't know.

766
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,550
There's been progress in the dismembered body case.

767
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,949
We found this waist token

768
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,510
on this body.

769
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,920
Clearly, it belongs to the academy.

770
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,230
But we asked Principal Cheng

771
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,889
and he said there were no missing women from the academy.

772
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,110
Okay.

773
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,310
Thank you.

774
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:45,370
We'll take our leave.

775
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,630
Is it that

776
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:57,710
you haven't seen the Principal's wife yet?

777
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,760
Duan Yu.

778
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:03,750
Where are you going?

779
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:04,800
Uncle Cheng.

780
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,050
My brother asked me

781
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:08,040
to give some supplements to Madam.

782
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:10,890
Thank you.

783
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,400
Uncle Cheng, we're all here.

784
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:15,670
Please let us see her.

785
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,630
Her illness is contagious.

786
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,470
It's okay.

787
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,140
Tuberculosis does not easily infect people.

788
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,350
We'll be careful.

789
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:27,360
She's probably resting right now.

790
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,150
We'll just take a look from afar.

791
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,840
It wouldn't be appropriate...

792
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,300
Uncle Cheng, please listen to me.

793
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,650
What do you mean?

794
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:40,230
Let me out!

795
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,110
Is anyone there?

796
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,640
Let me out!

797
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,640
Xueniang. Xueniang.

798
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,300
Xueniang.

799
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,740
Are you all right?

800
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,930
I'm fine.

801
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:18,910
Who's this?

802
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,910
Madam.

803
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,630
Hello, Madam.

804
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,100
You are...

805
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,470
Yu.

806
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,220
You remember me.

807
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,360
Of course.

808
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,340
When you and Shaoyi were young,

809
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,760
you often came to me for candy.

810
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:41,960
Mufei.

811
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,720
Since Yu is here,

812
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,320
why didn't you tell me?

813
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,270
I'm worried about your condition.

814
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:49,170
I'm also afraid they'll get sick.

815
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,960
It doesn't matter.

816
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,400
I'm happy to see Yu.

817
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,120
Who is this lady?

818
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,470
I'm Duan Yu's friend.

819
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,200
I'm Gu Qingqiao.

820
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,690
Shaoyi has gone missing.

821
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,840
Qiao is accompanying me to find him.

822
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:12,390
Xueniang needs proper care for her illness.

823
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:13,990
You've visited her.

824
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,480
That's enough for today.

825
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,320
Madam,

826
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,120
these are the supplements for you.

827
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,020
In that case,

828
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,710
we'll take our leave now.

829
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,550
Thank you.

830
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,900
Looks like we guessed wrong.

831
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,240
That dismembered body isn't Madam.

832
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,240
If it's not Madam,

833
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,800
then who could it be?

834
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:52,930
Xueniang, you've gotten scared today.

835
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:56,260
Mufei.

836
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,460
Why did you stop me?

837
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,710
After killing Granny Xu

838
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:05,130
and learning of my identity as a disciple of the Sacred Blood Sect,

839
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,870
I should have died.

840
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,830
I can't keep dragging you down.

841
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:12,910
There's no such thing between us.

842
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,270
Xueniang.

843
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:16,150
Trust me.

844
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,880
I'll soon smoothly send off the Duan family

845
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,710
and then take you away from here.

846
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:23,230
Let's go to a place where no one knows us

847
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:24,590
and start over.

848
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,600
Can there really be such a day?

849
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,190
Although Uncle Cheng tried to stop me,

850
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:32,070
I found nothing wrong with Madam.

851
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,150
We still can't relax our guard against the Sacred Blood Sect.

852
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:38,480
This might be their plot to start internal strifes among us.

853
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,350
I understand.

854
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:41,120
Besides,

855
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,390
even if we can trust Gu Qingqiao temporarily,

856
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:45,320
you shouldn't get too close to her.

857
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,110
Brother.

858
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,870
I can see clearly now.

859
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,830
You've grown deeply attached to Gu Qingqiao.

860
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:52,750
And I

861
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:56,230
absolutely won't allow you to be with the Star of Rebellion.

862
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:58,840
Duan Yu, you are from the Duan family.

863
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:01,260
You have the blood of the Duan family in your veins.

864
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:04,030
The suitable woman for you must be someone of equal status.

865
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,510
And her family can assist you.

866
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,670
Gu Qingqiao

867
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,310
is not on the same path as you.

868
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,720
I don't need a woman of equal status.

869
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,590
I just want someone who shares mutual feelings with me.

870
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:14,560
And that person

871
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,440
is Gu Qingqiao.

872
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,590
Fine.

873
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,960
Let's not discuss how the Star of Rebellion

874
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,230
could endanger the Duan family.

875
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,270
Just as you said today,

876
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:28,030
Gu Qingqiao comes from another world.

877
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:30,360
So even if we ultimately eliminate the Sacred Blood Sect,

878
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,550
resolve the crisis,

879
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,950
and help her gather the Four Treasures to open the gate of time and space.

880
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:37,820
In the end, she will return to her own world.

881
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:39,690
What about you?

882
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,300
What will you do?

883
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,520
If she leaves,

884
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,090
I will remain unwed for life.
