But as the young master of the Duan family,

162

It's okay.

174

After careful thinking,

185
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,210
Qiao is here for two reasons.

186
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,090
One is that the Sacred Blood Sect disciples are here.

187
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:20,970
-Sacred Blood Sect disciples?
-The second

188
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,000
is that

189
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,250
the Four Treasures are here.

190
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,250
So, treating your arm is only an excuse for you to stay?

191
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,930
Well, the romance writer

If you did, the other three Treasures

if all the petals turn black,

570
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,320
Great Master.

571
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,960
It's very kind of you to say so.

572
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,020
Young Master Duan.

573
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,990
How's your injury?

574
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,050
It's

575
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,530
much better.

576
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,110
Thanks to the doctors at Xiling.

577
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,680
I plan to stay for a bit longer

578
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,170
for more medicinal baths and then head home.

579
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:40,980
Stay as long as you need to recover.

580
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,660
There's no rush.

581
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,670
Thank you, Great Master.

582
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:47,870
Young Master Duan.

583
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:52,850
You're acquainted with our disciple,

584
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,460
Dong... what's her name?

585
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,200
Yes,

586
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,670
we've had some interactions in the past.

587
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,250
You're more honest than I expected.

588
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,590
What do you mean?

589
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,300
Nothing.

590
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,100
Feel free to continue your recovery.

591
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,400
I'm tired today.

592
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:17,210
Then I'll take my leave.

593
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,130
Okay.

594
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,780
See you.

595
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,830
Goodbye.

596
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,010
Okay.

597
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,820
The Duan family is wealthy.

598
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,780
Let's see what he's brought.

599
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:47,050
This tea set is exquisite.

600
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:52,670
What else do we have?

601
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,660
A gold pot.

602
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,940
Quite expensive.

603
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:02,850
But

604
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,710
it's all gold and jewels.

605
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:08,730
Nothing interesting.

606
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,380
Boring.

607
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:11,930
Boring.

608
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:19,210
There's something odd about Duan Yu

609
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,660
and Dong... something Qing.

610
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:27,740
[Xiling] [Martial Arts]

611
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:52,300
[Xiling] [Martial Arts]

612
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,700
Great Master.

613
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,300
Great Master.

614
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,170
You want to see me?

615
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,370
They say your name is Pipa.

616
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:57,860
Why?

617
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,540
Pipa is such a beautiful name.

618
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,250
You...

619
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,210
You don't deserve it.

620
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:05,170
Great Master.

621
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:08,050
Are you saying I'm not good-looking?

622
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:10,730
I knew it.

623
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:13,370
I might not be a great beauty,

624
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:14,330
but at least...

625
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,410
I'm not saying

626
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:18,090
you're not good-looking.

627
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,700
I'm saying

628
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,290
you're ugly.

629
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:24,610
Great Master,

630
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,010
you should take a rest.

631
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,100
I'll head back now.

632
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,270
My arm hurts.

633
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,510
I didn't touch you.

634
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:39,810
Dong... something Chun?

635
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,540
I think

636
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:44,380
you not only look ugly

637
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,030
but also have a problem with your brain.

638
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,790
You need some medicine.

639
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,870
What medicine?

640
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,410
Smart pills.

641
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:54,820
Okay, Great Master.

642
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:56,690
I'll go take some medicine.

643
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:57,610
Pipa,

644
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,510
massage my shoulders.

[Xiling] [Martial Arts]

646
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:14,770
Why do they call you Pipa?

647
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:17,580
A long, long time ago,

648
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,630
I lived in a faraway place.

649
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:22,270
Later, I came to Changqing,

650
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:24,940
but my behavior was strange,

651
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,520
and different from others.

652
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:29,910
In my hometown, people like that are called 'Qipa,'

653
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,660
but somehow

654
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:34,270
they started calling me 'Pipa.'

655
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:38,290
Does Duan Yu call you that too?

656
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,620
Sometimes.

657
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:44,980
It seems

658
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:49,580
you two are quite close.

659
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:53,540
Great Master.

660
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:56,040
Are you trying to trick me?

661
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,920
Great Master.

662
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:12,700
Shut up!

663
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,580
Who's your Great Master?

664
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,580
Tell me.

665
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,970
Why did you come to Xiling?

666
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:18,610
I...

667
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,960
I came to learn medicine.

668
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,740
[Xiling] [Martial Arts]

669
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:25,460
Do you believe I'll kill you?

670
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:26,570
No, no.

671
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,450
I'll tell the truth.

672
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,930
I... I'll be honest.

673
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:45,790
Great Master,

674
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:48,080
I have a rare disease

675
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,470
that only the Qingmu Sword can cure.

676
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:52,230
If I don't find it,

677
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,250
I'll die.

678
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,730
Did you plan this with Duan Yu?

679
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,250
No.

680
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,840
We met by chance.

681
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:02,890
Who else did you tell about this?

682
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,660
I told Master Ruan.

683
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,730
He took pity on me

684
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,880
and agreed to help.

685
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,370
He agreed?

686
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,850
I don't believe you.

687
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:21,090
Here,

688
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:23,330
it's written clearly.

689
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:25,170
Let me see.

690
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:28,250
Let me see.

691
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,450
You...

692
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,220
You broke the agreement.

693
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,710
It's written in black and white.

694
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,300
You...

695
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:40,030
You're not keeping your word.

696
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:41,890
I...

697
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,100
I'm not keeping my word.

698
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,120
So what?

699
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,120
If you don't like it, fight me!

700
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:47,690
I...

701
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,670
You little brat,

702
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,350
dare to shout at me?

703
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,330
I'll hit you

704
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,510

00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,790
I'm telling you.

708
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,730
I won't give you

00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,760
the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword.

710
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:06,680
If you want to live,

711
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:10,650
you better cook me braised pork every day.

713
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,250
is eat.

714
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,560
You even eat paper!

[Xiling]

716
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:23,620
What should I do?

717
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,790
My Black Wood Human-shaped Sword.

718
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:29,489
Siqiong,

719
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:32,460
can you tell me

720
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:36,190
why you're willing to risk your life

721
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:39,830
to help Qing draw the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword?

722
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,739
Qing is the sword seeker,

723
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,969
and I am the sword guardian.

724
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,610
I am destined to help her draw the sword.

725
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:50,040
The guardian only draws the sword for those who are worthy.

726
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,500
That child lacks the wisdom

727
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:55,210
and spirit

728
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:57,650
to take on such a great responsibility.

729
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:58,330
Qing.

730
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:58,970
Qing...

731
00:34:58,970 --> 00:34:59,770
Stop it.

732
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,580
I will not risk your life

733
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:06,650
for an uncertain future.

734
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:08,410
Master,

735
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:10,960
the first time I saw her,

736
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:13,020
she reminded me of someone.

737
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:13,640
No.

738
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:14,340
Yes.

739
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:17,130
The first time I saw her, my heart fluttered.

740
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:19,560
Because she resembles Shan Yao so much.

741
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,610
No.

742
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,700
It's because she's the sword seeker.

743
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,370
That's why you felt that way.

744
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,350
So,

745
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:31,000
she really is the sword seeker.

746
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:34,580
Leave me alone for a while.

747
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,490
I need to think.

748
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,180
Try this.

749
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,170
Resemble? This is rubbish!

750
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,830
Master.

751
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,410
I was wrong.

752
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:48,490
I'm sorry.

753
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,340
Just eat.

754
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,590
Okay.

755
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,430
Master, I'm full.

756
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:04,540
-Master, did you finish your meal?
-Master.

757
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,860
Rubbish!

758

759
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:15,080
did Master ever scold you?

760
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:15,770
No.

761
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,970
He's treating us differently!

762
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,460
It's so unfair.

763
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,230
I'm hurt.

764
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:27,570
Senior.

765
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,200
If I'm not around,

766
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,190
please take care of Master.

767
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,420
I can't be alone with him.

768
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,920
Look, it's only been a few days

769
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,600
and

770
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,650
I already have a few more wrinkles.

771
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:40,560
Senior.

772
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,860
Master actually cares about you a lot.

773
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,030
He just doesn't know how to show it.

774
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:47,690
He seems to know how to show it to you!

775
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:50,750
By the way,

776
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,260
a few days ago,

777
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:53,810
you promised me

778
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:57,130
you'd help me train the next generation of Xiling talents.

779
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:57,730
How can you

780
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,170
go back on your word

781
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:00,890
so soon?

782
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,720
The moon waxes and wanes.

783
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:04,770
People come and go.

784
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,050
Change is the only constant.

785
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,220
Xiling is getting weaker.

786
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,250
If you leave,

787
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,320
we'll be even more vulnerable.

788
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:18,830
Master's always angry with you

789
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,450
because he's worried about this too.

790
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,980
If fate is against me,

791
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,050
what can I do?

792
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:26,500
Senior,

793
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:28,770
you're destined for greatness.

794
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,170
Heaven will protect you.

795
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,250
Heaven?

796
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:33,390
Even you don't protect me!

797
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,150
You're such a swindler.

798
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:36,650
swindler?

799
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:43,190
That's what Qing said, isn't it?

800
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,060
Yes.

801
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,500
Qing,

802
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,650
has been here for a long time,

803
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,120
helping with the medicinal baths

804
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:54,840
and encouraging the Xiling disciples.

805
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:58,090
She might not be the brightest student,

806
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,440
but she's a good person.

807
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,610
I wish

808
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:04,890
she could stay longer

809
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:07,690
and help us more.

810
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,840
Yeah,

811
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,200
but I won't see her for a long time.

812
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:15,190
So, you shouldn't leave.

813
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,200
I don't want to, either.

814
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:27,370
What do you think I'm doing here?

815
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:31,890
I'm waiting for you.

816
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,700
How did you know I would come?

817
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,480
Ever since you came here,

818
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:37,740
I've felt your presence.

819
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,780
I feel your gaze on me every moment.

820
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:45,410
Xing Si told me

821
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,950
that you weren't trying to kill me,

822
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:51,280
but to protect me.

823
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:54,010
I told him I wasn't angry anymore.

824
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,820
Those words weren't for him.

825
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,250
They were for you.

826
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,590
Qiao.

827
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,850
Do you really forgive me?

828
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:03,370
Actually, on the way back to Xiling,

829
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,860
I already forgave you.

830
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,710
Quickly pack your things.

831
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:09,280
Let's go back to Changqing.

832
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,130
Look at you.

833
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,220
The calm and composed Young Master Duan

834
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,810
is acting crazier than I am.

835
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,930
Don't interrupt.

836
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:17,100
It doesn't matter whether I'm acting crazy or not.

837
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,100
What's important

838
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,510
is that you come with me.

839
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,480
Young Master Duan.

840
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,870
Do you think

841
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:23,250
I was joking

842
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,780
when I said we should

843
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,470
go our separate ways?

844
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:29,010
Since I learned about the ancient feud

845
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:30,950
between the Star of Rebellion and the Duan family,

846
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:31,870
I knew

847
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,520
we could never be together.

848
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,750
Since I came to Xiling,

849
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,790
I've been lying to myself,

850
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:42,170
telling myself

851
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:44,530
that even if I can't find the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword,

852
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:48,020
it's good enough to stay here in this peaceful land.

853
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:50,550
So, you've been focusing on medicinal baths

854
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,620
and learning medicine.

855
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:53,880
Yes.

856
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:56,010
But the changing color of the flower petals

857
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,540
reminds me

858
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,960
that I must find the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword.

859
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,070
Even if I find it,

860
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:05,820
there are still two things left unaccounted for.

861
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:07,170
I've accepted my fate.

862
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:07,930
Qiao.

863
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:08,550
Actually...

864
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,120
Duan Yu.

865
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:09,530
I...

866
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:11,580
It took me

867
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,470
a lot of courage to tell you this.

868
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,800
Let me finish.
