[Her Fantastic Adventures]

3
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,110
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

4
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,610
I was afraid that you would be afraid of me.

5
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:47,910
And that

6
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,950
you'd think I'm crazy.

7
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:51,050
Does Duan Yu

8
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,630
know about this?

9
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,660
He knows.

10
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,940
He has been thinking of ways to help me go home.

11
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,830
You misunderstood him before.

12
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,770
I've been dragging him down.

13
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:01,910
Qiao!

14
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,300
My baby.

15
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,080
Why is your life so miserable?

16
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:07,970
Father.

17
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:08,870
You...

18
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:10,830
don't blame me?

19
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,660
How could I blame you?

20
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,560
It's you

21
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,380
who let me see my daughter healthy and happy.

22
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,430
You let me hear her say goodbye to me.

23
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,420
I just feel sorry for you.

24
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,800
My child.

25
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,180
I'm the one who's incapable

26
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,590
of protecting you.

27
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,390

28
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,620
Dad?

29
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:38,579
Silly girl.

30
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,940

I've let Qiao down once

35
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,670
I won't let her down again.

36

Please grant us your assistance.

37
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,790
Fine.

38
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,350
Since you insist,

39
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,320
I'll do as you say this time.

40
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,950
Master, Chief Inspector Jin is here.

41
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,840
Tell him to meet me in the study.

42
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,600
Yes.

43
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:29,810
You scared me.

44
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:45,990
You may leave.

45
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,060
Close the door.

46
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:47,650
Yes.

The people are ready.

49
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,640
They're not enough.

50
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,870
I have to recover my strength as soon as possible.

51
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,420
But there are too many prisoners in prison.

52
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,050
I'm afraid it'll be hard to account for.

53
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,380
The only person you need to report to is me.

54
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,060
I don't care how you do it.

55
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,580
If you can't find enough people for me,

56
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,830
I will use your men.

57
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:52,659
I will

58
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,820
do my best.

59
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,659
There are two treasures maps left in Duan Yan's hands.

But...

63
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,670
Duan Yan is a cunning person

64
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,480
and now he's very vigilant.

65
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,960
I'm afraid it won't be easy.

66
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,690
You just need to lure him here.

67
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,890
As for the rest,

68
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,850
I'll deal with it.

69
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,430

00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,720
You want to kill me?

72
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,350
You killed the innocent.

73
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,220
You deserve it.

74
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,210
Gu Qingqiao,

75
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,190
even if you know who I am,

76
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,980
you'll still choose Duan Yu, right?

77
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,030
Since you're so stubborn,

78
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,250
and chose to work with the Duan family.

79
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,960
Then don't blame me

80
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,230

81
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,060
Principal Cheng and his wife's body

have been buried together.

83
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,360
Good.

84
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,590
It was Uncle Cheng’s last wish.

85
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:08,910
Mr. Qi.

86
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,270
My Lord.

87
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,220

[Invitation]

89
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,250
Did he tell you the reason?

90
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,150
He said...

91
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:18,950
Go ahead.

92
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,770
It’s about Young Master breaking off the engagement with Miss Du.

93
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,380
Brother,

94
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,490
I caused the trouble. I'll go.

95
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,870
Ultimately, this happened

00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,560
[Duan]

97
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,750
because I ignored your will

98
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,360
and decided on this marriage without your consent.

100
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,470

Brother.

102
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,230
Say no more.

[Duan]

104
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,960
I'll visit him as an act of apology.

105
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,310
Besides,

106
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,890
the Sacred Blood Sect is about to attack.

107
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,390
Changqing still needs people from the Shangguan Residence.

108
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,990
Even if he doesn’t come to me,

109
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,430
I have to find him.

110
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:50,890
My Lady, the food is here. Get up and eat.

111
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:52,909
My Lady.

112
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,720
My Lady.

113
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,200
What are you doing?

114
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,360
My Lady.

115
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,570
You've been like this since yesterday.

116
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,300
Get up and eat something.

117
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,640
I don't want to eat.

118
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,670
Get out.

119
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,460
I just want to be alone.

120

00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,590
Shaoyi.

122
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,700
You don’t want to eat so many delicious food?

123
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,540
What’s wrong?

124
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,540
Shaoyi, you...

125
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,270
Yuanhua, I have something to say to Shaoyi.

126
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,190
Please go out.

127
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,220
Yes.

128
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,260
What's wrong?

129
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,950
Did you hear any rumors today?

130
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,180
What rumor?

131
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,310
A dead person.

132
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,580
A murder?

133
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,170
No.

134
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,190
Why do you suddenly care about this?

135
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,210
I was just asking.

136
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,570
Why are you here today?

137
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,510
Magistrate Du invited my father to a banquet in the residence.

138
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,770
He said it was about Uncle calling off the engagement with you.

139
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,050
So I came to see you.

140
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:55,920
What?

141
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,050
Shaoyi.

142
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,140
Please distract the people outside.

143
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,070
Help me.

144
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,360
Lord Magistrate.

145
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,720
I was reckless

146
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,660
about Duan Yu and Miss Du's engagement.

147
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,150
So I came here today to apologize.

148
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,630
We've known each other for years.

149
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,500
Although I'm angry,

150
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,160
I won't make things difficult for you.

151
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,940
I want to ask you something.

152
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,770
Go ahead.

153
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,690
I heard something happened to the Sacred Blood Sect in Jizhou

154
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,030
and they suffered heavy casualties.

155
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,870
Is this true?

156
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:35,980
To be honest,

157
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,929
I just came back from Jizhou.

158
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,650
It's true.

159
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,390
I don't understand

160
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,540
why the Sacred Blood Sect attacked Jizhou Academy.

161
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,460
They did it for the treasure map.

162
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,920
You know that

163
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,130
the Duan family has been guarding against the resurrection of the Sacred Blood Sect.

164
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,900
They're gathering the Four Treasures

165
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,100
and the location of one of the Treasures

166
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,980
is in the treasure map.

167
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,590
In that case,

168
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,340
the Sacred Blood Sect has got the treasure map.

169
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,050
Not yet.

170
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,390
The treasure map is divided into four.

171
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,240
I have two of them.

172
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,850
Now these two treasure maps

173
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,230
are the key to suppress the Sacred Blood Sect.

174
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,390
Looks like Changqing will experience

175
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,090
a bloody storm soon.

176
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,930
So I came here today

177
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,140
to discuss this with you.

178
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,700
I'm afraid Changqing needs to strengthen its defense.

179
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,510
The Sacred Blood Sect can hide among ordinary people.

180
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,860
It's hard to tell them apart.

181
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,060
That's easy to say.

182
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,350
I'll dispatch soldiers

183
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,480
to guard along with the Wuyi Guards.

184
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,590
I'm mainly worried

185
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,930
about the safety of the treasure maps.

186
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,130
Of course.

187
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,750
I always carry it with me.

188
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,680
The map goes where I go.

189
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,150
Don't worry.

190
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,340
That's good.

191
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,110
Come on, let me toast you.

192
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,430
Cheers.

193
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,910
After drinking this cup.

194
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,910
Let's forget about the past.

195
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,980
I should be the one to toast you.

196
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:05,950
My Lady.

197
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,100
My Lady, there's a guest.

198
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:07,900
Don't stop me.

199
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,350
Father, why didn’t you let me out?

200
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,970
Miss Du, you are...

201
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,190
Did you know Duan Yu broke off the engagement with me?

202
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,880
But my father kept me at home and wouldn't let me out.

203
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,030
It was Duan Yu's fault.

204
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,430
Why are you punishing me?

205
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,110
Nonsense!

206
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,030
Lord Duan is here.

207
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:27,930
Leave now.

208
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,060
No.

209
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,970
I won't.

210
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,220
I won't listen to you today.

211
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:38,970
Lord Duan,

212
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,900
you're not welcome here.

213
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,170
Why are you still here?

214
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,130
Miss Du, I’m really sorry.

215
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,840
Leave!

216
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,700
Ruoyun!

217
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,680
Magistrate Du.

218
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,750
It seems I came at the wrong time.

219
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,980
I'll take my leave.

220
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,840
Lord Duan! Lord Duan!

221
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,430
Ruoyun.

222
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,240
Do you know what you've done?

223
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,050
I just don't want to see the Duan family.

224
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:09,850
Guards!

225
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,640
Lock her up in her room.

226
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,190
Don't let her out.

227
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,430
My Lord.

228
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,920
I didn't expect Ruoyun to barge in...

229
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,520
and disrupted my plan.

230
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,350
But I'm sure

231
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,810
the treasure map is with Duan Yan.

232
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,230
As long as we kill him,

233
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,090
we can get the treasure map.

234
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,770
Duan Yan is cunning.

235
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,030
If he runs away this time,

236
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,350
he'll be on guard.

237
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,940
Next time,

238
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,700
it won't be so easy.

239
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,730
I didn't have the opportunity to do it this time.

240
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,670
I think Duan Yan didn't notice anything wrong.

241
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,040
I'd hope so.

242
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,310
The Star of Rebellion don't have much time left.

243
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,030
We must gather the Four Treasures

244
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,830
and open the gate of time and space before she dies.

245
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,590
Otherwise, all our efforts will be in vain.

246
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,890
Don't worry.

247
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,910
I won't let you down.

248
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,080
My Lord.

249
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,550
I was wrong.

250
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,390
Please spare me.

251
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,510
I know I was wrong.

252
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,800
Enough. Stop.

253
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,270
Yuanhua,

254
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:36,130
do you know why I punished you today?

255
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,310
Yes.

256
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,670
I didn't keep a good watch on Miss Du

257
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,470
and disturbed your guest.

258
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:42,960
That's one thing.

259
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,880
Second, why didn't you inform me

260
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,900
of Miss Du's actions?

261
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,440
How dare you hide it from me?

262
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,410
Yes.

263
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,480
It's my fault.

264
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,430
I was wrong, My Lord.

265
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,780
Let me ask you again.

266
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,050
Is there anything unusual

267
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,060
about the Lady lately?

268
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,710
Miss Du...

269
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,460
She sneaked out yesterday.

270
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,400
but she came back in the afternoon.

271
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,070
Duan Yu,

272
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,790
this is the last thing I can do for you.

273
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,160
From now on,

274
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,630
we'll go our separate ways.

275
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,630
We're even now.

276
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,590
I'm going to bed.

277
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,650
Why are you here so late?

278
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,130
Why don't you recuperate?

279
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,920
My Lady,

280
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,870
I'm worried about you.

281
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,760
What's there to be worried about?

282
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:38,820
Have a seat.

283
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,100
Sit.

284
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,010
I feel bad

285
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,140
for getting you beaten.

286
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,710
My Lady,

287
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,210
you're the one who acts properly everyday.

288
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,910
But you made a scene today.

289
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,870
I was afraid something happened to you.

290
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,710
I...

291
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:05,920
I just didn't want to see the Duan family anymore.

292
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,200
I'm relieved then.

293
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:10,850
Yuanhua,

294
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,330
do you know the Sacred Blood Sect?

295
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,470
Why do you ask?

296
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,090
I...

297
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,590
I saw my father hiding a member of that Sect.

298
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,120
Many years ago,

299
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,790
you left the Sacred Blood Sect

300
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,630
to be with an ordinary woman.

301
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,280
Unexpectedly,

302
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,290
you broke the taboo that forbids

303
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,000
the union of the Sacred Blood Sect and ordinary people,

304
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,490
giving birth to a child who possesses both the lineage of the Sect

305
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:38,010
and the health of an ordinary person.

306
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:38,980
Ruoyun,

307
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,960
is a taboo of the Sacred Blood Sect,

308
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,850
but is even more of a miracle.

309
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,920
My Lord.

310
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,870
Ruoyun doesn't know our plan.

311
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,990
Please don't blame

312
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:53,140
my daughter for what happened today.

313
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,450
Don't worry.

314
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,800
Ruoyun is the hope of the continuity of the Sacred Blood Sect.

315
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,260
I won't do anything to her.

316
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,710
Besides, I promised you

317
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,720
once the Sacred Blood Sect is restored,

318
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,370
you can openly appear

319
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,840
in front of the world.

320
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,800
Ruoyun will be the Priestess of the Sacred Blood Sect

321
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,930
and can enjoy supreme glory.

322
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,580
Thank you, My Lord.

323
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,660
Remember what you said.

324
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,710
Keep watch on Du Ruoyun.

325
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,150
If my only way out is blocked,

326
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,320
she

327
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,990
will die.

328
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,270
I understand.

329
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,050
I will find a way

330
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,630
to get the treasure map from Duan Yan.

331
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,620
My Lady, I'm leaving.

332
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,390
Wait.

333
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,300
Tell me what happened.

334
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,110
My Lady.

335
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,600
My father said it's a big secret.

336
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,530
I'll die if I tell anyone.

337
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,290
Tell me.

338
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,360
I will never tell anyone.

339
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,200
My Lady.

340
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,220
Actually,

341
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,640
Master used to be a member of the Sacred Blood Sect.

342
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,480
Impossible.

343
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,800
The Sacred Blood Sect killed commoners

344
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,910
and caused damage to the society.

345
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,490
How could my father be part of the Sacred Blood Sect?

346
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,490
I don't know.

347
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,760
My father told me this before he died.

348
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,270
He said the Sacred Blood Sect

349
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,030
wasn't as evil as rumored.

350
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,910
They are ordinary people like us.

351
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:06,690
No.

352
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,200
Your father must have lied to you.

353
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,860
I heard that man...

354
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,200
used other people's blood to heal.

355
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,240
How could they be ordinary people?

356
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,040
You must be lying.

357
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,370
My father said

358
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,540
a long time ago,

359
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,920
Master met his wife.

360
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,940
But the Sacred Blood Sect is not allowed to marry a outsider.

361
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,630
In order to be with Madam,

362
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,700
he gave up everything and left the Sect.

363
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,150
When he left, he also brought along my father.

364
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,210
But not long after,

365
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,900
the four noble families besieged the Sacred Blood Sect.

366
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,980
Our misfortune

367
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,650
saved our lives.

368
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,140
How could this happen?

369
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,830
Then am I also of the Sacred Blood Sect?

370
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,100
I don't know.

371
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,170
My Lady, I’m leaving.

372
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,290
Have a rest.

373
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,460
I told her everything.

374
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,099
My Lady.

375
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:05,910
I'm sorry.

376
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,940
Master did it for your own good.

377
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,640
Yuanhua had no choice.

378
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,190
My Lord.

379
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,740
Something happened.

380
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,540
What happened?

381
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,020
Gu Xingwu came to report a case.

382
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:17,980
He said last night,

383
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,140
his daughter Gu Qingqiao

384
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,740
was taken away by the Duan family of Changqing.

385
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,910
Gu Xingwu.

386
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,050
You accused the Duan family of Changqing

387
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,850
of kidnapping your daughter, Gu Qingqiao.

388
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,150
Do you have proof?

389
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,450
The neighbours heard the noise.

390
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,230
Many pedestrians witnessed Wuyi Guards

391
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,940
breaking into my house and taking my daughter away.

392
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,800
Lord Magistrate,

393
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,750
please help me.

394
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,550
I've received your complaint.

395
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:53,420
I will uphold justice for you.

396
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,970
Thank you, Lord Magistrate.

397
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,100
My Lord.

398
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,440
I think

399
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,060
there might be something fishy about this case.

400
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,500
It's indeed strange.

401
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,740
The Duan family

402
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,940
has reversed the case for Gu Qingqiao.

403
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,550
Now, they broke into the Gu family at night

404
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,020
and took Gu Qingqiao away in public.

405
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,410
It's against common sense.

406
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:19,250
My Lord,

407
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,180
do you want me to go to the Duan family

408
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,020
to check if there's anything behind this case?

409
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,790
No need.

410
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,370
I'll go there myself.

411
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,630
Magistrate Du.

412
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,130
Sorry to keep you waiting.

413
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,800
Lord Duan.

414
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,660
I was delayed by something.

415
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:38,450
Sorry.

416
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,090
Please have a seat.

417
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,110
My daughter was ignorant yesterday

418
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,030
and have disturbed you.

419
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:52,040
It's reasonable that Ruoyun has a grudge against me.

420
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,120
I don't blame her.

421
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,070
I watched her grow up

422
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,320
but I wasted her time on her marriage.

423
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,850
When Duan Yu comes back,

424
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,410
I'll ask him to apologize.

425
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,550
Young Master Duan is not home?

426
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,680
He left the city last night

427
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,740
and went to Xiling.

428
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,140
I see.

429
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:08,960
Magistrate Du

430
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,110
should know what happened yesterday.

431
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,520
That's why you're here.

432
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,350
Nothing can hidden from Lord Duan.

433
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,300
That's right.

434
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,990
Gu Xingwu has submitted a complaint to the government.

435
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,920
I'm here today for Gu Qingqiao.

436
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,910
Lord Duan,

437
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,770
even if you wanted to capture her,

438
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,900
you didn't have to make it public.

439
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,130
I had no choice.

440
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,720
Duan Yu was determined to marry her.

441
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,980
How could I let her marry into our family?

442
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,410
This is truly tricky.

443
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,900
I'm afraid you don't know.

444
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,290
Three of the four noble families have died out.

445
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:44,130
Now only the Duan family is struggling to survive.

446
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,530
If the Sacred Blood Sect attacks,

447
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,260
the world will be in misery.

448
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,740
It's a critical moment now.

449
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,550
After thinking about it last night,

450
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,650
I think we should start with Gu Qingqiao.

451
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,310
You mean...

452
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,250
Kill her

453
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,310
to end it all.

454
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,930
Brother Duan, please don't.

455
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,030
I mean,

456
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:09,520
if you destroy your relationship with Young Master Duan because of Gu Qingqiao,

457
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,230
it'll be a pity.

458
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,870
Magistrate Du is right.

459
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:19,610
Killing Gu Qingqiao is indeed the last resort.

460
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,180
But I can't let her

461
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,540
fall into the hands of the Sacred Blood Sect.

462
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,040
So we can only keep her under control

463
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,300
and discuss it later.

464
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,300
Lord Duan,

465
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,450
I want to see Gu Qingqiao.

466
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,170
I'm afraid...

467
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,700
It's not that I don't trust you.

468
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,280
If she dies,

469
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:39,870
it'll be difficult for me as the official of Changqing.

470
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,390
Fine.

471
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,330
Gu Qingqiao.

472
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,190
Duan Yan.

473
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,150
You hypocrite!

474
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:03,320
Duan Yu won't let you go when he comes back.

475
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,510
Star of Rebellion.

476
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,440
Do you really think Duan Yu will sever ties with me

477
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,680
for you?

478
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,670
He's a member of the Duan family.

479
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,850
He'll be sad for a while because of you.

480
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:13,860
So what?

481
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,540
You're despicable!

482
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Be smart

483
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,640
and give me the real treasure map.

484
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,140
I won't tell you.

485
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,500
Kill me if you dare.

486
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,220
Kill me

487
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,640
and no one can get the treasure map.

488
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,740
Torture her!

489
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:33,620
Yes.

490
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,070
Wait.

491
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,410
Lord Duan.

492
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,160
Don't cause any casualties.

493
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,290
Then I'll listen to Magistrate Du.

494
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,790
Keep an eye on her.

495
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,690
Don't let her be taken away.

496
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:56,420
Yes.

497
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,250
Don't worry, My Lord.

498
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,780
This dungeon is surrounded by Wuyi Guards.

499
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,660
I'm sure even a fly can't fly out.

500
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,440
Magistrate Du.

501
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:08,250
Please.

502
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,600
Duan Yan, come back!

503
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,320
Let me out!

504
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,070
You...

505
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,280
Miss Gu, are you alright?

506
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:34,590
Lord Duan,

507
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,050
weren't the remaining two treasure maps

508
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,700
with you?

509
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,800
She gave me a fake treasure map

510
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,800
to gain my trust.

511
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,800
Then I saw through it.

512
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,430
Magistrate Du,

513
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,660
you saw Gu Qingqiao

514
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:53,520
and I still have some use for her.

515
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,160
I won't kill her right away.

516
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,870
But if the Gu family still acts out...

517
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,400
I know.

518
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,430
It's good that she's alive.

519
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,340
As for the rest,

520
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:06,280
you can leave it to me.

521
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:10,050
Thank you, Magistrate Du.

522
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:17,250
[Du Residence]

523
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,840
My Lord.

524
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,170
What happened?

525
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:24,070
Miss Du tore up her favourite dialogue novel.

526
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,400
Have you done

527
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,540
what I asked you to do?

528
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,000
Something unexpected happened.

529
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:36,650
Duan Yan caught Gu Qingqiao.

530
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,900
Duan Yan didn't do anything in Jizhou.

531
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,800
Why did he act after leaving your residence?

532
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,040
Did he notice something's off already?

533
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,170
When I went to the Duan Residence today,

534
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:49,120
it didn't seem like he suspected me.

535
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:52,870
He said it was because he was concerned about Duan Yu before,

536
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,500
but since Duan Yu is not in Changqing now

537
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,100
it was time to take action.

538
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,890
Where is Duan Yu?

539
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,780
I think he went to Xiling.

540
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,160
Zhang Sifeng is dead and

541
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:05,220
the treasure map is in Duan Yan's hands.

542
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,830
Why would he go to Xiling?

543
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,310
Maybe Duan Yan

544
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,450
found an excuse to send him out?

545
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,780
Where is Gu Qingqiao now?

546
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,600
She's still alive.

547
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,680
In my opinion, Gu Qingqiao doesn't trust the Duan family.

548
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,210
She had a backup plan

549
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,030
and gave Duan Yan a fake treasure map.

550
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:28,780
In order to find the location of the real treasure map,

551
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,150
he's keeping her alive.

552
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:33,550
But Gu Qingqiao has been tortured severely.

553
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,200
I'm afraid she won't last long.

554
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,230
It's fake?

555
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,340
Don't act rashly now.

556
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:45,100
This is a bit strange.

557
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:45,990
My Lord,

558
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:49,350
if Duan Yan is cruel enough to kill Gu Qingqiao,

559
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,730
it'll do us no good.

560
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,170
Stall Duan Yan.

561
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:57,350
I'll find a way to take Gu Qingqiao away.

562
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,140
Master.

563
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,620
My Lord.

564
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:08,890
Please

565
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,970
tell Gu Xingwu in person

566
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,050
that the bigger scene he makes

567
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,470
the better he can protect his daughter.

568
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,720
What brings you here today?

569
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,430
It's for Gu Qingqiao again.

570
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,070
You mean...

571
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:30,210
Gu Xingwu made a big fuss

572
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,420
and it's bad for the reputation of the Duan family.

573
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,460
In my opinion,

574
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:36,380
it's better to frame Gu Qingqiao with a crime

575
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,210
like what happened at Mantra Sect before

576
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,060
and put her in jail.

577
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,340
Don't bother.

578
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,150
As long as she hands over the map,

579
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,680
I'll kill her myself.

580
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,630
Lord Duan hasn't found the treasure map yet?

581
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,820
She's very smart.

582
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,300
She must have guessed

583
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,760
what will happen after she hands over the map.

584
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,190
But I've figured it out.

585
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,930
Even if she doesn't hand over the map,

586
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,170
as long as she dies,

587
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,420
the Four Treasures will be useless to the Duan family.

588
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,020
Aren't you curious

589
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:05,810
about where Four Treasures are hidden?

590
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:09,200
The four parts of the treasure map needs to be pieced together

591
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,600
to find the location of the Heavenly Pearl.

592
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,490
Although I have seen it before,

593
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,260
but I couldn't guess the location.

594
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:18,030
I know something about paintings.

595
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,990
If you believe me,

596
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,210
you can leave it to me.

597
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:25,870
My Lord.

598
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:26,930
It's time.

599
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,850
I'm busy today.

600
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,800
I've neglected you.

601
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,140
Please forgive me.

602
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,340
Go ahead.

603
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:46,230
Mr. Du.

604
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,460
Shaoyi.

605
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:48,430
Mr. Du.

606
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,410
I haven't seen Ruoyun for a long time.

607
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,410
How is she lately?

608
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:54,260
Ruoyun is pondering over her mistakes behind closed doors.

609
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,750
She's pondering over her mistakes?

610
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,060
She's just throwing a tantrum.

611
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,250
Don't keep her behind doors.

612
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,330
Let her out.

613
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,100
My father is injured recently.

614
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,100
No one plays with me anymore.

615
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,330
Your father is injured.

616
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,410
Don't you know?

617
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,670
It's all because of the treasure map.

618
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,390
He was injured by the members of the Sacred Blood Sect.

619
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:12,190
He needs a medicinal bath at this hour every day.

620
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,690
I see.

621
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:14,390
Then...

622
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,780
you saw the treasure map?

623
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,280
Not only did I see it,

624
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,540
I also know where it is.

625
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,640
But I can't tell you.

626
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,030
My father views the map

627
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,830
as more important than his life.

628
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,620
I'm afraid he'll kill me.

629
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:30,090
Don't worry.

630
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:32,480
I've known your father for more than ten years.

631
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,320
I will help your father catch the Sacred Blood Sect.

632
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,080
But...

633
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,100
I have one condition.

634
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,580
You have to tell me where the treasure map is.

635
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,670
In that case,

636
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:47,970
I'll tell you.

637
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,650
But you can't tell my father

638
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,100
I told you.

639
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,050
Deal.

640
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,300
My father is injured, isn't he?

641
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,230
So he tells others that the treasure map is on him.

642
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,020
In fact,

643
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,140
In fact...

644
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,130
What?

645
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:01,490
In fact,

646
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:04,050
it is on the Treasure Pavilion in the study.

647
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,300
My Lord, the medicinal bath is ready.

648
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,230
Guard this place.

649
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,630
Don't let anyone in.

650
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:38,950
Yes.

651
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,190
Guards!

652
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,660
Oh no!

653
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,830
Where is my official seal?

654
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:51,430
My Lord.

655
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,580
Where is the official seal?

656
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,450
Did you lose it somewhere?

657
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,610
We'll be in trouble if we lose the seal.

658
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,630
Lord Magistrate.

659
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,420
I'll find it for you.

660
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,400
I'll send it back to your mansion once I find it.

661
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,230
Okay.

662
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:02,000
Okay.

663
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,840
I want to find it myself.

664
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,380
I can't find my official seal.

665
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,930
Where is my seal?

666
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,830
Mr. Du,

667
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,960
this is our master’s study.

668
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:49,100
Your seal shouldn't be here.

669
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,100
My Lord, please come out with me.

670
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:51,950
My Lord.

671
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,870
I found your seal.

672
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,500
Thanks to you.

673
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,600
I'm relieved now.

674
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,600
That's a relief.

675
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:02,940
Be careful, My Lord.

676
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,400
-Ruoyi, admit your mistake.
-My Lord.

677
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,370
My apologies.

678
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,590
I fought with someone just now,

679
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:10,120
but I didn't want to hurt the Lord Magistrate.

680
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:11,850
Please forgive me.

681
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,080
What would you do

682
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,720
if you hurt our Lord?

683
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:17,430
Lord Magistrate, please forgive me.

684
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:26,630
Master.

685
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,310
There is no necklace on Magistrate Du's neck.

686
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,220
Could it be that he deliberately hid it?

687
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,710
There's another strange place.

688
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:36,110
I told him the location of the treasure map.

689
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:36,960
He went there,

690
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,220
but he didn't take away the treasure map.

691
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:40,370
Could it be...

692
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,860
he already noticed?

693
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,250
Not necessarily.

694
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:45,340
Magistrate Du is cunning.

695
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:48,510
What's the problem then?

696
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:51,420
After Du Ruoyun interrupted the banquet that day,

697
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,870
I realized something suspicious about Magistrate Du.

698
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:54,990
Come to think of it,

699
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,110
that day at the banquet,

700
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,390
he deliberately asked me about the whereabouts of the treasure map.

701
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,920
If Ruoyun hadn't barged in,

702
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:02,150
I would've died right now.

703
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:03,630
Actually,

704
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:05,540
when I fought with Magistrate Du,

705
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,710
there was a moment

706
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,920
I saw Magistrate Du's eyes turned red.

707
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,980
But it was only for a moment.

708
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:12,120
I'm not sure.

709
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,480
I remember now.

710
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,180
In Jizhou,

711
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:16,350
when the leader of the Sacred Blood Sect

712
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,480
fought the Black Wood Human-shaped Sword,

713
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,270
he once said

714
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,770
he used the Soul-stealing Nail on the Sword.

715
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,880
When Magistrate Du interrogated me in prison,

716
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,200
he asked about the whereabouts of the Sword.

717
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,060
He said Lord Duan needed it.

718
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,610
In that case,

719
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:33,340
Magistrate Du must have something to do with the Sacred Blood Sect.

720
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,150
But if Magistrate Du really belongs to the Sacred Blood Sect,

721
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:38,030
why isn't Ruoyun acting strange?

722
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,260
Although Magistrate Du is her father,

723
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,810
he wouldn't tell Ruoyun everything.

724
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,590
I'd rather believe that...

725
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,740
she knows nothing.

726
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,300
I'm not waiting anymore.

727
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,230
I don't care if Magistrate Du

728
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,930
is the leader of the Sacred Blood Sect.

729
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:53,680
As long as he can use the Blood Technique,

730
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,640
he is our enemy.

731
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,330
Tu Jia.

732
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,320
you should make an excuse to kill Gu Qingqiao tomorrow

733
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,750
and invite Magistrate Du here.

734
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:01,710
Let's go to another dungeon

735
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,550
that can have traps set up.

736
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,810
Yes, My Lord.

737
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:10,950
My Lord.

738
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,610
Please leave the mansion and hide.

739
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:16,560
They seem to suspect my identity.

740
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,500
How?

741
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,610
My trip to the Duan family today is quite strange.

742
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,450
Everyone seems to be testing me.

743
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,470
Are you scared?

744
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,920
I don't want to implicate you.

745
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,090
My Lord,

746
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,390
you are our hope.

747
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,290
Don't worry.

748
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,390
There's no need for me to hide anymore.

749
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,760
You mean...

750
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,640
Tomorrow,

751
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,180
I'll enter the Duan Residence as a Priest

752
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,900
and I'll bring Gu Qingqiao out.

753
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,470
Why are you here?

754
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:50,290
How's the investigation going?

755
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,580
I'm worried about you

756
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,620
so I came here.

757
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,950
Why don't you go back to your room?

758
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,030
No need.

759
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,810
We need to put on a full show.

760
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,510
If Magistrate Du comes to break into the prison

761
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,470
and finds out I'm not here,

762
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,510
we'll be exposed.

763
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:05,050
How are you doing

764
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,370
recently?

765
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,380
I'm fine.

766
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,430
I eat well and sleep well.

767
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,410
Although I look like this,

768
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,710
these are all painted by Tu Jia.

769
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:15,770
I can wipe them off.

770
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,050
Your brother's attitude

771
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,900
towards me has improved a lot.

772
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,150
Brother.

773
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:26,420
You're here too.

774
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,680
I'm worried about Qiao

775
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,890
so I came here.

776
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:33,810
For me?

777
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,910
Lord Duan, you came here in the middle of the night

778
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:38,190
to give me a blanket?

779
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,270
It's cold here.

780
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,050
It's to prevent you from catching a cold.

781
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:42,210
Thank you.

782
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,570
Lord Duan,

783
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,970
please say what's on your mind.

784
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,910
I want to apologize to you

785
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,400
for my reckless behavior.

786
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,600
If you want any compensation,

787
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,110
just let me know.

788
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,100
I want a mattress,

789
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,830
a pillow and a bowl of braised pork.

790
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,700
You'd better give me another plate of peanuts.

791
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,690
I promise you.

792
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,770
Once the Sacred Blood Sect is settled,

793
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:08,170
everything will be over.

794
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,429
I'll give you

795
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,520
everything.

796
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,760
Qiao.

797
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,130
Do you really just want a blanket

798
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,550
pillow, braised pork,

799
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:23,159
and peanuts?

800
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,010
You and your brother are so alike.

801
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:29,250
Typical straight man.

802
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,070
I...

803
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:32,980
Actually, I want a lot.

804
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,949
I hope everyone around me

805
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:36,170
can be safe and happy.

806
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,900
You,

807
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:41,409
my father, Dongxi, Da

808
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,679
and the Duan family.

809
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,000
As long as you're doing well,

810
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,340
I'll be satisfied.

811
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,969
My Lord, everything is arranged.

812
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,370
Go to the Du Residence in person.

813
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:54,100
Tell them I'm going to kill Gu Qingqiao

814
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,429
and you tried to stop me.

815
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,020
Send someone to redeem Qingfeng Restaurant

816
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,310
and return it to Mr. Gu.

817
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:07,950
Yes.

818
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,630
Report!

819
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:11,840
My Lord.

820
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,400
The Priest is here.

821
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,310
Priest?

822
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,420
Mr. Lu.

823
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:20,080
Sorry for not welcoming you.

824
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,610
You're welcome, Lord Duan.

825
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:26,770
What brings you here today, Mr. Lu?

826
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,090
Now three of the four noble families have died out.

827
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,700
The Alliance of the Noble Families only exists in name.

828
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,370
The Palace Lord ordered me to collect the Order of the Noble Families.

829
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,620
I see.

830
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:42,750
The Divine Palace is well-informed indeed.

831
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,720
Qi,

832
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
get the Order of the Noble Families.

833
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:46,780
Yes.

834
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:54,430
Thanks to your reminder,

835
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,720
we knew how to guard against the Sacred Blood Sect.

836
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,110
Fate and reincarnation.

837
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:58,970
The Palace Lord

838
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:01,410
just told you the Heaven's Way he saw.

839
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,390
The Heaven's Way is fixed.

840
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,990
No one can change it.

841
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,720
Lord Duan, please remember this.

842
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,310
Thank you for your advice.

843
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,400
Actually, I came here today

844
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,390
to ask you for a personal favor.

845
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,480
Go ahead.

846
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:18,020
I have a friend in your mansion now.

847
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,350
I know she's in trouble

848
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,290
so I came to visit her.

849
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,820
Who is this friend of yours?

850
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,280
Gu Qingqiao.

851
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:35,140
I'm exhausted.

852
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:37,800
Why hasn’t Magistrate Du come?

853
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:38,650
Miss Gu.

854
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:40,810
Miss Gu.

855
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:42,040
The Priest is here.

856
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,020
Lu Zizheng?

857
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:44,850
What is he doing here?

858
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,890
Is he here to save me?

859
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:47,890
I'm not sure.

860
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,140
But Master is talking to him.

861
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,630
Mr. Qi thinks its out of place,

862
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,620
so he asked me to tell you.

863
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,750
Why did he have to come

864
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,830
at this moment.

865
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,880
I think he’s here to cause trouble for me.

866
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,120
Miss Gu, our plan...

867
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,640
Should we hide it from him?

868
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,940
The Divine Palace doesn't care about the world.

869
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:07,900
I didn't expect that you would have friends in the mortal world.

870
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,620
Gu Qingqiao is the Star of Rebellion.

871
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,350
She's not considered a mortal.

872
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,210
Would it be possible

873
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,680
for me to see her?

874
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:16,700
Well...

875
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,180
I won't interfere with the Duan family's family matters.

876
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,120
I just want to

877
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,870
to fulfill my friend's wish.

878
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,780
Lord Duan,

879
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:30,930
I want to

880
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:32,880
to talk to Gu Qingqiao alone.

881
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,540
I'm afraid that's inappropriate.

882
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,160
I'm a Priest from the Divine Palace.

883
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,440
Don't you trust the Divine Palace?

884
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,700
I don't mean that.

885
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,230
The Divine Palace have given us guidance,

886
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,300
of course I trust you.

887
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,960
Please help yourself, Mr. Lu.

888
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:48,940
Gu Qingqiao.

889
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:51,460
Why did you do this to yourself again?

890
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,990
I don't know.

891
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,380
Well,

892
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,260
it's a coincidence.

893
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,470
Fortunately, I'm the Priest of the Divine Palace.

894
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:01,230
I can come here to see you.

895
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,250
That's great.

896
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,170
Gu Qingqiao.

897
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,430
Do you know Duan Yan wants to kill you

898
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,820
in order to eliminate future troubles?

899
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,530
Did he tell you that?

900
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,320
Yes, he told me himself.

901
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:12,950
Of course.

902
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,730
If Lord Duan didn't tell Lu Zizheng about the plan,

903
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,490
I shouldn't expose it.

904
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,870
I'm so unlucky.

905
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,380
I don't know who I've offended.

906
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,020
After Duan Yu left,

907
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,990
Duan Yan kept acting against me.

908
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,470
You are a lucky person.

909
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,590
I rushed back to Changqing as soon as I heard the news.

910
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,270
I'm afraid I'm the only one who can save you now.

911
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,910
Now?

912
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,310
There are so many guards at the door.

913
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,510
What if...

914
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:41,100
you are also killed?

915
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:42,070
What should we do?

916
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,870
Of course I won't get you out now.

917
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:45,150
But it won't take long.

918
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,340
You just need to cooperate with me.

919
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,760
When you reach the Divine Palace,

920
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,130
even if Duan Yan wants to kill you,

921
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:51,130
he can't do it.

922
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,390
Forget it.

923
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:56,450
It's not appropriate

924
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,280
to use your identity for that.

925
00:38:58,990 --> 00:38:59,880
Mr. Lu,

926
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,110
your room is ready.

927
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,980
You don't need to think about anything else.

928
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,270
You just need to listen to me.

929
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:08,270
I'll get you out when the time comes.

930
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,340
Okay.

931
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,600
We'll talk about it

932
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,220
when the time comes.

933
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,020
Mr. Lu.

934
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,150
Please.

935
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:34,250
What's wrong?

936
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,950
I cut my hand accidentally.

937
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,760
I'm fine.

938
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,470
Blood.

939
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,370
It's okay, My Lady.

940
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,000
My Lady.

941
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,070
What's wrong?

942
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:04,950
What's wrong?

943
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,330
Stay away from me.

944
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:08,350
My Lady.

945
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,090
Can't you hear me?

946
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:10,810
Get out.
