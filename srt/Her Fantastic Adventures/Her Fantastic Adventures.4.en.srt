I've turned the Glory of Meat

into a genuine old brand.

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,630

00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,230

Sorry, you can't go in.

It's a mess here,

00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,860
but you still dare to refuse guests.

00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:39,910
Is this

37
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,100
how Qingfeng Restaurant treat guests?

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,180
Everyone is working enthusiastically.

51
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,320
Please.

52
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,910
It's so dirty here.

53
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,030
How can we sit here?

54
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,940
We have private rooms upstairs.

55
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,050
Then lead the way.

56
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:15,730
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,810
You need to top up first before you go to the private room upstairs.

58
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:19,860
What is it?

59
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,079
Just transfer your money to our card...

60
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,829
To our our account.

61
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,850
Then you won't need to bring silver next time.

62
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,230
You can deduct the payment from your account.

63
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,190
Good idea.

64
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,710
Customers who deposit money become regular patrons.

65
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,940
If I don't deposit,

66
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,550
how can I go to the private room you mentioned?

67
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,950
If you don't deposit,

68
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,710
you can only sit in the lobby.

69
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,570
The Chairman of the Changqing Chamber of Commerce

70
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,890
is a friend of mine.

71
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,410
Of course I have to make him proud for the food festival.

72
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,210
Can you give me a fair price?

73
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,220
You are well informed.

74
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:49,740
Fine.

75
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,180
For the sake of the Chairman,

76
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,320
you can become our gold member

77
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,480
with a deposit of three thousand taels.

78
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,510
You can then dine in the private room upstairs.

79
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,670
That's so expensive.

80
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,310
Are you trying to rip us off?

81
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,620
You're wrong.

82
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,550
The more distinguished a person is,

83
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,700
the more she should enjoy premium service.

84
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,090
Others need to deposit

85
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,440
at least five thousand taels.

86
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,600
Is that fair enough?

00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,600

88
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,000
Deposit three thousand taels.

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,700
I will come back another day to taste the food.

91
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,390
I like a straightforward person like you.

92
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,040
Waiter, take the payment.

93
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:18,860
OK.

94
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,540
Young Miss.

95
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,540
Did you quote the wrong price?

96
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,560
Wrong?

97
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,660
I think I quoted too low.

98
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,960

100
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,390
in the name of Chairman Duan,

101
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,580
the deposit starts at

102
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,840
three thousand taels.

103
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,180
My Lady,

104
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,170
people of Qingfeng Restaurant don't know the rules.

105
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,830
How dare they speak to you like that?

106
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,460
They are just people

107
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,180
who work for Brother Duan Yu.

108
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:42,870
It doesn't matter.

109
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,420
My Lady, you are truly wise.

110
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,510
Yuanhua.

111
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:46,850
Tell me.

112
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,210
I became a member of Qingfeng Restaurant.

113
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,820
Brother Duan Yu will surely

114
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,060
dine with me

115
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,630
during the food festival, right?

116
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,690
That's not enough.

117
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,850
I think Young Master Duan should also invite you to enjoy the lanterns

118
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,110
and the moon together.

119
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:00,750
What a sweetheart.

120
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,940
Let's go to the bookstore

121
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,160
to see if Mr. Si's new book is published.

122
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,020
Pure love.

123
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:09,530

Hurry up.

129
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,810

132
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,840
What do you think?

133
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,140
Mr. Si's works

134
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,420
are always top-notch.

135
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,380
Wait here.

136
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,540
I'll go get the money.

137
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,540
The usual price.

138
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,770
Three hundred taels.

139
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,580
Watch your step.

140
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,570
Why isn't the manager here?

141
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,250
It's fine.

142
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,680
Let's take a look inside.

143
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,790
There are thousands of writers,

144
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,340
but Mr. Si's love stories

145
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,540
are the most captivating.

146
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,780
My Lady.

147
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,550
You really like Mr. Si.

148
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,300
Nonsense.

149
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,070
Brother Duan Yu is the only one in my heart.

150
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,950
But I do admire

151
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,140
and respect Mr. Si a lot.

152
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,130
My Lady.

153
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,540
Are Mr. Si's books really that good?

154
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,100
Most ordinary storybooks are similar.

155
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,980
I just read them to kill some time.

156
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,020
Mr. Si's stories are the most authentic.

157
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,990
Although they are all romance series,

158
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,500
romance is just the surface.

159
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:34,040
The characters have passionate and sensitive hearts.

160
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,940
As they say, "Love once begun,

161
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,190
wherever it goes,

162
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,540
will never end."

163
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,940
In my opinion,

164
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,400
he writes sensitively that no one can match.

165
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:45,659
Who?

166
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:47,820
Who is there?

167
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,110
I found it, Yuanhua.

169
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,659
I've been waiting for it.

170
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:57,820
Great.

171
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,480
Manager.

172
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,300
I'll take this book.

173
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:02,740
How much is it?

174
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,270
Three...

175
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,180
One tael.

176
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,310
You didn't even see it.

177
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,440
Yuanhua, pay for it.

178
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,060
Are you...

179
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,660
Are you new here?

180
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,200
I put the money here.

181
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,350
My Lady.

182
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,260
Mr. Si.

183
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,920
The money is ready for you.

184
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:22,990
Well.

185
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,250
I lost the book.

186
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,020
Lost?

187
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,200
How could you lose the original book?

188
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,900
I lost my heart.

189
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,360
Qi Chunjiao.

190
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,390
What did you say?

191
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,409
How dare you talk about retirement?

192
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:46,900
If your father hears this, he will be so heartbroken.

193
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,830
Mom, wake up.

194
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,060
My dad is gone.

195
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,060
He can't see what a failure I am.

196
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:54,650
What have I done wrong?

197
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,659
I have such a pitiful husband

198
00:07:57,659 --> 00:07:59,940
and an unfilial daughter.

199
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,590
What's wrong?

200
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,580
Why are you crying?

201
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,930
Tell me, who bullied you again?

202
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,700
Lu Zizheng.

203
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,270
Where exactly are we?

204
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,980
My Mom should have calmed down.

205
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,560
Let's go back.

206
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Gu Qingqiao.

207
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,050
Are you silly?

208
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,500
Gu Qingqiao?

209
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,280
Right, I'm Gu Qingqiao.

210
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,570
Gu Qingqiao.

211
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,340
Gu Qingqiao!

212
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,220
Shut up!

213
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,490
Gu Qingqiao. Gu Qingqiao.

214
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,260
You scared the living daylights out of me.

215
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:37,990
Are

216
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:38,919
you angry now?

217
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,530
Don't come to my room anymore.

218
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,130
Yes.

219
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,350
There will be fewer chances for me to come over.

220
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,420
Actually, I came

221
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,450
to talk to you.

222
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,660
Go ahead.

223
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,260
Did Miss Gu

224
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,260
already feel that you had doubts about her

225
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,340
in the mansion that day?

226
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,740
Propose a food festival to capture the Mantra cultists.

227
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,670
Could she also be deliberately hiding her identity?

228
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,960
I don't think so.

229
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,600
Should I tie her up

230
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,740
and check

231
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,200
if there's a mark on her ankle?

232
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,070
Nonsense!

233
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,580
Even if she is the Star of Rebellion,

234
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,730
we still need to consider it carefully.

235
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,450
If Gu Qingqiao really is the Star of Rebellion,

236
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,060
we can't alert her.

237
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,260
Miss Gu

238
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,660
looks like a good person.

239
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,720
When she sees you,

240
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,410
she always speaks softly and says silly things.

241
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,790
Let's get down to business.

242
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,040
Young Master, since you are proposing marriage,

243
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,710
we should find an official matchmaker

244
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,660
to exchange the eight characters for fortune-telling.

245
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,170
It could also indirectly help us find out

246
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,430
whether Miss Gu is the Star of Rebellion.

247
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,810
What did Duan Yu tell you before?

248
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,570
It's

249
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,630
none of your business.

250
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,620
Why are you so nosy?

251
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,580
Nosy?

252
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,020
Fine.

253
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,780
Cut the crap. Let me tell you.

254
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,340
Everything I do is because of you.

255
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,330
After they capture the Mantra cultists

256
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,020
and the officials relax their vigilance,

257
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,020
you can run away.

258
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,670
You're so disgusted with me.

259
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,550
Yes.

260
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:07,370
What?

261
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,050
You don't trust me?

262
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:09,990
You should know

263
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,220
that taking down Duan Yu and eradicating the Mantra cultists

264
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,540
are not as simple as you think.

265
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,230
Dreams never let those who work hard down.

266
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,500
So confident?

267
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,060
Of course.

268
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:23,950
Let's work hard together.

269
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,060
But you promised me.

270
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,380
After this,

271
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,990
give me the Nine-turn melodious bell.

272
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,450
Don't go back on your word.

273
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,110
What did you say just now?

274
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,100
What is it?

275
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,660
About the dreams.

276
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,170
You still need to have dreams.

277
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,720
What if they come true?

278
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,950
That's not what you said just now.

279
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,200
Anyway, the meaning is similar.

280
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:52,580
Then that's my advice.

281
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,860
Lu Zizheng, stop being so annoying to me.

282
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,620
I'll prick you with a needle.

283
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,050
You always mention Lu Zizheng.

284
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,880
Who exactly is Lu Zizheng?

285
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,690
If Duan Yu and Lu Zizheng

286
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,920
propose to you,

287
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,630
who will you marry?

288
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:14,850
Shut up!

289
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,460
Master. Young Miss.

290
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,770
I'll take my leave.

291
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,780
Take care.

292
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,100
Madam Zhang,

293
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,540
please see Mrs. Xu off.

294
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,310
You...

295
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,190
What's wrong?

296
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,930
She got your information.

297
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,280
It feels like my heart has been hollowed out.

298
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,180
Dad.

299
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,000
Don't be like this.

300
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,140
You...

301
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,190
Dad, what's wrong?

302
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:53,970
You...

303
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:57,930
Don't cry.

304
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,920
It's not good for others to see.

305
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:02,990
Qiao.

306
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,650
You finally called me Dad.

307
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,460
I thought something serious happened.

308
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,730
Just because I called you Dad?

309
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,790
Dad! Dad!

310
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,120
Dad!

311
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,220
Dad!

312
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,500
Young Master.

313
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,700
Why are you laughing?

314
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,530
I'm not laughing.

315
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,590
This pouch is quite ugly

316
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,040
and creative.

317
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:33,860
It is indeed unique.

318
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,650
But

319
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,030
Miss Gu said she has never done needlework

320
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,390
or embroidery.

321
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,820
She learned it recently.

322
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,900
Aren't you afraid

323
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,120
she is the Star of Rebellion?

324
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:50,430
Emotions can perhaps be disguised.

325
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:51,740
But her hands

326
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:53,830
cannot be changed.

327
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,090
Si.

328
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:57,130
Please bring it to Young Master Duan

329
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,230
Your hands...

330
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,870
It's okay.

331
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,540
I'll be glad if Young Master Duan likes it.

332
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,400
Then I'll thank Miss Gu on behalf of my Young Master.

333
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,940
This is My Lady's

334
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,780
first time embroidering a pouch.

335
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,380
Her eyes are almost blinded.

336
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,300
You must take good care of it for Young Master Duan.

337
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,500
I really hope she's not the Star of Rebellion.

338
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,820
How is the preparation for the food festival going?

339
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,940
I released the news in advance,

340
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,660
and informed Magistrate Du to send more manpower.

341
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,870
How about the arrangements at Qingfeng Restaurant?

342
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,090
The masters of Wuyi Guards have entered Qingfeng Restaurant

343
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,580
and been disguised as waiters and helpers.

344
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,110
Another team will enter as diners in advance.

345
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,320
Good.

346
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,210
Yuanhua.

347
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,620
Keep an eye on my Dad tomorrow.

348
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,050
We'll go to the food festival after he leaves.

349
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,640
Didn't Master tell you not to go?

350
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,360
So what, I'll go there anyway.

351
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,390
Go secretly.

352
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,630
Just don't let him see us.

353
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,340
My Lady.

354
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,400
Aren't you afraid that Young Master Duan will give you a hard time?

355
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,280
Who cares?

356
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,220
Shaoyi will go with me tomorrow.

357
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,890
When will Young Master Shaoyi return?

358
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:00,290
He said he'd return to Changqing tomorrow.

359
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:01,920
Young Master.

360
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,860
The Magistrate sent a message.

361
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,780
The Magistrate will personally
oversee the operation at Qingfeng Restaurant tomorrow.

362
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,690
Arrange someone to
closely monitor Miss Gu in secret.

363
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,500
If she acts suspiciously,
take her down immediately.

364
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:11,980
Yes.

365
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,140
I hope

366
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,180
everything goes well tomorrow.

367
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,700
The power of the Qilin Bow.

368
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,100
I assume everyone knows it well.

369
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,250
Once the Qilin Bow is drawn,

370
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,160
there will be casualties.

371
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:34,910
[Geng]

372
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,190
The climate is dry.

373
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,860
Be careful with fire safety.

374
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,370
The climate is dry.

375
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,330
Be careful with fire safety.

376
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,760
Did you find out?

377
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,720
It's here.

378
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,200
The Right Guardian

379
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,940
will come to Qingfeng Restaurant to surrender to the government tomorrow.

380
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,610
The sacred object will return to our sect.

381
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,470
Traitors will die as punishment.

382
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,720
Lu Zizheng,

383
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,500
do you know what a sense of unreality is?

384
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:03,660
Sense of unreality?

385
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,500
What is it?

386
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:09,050
It's the feeling of insecurity
when you can't see the future.

387
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,970
Anyway, it's a really bad feeling.

388
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,660
You are so melodramatic.

389
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,680
Melodramatic?

390
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,690
You know what melodramatic is now?

391
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:18,860
I learned it from you.

392
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,740
Good student. I'll reward you with a chicken leg.

393
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,800
You're leaving tomorrow.

394
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,410
What?

395
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,850
You don't want me to leave?

396
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,020
Tell me about him.

397
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,180
Lu Zizheng?

398
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,580
He's just like you.

399
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,380
Arrogant, narcissistic and annoying.

400
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,060
Since you dislike him so much,

401
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,790
why were you so happy

402
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:48,920
when you mistook me for him?

403
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,660
Didn't I tell you before?

404
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,420
I came from a faraway place.

405
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:53,890
I trust you for now.

406
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,800
In our place, there's a phrase

407
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,070
called childhood friends.

408
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,310
You grew up together.

409
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,680
You played together, fought over ice creams,

410
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,640
and fell down together.

411
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,500
You teased each other each time you met.

412
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,180
But,

413
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,100
whenever you encounter

414
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,500
happy or unhappy things,

415
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,180
you want to share it with them.

416
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,340
Although when you grow up,

417
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,030
you can't hang out together every day.

418
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,870
You're still close.

419
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,140
He's a lifelong good buddy.

420
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,680
So you organized such a big food festival

421
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,700
for me?

422
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,050
Not entirely.

423
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,120
It's not easy for my Dad to raise me up.

424
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,990
I have to make Qingfeng Restaurant prosperous.

425
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:28,640
You

426
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,620
are my old friend.

427
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,700
I have to help you get through it.

428
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,580
I didn't expect

429
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,670
you to be a loyal

430
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,660
fool.

431
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,620
Can't you stop being so mean?

432
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,950
I won't have a chance to treat you like this

433
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,420
in the future.

434
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:53,990
Gu Qingqiao.

435
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,230
Haven't you realized who I am?

436
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,500
Lu Zizheng?

437
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,910
L-Lu Zizheng.

438
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,670
I-Is it you?

439
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,220
It's me, idiot.

440
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,260
You chased after me all the way here
for the money I owe you?

441
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:08,970
You don't have to pay me back.

442
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,170
We're good friends.

443
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,230
I knew you weren't him.

444
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,530
Why are you such a liar?

445
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:15,540
Wait.

446
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:16,770
How did you figure it out?

447
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,060
I thought I did a good imitation.

448
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,819
Lu Zizheng is so stingy.

449
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:22,050
If I owed him money,
how could he not make me repay?

450
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,730
If he got me,

451
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,829
he will...

452
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,560
You won't understand.

453
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,940
I won't understand if you don't tell me.

454
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,450
You won't understand even if I tell you.

455
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,250
Forget it.

456
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,500
See you tomorrow.

00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,900

Shaoyi is back. Did you see him?

567
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,580
Young Master Shaoyi had something to do,
so he went back to the Duan Residence.

568
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,030
Where is Brother Duan Yu?

569
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,930
Young Master and Magistrate Du have something important to discuss.

570
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,690
Don't let my Dad know I'm here.

571
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,690
Mr. Ji,

572
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,710
have you ever been to the bookstore?

573
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,370
My lord, this way, please.

574
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:08,740
Let's go.

575
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,400
Magistrate Du.

576
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:17,680
Yes.

577
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,460
Magistrate Du.

578
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,580
Please take a look.

579
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,320
Confusing the matter.

580
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:34,020
Young Master Duan. It's like fishing in a barrel.

581
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:36,430
It's a wonderful plan.

582
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,600
Thank you.

583
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,110
Please.

584
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,660
Please.

585
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,470
Let go! Let go!

586
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:44,330
Disgusting!

587
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,220
They seem to have left.

588
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,470
Miss Du, if it weren't for me,

589
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,270
Magistrate Du would have found you.

590
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,870
Why are you acting so guilty?

591
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,810
I...

592
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:04,460
I...

593
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,170
Xing Si.

594
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,630
You nearly smothered me.

595
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,210
This...

596
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,460
Yuanhua, let's go.

597
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:09,990
I...

598
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:14,610
Look at this lamb.

599
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,950
Belly up.

600
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,190
So that it can be roasted thoroughly.

601
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:19,620
Yes.

602
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,780
This is called Sword Roast Whole Lamb.

603
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,260
It must be roasted for more than four hours.

604
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,920
Give me a sword.

605
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,440
Sword?

606
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:29,640
Right.

607
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,670
I forgot that you don't have swords.

608
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,540
Wait a moment, let me borrow one.

609
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,290
Are you practicing martial arts?

610
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,680
Lend me your sword.

611
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,340
I'm here to eat.

612
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,680
I don't have a sword.

613
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,320
Don't fool me.

614
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,610
I've been watching you for a while.

615
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:43,530
It's a buffet.

616
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,290
You took a plate of carrots and didn't take a bite.

617
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,460
We're on the same team. Hurry up.

618
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,180
Here we go.

619
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,760
Braised pork is ready.

620
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:00,660
First come, first served.

621
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,340
Braised pork is ready.

622
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,060
First come, first served. Line up and get it.

623
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,110
Line up.

624
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:07,980
Line up.

625
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,700
Line up.

626
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,340
There's more if it's not enough.

627
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,490
Don't be in a rush.

628
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,410
Go.

629
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,620
Right Guardian.

630
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:17,940
Go.

631
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:46,220
Murder! Murder!

632
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,740
Murder! Murder!

633
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:54,130
[Glory of Meat]

634
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:57,560
Step back!

635
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,180
Let us out!

636
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:58,880
Step back!

637
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,170
We've been tricked.

638
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,650
Mantra cultists.

639
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,250
You can't escape.

640
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,980
Don't let anyone escape!

641
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,010
Take him down!

642
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,970
It really worked.

643
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,270
Young Miss.

644
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,620
Don't worry.

645
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,250
Duan Yu can handle it.

646
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:20,270
Young Miss, aren't you going out?

647
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,390
You can go out.

648
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:39,860
He's here.

649
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:40,820
Move!

650
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,610
Mantra Sect.

651
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:00,990
-Dongxi.
-Young Miss.

652
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,630
Watch out!

653
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,000
Stop!

654
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:02,340
Move!

655
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:04,990
Move.

656
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,390
Let us go.

657
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,770
Otherwise,

658
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,000
I'll kill her.

659
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:14,730
Let her go!

660
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,660
Xing Si.

661
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,630
I can let you go.

662
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,680
But you have to let her go first.

663
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,180
Let's go.

664
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:29,460
Don't move.

665
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,380
Buyi.

666
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,800
[Duan]

667
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:22,560
Qiao.

668
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,100
You're hurt.

669
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,480
It's not my blood.

670
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,430
You scared me to death.

671
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,460
Are you okay?

672
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:33,800
Let me do it.

673
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,510
One escaped.

674
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,090
The rest took poison.

675
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,820
They're all dead.

676
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,220
The Wuyi Guards and soldiers sent out

677
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,050
are back.

678
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:48,230
They didn't find the Right Guardian.

679
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:51,210
Brother Duan Yu,

680
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:51,970
thank you.

681
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,020
You don't need to thank me.

682
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,680
I'm going to check on Miss Gu.

683
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,900
I also want to see her.

684
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:57,210
Miss Gu.

685
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,400
Are you okay?

686
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,440
Did you hurt your hand?

687
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,410
No.

688
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,580
It's not my blood.

689
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,570
I'm fine. Don't worry.

690
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:07,950
Thank you, Miss Gu.

691
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,660
It's okay. It's okay.

692
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,740
What do you think?

693
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,620
You're right.

694
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,480
So many people died during a meal.

695
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,770
Who will dare to come here again?

696
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,680
Yang Chunfeng.

697
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,730
Can you stop causing trouble here?

698
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:20,130
Wait.

699
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,490
How am I causing trouble?

700
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:23,690
I'm just seeking justice for everyone.

701
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,800
What qualifications does Qingfeng Restaurant have?

702
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,910
You made such flashy things

703
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:28,930
and deceived everyone here.

704
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,330
You were planning to kill us, weren't you?

705
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,450
What do you mean?

706
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,540
What do you mean?

707
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,920
Let's be honest.

708
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,770
Such a big deal.

709
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,180
Did you know it in advance?

710
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:36,840
-Right?
-I…

711
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,750
-Yeah.
-Look at him.

712
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,370
Give us an explanation.

713
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:41,700
You lured us here to kill us

714
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,780
and take all the money, right?

715
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,430
You're too heartless.

716
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,790
Can you take the responsibility?

717
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,560
Right. Can you take the responsibility?

718
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,480
Can you?

719
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,920
Yes, can you?

720
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:53,050
[Glory of Meat]

721
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,290
I'll

722
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,910
take this responsibility.

723
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,140
Stop.

724
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,100
Routine inspection.

725
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:06,660
Lift it.

726
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,620
Cover it.

727
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,220
Lift it.

728
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,900
Let him go.

729
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,470
In today's battle with the Mantra Sect,

730
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:40,480
I suspect someone took advantage to harm Young Master,

731
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,220
but I'm sure it wasn't a Mantra cultist.

732
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,090
I suspect it's related to Miss Gu.

733
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,740
According to the original plan,

734
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:50,540
security at the city gate will be relaxed tonight.

735
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:53,690
I want to see who will expose themselves first.

736
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:56,860
The real Right Guardian didn't show up today.

737
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,360
Based on Miss Gu's performance today,

738
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,380
she's not the Star of Rebellion.

739
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,070
What exactly is

740
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,530
Gu Qingqiao up to?

741
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:11,160
[Duan]

742
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,220
Lu Zizheng.

743
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:17,940
Lu Zizheng,

744
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,900
didn't you say that
as long as we catch the Mantra cultists,

745
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,900
you'd return my digital watch to me?

746
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,590
You're going back on your word?

747
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,900
Are you injured or just mute?

748
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,030
I'll count to three.

749
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,590
If you don't come out, I'm leaving.

750
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:39,850
One.

751
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:41,970
Two.

752
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:44,530
Three.

753
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:46,900
Why are you so impatient?

754
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,910
Can't you say something nice to me?

755
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:54,020
Are you okay?

756
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:56,170
Give me the digital watch.

757
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,630
You should leave quickly.

758
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,380
You're really heartless and ungrateful.

759
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,180
I went out of my way

760
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,330
to protect you during the day.

761
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,190
You went to Qingfeng Restaurant?

762
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:09,139
What a pity about the well-roasted lamb leg.

763
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:10,219
It's not a pity.

764
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,659
Next time,

765
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,830
I'll make you Sword Roast Whole Lamb.

766
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:19,960
Have you made up your mind?

767
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,010
Once you wear it,

768
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,929
you will no longer be you.

769
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:25,780
You are destined to be no longer ordinary.

770
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:28,900
And the world will be in turmoil.

771
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:56,139
The Nine-turn melodious bell is the sacred object of the Mantra Sect.

772
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:57,870
Don't let anyone know about it.

773
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,820
Otherwise, you might get yourself killed.

774
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,450
Especially beware of your future husband.

775
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:07,250
You can't live
without saying something bad about Duan Yu?

776
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,050
Do you think he really loves you?

777
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,350
You're infatuated.

778
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,610
Are you done?

779
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,580
As a man,

780
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,290
you're always nagging.

781
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,050
Anyway, I'm doing this for your own good.

782
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:19,780
Take good care of the sacred object and yourself.

783
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:22,500
I'll come to take it someday.

784
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,370
Take what?

785
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,100
What's in my hand is mine.

786
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,300
If you say so,

787
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,010
what's in my hand

788
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:34,940
is mine too.

789
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,010
Looks like you're quite the female hooligan.

790
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:53,870
I don't want to bully you anymore.

791
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:54,950
It's getting late.

792
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,340
See you.

793
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,530
What are you doing?

794
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:02,170
Aren't you going to give me five?

795
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:03,630
So childish.

796
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,970
You've rubbed off on me.

797
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:08,990
I'm leaving.

798
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,100
Wait.

799
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,200
What's your name?

800
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,850
Lu Zizheng.

801
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,210
I mean your real name.

802
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:20,430
Since Lu Zizheng is so important to you,

803
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,170
just call me Lu Zizheng.

804
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:24,570
Lu Zizheng.

805
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:27,010
You really are as arrogant as

806
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:29,570
Lu Zizheng.

807
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,050
Thank you for saving my life twice.

808
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:35,110
You also know I saved your life twice?

809
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,750
Don't think you're a cat with nine lives.

810
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:39,970
You are being hunted all over the place.

811
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,380
He finally left.

812
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,980
You jinxed it.

813
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,250
You're injured.

814
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,370
Qilin Arrow.

815
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,850
How did Duan Yu know you were here?

816
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:41,570
I should be the one asking you that.

817
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:43,130
I was careless.

818
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,860
He must have guessed you'd come,

819
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,430
so he deliberately revealed a weakness,

820
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,440
and followed me.

821
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,790
No, he followed you.

822
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,340
Let me lead them away first,

823
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,490
then you can slip away.

824
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:53,130
No.

825
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,750
Don't! Don't!

826
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:58,970
It's me.

827
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,920
I have no grudge against you.

828
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:03,730
What are you doing?

829
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:08,570
Don't! Don't!

830
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,540
It's me.

831
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,300
I have no grudge against you.

832
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,580
Don't act recklessly.

833
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,690
I heard that this lady

834
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,810
is Young Master Duan's fiancée.

835
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:20,080
I guess you don't want to

836
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:21,660
see her die here.

837
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:23,540
What do you want?

838
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:26,250
Tell your men to leave.

839
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:26,980
Leave.

840
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,530
Or I'll kill her.

841
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:30,350
Leave.

842
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:31,430
I don't want to die.

843
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,690
The drama needs to be real,

844
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:35,510
so that both of us can survive.

845
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,160
Young Master Duan.

846
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:39,710
Long time no see.

847
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,940
You are really annoying as always.

848
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:45,050
As the Right Guardian, you're threatening a woman.

849
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,930
It doesn't necessarily make you an honorable person.

850
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:49,260
Don't speak so harshly.

851
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,190
Likewise.

852
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,310
Let your men leave.

853
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:59,700
Miss Gu, don't be afraid.

854
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,280
You'll bleed slowly.

855
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:03,100
You won't die in a minute.

856
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,080
Leave.

857
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:06,900
Young Master.

858
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:07,470
Leave!

859
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:09,410
Leave!

860
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:10,370
Yes.

861
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:14,320
Don't play any tricks.

862
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:19,980
Her life is up to you.

863
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,610
If you don't care,

864
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,890
you can try whether your arrow is faster

865
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,620
or my dagger is faster.

866
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:31,060
See you.
