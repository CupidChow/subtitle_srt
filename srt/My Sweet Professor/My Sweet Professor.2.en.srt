2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:05,130
Hello, Mr. Huo.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,730
I'm your attending doctor,

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,400
Gao Yuan.

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:12,530
Eh?

6
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,330
You don't recognize me?

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,600
If you need anything, ring the bell.

8
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,300
A nurse will come over.

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,660
We're going to have a quiz.

10
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,270
The purpose is to test

11
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,260
what you've learned
in the last two years.

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,100
Don’t cheat.

13
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,360
Read the questions carefully.

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,000
Hey.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,860
Guess who I’ve just seen?

16
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,160
Huo Shang.

17
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,200
How do you know?

18
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,600
That's right.

19
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,700
He's in your neurosurgical ward.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,160
He seems to own a business now.

21
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,500
He's even got an assistant.

22
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,260
Can I talk to you about something?

23
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,360
He has a fracture in his arm.

24
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,700
The nerve is not impaired.

25
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:25,560
Um...

26
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,530
Just tell me what you want.

27
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,800
Your Orthopedics should take over him
from now on.

28
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,530
No.

29
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,060
I give you this topped-up
canteen service card.

30
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,200
Oh.

31
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,330
Well...

32
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,100
Mr. Huo,

33
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,600
how do you feel today?

34
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,400
Not bad.

35
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,200
Oh,

36
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,100
your BP is a bit low.

37
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,380
(President Gu)

38
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,460
Hi, President Gu.

39
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,800
OK, sir.

40
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,760
I'll switch back with Huangfu Ren
tomorrow.

41
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,830
Good night, sir.

42
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,200
Mr. Huo,

43
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,500
do you feel better today?

44
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,060
Yes.

45
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,260
It'd be better if someone didn't pretend
to be a stranger.

46
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,300
Dr. Gao, we were friends in school.

47
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,800
Am I that scary?

48
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,960
You are getting a lot better

49
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,000
and can leave the hospital in days.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,530
I have a headache.

51
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,230
I feel nauseous

52
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,100
and sick.

53
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,060
You're totally fine.

54
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,060
Maybe it's a mental problem.

55
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:11,860
Get well.

56
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,460
Call the nurse if you need anything.

57
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,080
Is this how you treat your old friend?

58
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,080
That really hurts,

59
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,680
Gao Yuan.

60
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,140
I thought

61
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,160
you'd hug me, crying,
since we hadn't met in years

62
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,260
and ask me how I had been.

63
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:31,610
Hey,

64
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,250
give me your phone number
if you don't mind.

65
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,100
