The riche brought breakfast.

8
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,280
Thank you.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,800
Sorry.

10
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,110
This is yours.

11
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,710
Hey.

12
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,070
What happened to my waist?

13
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,880
It hurts like hell.

14
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,280
I'm going to take an X-ray.

15
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,150
Dr. Huangfu.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,630
Don't be like Dr. Gao.

17
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,000
You live so far away.

18
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,800
And there is no one like Mr. Huo
sending you home every day.

19
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,030
You know what?

20
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,230
Gao Yuan did the same amount
of exercise as me last night.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,110
Maybe his waist was...

22
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,150
Do you

23
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,360
feel uncomfortable?

24
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,670
No.

25
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,550
What? You feel uncomfortable?

26
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,590
I'm fine.

27
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,670
But you did lots of work last night.

28
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,300
(Linquan First Hospital)

29
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,510
Pig's liver builds blood.

30
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,880
I got them from the canteen.

31
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,760
Well...

32
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,320
I drank a lot last night.

33
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,670
Yeah.

34
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,510
You did drink a lot.

35
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,590
How annoying.

36
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,150
You badger me every time you're drunk.

37
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,000
Thank goodness
Huo Shang took you home.

38
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,400
Huo Shang?

39
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,030
Yeah.

40
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,280
He sent you home last night.

41
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,400
You didn't send me home?

42
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:24,710
No.

43
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,550
He sent both of us home.

44
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,880
So your waist...

45
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,030
Don't get me started.

46
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,590
I don't know it's because
I'm old or something.

47
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,480
I just danced a little

48
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,230
and twisted my waist.

49
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,800
You don't know how much it hurt
in the morning.

50
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,110
Oh, right.

51
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,510
Did Huo Shang do something to you?

52
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,630
No.

53
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,230
That's good.

54
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,230
Hey.

55
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,280
Isn't it for me?

56
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,190
I just realized I haven't had lunch.

57
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,030
Hey.
