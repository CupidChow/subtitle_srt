2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:09,700
Hello?

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,280
Dr. Gao.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,560
Are you free this evening?

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,130
Let's have dinner tonight.

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,060
Huo Shang?

7
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:15,330
Mm.

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,300
I'm on duty tonight.
I'm afraid I won't have time.

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,020
Hey.

10
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,900
I'm at the door of your hospital.

11
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,300
And Dr. Gao,

12
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,500
I forgot to tell you.

13
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,460
I have a copy of your duty roster.

14
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,300
Are you ready, Dr. Gao?

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,300
Why hasn't he come down?

16
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,500
Dr. Gao.

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,860
Dr. Gao has left.

18
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,000
When did he leave?

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,260
About an hour ago.

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,500
Shoot. I forgot about the back door.

21
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,700
Gao Yuan.

22
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,930
I know you're in there.

23
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,500
How did you get in?

24
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,360
I came through the door.

25
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,400
Where did you get the key?

26
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,500
I didn't.

27
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,160
Huo Shang.

28
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,130
I'm begging you.

29
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,460
We have our own lives now.

30
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,060
You live your life

31
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,100
and I live mine.

32
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:53,380
Alright?

33
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,660
No.

34
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,100
Why are you avoiding me?

35
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,260
I'm not.

36
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,160
Don't you wanna know what I've
been through for the last eight years?

37
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,300
I don't.

38
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,200
I don't wanna know
what you've been through.

39
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,860
And I don't wanna know why you left.

40
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,790
Stop talking about the past.

41
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,440
I don't want to know anything
about what happened before.

42
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,200
Is that okay?

43
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,560
Listen to this question.

44
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,730
Which of the following statement
about human tissue fluid is wrong?

45
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,400
Option A.

46
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,700
Glucose from plasma

47
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,400
can enter skeletal muscle cells
through tissue fluid.

48
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,160
Wanna play Gobang?

49
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,130
There are so many questions left.

50
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,530
Can you hold on a little longer?

51
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,660
Option A must be right.

52
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,520
And Option B.

53
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,800
Carbon dioxide produced by
respiration metabolism of stem cells...

54
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,340
Do you wanna play?

55
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,330
Who goes first?

56
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:01,900
You.

57
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,250
♪ As long as you're here ♪

58
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,140
One more round.

59
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:20,100
♪ My heart pounds
every time when you're around ♪

60
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,900
You lost again.

61
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,560
No way, let's play again.

62
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,530
You're so smart,

63
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,100
but how can't you win me at Gobang?

64
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:34,800
Don't look down on me.

65
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,890
Let's play one more round.

66
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,600
If I win, you should study
all the questions with me.

67
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,400
Mm.

68
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,860
