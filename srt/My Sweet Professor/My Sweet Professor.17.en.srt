00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,820
(Ambulance)

3
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:11,540
President.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,510
Let me send you home.

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,100
(Three days later)

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,400
Get on the electrocar.
I'm taking you somewhere.

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:19,630
Where?

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,280
You'll know when you get there.

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,070
Let's go!

10
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:31,890
This is our school.

11
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:32,500
Yeah.

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,070
It's changed so much.
I almost don't recognize it.

13
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,840
Do you remember this place?

14
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,320
This is where we had evening classes.

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,670
No, this is the piano room.

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,000
That's where we had evening classes.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,320
The piano room is over here.

18
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,230
That's not right.

19
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:49,670
I remember the piano room is this way.

20
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,480
The basketball court is over here, see?

21
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,510
Yeah, it has always been the piano room.

22
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,040
Mr. Zhang.

23
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,370
Gao Yuan.

24
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,670
You always came top of the class.

25
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,320
Where are you working now?

26
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,550
I'm a doctor in the neurosurgery
department of Linquan Huayuan Hospital.

27
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,670
Good.

28
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,840
Do you know a colleague

29
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,670
who's good at hair transplant?

30
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,000
Ha ha ha.

31
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,360
Huo Shang.

32
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,800
Mr. Zhang, you still remember me.

33
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,920
Of course I do.

34
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,630
I remember you too well.

35
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,000
You're the only student I had

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,920
who didn't fill out an application.

37
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,960
Tell me, what are you doing now?

38
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,190
Uh, Mr. Zhang,
we still have something to do.

39
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,440
We gotta go.

40
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:37,300
Bye.

41
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,180
(Closed for maintenance)

42
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:45,880
I know what to do.

43
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:48,710
Hey, what are you doing?

44
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:49,590
Don't climb the handrail.

45
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:50,880
Run!
