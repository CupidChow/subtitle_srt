What the hell is this?

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:09,930
What do you mean by that?

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,100
Well,

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,800
is it

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,860
not good enough for you?

7
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:15,760
No.

8
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,900
Not even close.

9
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,530
It's not even worth my attention.

10
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:19,460
Huh.

11
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,260
Dong,

12
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,700
do you know what to do now?

13
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,460
Huo Shang, don't push it.

14
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,600
All right.

15
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,960
I'm just kidding.

16
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,000
Actually,

17
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I just want you to
walk me out of the hospital.

18
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,560
Walk you out?

19
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:32,930
Why should I?

20
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,400
You hate me, right?

21
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,930
Yes, I hate you.

22
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,300
I hate you just left without a word.

23
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,500
I hate you more when you came back.

24
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,700
Even more when you're
talking to me like a friend.

25
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,240
I was wrong.

26
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:48,980
But I came back, right?

27
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,760
You came back

28
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,000
so we should be friends again?

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,930
I still have your number.

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,160
I'll call you after I leave the hospital.

31
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,500
Look at the score you got.

32
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,330
How can you take
the big exams in the future?

33
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,800
I know your parents left early.

34
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,960
But if you can't get into college

35
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,860
and without a family to support you,

36
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,200
how can you survive?

37
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,000
What's more,

38
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,600
Other teachers told me
you slept in class.

39
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,330
If you're caught again,
you'll get a formal reprimand.

40
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,300
I got it, Mr. Zhang.

41
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,900
Okay, you can go now.

42
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,100
Concentrate more on your studies.

Hello.

45
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,960
I'm sorry. I'll be right there.

46
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,300
What's taking you so long?

47
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,800
You want to starve me to death, huh?

48
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,400
Look.

49
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,930
How can I eat this?

50
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,360
How do you want to fix this?

51
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,000
What about giving you
a bad review and a complaint?

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,630
Please don't.

53
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,730
I'll pay for it.

54
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,530
How much?

55
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,560
Sir, I have to go.
