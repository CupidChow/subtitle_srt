00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:06,430
Here.

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:07,560
This is for you.

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:09,460
Thanks.

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,100
And this one

6
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,300
is for the boy sitting next to you.

7
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,600
No.

8
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,060
Do it yourself if you want to.

9
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,500
Come on, Gao Yuan.

10
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,060
We're childhood friends.

11
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,600
If you don't help me, who will?

12
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,300
Right?

13
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,460
I'm begging you, please.

14
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,060
Please.

15
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,400
This one's for him.

16
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:28,090
Don't mix those up.

17
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:28,600
Bye.

18
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:29,460
Hey.

19
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:42,400
This is…

20
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:44,860
What?

21
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,040
You don't want it?

22
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,500
I do.

23
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,900
I like it.

24
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,860
Okay, let's talk about the papers
we handed out yesterday.

25
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,960
Sir,

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,100
I didn't bring it to school.

27
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,960
Then, I'm going to help you
correct your problem.

28
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,600
Who else didn't bring their papers?

29
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,330
Go stand at the back.

30
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,060
Don't worry.

31
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,130
Just sit tight.

32
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,500
Gao Yuan.

33
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,400
Is there a question on Huo Shang's face?

34
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,460
All right. Class dismissed.

35
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,330
Thank you.

36
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,000
It's okay.

37
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,300
Gao Yuan.

38
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,490
Hurry up.

39
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,190
Did you give him his drink?

40
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,160
How did he react?

41
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,830
I did.

42
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,400
He said he liked it.

43
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,360
Really?

44
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,160
Yeah.

45
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,460
Oh.

46
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,460
Dr. Gao.

47
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,760
Here.

48
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,100
Please take it.

49
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,200
What's this?

50
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,930
Mr. Huo asked me to give it to you

51
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,800
to thank you for
taking care of him these days.

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,900
Please accept it.

53
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,000
It’s a token of appreciation..

54
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,530
Give it back to him

55
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,300
I don't need it.

56
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,400
I'm afraid you have to do it yourself.

57
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,530
What the hell is this?

58
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,260
What do you mean by that?

59
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,340
