Crap.

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,190
I forgot.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,190
Huo Shang, where's my car?

6
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,360
Was it towed away by the traffic police?

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,930
Every time I run into you,
nothing good happens.

8
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,460
You should stay away from me.

9
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,110
What? You didn't tow my car away?

10
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:26,450
They don't have your car?

11
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:28,190
Hey.

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,480
Don't worry.

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,760
To say sorry to you,

safe and sound.

Let's go.

19

Go.

20
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:53,480
Hey, riche.

Ah.

23
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,190
My limbs are weak

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,550
and I've been feeling

25
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,590
dizzy and tired these days.

26
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,630
But I've still got piles of work to do.

27
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,880
Well...

28
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,480
I'll do them for you.

How do you like your new car?)

Dr. Gao must be thrilled.

46
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,880
You didn't see it.

47
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,480
I decorated the car perfectly.

48
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,760
(Gao Yuan)
I'm sure it shows your good taste.

Hey.

I need you to give me
back my car right now!

52

He yelled at you?

53
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,880
Don't worry, Mr. Huo.

54
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,270
I have a better way.

55
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,280
Hey.

56
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:19,840
I'll give you a ride.

57

No need.

58
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,150
The subway station isn't far.

59
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,800
Eh.

60
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,880
Mr. Huo.

61
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,930
What do you want exactly?

62

I still have to go to work.

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,800
Get in the car.

64
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,360
Isn't it cozier than the subway?

65
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,960
If you didn't take away my car,

66
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,070
I wouldn't need to take the subway.

67
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,070
But you didn't accept the new car.

68
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,400
Come on, Huo Shang,

69
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,230
you weren't like this before.

70
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,630
How did you become like this?

71
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,480
What happened?

72
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,440
What am I like now?

You're like a nouveau riche.

74

Nouveau riche?

75
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,840
Do I look like that?

76
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,880
I'm the CEO.

77
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,360
Hey.

78
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,280
