00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,860
Hi, Dr. Gao.

(Gao Yuan)

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,400
Only Dr. Gao can park his car here.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,060
That's right.

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,400
Hey, Dong.

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,000
(Huo Shang)
I sent you a message.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,130
Find this person for me.

9
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,900
Dr. Gao, there's a car accident
on the flyover.

10
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,260
Two were seriously injured
and one slightly.

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,600
They're on the way to the hospital.

12
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,760
You need to get prepared.

13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,200
OK.

14
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,000
This is breakfast.

15
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,330
You can have some.

16
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,530
Hey.

17
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,900
(Huangfu Ren)
I bet Xiaorou has a crush on you.

18
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,260
Soft-boiled eggs again?

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,260
Every day for 8 years.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,730
Mr. Huo, you're injured.

21
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,130
Let me carry you upstairs.

22
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,460
Just a bone fracture.

23
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,800
I'm fine.

24
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,200
(Pan Dong)
This is not a minor injury.

25
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,700
I'll arrange the best doctor for you

26
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,860
and put you in the best ward.

27
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,960
I can't stay in the ward.

28
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,360
Just get me a splint.

29
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,530
But your arm...

30
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,600
I'm injured in the arm, not the leg.

31
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:16,800
Don't be so nervous.

32
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,400
Go register.

33
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,060
OK.

34
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,560
OK.

35

Gao Yuan, Gao Yuan.

40
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,160
Show me how to solve this problem.

41
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,860
Hey, man.

42
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,130
You bumped into me.

43
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,560
Oh.

44
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,160
What's your attitude?

45
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
What are you doing?

46
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,600
We have a new classmate today.

47
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,730
This is Huo Shang.

48
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,560
All right.

49
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:17,830
Huo Shang,

50
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,600
that's the class monitor, Gao Yuan.

51
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,900
Your seat is next to him.

52
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,700
Yes, sir.

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,930
Mr. Huo, I've made an appointment.

54
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,400
Let's apply splints for you.

55
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,200
I can go by myself.

56
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,460
Go to the nurse and go through
the admission procedures.

57
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,160
I want no one but this doctor.

58
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,860
Admission procedures?

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,650
Dr. Gao,

60
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,600
This next patient is transferred
from Orthopedics.

61

Bone fracture in the right arm.

00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,700
The patient is 26

63
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,960
and named Huo Shang.

64
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,900
Dr. Gao, where are you going?

65
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,360
I'm going to the restroom.

Liang Qi,

74
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,530
do you know where Huo Shang is?

75
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,200
I can't get in touch with him now.

76
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,400
(Liang Qi)
He transferred

77
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,200
and moved away.

78
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,260
Maybe he'll never come back.

79
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,500
I'm going abroad for college tomorrow.

80
