2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:06,920
President.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,150
Mm.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,800
Gao Yuan, there's an opportunity
to go abroad and study.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,920
We decided that you should go.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,070
What's wrong?

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,190
I just don't know what to say.

8
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:18,710
Well,

9
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,030
if you don't have any problem with this,
go and get prepared.

10
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,360
You're leaving next week,

11
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,360
and go to Germany
and study for two years.

12
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,230
I believe you.

13
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:25,590
President,

14
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,070
I need some time to think about this.

15
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,000
Why?

16
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,760
Think about what?

17
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,280
This opportunity is very hard to get.

18
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,400
If you let this one go,

19
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,320
you may not get an opportunity
like this again.

20
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,030
I know.

21
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,190
So I need some time
to think carefully about this.

22
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:39,440
And ...

23
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:41,360
This ...

24
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,230
Fine. Think about it first.

25
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,320
Let me know your answer.

26
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,230
Well, thank you for
trying my husband's outfit.

27
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,590
He was just too busy.

28
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,550
He's gonna buy you dinner
when he comes back.

29
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,000
What's wrong?

30
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,230
The hospital wants me to go to Germany
and study for two years.

31
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,670
I'll leave in half a month.

32
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,630
I might miss your wedding.

33
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:05,000
Argh.

34
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,840
Fine.

35
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,280
Then we'll say goodbye to you
at the airport when you leave.

36
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,280
I'm so sorry.

37
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,000
The exam is finally over,
and we're finally free!

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,840
That's right!

39
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,110
Well,

40
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,150
have a drink.

41
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,800
Come on.

42
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,480
Cheers!

43
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,570
Can I sing a song with you?

44
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,310

OK.

69
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,280
Hey, you're so pretty.

70
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:41,920
Don't touch me.

71
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,510
Add me to your contacts on WeChat.

Go away.
