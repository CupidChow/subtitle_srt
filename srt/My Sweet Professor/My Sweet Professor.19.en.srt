2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,920
Escort Mr. Huo out.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,360
Don't go too far, You Qing.

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,670
Huo Shang,

5
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:10,000
these are compensation claims
from residents

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,760
who live in the place
that you illegally purchased.

7
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,320
You don't work here anymore.

8
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,190
You have to take the responsibility
on your own.

(Gao Yuan)

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,230
Hey!

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,440
What are you doing?

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,920
Nothing.

13
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,000
Why hasn't Huo Shang
picked you up lately?

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,630
You look so tired.

15
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,110
Have some rest.

16
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,230
Spam messages again.

17
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,360
-Time to pay the loan for your house?
-So sick of it.

18
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,030
That's right.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,800
Text messages.

20
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,700
(Gao Yuan)

21
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,000
Mr. Huo,

22
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,550
why is Dr. Gao calling me?

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,800
What should I do?

24
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:11,480
Leave it alone.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,920
Are you really not going to talk to him?

26
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,590
Do you know why I didn't contact him

27
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,440
in the past eight years?

28
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,230
I used to go to his college
and look for him.

29
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,190
I saw him from afar.

30
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,440
He was even more popular at that time
than he was in high school.

31
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,230
But I didn't even have a job

32
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:32,840
for some reason,

33
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,800
until one day Mr. Chen found me

34
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,630
and brought me back to Qingde Group.

35
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,630
Uncle Chen.

36
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,110
You'll be with me in the future.

37
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,960
Your parents died because of me.

38
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,960
I'll take care of you.

39
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,190
Let's go.

40
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,030
Thank you, Uncle Chen.

41
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:52,840
Uncle Chen.

42
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,070
You came.

43
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,630
Huo Shang,

44
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,150
I have a set of books
called Red Merchant.

45
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,930
Take your time and read them.

46
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,630
They're worthy of your time and effort.

47
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,480
Your career will benefit
from them greatly.

48
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,230
No problem.

49
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,600
Thank you, Uncle Chen.

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,800
You can excuse yourself now.

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,110
I'm still down and out now,
just as I was eight years ago.

52
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,190
I can't take care of him.

53
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,440
I can only be a burden of him,

54
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,440
right?

55
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,400
But I believe real friends

56
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,960
won't be bothered by these things.

57
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,190
That's all. Stop now.

58
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,320
Keep a close eye on those

59
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,550
who were in charge of purchases,

60
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,800
especially on their contact
with You Qing.

61
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,670
Are you suspecting them of...

62
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,630
Yeah.

63
