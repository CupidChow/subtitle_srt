=Episode 23=

2
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,470
You dropped this

3
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,480
yesterday.

4
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,710
And,

5
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,530
when you were in custody

6
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,500
eight years ago,

7
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,860
Huo Shang actually talked to me.

8
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,420
Hey, you're so pretty.

9
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,120
Add me to your contacts on WeChat.

10
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,500
Don't touch me. Go away!

11
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,460
Liang Qi!

12
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,660
What are you doing?

13
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,380
It's

14
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,760
none of your business!

15
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,960
Gao Yuan!

16
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,330
Mind your own business!

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,600
Go away!

18
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,340
Leave me alone!

19
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,500
What should I do? Help me!

20
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,360
Liang Qi,

21
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,800
no matter who asks you about this,

22
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,200
just tell them it's me.

23
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,300
In fact,
that punk was not hurt at that time.

24
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,060
He just fainted.

25
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:49,960
But he called some other punks

26
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,980
and claimed that they were gonna
take their revenge on us.

27
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,470
Huo Shang knew about this.

28
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,810
He hit him badly.

29
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,000
He was also seriously wounded.

30
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,190
Hello? 110?

31
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,130
I need to turn myself in.

32
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,530
The reason why you were free to go

33
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,900
(Hexi Detention Center)
was that the police found out later

34
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,700
that you didn't hit that man.

35
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,860
It's OK. It's all over.

36
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:11,970
Mom.

37
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:12,340
Mm.

38
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,460
Is this really over?

39
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,930
Rest assured. It's all over.

40
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:16,650
Come here.

41
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,200
Huo Shang turned himself in

42
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,130
later.

43
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,660
Hey, Dr. Gao.

44
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,400
Mr. Huo sends me to give you this.

45
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,960
Congratulations on your wedding.

46
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,600
In fact,

47
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,060
there's some reason
that Mr. Huo didn't answer your calls.

48
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,960
He was afraid
that he might be your burden.

49
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,900
Take me to see him. Now.

50
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,700
Get in my car.

51

52
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,820

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,990
