00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,060
Hey,

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,660
give me your phone number
if you don't mind.

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:12,900
Gao Yuan,

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,160
let's go home together after school.

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,460
What are you doing?

8
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,200
I don't like it.

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,760
Yet you can't toss it around.

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,800
That's my stuff.

11
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,180
I'm talking to you.

12
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,560
What's your problem?

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,600
Eh, eh, eh.

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,290
Sorry, sorry.

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,460
I didn't do it on purpose.

16
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,660
I'm so sorry.

17
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,300
Let's go.

18
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,460
OK.

19
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,500
Oh, come on.

20
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,060
Ignore this guy.

21
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,330
It was my fault.

22
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,000
That's your new desk mate?

23
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,260
Yeah.

24
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,300
Well,

25
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,560
what's his name?

26
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,800
Hey, tell me quickly.

27
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:05,930
Huo Shang.

28
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,460
Nice name too.

29
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,560
What's with that look?

30
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,760
Leave me alone.

31
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,100
You're not thinking straight.

32
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:12,460
Gao Yuan.

33
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,000
Good morning, Mr. Huo.

34
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,600
Dong,

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,600
what are you doing here?

36
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,900
I told you not to come.

37
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,560
Oh,

38
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,960
I have something to report to you.

39
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,760
It's about the acquisition
of the wetland park.

40
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,330
Several families want to back out

41
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,560
and threaten to file a lawsuit
in the company.

42
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,600
Then what?

43
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,560
Mr. Chen's health is getting worse.

44
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,900
The successor of the company

45
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,060
is either you or You Qing.

46
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,260
I am afraid him to get something on you.

47
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,100
So I rushed over to discuss it with you.

48
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,260
Mr. Chen...

49
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,130
Mr. Huo,

50
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,660
how do you feel uncomfortable today?

51
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,700
Dong,

52
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,360
go back first.

53
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,160
Yes, sir.

54
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,760
Today,

55
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,860
I feel terrible.

56
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,300
It's bad.

57
00:01:58,730 --> 00:01:59,730
How?

58
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,100
It's in here.

59
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,060
Discomfort in the heart.

60
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,130
I'll transfer you to Cardiac Surgery.

61
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,460
Don't.

62
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,730
Compared to the heart,

63
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,800
I feel worse here.

64
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,560
Don't you want to know

65
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,360
what I've done in the last 8 years?

66
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,130
No, I don't.

67
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,100
You're my patient.

68
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,860
After you're discharged from hospital,

69
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,300
we won't have to see each other anymore.

70
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,330
You want me out of the hospital
that badly, huh?

71
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,730
OK.

72
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,200
Your wish is coming true.

73
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,200
I'm leaving soon.

74
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,530
There are some emergencies

75
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,100
I need to attend to.

76
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,560
When will you leave?

77
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,730
The nurse will help you with the bills.

78
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,260
