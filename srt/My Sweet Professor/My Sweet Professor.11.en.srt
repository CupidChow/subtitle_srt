♪ She's all around you ♪

5
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:24,510
Don't beat yourself up about it.

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:26,960
Use this time to give yourself a break.

7
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,360
Come on.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,400

People come and go. It's natural.

Doctors save lives,

15
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,800
but they are not God.

16
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,510
I know.

17
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,800
You and Grandma Li were close.

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,280

But every time I see a life

23
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,590
leave the world

24
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,710
and there's nothing I can do about it...

25
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,320
I know how you feel.

26
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,320
But things are like this.

27
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,070
It doesn't always go our way.

28
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,070
Right.

29
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,760
Getting what you want

30
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,440
is the biggest surprise.

31
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,120
But most of the time...

Yeah.

33
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,280
Most of the time,

34

even if we try,

35
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,190
fate still takes its course.

36
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,550
So

37
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,060
don't think too much.

38
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,000

What kind of day is it today?

45
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,510
You actually called me.

What's up?

47
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,000
