2
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,560
Hey.

3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,130
You're also here for lunch?

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,760
No, I'm going to another restaurant.

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,300
Wait.

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,530
Don't.

7
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,800
Since you're already here,

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,800
let's eat together.

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,300
You took the only parking space
left here.

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,830
Don't worry.

11
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,130
I'll fix it for you.

12
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:41,660
What are you doing?

13
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,260
Dig in.

14
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,560
Mm.

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,130
It still tastes the same.

16
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,330
Did you give him the drink?

17
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,500
I did.

18
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,130
But why he didn't have any response?

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,700
What response can he have?

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,760
Could you help me one more time?

21
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,360
How?

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,360
Let's have dinner together
tomorrow night.

23
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,200
What do you think?

24
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:18,930
The three of us?

25
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,060
Of course.

26
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,660
Fine.

27
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:24,990
Take it.

28
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,120
Put it there.

29
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,610
What?

30
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,200
When Huo Shang comes,
you let him sit here.

31
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,260
Do you get it?

32
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,800
You're using a trick.

33
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,260
This is nothing.

34
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,800
When he gets here,

35
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,700
I'll have physical contact with him.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,800
I'll

37
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,600
lean over like this.

38
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,330
If he doesn't reject it,

39
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,800
that means I stand a chance.

40
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,930
Hi.

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,630
There you are.

42
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:48,780
Sit here.

43
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,120
Here.

44
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:52,530
Thanks.

45
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,390
I ordered your favorite
hard-boiled egg, medium rare.

46
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,700
Isn't it a soft-boiled egg?

47
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,160
Do you have much homework?

48
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,300
Yes.

49
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,320
It's been tiring.

50
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,310
You also have lots of homework, right?

51
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:05,960
Mm.

52
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,810
A lot.

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,600
I'm very tired.

54
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,360
Why don't you eat?

55
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,300
Come on.

56
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,630
Ah.

57
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,100
I'm eating.

58
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,020
Let's go.

59
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,460
The exam is coming.

60
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,960
Let's relax a bit.

61
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,290
Why don't we

62
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,400
go to the park this weekend?

63
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,000
How does it sound?

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,560
Good.

65
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,400
We're all friends.

66
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,460
Let's go together.

67
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,600
Huo Shang, let's ride
the ferris wheel together.

68
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,260
Gao Yuan.

69
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,460
Gao Yuan's afraid of heights.

70
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,330
He can't go.

71
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,660
Yeah, I'm afraid of heights.

72
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,800
You guys go.

73
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,500
I'm also afraid of heights.

74
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,730
Maybe you could go alone.

75
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,860
We'll wait here for you.

76
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,070
Neither of you is going.

77
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,660
Then I'm not going.

78
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,640
It's fine, just go.

79
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,540
We'll wait for you.

80
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:14,660
OK.

81
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,800
I'm going then.

82
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:16,980
Bye.

83
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,800
Who's it?

84
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,530
You want to get beaten?

85
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,500
Run!

86
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,000
Stop there!

87
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,800
Go get them.

88
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,160
Where are they?

89
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,600
I saw them running that way.

90
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,300
Let's go.

91
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,860
Oh.

92
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,600
You hurt the man.

93
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,400
Why did you make me run with you?

94
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,500
Idiot.

95
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,000
Because we're a team.

96
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,160
If I were you,

97
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,900
I'd just fight them.

98
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,760
I wouldn't have run
if it wasn't for you.

99
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,860
I'm afraid they'd hit you.

100
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,360
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no!

101
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,130
- Liang Qi!
- Liang Qi!

102
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,130
Where have you been?

103
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,730
I've been waiting for you guys.

104
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Hurry and eat.

105
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,400
Thanks for your treat.

106
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,260
I... will see you around.

107
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,700
Hey.

108
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,160
I'm always around you.

109
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,800
Where's my car?
