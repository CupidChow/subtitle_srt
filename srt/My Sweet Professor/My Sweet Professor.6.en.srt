00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,460
Here. Refuel your energy.

00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,050
It's grapefruit-flavored.

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,060
My favorite.

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,120
Grapefruit-flavored?

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,600
What?

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,660
You don't like it?

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,500
Eh, no, no.

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:22,560
Oh.

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,730
Wait a minute.

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,730
What is it?

12
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:28,860
Here.

13
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,200
I saw you were sleeping in class,

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,730
so I wrote down the notes for you.

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:36,960
Thank you.

16
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,130
It was nothing.

17
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,840
I can help you with your lessons.

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,720
Help me?

19
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:43,260
Mm.

20
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,130
Actually,

21
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,160
you don't need to.

22
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,200
Why?

23
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,600
I'm not gonna get into college
with my grades.

24
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,530
I transferred to here

25
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,200
only for getting a high school degree.

26
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,200
You can't think this way.

27
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,200
It's more than half a semester away
from the exam.

28
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,260
We've got plenty of time.

29
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,530
Besides, I've told you.

30
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,300
I'll help you.

31
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,530
There'll be no problem.

32
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:02,700
But I...

33
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,860
But what?

34
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,700
Listen to me.

35
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,900
All the girls

36
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,130
in college are well matured.

37
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,330
They're much prettier than
high school girls.

38
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,100
It'll be a big regret for you

39
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,500
if you don't go to college to feel it.

40
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,960
You have to give it a try.

41
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,100
OK.

42
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,560
Then let's try it together.

43
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,560
Dr. Gao, you've been receiving
delicious food these days.

44
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,700
Are you falling in love?

45
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,060
No.

46
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,960
Humph.

47
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,600
Be nice to others.

48

can you get something else to eat?

50
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,360
I've been eating your grapefruits

51
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,560
for almost half a month.

52

you reply? Let's have lunch together.)
