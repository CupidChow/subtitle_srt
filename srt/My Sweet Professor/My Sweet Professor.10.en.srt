Come on.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,500
Have some more drinks for team-building.

00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,220
Cheers.

5
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,400
Cheers.

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:10,990
Hey.

7
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:12,760
Don't just drink.

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,670
Let's play some games.

9
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,880
Truth or Dare.

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,710
Me?

11
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:19,550
Of course it's you.

12
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,860
You lost in the last round.

13
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,400
Exactly.

14
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,150
Mm.

15
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,070
Truth.

16
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,250
Who

17
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,150
do you like

18
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:30,710
the most?

19
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:32,890
There's no such a person.

20
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,210
No such a person?

21
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,640
Then you have to drink.

22
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:37,550
Come on.

23
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,310
Bottoms up.

24
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,440
Then who do you like the most?

25
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,000
I'll drink.

26
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:47,880
He's feelings shy.

27
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,020
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

28
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,820
Waitress.

29
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:02,960
The bill, please.

30
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,200
Sir, someone already paid your bill.

31
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,030
Ah?

32
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,760
Hey.

33
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,760
Are you hurting yourself here?

34
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,760
Huo Shang.

35
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:21,670
Why are you here?

36
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,140
Dr. Gao. Dr. Gao.

37
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,300
Grandma Li's dying.

38
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,190
Dr. Gao, the patient is dying.

39
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,320
Give her adrenaline injections.

40
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,320
We already did twice.

41
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,230
Do it again!

42
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,710
Yes.

43
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,550
Dr. Gao. Dr. Gao.

44
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,230
(Li Guifen's time of death)

45
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,440
(14:22 PM)

46
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,590
You still haven't eaten?

47
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,710
It's natural that this thing happens.

48
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,360
Don't feel too sad.

49
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,150
Senior.

50
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,880
I wish I had found it out earlier.

51
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,190
Don't blame yourself.

52
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,630
This isn't your fault.

53
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,590
You took care of Grandma Li

54
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,710
for a long time wholeheartedly.

55
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,440
I know you were very close.

56
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,360
But she suddenly
took a turn for the worse,

57
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,760
and we knew

58
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,960
what the result would be.

59
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,280
So don't blame yourself.

60
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,670
Gao Yuan.

61
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,230
This isn't your fault.

62
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,800
Go home and adjust yourself these days.

63
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,920
Take a good rest.

64
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:09,960
Just call me

65
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,480
if you need anything.

66
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,160
I know, President.
