00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:11,360
Earthquake!

Gao Yuan.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,800
There was an earthquake
in the neighboring city last night.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,590
The patients will be sent
to our hospital soon.

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,630
And we've also set up a rescue team

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,070
to go to the front and save lives.

8
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,880
(Linquan Huayuan Hospital)
I'm happy to see how active you are.

9
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,630
But the hospital has drawn up a list.

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,840
If I call your name,

11
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:34,440
go with me.

12
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,030

Lin Rou.

15
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,440
It's very urgent,

16
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,360
so we have to go to the front line
as soon as possible.

17
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,030
I'll give you two hours to get ready.

18
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,330
I'll pick you up from work.

19
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,320
Ah, no. I'm going away for a few days.

20
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,880
To the stricken areas.

21
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:58,840
When are you leaving?

22
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,880
Soon.

23
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,920
Alright, got it.

Gao Yuan.

26
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,440
Huo Shang, what are you doing?

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,280
I have to go save lives.

28
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,670
I'm not saying you can't go.

29
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,230
I asked Dong to prepare
some relief supplies

30
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,710
and send them to the stricken areas.

31
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,230
I'm going with you.

32
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,360
Let's go.

(Ambulance)

35
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,150
Come on.

36
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:16,920
Have some water.

37
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,000
Will we be able to leave here?

38
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,110
Now even the rescue cars can't get in.

39
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,150
It's hard to say.

40
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,280
I've asked around.

41
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,880
There was a landslide in front.

42
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,000
The road is hard to walk.

43
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,400
Have some bread.

44
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,150
What will you eat?

45
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,280
I'm not hungry.

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,070
Oh no, an aftershock.
