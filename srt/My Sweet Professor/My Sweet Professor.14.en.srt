2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,190
OK.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,550
There's no problem with all the reports.

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:10,030
Thanks.

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,280
Come on, let me treat you to lunch.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,070
I have more reports to review.

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,070
I'm not going.

8
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,630
Hey, why are you here?

9
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,800
We agreed to have lunch together.

10
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,280
Senior, wanna join us?

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,280
Mm.

12
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:23,800
It's fine.

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,230
You guys eat.

14
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,600
You ordered my favorite salad.

15
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,300
Why are you always looking at me?

16
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,460
Have you had enough?

17
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,900
How do you always know
I'm looking at you?

18
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,420
Of course I haven't had enough.

19
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:46,980
I

20
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,060
will make up for the lost eight years.

21
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,660
Well, Mr. Huo.

22
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,700
Mr. Chen will arrive at 8:00 PM.

23
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,500
OK, got it.

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,500
I'll pick him up later.

25
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,480
I heard you met an old classmate.

26
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:15,460
Yes.

27
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,620
It's good to make a friend,

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,660
but don't overstep the bounds.

29
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,370
Got it.

30
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,740
You did too much for him
eight years ago.

31
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,220
I've been feeling worse lately.

32
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,500
I'll leave the company
to you and You Qing.

33
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,670
I heard You Qing's been restless lately.

34
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,520
Be careful.

35
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,100
Thanks for the reminder, Uncle Chen.

36
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,980
Huo Shang, you're a talent.

37
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,700
I know Xinrong likes you.

38
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,900
But don't let me down.

39
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,000
I know.

40
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,700
She's my only daughter.

41
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,690
In the future,

42
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,220
I'll definitely

43
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,860
hand over the company to her.

44
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,300
I also like Xinrong.

45
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,700
She's been my favorite sister.

46
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,250
Then be nice to her.

47
00:01:59,480 --> 00:01:59,870
I will.

48
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:01,780
Alright.

49
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,650
It's the thing between you young people.

50
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,230
I won't meddle anymore.

51
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,740
Come on, cheers.

52
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:14,400
Let's go to PH later.

53
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,060
Hey, Huo Shang.

54
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,060
Huo Shang, say something.

55
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,380
What do you want?

56
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,700
There you are.

57
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,980
I wanna go home, too.

58
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,700
Cute.

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,770
Cute?

60
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,760
You mean me?

61
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,560
Go away.

62
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,870
I want water.

63
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,420
Here.

64
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,980
I'm thirsty, too.

65
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,450
I'm thirsty, too.

66
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,180
The camel in the desert
finally has water.

67
