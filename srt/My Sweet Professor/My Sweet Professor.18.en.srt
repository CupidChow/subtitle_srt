2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,190
What an interesting day!

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:08,510
Yeah.

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,110
Here you are.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,510
So comfortable here.

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,840
It can be our special place.

7
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,280
It always is.

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:16,880
Yeah.

9
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,630
By the way, I have something to show you.

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,670
I used to come here all the time,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,480
and I left this mark every time.

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,960
It's been so many.

13
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,440
Come here.

14
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,510
I also have something to show you.

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,880
I used to come here, too.

16
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,230
And I drew a line every time.

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,590
Let's sit down.

18
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,480
Well,

19
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,320
it turns out that we've missed
each other so many times.

20
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,110
Since you've been looking for me,

21
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,110
why didn't you just contact me directly?

22
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,230
What exactly happened
in the past eight years?

23
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,110
If you don't want to say,

24
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,320
then don't.

25
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,440
But,

26
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,320
promise me one thing.

27
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,360
Say it.

28
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:51,710
You just can't disappear

29
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,360
without any explanation
or reason in the future.

30
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,710
Yeah. I promise you.

31
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:02,920
Sure.

32
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,840
Just come in. It's open.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,920
Hello, Dong.

34
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,920
Mr. Huo, hurry and come here.

35
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,110
Mr. Chen may not make it.

36
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,670
I'm afraid there will be something wrong
in the company.

37
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:22,840
OK.

38
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,000
Hello.

39
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,440
There's something wrong
with the company.

40
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,880
I need to go there.

41
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,710
Sure. Go ahead.

42
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:37,920
I'll be back later.

43
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:38,510
OK.

44
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,000
Wait for me.

45
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:40,800
Sure.

46
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,000
Dong.

47
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,150
What's wrong?

48
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,630
Mr. Huo,

49
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,630
Mr. Chen can't make it.

50
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,840
I just met him a few days ago.

51
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,630
Why so sudden?

52
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,000
He fell just now, and

53
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,400
there was a lot of blood on his head.

54
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,590
He couldn't make it at that time.

55
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,400
Mr. Huo, I think you have to watch out.

56
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,000
You Qing came just now.

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,400
There was something wrong with this.

58
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,670
OK. I'll be careful.

59
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,070
Yeah.

00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,940
