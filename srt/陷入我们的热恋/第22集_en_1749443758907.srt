00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,960
provided by us.

2
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,480
Your character seems to be

3
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,120
prepare for seen through the vision.

4
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,800
Who is it?

5
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,160
Close the door!

6
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,800
Hello?

7
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,640
Hurry up, Watch out!

8
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,440
Come in.

9
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,000
Lu Zhou.

10
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,400
Mei Yi.

11
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,400
Give it to me.

12
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,000
Come on.

13
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,280
Have a good night.

14
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,120
I'll take you to the amusement park.

15
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,120
Be honest.

16
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,680
Don't run.

17
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,040
I'm waiting for you.

18
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,520
Go.

19
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,960
I don't want to see you.

20
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,600
You kid.

21
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,560
Mei Yi, I'll leave you to your family.

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,720
I'll leave you alone.

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,440
What are you doing, Lu Zhou?

24
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,040
You haven't come back for a long time.

25
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,800
Come on. I'll pour you some water.

26
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,600
Come on.

27
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,480
Come on.

28
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,320
I'll go and cut some fruits.

29
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,280
I've sent them away.

30
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,440
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

31
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,000
I'll come in and sit down.

32
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,680
No.

33
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,480
Lu Zhou.

34
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,240
I...

35
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,200
God, you've gone too far.

36
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,960
I'm running away now.

37
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:20,360
Little

38
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,320
I know you've said a lot of things.

39
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,320
I want to tell you

40
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,320
You didn't let me get my heart broken.

41
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,820
I watched you grow up every day.

42
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,820
You were a good customer.

43
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:38,820
You made me the most envious father of Chen Lu Zhou.

44
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,620
I'm really thankful for you.

45
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,020
In your opinion,

46
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,420
I treated my father too badly.

47
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,420
You didn't get along well with your mother.

48
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,420
You were also a good father to me.

49
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,420
Now, you can't talk to me on the weekends.

50
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,420
I'm the one who took this home.

51
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,920
Don't mention the past.

52
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,420
I'm just looking forward to seeing you.

53
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,420
I'm just looking forward to seeing you.

54
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,420
I'm just looking forward to seeing you.

55
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,420
Lu Zhou,

56
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,420
what should I do?

57
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,420
This is Li Yong'an's house.

58
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,420
As long as you want to come back,

59
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,420
you can do anything.

60
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,420
I won't take the red envelope.

61
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,420
Take care of yourself.

62
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,420
Take care of your health.

63
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,420
I'll come back to see you on the weekends when I'm free.

64
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,420
I'm leaving, dad.

65
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,420
Boyfriend, I was sent to a grandma's house by the teacher.

66
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,420
I'm going to the country house.

67
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,420
I'm afraid I can't go back today.

68
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,420
What should I do?

69
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,420
Just stay here.

70
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,420
I'll be back soon.

71
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,420
What are you saying?

72
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,420
I'm just thinking about it.

73
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,420
You don't want me to be here?

74
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,420
I do.

75
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,420
But now,

76
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,420
I'm just thinking about it.

77
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,420
Is there anything else?

78
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,420
Nothing.

79
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,420
So you can come back tomorrow?

80
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,420
My dad is coming.

81
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,420
He doesn't want to come back.

82
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,420
I can't just run away.

83
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,420
I see.

84
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,420
Your dad must have been on purpose.

85
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,420
Hey.

86
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,420
Hey.

87
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,420
Dad is already dry.

88
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,420
What's wrong?

89
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,420
I'm talking about Xu.

90
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,420
Did you do it on purpose?

91
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,420
I just think that guy is not very local.

92
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,420
He said that because he was afraid that you wouldn't be able to accept him.

93
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,420
I can't accept him no matter how old I am.

94
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,420
I can't accept him.

95
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,420
I'm not against your relationship.

96
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,420
It's good for a boyfriend and a husband.

97
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,420
You must build a foundation

98
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,420
that supports the Western Union, right?

99
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,420
But this foundation

100
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,420
is not for nothing.

101
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,420
You have to understand.

102
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,420
I understand.

103
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,420
You are young now.

104
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,420
As time goes by,

105
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,420
the Western Union will change.

106
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,420
If this guy has the responsibility,

107
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,420
we won't say it.

108
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,420
If he doesn't,

109
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,420
he won't be a scapegoat.

110
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,420
That means he won't marry you.

111
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,420
Isn't it your time to waste?

112
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,420
Chen Luzhao won't.

113
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,420
I know he won't.

114
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,420
On the contrary,

115
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,420
I have seen him well.

116
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,420
I feel that

117
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,420
he is more mature than you.

118
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,420
But you are my daughter.

119
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,420
I don't want to take advantage of his troubles.

120
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,420
Li Liwei,

121
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,420
what if he bullies you in the future?

122
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,420
What if he bullies you?

123
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,420
Beat him to death!

124
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,420
Here is your order.

125
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,420
Dad,

126
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,420
Chen Luzhao is being threatened by you.

127
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,420
He is so sweet.

128
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,420
He really said that?

129
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,420
It's a little useful.

130
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,420
So,

131
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,420
when are you going to return the suitcase?

132
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,420
Don't worry.

133
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,420
From the beginning to the end,

134
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,420
I don't intend to make him suffer.

135
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,420
You can clean the place

136
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,420
where you are taught.

137
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,420
Okay.

138
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,420
Okay.

139
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,420
Li Liwei.

140
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,420
Mr. Fu.

141
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,420
I heard that you don't have the old boat.

142
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,420
Xu Zhihan, you should come.

143
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,420
Thank you.

144
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,420
Thank you.

145
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,420
Don't you want me to go in and have a cup of tea?

146
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,420
This way.

147
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,420
This way.

148
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,420
There is no tea in the house.

149
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,420
Is it okay to drink water?

150
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,420
No problem.

151
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,420
This way.

152
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,420
That table...

153
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,420
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,420
This table...

155
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,540
Hey!

156
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,640
How did you get there?

157
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,080
equipment

158
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,020
I put it here for you

159
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,400
Well

160
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,080
I heard that

161
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,760
You love her too much

162
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:25,680
Yes

163
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,440
There is a problem?

164
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,780
There is no big problem

165
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,900
No problem.

166
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,180
Well,

167
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,580
there are a few small problems.

168
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,340
Did you

169
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,740
date before?

170
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,700
Just one.

171
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,660
No way.

172
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,580
I'm not sure.

173
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,580
I'm not sure.

174
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,580
I'm not sure.

175
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,580
I'm not sure.

176
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,580
I should ask the family question.

177
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,580
I don't care about the family.

178
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,580
No one cares about the family.

179
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,580
And they can't change anything.

180
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,580
If someone asks you about the family background,

181
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,580
they just want to know if you have money.

182
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,580
But even if you don't have money now,

183
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,580
Xu Zhi and you are all Chinese high school students.

184
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,580
You can find a job in the future.

185
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,580
I believe you will live a good life.

186
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,580
I care about it.

187
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,580
It's about men.

188
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,580
It's so good for you.

189
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,580
If you go out and wander,

190
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,580
I can understand it.

191
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,580
But

192
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,580
if you go out and wander,

193
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,580
don't come back to find Xu Zhi.

194
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,580
I don't want to be in Xu Zhi's shoes

195
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,580
when the wanderer goes back.

196
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,580
Boss Fu, I look like a wanderer.

197
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,580
Stop it.

198
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,580
What?

199
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,580
Are you forcing me to praise you for being handsome?

200
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,580
No.

201
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,580
But I think Boss Fu is

202
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,580
pretty handsome when he's young.

203
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,580
He's handsome, right?

204
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,580
Are you a wanderer?

205
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,580
You're quite smart.

206
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,580
I won't say more.

207
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,580
You know what I'm talking about.

208
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,580
I'll take my leave then.

209
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,580
Don't drink water, Boss Fu.

210
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,580
No.

211
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,580
I'm afraid you'll poison me.

212
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,580
Take care.

213
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,580
I'll take you out.

214
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,580
Boss Fu, drink some water.

215
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,580
Don't you want to drink?

216
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,580
No, you drink it.

217
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,580
Xu,

218
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,580
do you know

219
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,580
about Master Wei?

220
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,580
I know.

221
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,580
I told him when I was young.

222
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,580
Fine.

223
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,580
You're hiding it from me.

224
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,580
You're also hiding it from me.

225
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,580
On the third day,

226
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,580
I called Master Wei.

227
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,580
You took Lu Zhou with you.

228
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,580
It's been a year.

229
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,580
I've seen him for several times.

230
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,580
I miss him a lot.

231
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,580
We're having a meal.

232
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,580
We'll meet again.

233
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,580
Okay.

234
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,580
I'll tell him.

235
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,580
I'll see him.

236
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,580
Auntie Wu.

237
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,580
I just met him outside.

238
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,580
Okay.

239
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,580
Come in.

240
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,580
You go first.

241
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,580
Alright.

242
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,580
Take the shoe.

243
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,580
Happy new year.

244
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,580
Thank you.

245
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,580
Thank you.

246
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,020
Xu Yu is cooking inside.

247
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:53,620
Yes, I'm here.

248
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,540
I'll help you.

249
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,580
You're here.

250
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,260
Come in.

251
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,860
Are you busy?

252
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,980
My shoes are a bit small.

253
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,540
Take a seat.

254
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,300
I'll do it.

255
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:03,820
It's okay.

256
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,460
Give it to me.

257
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:08,980
You're thinking too much.

258
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,700
Give it to your uncle.

259
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,380
What a game.

260
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,700
Are you nervous?

261
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,100
What am I nervous about?

262
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,260
I've never seen you before.

263
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:17,740
Don't play.

264
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:18,940
Let's go.

265
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,460
Put it on the table.

266
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,020
Let's go.

267
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,620
Thank you.

268
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,100
Lu Zhou,

269
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,620
try this dish.

270
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,060
Okay.

271
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,460
Is it good?

272
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,020
Is it good?

273
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,580
Yes.

274
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,020
It's good.

275
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,980
Try the salted chicken.

276
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,860
See if it's good.

277
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,380
How is it?

278
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:47,500
It's good.

279
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:48,860
Not salty.

280
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:49,780
Just right.

281
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,780
Just right.

282
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,540
I'm afraid you'll get salty.

283
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,260
The ribs are here.

284
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:55,780
The dish is ready.

285
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,620
Here, try it.

286
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,100
Is the ribs sweet?

287
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,100
Okay.

288
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,060
Are you here to try the dishes?

289
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,380
I just want to see

290
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,980
if you can eat with our president.

291
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:12,900
Absolutely.

292
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,580
I love it.

293
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,380
That's good.

294
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:16,740
Have one.

295
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:17,580
Have one.

296
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,260
Yu.

297
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:19,860
How is it?

298
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,060
It's good.

299
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:28,980
Xu Zhi.

300
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,500
I'll open the gift for you.

301
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,020
Okay.

302
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,100
There's a gift?

303
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:34,860
I don't know.

304
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,260
What did you buy?

305
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,940
You'll know now.

306
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,340
What is it?

307
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,260
Is it cake?

308
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,420
It's so pretty.

309
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,020
Is it?

310
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,900
Xu Zhi showed me your childhood photos.

311
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,500
I saw you like motorcycles.

312
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,020
There are so many motorcycles in the world.

313
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,140
I thought you might use it.

314
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,100
Take a look.

315
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:01,580
It's so pretty.

316
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,740
Look at it.

317
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:04,860
It's true.

318
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,340
It's much more attractive than mine.

319
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,220
You like it.

320
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,180
I like it.

321
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,220
Try it.

322
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,500
It's a little bit.

323
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,580
My choice.

324
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:13,660
Well.

325
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,140
I don't know much.

326
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,420
I bought the wrong number.

327
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,820
I'll buy a new one tomorrow.

328
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,740
No need.

329
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,140
I like it.

330
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,420
And if I can't bring it,

331
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,900
I can bring it to him.

332
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,940
It's suitable for the Louis Vuitton.

333
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,260
It's pretty.

334
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,140
I like it.

335
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,300
I'll buy a smaller one.

336
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,340
No need to waste it.

337
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,380
It's good.

338
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:34,580
Come on.

339
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,660
You're so happy today.

340
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,140
Come on.

341
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,180
One.

342
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:37,900
You must.

343
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,300
Come on.

344
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,580
One.

345
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,820
Happy new year.

346
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,820
Happy new year.

347
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,780
It's so beautiful.

348
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,060
It's heavy.

349
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,860
Chen Lu Shou.

350
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,740
Here.

351
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,780
Can you cover up?

352
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:12,860
No.

353
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,060
Women.

354
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,420
Bring mine.

355
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,620
Give it to me.

356
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,620
Here.

357
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,620
This is it.

358
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,620
The color of the smoke is so beautiful.

359
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,620
Today,

360
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:31,020
we will use our Xu's curse

361
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,620
to make the horse tail be his home.

362
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,220
I will give you the curse.

363
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,620
Don't be nervous.

364
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,220
Some things are going to happen.

365
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,620
Uncle, it's on me.

366
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,620
Of course.

367
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,620
Of course.

368
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,020
You have to experience

369
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,020
which position the horse tail is best.

370
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,020
This whip

371
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,420
can't be too low

372
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,820
and can't be too high.

373
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,220
It's the best

374
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,820
position.

375
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,420
But you have to keep your hair smooth.

376
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,420
Keep your hair smooth and go down.

377
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,020
Mr. Lu, your hair is short.

378
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,420
Don't move.

379
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,620
It's done.

380
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,220
Zhou, do you need help?

381
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,220
It's okay.

382
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,420
I just want to learn.

383
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,420
No.

384
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,420
Your hand has to be fast.

385
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,420
It will hurt if you move slowly.

386
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,020
This is it.

387
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,820
Do you remember these?

388
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,820
Some places can be picked.

389
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,620
Some places are not good.

390
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,420
You can't pick.

391
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,420
I see.

392
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,620
I see.

393
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,420
I'm satisfied.

394
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,020
Your dad is usually like this when he drinks too much.

395
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,420
I should help him get in.

396
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,820
I remember a kind of

397
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,620
blow-up method.

398
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,420
It's faster.

399
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,820
In case

400
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,220
you can't get in the class.

401
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,820
You'll be late for school.

402
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:15,820
This.

403
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,820
Remember this method.

404
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,620
You can get out very soon.

405
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,020
See you, Mr. Lu.

406
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,820
Be careful.

407
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,820
Be careful.

408
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,820
It's okay.

409
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,820
Go to Mr. Lu's.

410
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,020
I'll take care of him.

411
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,220
Thank you, Mrs. Wei.

412
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,820
See you, Mrs. Wei.

413
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,620
See you.

414
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,620
Take it with me.

415
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,820
I'll help you wear the shoes.

416
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,420
I'll wear the shoes for you, okay?

417
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,620
I've already worn them.

418
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,420
Be careful when you come back.

419
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:47,820
Okay.

420
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,420
Bye.

421
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,420
Bye.

422
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,020
I'll carry you.

423
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,620
Bye.

424
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,420
Take it.

425
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,420
Mr. Xue.

426
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,620
Please charge the power.

427
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,020
Thank you.

428
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,020
Can I have a look?

429
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:13,820
Check me.

430
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:14,820
No.

431
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,420
Check it.

432
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,620
Your password is your birthday.

433
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,420
Forget it.

434
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,820
It's not a problem for a boyfriend

435
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,620
who has no friends

436
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,820
who have no friends who have no friends.

437
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,820
If you want to check, just do it.

438
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,020
Anyway, my password is your birthday.

439
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,220
The house password and bank card password.

440
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:37,820
No.

441
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,820
I care about the bank card password the most.

442
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,620
Okay.

443
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,820
Little Cami.

444
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,020
Your password is the same as 903.

445
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,620
I've finished it.

446
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,820
Mr. Zhi.

447
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,220
What's your wish?

448
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,820
I wish my boyfriend

449
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,420
can turn into the professional that he likes.

450
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,620
This is a simple wish.

451
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,820
What do you want me to do in the future?

452
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,620
What do you want me to do?

453
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,420
You don't have your own business.

454
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,420
You can't do it.

455
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,420
You can't do it.

456
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,420
You can't do it.

457
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,420
You can't do it.

458
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,420
You can't do it.

459
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,420
You can't do it.

460
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,420
You can't do it.

461
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,420
You can't do it.

462
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,020
Do you have your own thinking?

463
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,420
Yes.

464
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,520
But I want to hear what you said.

465
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,020
I think you have good learning.

466
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,820
You can stay at the school

467
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,420
as a professor after you graduate.

468
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,620
You'll be great.

469
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,620
But I believe

470
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,820
that Chen Ruozhou

471
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,020
will do very well in everything.

472
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,220
Why does he listen to you so soundly?

473
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,020
His eyes are wide open.

474
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,860
Why are you so rude?

475
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,700
I've given you the whole yard.

476
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,460
What should I do?

477
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,180
You've guessed it.

478
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,060
I thought I was the only one who didn't have it.

479
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,060
You're so mean.

480
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:34,900
Open it.

481
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,060
What did you prepare?

482
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:56,220
ノ

483
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,480
Did you make this?

484
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,220
sä

485
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,140
like it?

486
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:07,460
What do you mean?

487
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,300
I found out

488
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,700
your dad's regret is really great.

489
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,220
I want to give my mom a hug.

490
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,180
If it's not because she attracted you,

491
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,020
you won't find me in a hundred seasons.

492
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,380
Then you have to give Tan Xu a hug.

493
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,740
If it's not because of her,

494
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,740
we haven't met yet.

495
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,460
Don't give me a hug.

496
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,580
Just kidding.

497
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,700
I'm kidding.

498
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,700
I'm sorry.

499
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,060
I love you, Chen Jiaojiao.

500
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,900
I'll take a photo.

501
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,380
I just allow you.

502
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,140
Come in.

503
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,740
Boss, good night.

504
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,860
Chen Luzhou lives nearby?

505
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,100
Would you like her to have breakfast with us?

506
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,100
She's not up yet.

507
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,580
How manysurdens can it be wiry?

508
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,460
He was so greedy just now.

509
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,060
How will he take care of you?

510
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,260
He's not always this late.

511
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,460
He works hard at school.

512
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,260
Do you remember what you did last night?

513
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,460
Director Wei told me.

514
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,260
Chen Lusheng won't be angry, right?

515
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,060
I hit him with a small whip.

516
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,060
No, he has a good temper.

517
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,460
Good temper? That's good.

518
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,060
Director Wei also praised him.

519
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,860
He said he knows etiquette.

520
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,860
He said he found out that

521
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,860
as long as he talks to Chen Luzhou,

522
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,660
he will listen to him carefully.

523
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,060
If Director Wei doesn't say it,

524
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,660
I don't know whether he will say it or not.

525
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,260
Are you praising Chen Luzhou or Director Wei?

526
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,660
What do you think of Director Wei?

527
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,860
He's nice and gentle.

528
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,860
He looks good in person.

529
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,460
Yes.

530
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,860
I think Chen Luzhou is good.

531
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,060
He will be a good husband in the future.

532
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,460
Take this.

533
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,660
After you finish eating,

534
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,060
send it to me while it's hot.

535
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,060
What's wrong?

536
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,060
You don't treat me like that.

537
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,060
Do you want to eat this kind of vinegar?

538
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,860
Of course, I want to eat this kind of vinegar.

539
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,460
Have you finished eating?

540
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,860
Have you finished eating?

541
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,860
Otherwise, my heart will be cold.

542
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,460
It's almost done.

543
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,260
Do you want anything else? Is it important?

544
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,260
Yes.

545
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,860
Wang Tao, okay?

546
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:17,660
Yes.

547
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:18,860
Take one for yourself.

548
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:19,460
This one.

549
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,060
It's a gift.

550
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,660
I want to buy a gift for Aunt Wei.

551
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,860
But I don't know how to buy it.

552
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,860
You want to steal it so soon?

553
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,260
I think it's not easy to buy it.

554
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,460
Do you know?

555
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,460
I just came to your house.

556
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,660
It's not convenient to go out to buy it.

557
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,260
It's not easy to tell Xu.

558
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,060
Later, when I asked for the food,

559
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,660
I found that Xu had prepared it for me.

560
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,660
It's in the car washroom in our washroom.

561
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,660
These years, he is a father and mother.

562
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,860
It's really not easy.

563
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,060
Actually, Aunt Wei is also quite good.

564
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,660
At least when I'm not around,

565
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,460
she can take care of my father for me.

566
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,460
Don't worry.

567
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,260
I'll take care of the light-growing task.

568
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:05,660
You...

569
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,660
You're silly.

570
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:08,860
Let's go.

571
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,260
I'll go now.

572
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,260
Okay.

573
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,060
Why am I in the car washroom?

574
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,260
I'm in the car washroom.

575
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,260
I'm in the car washroom.

576
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,060
Xu.

577
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,060
I'm in the car washroom.

578
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:32,860
You...

579
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,060
Xu?

580
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,860
Lian Hui?

581
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,260
Why...

582
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,060
Why are you here?

583
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:44,660
No.

584
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,660
This is your house.

585
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,060
This is your house.

586
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,060
Don't worry.

587
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,460
No.

588
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:03,660
Xu.

589
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,060
I didn't expect that...

590
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,060
I'm actually your daughter.

591
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,860
Why didn't I think about it?

592
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,260
I really have a similar relationship with you.

593
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,060
I can't react now.

594
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,460
Lu Zhou is your child.

595
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,460
Sit down.

596
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,860
Let's have some porridge.

597
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:22,860
No. No.

598
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:23,460
It's good.

599
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,060
Have some water.

600
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,660
Actually, I heard my son say that.

601
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,460
Lu Zhou was in your house this year.

602
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,460
I came to thank you.

603
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,460
I was giving you a year.

604
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,460
I didn't expect that you were so lucky.

605
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,460
Yes.

606
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,460
Thanks to your son.

607
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,460
Think about it.

608
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,860
We haven't met for years.

609
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,260
Then...

610
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,860
Lu Zhou...

611
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,660
Xu.

612
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,060
Let's not mention the past.

613
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,460
I don't want Lu Zhou to know.

614
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,260
I don't want Lu Zhou to know.

615
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,460
Okay.

616
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:12,260
You've been a father and a mother for so many years.

617
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,660
Your mother is in my house.

618
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,660
She's looking for you.

619
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:20,860
It's not right.

620
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,260
She doesn't know I'm in your house.

621
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,260
Chen Xingqi said that.

622
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,260
I'm afraid so.

623
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,260
You're still young.

624
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,260
I just hope

625
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,660
that I don't affect the children

626
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,060
when I'm young.

627
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,860
It's better not to let them know about it.

628
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:40,460
Okay.

629
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,660
You're not wrong.

630
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,660
I'm...

631
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,460
What's going on?

632
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,260
Have you thought about it?

633
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,060
Your mother must not be my mother.

634
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,900
But your father must be my father.

635
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,100
I agreed!

636
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,020
Have a drink.

637
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,020
I drink Armenian tea.

638
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,840
From this wine,

639
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,080
I keep my whole life here.

640
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,880
I drink this wine

641
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,320
for our marriage.

642
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,460
See?

643
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,960
In my spirit,

644
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,820
We are mid- rheumatism.

645
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,200
To light the tree,

646
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,760
we need energy

647
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,480
I think there's only one reason.

648
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,480
What?

649
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,880
You don't love me anymore.

650
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,200
What if you really hate me?

651
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,640
Just do it.

652
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,520
But what do I do?

653
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,680
You don't look like my dad.

654
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,080
Where's Xing?

655
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,400
Xing doesn't look like him.

656
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,560
He doesn't look like anyone.

657
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,000
How about

658
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,960
I go back first

659
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,960
and take a look at my dad?

660
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,160
What now?

661
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,000
Do you have to go now?

662
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,080
What?

663
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,360
Can we go later?

664
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,560
Okay.

665
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,180
No, I can't really leave you guys to managing this.

666
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,040
Dad, I've come back.

667
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,400
Why are you back?

668
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,520
Wash yourself!

669
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,560
You'll be able to eat right now.

670
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,400
I'm sorry.

671
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:01,920
Dad.

672
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,480
Wait for me.

673
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,120
What's wrong?

674
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,880
Do you think

675
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,760
I'm not

676
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,440
your sister?

677
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,000
How did you know?

678
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,000
Don't joke.

679
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,680
You're kidding me.

680
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,480
Tell me. What do you want to ask?

681
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,600
I saw a news today

682
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,720
that someone had a baby.

683
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,160
The whole family didn't know.

684
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,720
Then the baby died.

685
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,080
The baby ran out to inherit the property.

686
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,240
Don't worry.

687
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,680
Dad doesn't have a property.

688
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,560
Only the mortgage and a shrewd debt.

689
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,920
Which one do you want to inherit?

690
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,440
You have to find day.

691
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,040
Jay,

692
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,280
you've just returned.

693
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,720
Pay my son a visit.

694
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,420
It's nice to see you.

695
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,640
I never miss your visit.

696
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,020
Say you love me.

697
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,100
Which one?

698
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:17,820
What?

699
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,860
I just realized that my dad is quite strict.

700
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,300
He's very hard to protect.

701
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,220
He can't get out.

702
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,220
I think it's impossible.

703
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,820
He's quite a flower.

704
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,220
I heard that he's been playing with a car and a cow.

705
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,460
He's been in a coma for a few years.

706
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,580
Then you can take my dad to a hundred big men.

707
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,100
He can't do this.

708
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,820
But there was a man who did a racing car

709
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,100
when he was young.

710
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,700
He was in a coma for three or four years after he got into a car accident.

711
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,060
Really?

712
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,060
Who?

713
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,260
Fu Yuching.

714
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,380
Eat.

715
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,380
I'm not talking. I'm afraid of calling me.

716
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:09,260
Chen Luzhou sent you to ask me, right?

717
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,660
You know everything?

718
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,660
How can I not know?

719
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,860
You're not good at the clothes you gave me

720
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,260
when you were in third grade.

721
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,860
You changed your clothes on the way to school.

722
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,860
You changed your clothes before you went to school.

723
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,260
Is that true?

724
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,260
I thought I was good at it.

725
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:38,260
So is Fu Shu Chen Luzhou's dad?

726
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,660
Is he?

727
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,860
I'll tell you a story.

728
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,460
Why are you here all of a sudden?

729
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,460
Do you want to have dinner with me tonight?

730
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,460
I'm not hungry.

731
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,460
I'm not hungry.

732
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,660
Do you want to have dinner with me tonight?

733
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,660
Are you looking for me?

734
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,060
Is it Fu Yuching?

735
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,260
Did Xu Zhi's dad tell you?

736
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,660
No.

737
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,860
When I sent Xu Zhi home this afternoon,

738
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,460
Feng Qiao met you to find Xu Shu.

739
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,460
Xu Zhi said his dad's education was very simple.

740
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,260
Plus, some clues you said before

741
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,060
are hard to guess.

742
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,460
I really didn't expect that

743
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,660
Xu Zhi's dad would be so smart

744
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,860
if he was so clever.

745
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,260
Did you know Xu Shu very early?

746
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,260
Yes.

747
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,260
He's Fu Yuching's friend.

748
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,260
When he was young,

749
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,260
our relationship was good.

750
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,260
After that, I broke up with Fu Yuching.

751
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,260
I've never contacted him.

752
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,260
Why did you break up?

753
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,260
I've been with him for years.

754
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,260
I've always been very stable.

755
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,260
So I proposed to marry him.

756
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,260
He refused you?

757
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,260
He said he was too young.

758
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,260
He wanted to marry me.

759
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,260
He's not going to marry me.

760
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,260
Why did he drag me out?

761
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,260
I thought that

762
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,260
in this world of misunderstandings,

763
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,260
Fu Shu is a poor and ungrateful woman.

764
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,260
I didn't expect that he's a bastard.

765
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,260
The four words

766
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,260
of being ungrateful

767
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,260
have nothing to do with your father.

768
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,260
What happened next?

769
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:14,260
He broke up with Auntie Lianhui.

770
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,260
After that,

771
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,260
he left the hospital for four years.

772
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,260
He went through a lot

773
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,260
in his family.

774
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,260
But he refused to tell me.

775
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,260
He even went to the hospital

776
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,260
to see his father.

777
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,260
He was very stubborn.

778
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,260
But he refused to tell me.

779
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,260
He even

780
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,260
didn't tell me

781
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,260
that he and Auntie Lianhui

782
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,260
had a child.

783
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,260
Chen Luzhou is his real mother.

784
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,260
Yes.

785
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,260
I was very worried.

786
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,260
Why did he take Chen Luzhou?

787
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,260
It's a mess.

788
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:49,260
After Fu Shu took the child back,

789
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,260
he left the car accident.

790
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,260
His grandma

791
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,260
couldn't take care of Chen Luzhou.

792
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,260
So he sent him to the welfare hospital.

793
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,260
After Fu Shu left the hospital,

794
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,260
he didn't find Chen Luzhou?

795
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,260
He did.

796
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,260
But when he arrived at the welfare hospital,

797
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,260
he saw

798
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,260
that the child was grown up.

799
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,260
He couldn't recognize him.

800
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,260
He could only ask Auntie Lianhui

801
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,260
to help him recognize the child.

802
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,260
At that time,

803
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,260
Auntie Lianhui knew

804
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,260
the child was sent to the welfare hospital.

805
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,260
That day,

806
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,260
Fu Shu was not hurt.

807
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,820
Neo-Koop is still the child.

808
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,260
As his grandma said,

809
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,260
he didn't tell anyone about her.

810
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,260
What did he tell them?

811
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,260
His grandma hired stupid people

812
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,260
by order ofắn me.

813
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,260
As I remember,

814
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,260
in him,

815
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,640
there was a police officer

816
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,640
to hold a cover.

817
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:43,800
In his case,

818
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,260
none of the serial killers

819
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,260
were in line.

820
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,260
No.

821
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:48,680
But the police

822
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,260
put the suspect

823
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,260
in the police station.

824
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,240
I think

825
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,400
to the other people.

826
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,480
He should never come to me.

827
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,680
What's my birthday?

828
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,960
March 17th.

829
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,560
Your birthday is on the ID card.

830
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,120
What's the 11th on the 11th?

831
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,760
11th.

832
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,200
On the 11th,

833
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,200
when you entered the hospital,

834
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,640
the hospital was written randomly.

835
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,760
What's wrong?

836
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,320
Nothing.

837
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,720
Are you going to recognize him?

838
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,400
No need.

839
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:54,960
Let's go.

840
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,120
How are you?

841
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,040
Are you okay?

842
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,720
You know, right?

843
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,440
Where is he?

844
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,120
Where did you go?

845
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,520
You haven't gone home yet?

846
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,960
Hello, Zhizong.

847
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,800
Hello.

848
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,800
Do you know where he is?

849
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,120
I just called him.

850
00:41:59,120 --> 00:41:59,880
He's not home.

851
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,800
I'll hang up.

852
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,800
Hello, Li Ke.

853
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,720
Is he with you?

854
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,680
Xiao Lei.

855
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,480
I don't know him.

856
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,640
He's not home.

857
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,760
I'm not home.

858
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,040
Don't talk to him.

859
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,360
I'm looking for him.

860
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,040
Is he with you?

861
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,560
No.

862
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,680
I'm at my home.

863
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,600
I'm not home.

864
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,560
I'm not home.

865
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,600
I'm at my home.

866
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,320
Give me Jiang Cheng's number.

867
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:26,960
Okay.

868
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,320
Jiang Cheng.

869
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,320
Okay.

870
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,200
Is Cheng Ruozhe with you?

871
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,400
I'm here.

872
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,400
Then let him answer the phone.

873
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,320
I'll call him.

874
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,520
Jiang Cheng.

875
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,080
Let's go.

876
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,360
Let's go.

877
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,400
Let's go.

878
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,480
Come here.

879
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,480
My dad is at home.

880
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,680
Do you want to come here?

881
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,120
Why don't you come over?

882
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,520
Let's study together.

883
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,280
You're going to be a professional.

884
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,360
So I don't have the power to attract you, right?

885
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,120
It's not that you don't have the power to attract me.

886
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,360
It's more like a family study.

887
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,080
It's almost time to start.

888
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,560
We have to be together.

889
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,720
Let's go in together.

890
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,680
I'll answer the phone.

891
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,240
Hello, aunt.

892
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,780
I remember it.

893
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,200
Well, I'll be right over.

894
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:35,640
Eat some oranges.

895
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,080
Be careful.

896
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,460
Eat some oranges.

897
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,360
They're sweet.

898
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,360
Are they okay?

899
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,160
They are.

900
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,400
Get up and suck them up.

901
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,720
Xu Jun is here.

902
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,400
Are you acting like you're Handsome again?

903
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,760
Will it be the last stuff in my mind?

904
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,880
What? Where are the people in the city?

905
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,040
They left. They are the little brothers.

906
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,960
Your father doesn't want to make things difficult for them.

907
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,960
He is anxious. He has to leave first.

908
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,000
Are you okay?

909
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,240
I'm fine. I have something to do on my way to work.

910
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,280
When the old man comes, let him do the work.

911
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,680
What are you thinking about?

912
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,280
You have seen it. It's really hard to tell.

913
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,800
You said you could report it in the morning.

914
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,880
How come it's hard to tell now?

915
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,480
Yes.

916
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,200
You went from home to the hospital on your way to work.

917
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,920
You went to Song Bai Road.

918
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,120
How can I report it to you from the hospital?

919
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,840
What's wrong with Song Bai Road?

920
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,560
I'm just afraid of the traffic. I just went around.

921
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,360
Right?

922
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,360
You go around me.

923
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,360
You go around Guangzhou.

924
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,360
You go around Shanghai, okay?

925
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,440
President Cai, you are the president.

926
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,920
You can't be so empty.

927
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,240
Besides, you just look at me last time.

928
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,840
For our hospital, right?

929
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,320
I suggest you to share it with me.

930
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,360
You report it to me.

931
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,360
We have two things to do here, okay?

932
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:53,360
Xu, did you buy the book shop in Song Bai Road

933
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,360
and buy the comic book for Wei Li?

934
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,360
Look, look, look.

935
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,360
You are doing private business, right?

936
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,360
You know what?

937
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,360
It's not good to do private business.

938
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,360
You...

939
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,360
What's wrong?

940
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,360
Uncle Xu.

941
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,360
Lu Zhou.

942
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,360
Lu Zhou is here.

943
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,360
How is it? Is it serious?

944
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,360
President Cai, look. Don't worry.

945
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,360
You guys talk first. I'll go get some hot water.

946
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,360
Okay.

947
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,360
I'll get some water.

948
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,360
I'll go with him.

949
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,360
Right, go.

950
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,360
It's okay, uncle Xu.

951
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,360
It's okay.

952
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,360
Don't worry.

953
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,360
Besides, you are almost there.

954
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,360
You are working hours.

955
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,360
I never calculated it for you.

956
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,360
You are so funny.

957
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,360
I'm not good at it.

958
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,360
Right.

959
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,360
Why are you here?

960
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,360
I thought you needed me.

961
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,360
What's wrong?

962
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,360
I'm not here.

963
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,360
I'm here.

964
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,360
I'm here.

965
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,360
I'm here.

966
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,360
I'm here.

967
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,360
I'm here.

968
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,360
I'm here.

969
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,360
Hello.

970
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,360
Why does he look so angry?

971
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,360
The people from outside are playing with him.

972
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,360
All because he is too tired.

973
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,360
We've been together for 1 month.

974
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,360
We need to make him a favor.

975
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,360
Hold on.

976
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,360
I'll pay today.

977
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,360
Yes.

978
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:31,360
It's almost my turn,台灣 food.

979
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,360
The two of you are the same age.

980
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:37,360
Don't stand by cold haired.

981
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,360
Don't be shy.

982
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,360
You know what?

983
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,360
I'm going to悶 up later.

984
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:44,220
I'll get則伯 through that when I have it.

985
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:45,960
No!

986
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,800
I don't think it's gonna work out like that.

987
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,700
What will行, sir?

988
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,760
OK.

989
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,640
Let's work out at the meeting room,

990
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,360
and see if something happens or not.

991
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,320
Bad boys try to get the best you can.

992
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,580
동人良良,

993
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,580
and we heard a little nonsense.

994
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,780
If we don't, it'll be hurt.

995
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,700
So we're here.

996
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:11,860
I was picking it.

997
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:18,140
But I only realized

998
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:20,060
that the other place

999
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:21,820
to where my dad works

1000
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:23,020
in Song Bai Road was far from there.

1001
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:24,300
Just

1002
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:27,900
half theumen

1003
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,340
is just Min Jiários's house.

1004
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:31,020
But now

1005
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:33,660
he went to Song Bai Road

1006
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:34,900
to buy my love book.

1007
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:36,940
In my heart,

1008
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,100
there's a little

1009
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,700
I can't say it's true.

1010
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:45,700
Be careful.

1011
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,700
There are two strangers at home.

1012
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,700
I usually change my life.

1013
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,700
It's normal to have time and try.

1014
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:04,700
Look.

1015
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:07,700
What's wrong?

1016
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:08,700
What's wrong?

1017
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:09,700
Your boyfriend has two legs.

1018
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,700
It seems like he has a strong leg.

1019
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,700
He should be able to use it for 60 years.

1020
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,700
Then?

1021
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,700
No matter if it's a loose path or a loose path,

1022
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:21,700
I'll go there.

1023
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:23,700
Okay?

1024
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,700
I'll go there.

1025
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:13,700
I'm free to go through the weather.

1026
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:19,700
The world is too quiet.

1027
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:27,700
I'm waiting for all the moments.

1028
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:33,700
Who will be in the light?

1029
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:35,700
Be careful.

1030
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:36,700
Don't fall into the water.

1031
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:38,700
The wind is blowing.

1032
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:42,700
The world becomes a relationship.

1033
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:44,700
What's the point?

1034
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:48,700
Look.

1035
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,700
The world is too quiet.

1036
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,700
I'm waiting for all the moments.

1037
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,700
I'm waiting for all the moments.

1038
00:51:58,700 --> 00:51:59,700
Who will be in the light?

1039
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,700
I'm waiting for all the moments.

1040
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,700
Who will be in the light?

1041
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:07,700
Be careful.

1042
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,700
Don't fall into the water.

1043
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:12,700
Be careful.

1044
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,700
The world is too quiet.

1045
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:20,700
I'm waiting for all the moments.

1046
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:23,700
Who will be in the light?

1047
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:25,700
Be careful.

1048
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,700
Don't fall into the water.

1049
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,700
The world becomes a relationship.

1050
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:34,700
I don't want to be a stranger

1051
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:38,700
Let's go in

1052
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,700
Let's go in

1053
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:48,700
I'm moving forward

1054
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:52,700
Because you are the wind

1055
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:55,700
I still have several chances to meet you

1056
00:52:55,700 --> 00:53:00,700
I can be brave and brave

1057
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:04,700
After the long journey

1058
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:08,700
I want to go against the wind

1059
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:13,700
I don't want to be a stranger

1060
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:17,700
In your eyes

1061
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:22,700
I see myself

1062
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,700
Into you

1063
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:28,700
Into you
