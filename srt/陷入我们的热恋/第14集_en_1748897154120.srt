the taste of this dish is average?

39
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,960
Why are there so many people coming to visit?

40
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,120
There was a movie

41
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,120

71
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,960
I want to know.

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,960
What do you want to know?

73
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,680
Don't blame my brother.

74
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,680
He just ten years old.

75
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,200
Brother, wait for me.

76
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,200

Okay.

81
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,120
It's not my fault.

82
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,720
You said it's hard to get a family out.

83
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,960
Is it that hard to get a family out?

84
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,120
Are you okay?

85
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,160
I'm fine.

86
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,800
Lu Zhou is in a bad mood recently.

87
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,760
You don't know it.

88
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,320
What's so bad about her?

89
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,920
The whole family sent her to school.

90
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,920
She should be happy.

91
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,880
She's always on the face.

92
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,640
Okay.

93
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,560
You're the master.

94
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,280
You're her father.

95
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,720
Can you not be angry with the child?

96
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,440
I...

97
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,760
Did he say something?

98
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,760

Go to the hospital.

What's wrong, Zhizong?

196
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,720
Did Chen Lu Zhou look for you today?

197
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,720
There's no news from the day he got married.

198
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,720
I don't know if he went to the hospital again.

199
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,720
What's wrong?

200
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,720
Go find him.

201
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,720
I'll hang up first.

202
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,720
I'm here.

203
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,720
Chen Lu Zhou?

204
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,720
Look for me.

205
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,720
Why don't you answer the phone?

206
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,720
My phone fell down accidentally.

207
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,720
I can't answer it.

208
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,720
Are you okay?

209
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,720
I'm fine.

210
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,720
I'm fine.

211
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
I'm fine.

212
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
I'm fine.

213
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
Don't worry.

214
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,720
I won't die.

215
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,720
Didn't I promise you that I'd give you a lift when you're 80?

216
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
Do you miss me?

217
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,720
You're so cruel.

218
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,720
You should say that you're fine.

219
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,720
Just like what you said on our break-up day.

220
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,720
Xu Zhi, you're so cruel.

221
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,720
How cruel.

222
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,720
You're not cruel.

223
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,720
Then why don't you ask me?

224
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,720
Why?

225
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,720
Ask me if I miss you.

226
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,720
Then you can think about it.

227
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,720
I'll tell you when I see you next time.

228
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,720
Okay.

229
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,720
Alright.

230
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,720
Yuan Yuanqian.

231
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,720
Lu Cheng.

232
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,720
Lu Cheng!

233
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,360
Hehe

234
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:36,900
Not

235
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,900
What do you think?

236
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,900
Do you want to study in this school?

237
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,900
I'm so worried.

238
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,900
What do you think?

239
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,900
You want to think about it for our parents.

240
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,900
I can't do it.

241
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,900
Besides,

242
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,900
the school is all set.

243
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,900
You can't go now.

244
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,900
What do you think?

245
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,900
This is my own decision.

246
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,900
I'm here to discuss it with you.

247
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,900
Lu Zhou.

248
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,900
Lu Zhou.

249
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,900
You have a good son.

250
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,900
What are you looking at?

251
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,900
It's good.

252
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,900
Now it's just a few votes.

253
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,900
I can't take it anywhere else.

254
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,900
What's the problem?

255
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,900
You're crazy about him.

256
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,900
Can you calm down?

257
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,900
Calm down.

258
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,900
Calm down.

259
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,900
How can I calm down?

260
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,900
Do you know

261
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,900
I close my eyes

262
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,900
and see the man's blood

263
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,900
in front of me?

264
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,900
He's almost the same as Lu Zhou.

265
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,900
Who can guarantee

266
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,900
that something like this

267
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,900
will happen in the future?

268
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,900
What if it's Lu Zhou?

269
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,900
Because of the accident,

270
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,900
you're so excited.

271
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,900
If you keep doing this,

272
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,900
you'll lose your mind.

273
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,900
Lu Zhou is my son.

274
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,900
His life is more important than anything else.

275
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,900
Now,

276
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,900
I'll return to the country immediately.

277
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,900
Mr. Zhi.

278
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,900
I'll give you a small package.

279
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,900
It's so good that you can try it.

280
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,900
You wait for me.

281
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,900
Xiaozhi.

282
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,900
Here.

283
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,900
I'll give you a little heart.

284
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,900
Is...

285
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,900
Is it a note?

286
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,900
How can it be a note?

287
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,900
You're so mean.

288
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,900
When did you become so generous, Uncle Cai?

289
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,900
Exactly.

290
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,900
Can't you remember?

291
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,900
You made a promise to me

292
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,900
when you were six years old.

293
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,900
I gave you a loan back then.

294
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,900
Tell me.

295
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,900
Uncle,

296
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,900
I couldn't spend money on you.

297
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,900
My dad took it away.

298
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,900
What should I do?

299
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,900
You're like this.

300
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,900
Uncle, what are you doing?

301
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,900
When I was in college,

302
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,900
you gave it to me.

303
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,900
That's all.

304
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,900
You're really a boss.

305
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,900
You're so good at business.

306
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,900
You must be overestimated.

307
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,900
I'm so lucky.

308
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,900
Look, I'm my rich dad.

309
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,900
Really.

310
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,900
Why do kids

311
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,900
spend so much money on you?

312
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,900
What if they get into trouble?

313
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,900
The money for kids

314
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,900
has grown up.

315
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,900
Now, you're the one who's worth it.

316
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,900
Don't worry about it.

317
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,900
Yes, I won't need it.

318
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,900
I don't need to be a businesswoman.

319
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,900
Uncle, you have to pay for it.

320
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,900
You'll make money later.

321
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,900
Pay for it.

322
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,900
Buy your dad's clothes first.

323
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,900
Buy food.

324
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,900
He'll have to pay for it.

325
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,900
Dad is the most important.

326
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,900
Do you know that?

327
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,900
I'll tell you.

328
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,900
Dad is the most important.

329
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,900
Don't fall in love with me.

330
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,900
Don't get married.

331
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,900
I'll be by your side.

332
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,900
Don't think about it.

333
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,900
How can you not fall in love?

334
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,900
I'm telling you.

335
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,900
You'll know

336
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,900
when you enter the university

337
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,900
and become a member of the society.

338
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,900
The purest love

339
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,900
is in the school.

340
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,900
You should experience it.

341
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,900
You should experience it.

342
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,900
Okay.

343
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,900
Okay.

344
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,900
Don't chase my boyfriend

345
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,900
and run away with the food.

346
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,900
How can you?

347
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,900
You can't live without Chen Luzhu.

348
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,900
Go to Hua Dahao to see.

349
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,900
If ten boys

350
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,900
are like Chen Luzhu,

351
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,900
you can stop being so greedy.

352
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,900
Okay.

353
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,900
Thank you for your words.

354
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,900
Love is love.

355
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,900
Someone will bully you.

356
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,900
Remember to tell your dad

357
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,900
the first time.

358
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,900
Okay.

359
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,900
The car is here.

360
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,900
Hurry up.

361
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,900
Don't get me wrong.

362
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:20,900
Uncle.

363
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,900
Let's go.

364
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,900
Right?

365
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,900
You really need to take care of yourself.

366
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,900
Wear more clothes.

367
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,900
Uncle Xu, you're done?

368
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,900
Yes.

369
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,900
Mr. Zhi.

370
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,900
Take care of yourself.

371
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,900
Make a video for me every day.

372
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,900
Make a phone call for me every day.

373
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,900
Don't be skinny.

374
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,900
You'll be fat.

375
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,900
Do you hear me?

376
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,900
I know.

377
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,900
You must learn well.

378
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,900
You've never left me

379
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,900
for so long.

380
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,900
Okay.

381
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,900
You're almost there.

382
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,900
Where did he come back?

383
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,900
Yes.

384
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,900
I'm sorry.

385
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,900
Bye.

386
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,900
Bye.

387
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,900
Wait for me.

388
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,900
You must go to Beijing.

389
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,900
Okay.

390
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,900
Bye.

391
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,900
Have a safe trip.

392
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,900
We're here.

393
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,900
Xu Zhi.

394
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,900
Yes.

395
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,900
Hello, my name is Xu Hongzhu.

396
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,900
Hello.

397
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,900
He's from Liu Yisi.

398
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,900
He's from our movie.

399
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,900
Do you need help?

400
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,900
Let me do it.

401
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,900
Thank you.

402
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,900
Thank you.

403
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,900
It's okay.

404
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,900
Thank you.

405
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,900
Thank you.

406
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,900
Thank you.

407
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,900
Thank you.

408
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,900
Thank you.

409
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,900
Thank you.

410
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,900
You're reading this too?

411
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,900
My friend gave it to me.

412
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,900
You're so good at it.

413
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,900
You're not a mortal.

414
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,900
How about we

415
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,900
go to the library together

416
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,900
after school?

417
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,900
Okay.

418
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,900
Hello.

419
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,900
I'm Du Qiilan.

420
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,900
Thank you.

421
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,900
I bought you milk.

422
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,900
Thank you.

423
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,900
Thank you.

424
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,900
You can drink it anytime.

425
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,900
Don't be polite with me.

426
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,900
You mean it?

427
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,900
Yes.

428
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,900
We're from the second-class school.

429
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,900
I studied hard.

430
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,900
I'm a big fan of the library.

431
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,900
We're from a few universities.

432
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,900
When they graduate from the university,

433
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,900
you'll be here.

434
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,900
By the way,

435
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,900
I'm helping you

436
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,900
in the student council.

437
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,400
Many

438
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,900
academicians will come.

439
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,900
Don't be late.

440
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,900
The academician is handsome.

441
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,900
Thank you.

442
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,900
It's okay.

443
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,900
I'm leaving.

444
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,900
You can go if you need help.

445
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,900
Okay, bye.

446
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,900
Bye, thank you.

447
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,900
They're here.

448
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,900
I can help you.

449
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,900
No need.

450
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,820
I can do it myself.

451
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,460
Okay.

452
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,900
I changed my number.

453
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,900
Remember to save it.

454
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,900
I got it.

455
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,900
How did you all live the first day of your retirement?

456
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,900
Da Wu.

457
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,900
Did you change your number to Ruicheng?

458
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,900
No.

459
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,900
I didn't.

460
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,900
I didn't.

461
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,900
I didn't.

462
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,900
Did you change your number to Ruicheng?

463
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,900
Why didn't you say anything?

464
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,900
You forgot about me so soon?

465
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,900
Silly.

466
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,900
Is there a possibility that

467
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,900
they have a real difference?

468
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,900
You're sleeping.

469
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,900
I didn't.

470
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,900
What's wrong?

471
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,900
I didn't.

472
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,900
I didn't.

473
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,900
I didn't.

474
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,900
Mom.

475
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,900
I really need to take a few days.

476
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,900
I can't stay like this.

477
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,900
My hand is going to get stuck.

478
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,900
You've been told by the doctor.

479
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,900
Don't wait for your all the indicators to be normal.

480
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,900
Don't need to fight.

481
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,900
They said I need to rest more.

482
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,900
Mom.

483
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,900
I really need to take a few days.

484
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,900
I can't stay like this.

485
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,900
My hand is going to get stuck.

486
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,900
You've been told by the doctor.

487
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,900
Don't think about it.

488
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,900
You need to take a long time to take your class.

489
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,900
Dad said I can stay.

490
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,900
He said no.

491
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,900
I don't care.

492
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,900
I just need to rest.

493
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,900
I just need to rest.

494
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,900
I want to eat ice cream.

495
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,900
You forgot.

496
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,900
When you were fevered in Ruicheng,

497
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,900
you had ice cream when you woke up.

498
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,900
I don't care.

499
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,900
I just want to eat.

500
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,900
Enough.

501
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,900
Master, the road ahead is turning right.

502
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,900
Stop.

503
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,900
It's still raining.

504
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,900
The cold is coming.

505
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,900
Yes.

506
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,900
Mom.

507
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,900
Do you think

508
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,900
my brother is weird?

509
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,900
I just want to put it all together.

510
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,900
If he had put it all together,

511
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,900
he would have been so angry and scolded me.

512
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,900
He agreed so soon.

513
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,900
Your brother is good to you.

514
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,900
He is not.

515
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,900
I still like his old days.

516
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,900
Since he came back from abroad,

517
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,900
he seems to be not close to me.

518
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,900
You know the boys.

519
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,900
Yeah.

520
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,900
Xuanzhi.

521
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,900
Xuanzhi.

522
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,900
Seize your shape.

523
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,900
I just said that.

524
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,740
It's you.

525
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,500
I've heard from my mom

526
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,540
that you're the best

527
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,740
and the most talented in the family.

528
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,460
You're here alone.

529
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,340
Xu Zhi.

530
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,300
Xu Zhi, take me there.

531
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:21,940
I'll go there first.

532
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,660
Okay.

533
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,180
Okay.

534
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,220
Xu Guangzhu,

535
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,700

00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,700
I'm hungry.

579
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,700
I'm hungry.

580
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,700
I'm hungry.

581
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,700
Where is he going so late?

582
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,700
I don't know.

583
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,700
What are you looking for?

584
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,700
I'm looking for a toilet.

585
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,700
I'll help you to find it.

586
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,700
Xun.

587
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,700
Is this it?

588
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,700
Yes.

589
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,700
Xun.

590
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,700
Xun.

591
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,700
Xun.

592
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,700
Xun.

593
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,700
Xun.

594
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,700
Xun.

595
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,700
Xun.

596
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,700
Xun.

597
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,700
Xun.

598
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,700
Xun.

599
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,700
Xun.

600
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,780
Mrs.

601
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,780
Mrs.

602
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,780
Mrs.

603
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,780
Mrs.

604
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,780
Mrs.

605
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,900
All right.

606
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,900
Thank you.

607
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,180
Thank you.

608
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,020
I don't know.

609
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:54,900
How do you know?

610
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,460
I noticed you when I was singing.

611
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,020
Okay.

612
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,500
Zhizhi.

613
00:28:59,140 --> 00:28:59,740
Li Ke.

614
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,620
You left too soon.

615
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,620
I forgot to tell you.

616
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,460
I met a couple in Qing Yi.

617
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,660
We will meet at the meeting.

618
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,540
I will bring you in.

619
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,460
Okay.

620
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,100
I will leave now.

621
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,660
I am leaving.

622
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,180
Bye.

623
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:09,500
Bye.

624
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,020
Bye.

625
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,020
You are high school classmates.

626
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:19,820
No.

627
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,620
We are all from Qing Yi.

628
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,820
But we are not from high school.

629
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,020
He is my friend.

630
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:24,900
Girlfriend?

631
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,820
She is my ex-girlfriend.

632
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,460
I am leaving.

633
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,740
Hey, Lu Cao.

634
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,380
The situation is full of screwhalvexton.

635
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,100
There is a character named Ji 1943.

636
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,100
You have to be careful,

637
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,100
although you look much more handsome.

638
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,060
Did Xu Zhi think like this?

639
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:15,980
I do not know.

640
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,940
Here comes my hole number.

641
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,140
They may want to hurt me

642
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,620
You said you couldn't go.

643
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,100
You don't have to worry about that.

644
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,740
Why do you have to worry about that?

645
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,220
I don't even have the right to speak.

646
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,220
Is it because of my accident?

647
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:35,700
Yes.

648
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,100
I promised you

649
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,020
that I would send him out when Lu Zhou is 18.

650
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,820
But you saw that we went abroad that time.

651
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:46,740
That little boy was lying in front of us.

652
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,660
He was about the same age as Lu Zhou.

653
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,860
I can't leave my son alone abroad.

654
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,660
I can't go.

655
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,660
But I can go to other countries.

656
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,420
Or

657
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,620
you have already decided.

658
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,740
You don't want him to go out.

659
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,220
You don't believe me.

660
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,260
No matter what I say,

661
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,180
you won't believe me.

662
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,020
I don't believe you?

663
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,340
Because you lied to me when you started.

664
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,140
How could you blame me?

665
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,140
You've been practicing この事情

666
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,380
for more than ten years.

667
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,260
You still Нов候

668
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,380
following every move!

669
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,340
bulbing my head!

670
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,820
of course I will take a turn!

671
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,140
But I'm asking you,

672
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,820
what I did was images of what you have done.

673
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,380
I can't believe you.

674
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,740
If you want to go abroad along the way,

675
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,100
then just leave.

676
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,580
You're leaving?

677
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,180
I won't regret your for technological.

678
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,140
I'm leaving.

679
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,140
I understand.

680
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,140
So you two

681
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,140
have already agreed.

682
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,140
I'm the only one left in the valley.

683
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,140
Li Wen.

684
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,140
Li Donglin!

685
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,140
I'm leaving.

686
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,140
I'm leaving.

687
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,140
I'm Jiang Yu.

688
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,140
Don't lose the important thing next time.

689
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,140
It's okay. It's a small wound.

690
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,140
How about tonight

691
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,140
you go to the new room and sleep?

692
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,140
I'll sleep with her.

693
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,140
I'll sleep with her.

694
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,140
Are you okay?

695
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,140
Many things

696
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,140
even if I explain to you,

697
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,140
you can't understand.

698
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,140
You will stand in your way

699
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,140
and think about us.

700
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,140
Everyone is the same.

701
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,140
Because it's not each other.

702
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,140
I think in this world,

703
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,140
there is no so-called emotional beast.

704
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,140
Because there is no one

705
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,140
who can really understand each other.

706
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,140
Don't make things so complicated.

707
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,140
Have you ever thought that

708
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:35,140
as long as I leave this family,

709
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,140
there will be no more problems?

710
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,140
Don't think so.

711
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,140
This has nothing to do with you.

712
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,140
It's the problem between me and Chen Jisheng.

713
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,140
The problem between me and Chen Jisheng.

714
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,140
Of course, things will be solved.

715
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,140
But I'm also a gentleman now.

716
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,140
I want to make my own decision

717
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,140
from now on.

718
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,140
I want to make my own decision.

719
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,140
Go to sleep.

720
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,140
Brother.

721
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,140
Will my parents really divorce?

722
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,140
Then who are you going to marry?

723
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,140
I won't marry anyone.

724
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,140
Then can I marry you?

725
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,140
Go to sleep.

726
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,140
Go to sleep.

727
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,140
I'm walking through the mountains.

728
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:17,140
The shadow of the river is hidden.

729
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,140
The stars are dancing and breathing.

730
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,140
The whole world is listening.

731
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:26,140
The message of the universe.

732
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,140
Ten thousand miles.

733
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:33,140
Looking for the good old days.

734
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,140
Falling into your eyes.

735
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,140
Ten thousand miles.

736
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:45,140
The shadow of the river is hidden.

737
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,140
Xu Zhi, go over there and grab the wall.

738
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,140
Okay.

739
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,140
Xu Zhi, help me.

740
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,140
Okay.

741
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,140
Thank you.

742
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,140
Do you need any help?

743
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,140
I can do it myself.

744
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,140
Thank you.

745
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:23,140
Well, you just came to the lab.

746
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,140
If you have any questions,

747
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,140
you can ask me at any time.

748
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,140
Okay.

749
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,140
Captain,

750
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,140
come and see how this side looks good.

751
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,140
I have to go to the side to help.

752
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,140
Okay.

753
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,140
This side.

754
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,140
This side.

755
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,140
I just forgot to mention it.

756
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,140
Okay.

757
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,140
Captain.

758
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,140
Captain.

759
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,140
Captain, you are so caring.

760
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,140
Thank you.

761
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,140
Hello, little Cai.

762
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,140
You have time to care about me.

763
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,140
Who told me to be locked up in the prison?

764
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:06,140
It's not that I have the opportunity to see you anytime, okay?

765
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,140
How are you?

766
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,140
I'm fine.

767
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,140
How are you?

768
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,140
Did you meet a common person in Huada?

769
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,140
I'm not that idle.

770
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,140
My mom has a soup with a soup over there.

771
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,140
It's super delicious.

772
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,140
You can buy a bowl of it for more than ten dollars.

773
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,140
Really?

774
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,140
Are you trying to seduce me to go to Beijing?

775
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,140
Come here.

776
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,140
If you are done,

777
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,140
I will sell you the good and good life.

778
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,140
What are you doing?

779
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,140
How is your dad's relationship with you?

780
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,140
To be honest,

781
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:41,140
I think it's good to be able to stay at home with him for a year.

782
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,140
You want to communicate with him so soon?

783
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:48,140
Because I went to the hospital that day.

784
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,140
Come on.

785
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,140
Have some tea.

786
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,140
Cai, where is your Yan Yong?

787
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,140
Hebei.

788
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,140
Hebei is not here.

789
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,140
He is not well.

790
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,140
Where is your dad?

791
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,140
It's so hard to be a widow.

792
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,140
It's not like that.

793
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:10,140
Girls are almost the same in the exam.

794
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,140
It's easy to say that they are good students.

795
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,140
It's more important to marry a good husband in the future.

796
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,140
Right?

797
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,140
How can I say that?

798
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,140
Girls' studies are not important.

799
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:21,140
I used to be too busy.

800
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,140
I didn't have time to take care of her when I was a kid.

801
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,140
It's not important.

802
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,140
This kid is not worse than others.

803
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,140
He is not a stupid kid.

804
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,140
He is independent.

805
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:33,140
He can get into the university he wants to go to.

806
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,140
I think that

807
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:38,140
he is important to marry a good husband in the future.

808
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:41,140
The important thing is that he should be happy.

809
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,140
Right?

810
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,140
It's not about being single.

811
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,140
I think so.

812
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:48,140
If he marries a good husband next time,

813
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,140
he will raise me.

814
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,140
If he doesn't,

815
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,140
I will raise him.

816
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,140
Come on.

817
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,140
Come on.

818
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:06,140
I am a little bit old-fashioned when I hear you say that.

819
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,140
Don't worry.

820
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,140
Your dad cooks so well.

821
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,140
I will definitely make you come home often.

822
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,140
Okay.

823
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,140
Then I will not talk to you first.

824
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,140
I haven't finished yet.

825
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,140
I will hang up now.

826
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,140
Bye.

827
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,140
Bye.

828
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,140
Are you okay?

829
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,140
I'm fine.

830
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,140
It's just a little bit late.

831
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,140
Don't worry.

832
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,140
It's okay.

833
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,140
Just a little bit late.

834
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,140
Don't worry.

835
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,140
I will give you the gift.

836
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,140
Who gave it to you?

837
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,140
He said he didn't know.

838
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,140
I will show Xia Yu as thellä woman.

839
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:14,140
Mr. Xia,

840
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:38,100
are you element어�

841
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,740
I'm afraid you'll be lost

842
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:42,140
The sky is always shining

843
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,140
I can't find you

844
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,140
I'm afraid you'll be lost

845
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,140
Don't be afraid of the lost

846
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,140
Staying in the world

847
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:55,140
You will realize the dream I used to dream of

848
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:59,140
Open your eyes and look at the wind

849
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:02,140
I'm with you

850
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:07,140
You look at this city and keep smiling

851
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:11,140
The light of the dormitory is dim

852
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:15,140
I believe you can't find the reason

853
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:18,140
I won't answer your questions

854
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:22,140
I'm with you

855
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:26,140
I'm with you

856
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:30,140
I'm with you

857
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:34,140
We are still in the same world

858
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:38,140
We are still in the same world

859
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:07,140
I'm with you

860
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:33,140
Just woke up, you said you wanted to see me

861
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,860
Did you bring the medicine?

862
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,900
Xu Zhi, did you receive the medicine?

863
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:45,340
Yes.

864
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:47,180
How did you know I had it?

865
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,700
I didn't have my eye line.

866
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:51,820
I'm sorry.

867
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:52,940
I don't know much,

868
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:54,140
so I bought a bottle of it.

869
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:55,820
The joint pain of the outer corner

870
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,180
and the swelling are normal.

871
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,100
Look at the outside.

872
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,340
What can you use to find it?

873
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:01,820
Thank you.

874
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,020
You're welcome.

875
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,060
We're old friends.

876
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,460
You're a friend of Lu Cao.

877
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:07,380
You should be.

878
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:10,980
What am I thinking?

879
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:13,100
Chen Ruozhou is in Rui City.

880
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:15,140
How could he appear in front of me?

881
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:34,860
Honey.

882
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,260
Come over.

883
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,260
It's okay, it's okay.

884
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:49,260
The store is open.

885
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,260
I think there's no new store.

886
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,260
Thanks.

887
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,260
It's not a big deal.

888
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,260
I just didn't expect that

889
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,260
there's a time when

890
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:07,260
you can't even take a walk.

891
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,260
I have to buy a medicine.

892
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:10,260
I'm so worried.

893
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:11,260
If I say I really like it,

894
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:13,260
I'll be so upset.

895
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,260
There's no need to worry about the medical practice.

896
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,260
I'll be your eye-catching.

897
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,260
I have something to do.

898
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:21,260
I'll talk to you later.

899
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:22,260
I'll hang up.

900
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,260
I'm so worried.

901
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:49,260
I'm so worried.

902
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,260
I'm so worried.

903
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:53,260
I'm so worried.

904
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:55,260
I'm so worried.

905
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,260
I'm so worried.

906
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:59,260
I'm so worried.

907
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:01,260
I'm so worried.

908
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,260
I'm so worried.

909
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:05,260
I'm so worried.

910
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,260
I'm so worried.

911
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,260
I'm so worried.

912
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,260
I'm so worried.

913
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:13,260
I'm so worried.

914
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:18,260
Like a cloud in the tree

915
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:26,260
Free to go through the weather

916
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:32,260
The world is too quiet

917
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:39,260
Let go of all the sound

918
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:44,260
Who will be in the light

919
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:51,260
Be careful not to fall into the fog

920
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:56,260
The air is cold

921
00:47:56,260 --> 00:48:02,260
Let the world become a concern

922
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:07,260
I think I know

923
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:15,260
Don't worry about the medicine

924
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:18,260
Tell you we are in this world

925
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:22,260
Despite life

926
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:26,260
I live

927
00:48:56,260 --> 00:49:00,260
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you

928
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:04,260
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you

929
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:08,260
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you

930
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:12,260
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you

931
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:16,260
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you

932
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:20,260
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you

933
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:24,260
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you

934
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:28,260
In your eyes

935
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:32,260
I see myself

936
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:36,260
Into you

937
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:39,260
Into you
