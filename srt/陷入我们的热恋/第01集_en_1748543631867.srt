Prepare a punch

3
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,460
Use your slipper

4
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,060
Apply년 그렇게

5
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,540
These words took the blow

6
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,240
It's over

7
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,640
I'll watch this

8
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:48,820
Feels good

9
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,180
Our couple is together

10
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,260
This is awesome

11
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,180
Wonderful

12
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,540

My friend

15
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,380
I'm going to the teacher's.

16
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,380
Actually,

17
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,380
the part of the one-meter is a bit too much for Qing Mi.

18
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,380
But the pity is that Tan Xu

19
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,380
is probably not as strong as he is.

20
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,380
If there is a chance,

21
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,380
you can be more open-minded.

22
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,380
Okay.

23
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,380
Tan Xu.

24
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,380
I'm going to the teacher's.

25
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,380
I'm going to the teacher's.

26
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,380
I'm going to the teacher's.

27
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,380
Tan Xu.

28
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,380
Tan Xu.

29
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,380
Tan Xu,

30
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,380
see you tomorrow.

31
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,380
Talk to you later.

32
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,380
I'll be there.

33
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,380
How can it be that you're not me?

34
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,380
Don't be so picky.

35
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,380
Can you make me feel any more confident in the city?

36
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,380
How dare you be so picky?

37
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,380
Xu Zhi,

38
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,380
can you make me feel any more confident?

39
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,380
Why does this voice sound like mom?

40
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,380
If I didn't come today,

41
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,500
What will you do?

42
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,580
I'm not not allowed to talk to you.

43
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,500
But don't do it.

44
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,020
You're making a bunch of mess.

45
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,300
I'll go and clean it up for you.

46
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,660
Isn't that good?

47
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,260
You don't have to be so hard-hearted

48
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,380
to send me abroad.

49
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,340
Don't be so harsh.

50
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,260
I'm not afraid of you.

51
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,860
You didn't look like this

52
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,860
when you first came here.

53
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,540
Before you left,

54
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,900
you must deal with

55
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,780
these messy things.

56
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:49,700
Oh my god.

57
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,060
I'm so jealous.

58
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,860
It must be a secret in apologize.

59
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,020
Yu Whe Weng,

60
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,900

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,100
ah

62
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,500
It's the cost of rich.

63
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,420
Haven't you caused it?

64
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:11,580
hurry up

65
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,300

70
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,260
I'm not going to get up.

71
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,340
What are you doing standing there?

72
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,740
It's daytime.

73
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,060
Why are you wearing a curtain?

74
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,580
Go change your clothes.

75
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,100
Professor Jiang wrote you a recommendation letter.

76
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,180
We need to thank them.

77
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,820
I just played a game with Chen Xingqi last night.

78
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,540
I can't be so upset.

79
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,020
Don't be me.

80
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,900
Let me join the national team.

81
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,420
I'll be 18 years old.

82
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,420
Chen Luozhou,

83
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,340
can you be more serious?

84
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,500
Why not?

85
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,540
I haven't said anything more serious.

86
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,060
But I've never been tired of you.

87
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,020
I'm happy with you

88
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,780
when I'm rich and abroad.

89
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,100
I'm a mother's boy.

90
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,580
Okay, I promise.

91
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,780
I'll let you know when I find a girlfriend.

92
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,540
Okay?

93
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,900
I'm going to bed.

94
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,220
You're going to bed?

95
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,700
You really take this place as your home?

96
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,580
The exam is over.

97
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,700
Move back.

98
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,100
Move back? Forget it.

99
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,180
I'm going abroad soon.

100
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,340
I'll move back.

101
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,500
You don't have to bother me.

102
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,100
meaningful

103
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,660

104
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,900
Uncle, what's up?

105
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,100
You wait me in the growth zone.

106
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,880
I'll be there right away.

107
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,420
Got it?

108
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,660
How pretty you are.

109
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:13,760
You...

110
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,000
It'll be too late to sovereignty.

111
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
It's your time.

112
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,500
Don't worry.

113
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,300
I'll give you.

114
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Thanks.

115
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,800
Here, have some tea.

116
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,700
Add some wine.

117
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,600
My wife asked me to

118
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,200
serve you.

119
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,220
Thank you.

120
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,300
I did this for Li Shan.

121
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,480
How are you going to thank me?

122
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Your mother's centimeter?

123
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,940
Inside Chen Lu Zhou's house, troolt your mother?

124
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,980
Brother, it turns out you like this type.

125
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,820
I see.

126
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,580
So you like this type of person.

127
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,020
Hu Xiaolusi,

128
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,100
has Gu Yan gone to you?

129
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,820
Zhu Yangqi.

130
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,260
This can't be true.

131
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,500
Gu Yan is hiding from me.

132
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,500
Where is he staying?

133
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,500
He said he was being humiliated

134
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,220
and violated your dating schedule.

135
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,620
Then he was kicked out by his friends.

136
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,180
If he was hit by a stone,

137
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,420
he said he couldn't be an actor.

138
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,020
And the movie school was all over.

139
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,500
I was so nervous when I heard it.

140
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,620
So you gave him my address directly?

141
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,460
Zhu Yangqi,

142
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,020
do you think

143
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,700
I can't find a girlfriend for the rest of my life?

144
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,180
So serious?

145
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,060
Cheng Luzhou,

146
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,060
I really like you.

147
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,300
Can you make me your boyfriend?

148
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,220
I don't want to.

149
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,740
Why?

150
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,940
You like him too.

151
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,180
Why not?

152
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,060
I don't feel like you.

153
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,660
Then?

154
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,740
Then my mom came.

155
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,580
So exciting.

156
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,900
You're the best in the world.

157
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,740
Zhu Yangqi, Zhu Yangqi.

158
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,700
You disappoint me.

159
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,500
Don't give me another address.

160
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,020
I see.

161
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:43,860
I know.

162
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,420
I'm not.

163
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,860
I won't do it again.

164
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:50,860
But

165
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,020
many people say you're in love.

166
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,500
They say

167
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,780
you can't be a good girl

168
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,300
because of your language.

169
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,260
I'm not good at

170
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,300
how I can be good at others.

171
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,460
I'm not good at it.

172
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:03,700
Let's go.

173
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,020
I'm not going in.

174
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:06,620
Here.

175
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:08,620
Wait.

176
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,620
Wait a minute. I'll treat you to barbecue.

177
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,420
barbecue?

178
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:13,660
No.

179
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,220
Let's go, boss.

180
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:15,780
I'm not going.

181
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,340
Grandma, dad.

182
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,140
I'm back.

183
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,420
Sister.

184
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,940
Where have you been all day?

185
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,380
I've been in the military.

186
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,020
What?

187
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,540
You're not married?

188
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,140
Yes.

189
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,420
You're leaving for the military.

190
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,980
You're leaving here.

191
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,260
You're even worse than me.

192
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,060
You're here.

193
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,020
You're in the military.

194
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:44,980
Yes.

195
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,580
Why can't you learn it?

196
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,140
Yingying, get some.

197
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,860
You're quite concerned about the food.

198
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,220
You're a good student.

199
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,180
I'm afraid she'll be upset

200
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,220
after she finds out.

201
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,060
You're right.

202
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,380
Then you should be more concerned about

203
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,100
the director.

204
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:00,980
Really?

205
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,660
It's over.

206
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,940
It's over.

207
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,580
Dad,

208
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,260
I think it's good now.

209
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,300
You have free time.

210
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,620
If I go to the university,

211
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,700
I can go home and cook.

212
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,780
What's the food?

213
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,060
I just finished my lunch.

214
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,260
I haven't had my lunch yet.

215
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,060
What's wrong?

216
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,300
You want to go to Qingda?

217
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,140
Qingda is good.

218
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,260
I'll be there in a few days.

219
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,660
What's so good?

220
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:25,980
Grandma,

221
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,620
are we going to Beijing to have lunch?

222
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,220
Grandma,

223
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:28,820
have your lunch.

224
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,020
What's so good about having lunch?

225
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,620
I'll have lunch after dinner.

226
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,060
You should shower your grandma tonight.

227
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,180
I don't shower.

228
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,380
I'm not going to shower even if I'm here.

229
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,460
I don't shower.

230
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,420
Sit.

231
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,660
If you don't shower,

232
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,620
I won't shower

233
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,820
if you don't shower.

234
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,860
You're done eating.

235
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,820
Let's eat.

236
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,420
Okay.

237
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,300
Grandma,

238
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:55,980
have your meal.

239
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,420
This meat.

240
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,060
It's a little sweet.

241
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:00,980
Grandma,

242
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,460
eat less meat.

243
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,100
It's hot.

244
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,620
You can eat more.

245
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,260
Try it.

246
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,420
I made it.

247
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,980
''Dream Fairy''

248
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:30,740
''Inopod. VS Actress inivot dwellers'

249
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,180
Help me dye my hair

250
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:35,940
with the polish tomorrow.

251
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,340
What about the shampoo?

252
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,020
Hello, everyone.

253
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,380
This is Ying Yingzu's Vlog.

254
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,100
Today, I'm going to introduce

255
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,380
the ten things you must do after graduation.

256
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,460
You can watch the journey

257
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,180
of dyeing your hair and ears

258
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,780
once you say it.

259
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,300
Okay.

260
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,220
What we're going to do today is dyeing your hair.

261
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,180
How dare you say that?

262
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,060
Xu Zhi,

263
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,460
can you please save me?

264
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,060
It's time. It's time.

265
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,420
Mr. Zhi, hurry up.

266
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,220
Help me take a picture.

267
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:08,900
Wait a minute.

268
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,820
I'm going to take a picture.

269
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,820
I'm going to take a picture.

270
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,660
Help me take a picture.

271
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,060
Are you done?

272
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,700
Okay, everyone.

273
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,060
Now, let's introduce my new hair color.

274
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,940
I'm so nervous.

275
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,220
How is it?

276
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,540
Okay, I'll announce that

277
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,140
the ten things you must do after graduation

278
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,420
are dyeing your hair.

279
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,780
Challenge successful.

280
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,860
You can try it

281
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,180
if you want to challenge.

282
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:37,860
How is it?

283
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:38,780
It's good.

284
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,100
Take a look.

285
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,620
It's pretty.

286
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,060
What's wrong?

287
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:52,900
Are you unhappy?

288
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,540
No, I was thinking about something.

289
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:56,900
I have something to ask you.

290
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,860
What?

291
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,820
Do you think

292
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,340
there are two people

293
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,660
who have the same voice in this world?

294
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,900
What do you mean?

295
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,020
I met a aunt yesterday.

296
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,420
Her voice, voice, voice, and mouth are all the same as my mom.

297
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,780
Where did you meet her?

298
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,660
At the house downstairs in the Tanxu Club.

299
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,820
You went to Tanxu?

300
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,780
I went to talk to her

301
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,260
and took my necklace back.

302
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,900
You gave her the necklace?

303
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,180
No, I borrowed it.

304
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,740
She told me before she went to college

305
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,660
that the four-leaf grass represents luck.

306
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,860
So I borrowed it and took it to the exam.

307
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,820
She's not strong enough.

308
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,980
She's lucky.

309
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,300
But she didn't get the exam.

310
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,420
Did she give it back to you?

311
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,260
The person yesterday didn't pick up the phone.

312
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,860
Who did she give it to?

313
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,660
She got the exam herself.

314
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,380
She can't see anyone else.

315
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,620
She didn't get the exam last time.

316
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,620
So she got mad at you.

317
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,940
She was in the PUA.

318
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,980
But she's going to be a doctor.

319
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,060
I want to talk to her.

320
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,260
You want to talk to her?

321
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,020
Don't worry.

322
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,020
I know what to do.

323
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:57,620
After the talk,

324
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,660
I'll go get the necklace.

325
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,540
I'll go with you.

326
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,060
Okay.

327
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,540
Book Two.

328
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:15,840
Write here.

329
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,780
She'll show me her small talk.

330
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,260
Why is your talk very hard?

331
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,460
I know every field.

332
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,740
My teacher taught me a lot.

333
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,080
I didn't ascertain the rage.

334
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,400
Who is the best fit in the world?

335
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,420
No.

336
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,040
Tell me.

337
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,700
What do you want to talk to me?

338
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:42,760
Come in.

339
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,500
Before Chengji has left,

340
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,020
don't think about things so badly.

341
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,220
I invented it since math is a big topic.

342
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,500
You haven't made the такable, right?

343
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,700
What if you feel sad?

344
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,200
I will admit it is my fault.

345
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,780
This girl's secret journey

346
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,760
cheated you.

347
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,980
Many people have not done

348
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,360
this test once before.

349
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,140
I heard they broke through a barrier

350
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,520
ready to pass a graduation exam.

351
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,340
But he doesn't seem to know that you lack the self-sufficiency.

352
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,340
He's also taking advantage of your comfort and non-friend.

353
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,340
How about you tell them?

354
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,140
Why should I tell them?

355
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:19,340
They say that person is lack of a door, but he's kind.

356
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:22,340
He won't be disqualified and doesn't need a girlfriend to comfort him.

357
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,340
His boyfriend is too talented.

358
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,740
Let's go.

359
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,340
You said he asked me to go shopping.

360
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,340
I forgot.

361
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,740
I got my favorite camera, basketball, and drone.

362
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,740
I have everything.

363
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,140
What does it mean?

364
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:43,140
He's also guaranteeing that I can feel the full sincerity.

365
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,140
Okay.

366
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,340
I admit that I can't move.

367
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,740
Good brand, good price,

368
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,140
is in the sky, 618.

369
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,340
So?

370
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,740
What are you going to say?

371
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,740
There's no real hope in the world.

372
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,740
Only the picture of the world that is trapped by thoughts.

373
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,740
You told me that.

374
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,940
I'm very grateful that you helped me to get the homework.

375
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,740
I'm very grateful that you helped me to get the homework.

376
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,340
If you need anything, I want to help you.

377
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,340
No need.

378
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,540
I don't need you to be pitiful.

379
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,340
Tan Xu, I...

380
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,340
Don't be so impulsive, okay?

381
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,740
You came to me today

382
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,540
to ask me to draw a letter with me, right?

383
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,340
You have to go to the reading point.

384
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,140
I'm going to be a copy of the book.

385
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,940
We'll soon be two people in the world.

386
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,540
You don't need to remind me.

387
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,740
I know better than anyone.

388
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,140
You think so?

389
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,540
What if I do?

390
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,340
Anyway, you're done with the exam.

391
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,740
I'm just against you.

392
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,140
I don't have a good price anymore.

393
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,140
You're a man.

394
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,140
Don't be so stubborn.

395
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,340
Since that,

396
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,140
give me back my necklace.

397
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,340
Don't see me again

398
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,140
if you have nothing important to do.

399
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,340
Are you crazy?

400
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,940
Let's go.

401
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,340
Are you okay?

402
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,340
I'm fine.

403
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,740
I didn't find it.

404
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,340
Mr. Zhi,

405
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,540
could it be on this tree?

406
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,940
It's possible.

407
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,540
How can we find it?

408
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,340
Tomatoes?

409
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,340
I won't tell you.

410
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,940
Whether itقي cheese or wafers

411
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,340
is fine for me.

412
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,340
She's beauty.

413
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,940
To fill you into tears.

414
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,140
eyes.

415
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,140
Wencamon?

416
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,340
Don't look at me like that.

417
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,140
The girl is so aggressive

418
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,140
who claims to be her lover.

419
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,100
I promised him

420
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,900
that I would talk to him before I have a girlfriend.

421
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,420
And I'm going abroad.

422
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,300
Why do you come here?

423
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,900
I play video games every day.

424
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:08,980
Then you...

425
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,460
It's not bad to practice in the country.

426
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,860
But I'm poor now.

427
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,740
If my mom can solve my card,

428
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,420
I can think about it.

429
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,900
Otherwise, people will want to see you.

430
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,460
You can't even get a plane ticket.

431
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,220
It's so embarrassing.

432
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,660
I'm just saying.

433
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,900
You're thinking too far.

434
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,060
You're thinking too clearly.

435
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,580
Are you really going to be a judge?

436
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,980
People call me a rebel.

437
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,900
I'm not good at it.

438
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:40,780
Who is it?

439
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:45,820
Coming.

440
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:50,700
What about you?

441
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,860
Lucy. Lucy.

442
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,860
Hurry up.

443
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:56,660
What's wrong?

444
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,380
Pretty little sister is here.

445
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,180
What's up?

446
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,860
I want to ask you for a favor.

447
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:07,900
My necklace

448
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,940
might hang on the tree at your door.

449
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,020
It's not convenient.

450
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,020
Go. Go.

451
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,780
You go in first. I'll be right back.

452
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,580
Don't be shy.

453
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,820
I was blocked by you yesterday.

454
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,700
You're too savage.

455
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,620
I'll kill you.

456
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,260
Why are you looked at?

457
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,500
I'm a Martian.

458
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,340
What are you doing?

459
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,020
You're a Martian?

460
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,020
I'll buy you another one.

461
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,780
That's not appropriate.

462
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,420
I want to see how you can show off your face.

463
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,220
Sorry to bother you.

464
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,020
The fragrance is expensive.

465
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,420
Really?

466
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,420
You have to make a wish.

467
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,420
Otherwise, it will be a waste.

468
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,420
I saw your house yesterday.

469
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,420
It seems like there's a table.

470
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,820
Can you show it to me?

471
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,020
I have a plane at home.

472
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,020
Are you interested?

473
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,820
I'm coming.

474
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,420
Wow.

475
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:28,620
Wow.

476
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,820
Is this a marriage?

477
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,820
He said it's a marriage.

478
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,020
What are you doing, Zhuo Yang?

479
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,020
What else can you do?

480
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,020
Help a pretty sister find a necklace.

481
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,620
Why do you help me use my three-leafed price?

482
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,820
The fragrance is expensive.

483
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,220
Come on, open it.

484
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,420
Don't get hurt.

485
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,020
This necklace is quite expensive.

486
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,020
It's not mine.

487
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,620
Let me do it.

488
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,220
Where is it?

489
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:11,820
You...

490
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,820
I told you to do it.

491
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,020
Where is it?

492
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,820
You have to do it like this.

493
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,420
Where?

494
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,020
Ying Ying, there it is.

495
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,020
There it is.

496
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,020
There it is.

497
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:23,620
There it is.

498
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,020
I saw it.

499
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:24,620
I saw it.

500
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,620
Help me.

501
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,820
It's mine.

502
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,020
Is it him?

503
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,020
Did he break it?

504
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,420
No.

505
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,020
Thank you.

506
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,820
How about I treat you to dinner?

507
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,620
No.

508
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,020
You're so rude.

509
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,820
Are you afraid that we'll be your friends?

510
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,020
We're all

511
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,220
male friends.

512
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,620
He's the most afraid of people.

513
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,220
We're not afraid of the reality.

514
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,020
We're not going to be free if we're male friends.

515
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,620
Bye.

516
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,020
Hurry up.

517
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,540
Yandong,

518
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,220
take it.

519
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,420
Okay, take it.

520
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,420
Jiang Han means

521
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,620
blowing you over.

522
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,280
Dude, give me one glass.

523
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,340
That didn't sound like his mom.

524
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,980
Yeah, that's normal.

525
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:06,980
Okay.

526
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,900
To Papa.

527
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,980
Just focus on what your plan now is.

528
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,880
Then you plan to remind her.

529
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,100
Then you can get paid by her.

530
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:12,780
Where?

531
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,820
You see.

532
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,540
There's a new bookstore in bed.

533
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,120
Really?

534
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,120
Do you like the person who stole the bike?

535
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,120
I also like this director very much.

536
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,120
He has a movie about the pet.

537
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,120
Do you want to watch it?

538
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,120
I'll treat you.

539
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
Treat me?

540
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,120
It's not enough for a meal.

541
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,120
You can treat me.

542
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,120
Then you can't just say it.

543
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,120
I just want to see your mother.

544
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,120
It's okay if you don't want to watch it.

545
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,120
You treat me to dinner.

546
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,120
You don't have to tell your boyfriend.

547
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,120
Can't a boyfriend eat with a doctor?

548
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,120
Good question.

549
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,120
Have a more delicious meal!

550
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,120
Very delicious!

551
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,120
Thanks more.

552
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,120
Anbase milk chopsticks is made by him.

553
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,120
Isibile aspirating vermicelli

554
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,120
basically your business?

555
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,820
As Airbnb

556
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,300
same as Fre acquainted with

557
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,820
the Chrome וא� hui hui hui huuong side dish.

558
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,940
Liu Cheng is not good at it.

559
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,420
I think he is not good at it.

560
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:24,980
Xu Zhi.

561
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:28,940
Cheng Lu.

562
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,020
Are you familiar with Liu Cheng?

563
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,220
No.

564
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,540
Don't misunderstand our Lucy.

565
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,660
She was always the one who was bullied by Dashan.

566
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,900
Why is there a boy named Lucy?

567
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,420
That's because my brother

568
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,580
is so pretty.

569
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,340
When he was young, he was so handsome.

570
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,660
I thought he was a girl.

571
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,660
You are almost the same.

572
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,260
Are you a girl now?

573
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,740
You are handsome now.

574
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,540
Right, Mr. Zhi?

575
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,420
Yes.

576
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,020
I'm still curious about your necklace.

577
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,460
Why did you throw it away?

578
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,260
Well,

579
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,060
because it's high-end.

580
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,940
It's better than his boyfriend.

581
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,660
His boyfriend is not in a good mood.

582
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,860
He is so violent.

583
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,660
He is not like this once or twice.

584
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,980
Mr. Zhi asked him to return to his necklace.

585
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,860
But he threw it away.

586
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,900
He went downstairs.

587
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,420
Xiao Xiao.

588
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,580
People say

589
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,180
don't find your boyfriend in the trash can.

590
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,460
You are good.

591
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,900
Find him in the trash can.

592
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,500
He is asking you about the trash can.

593
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,380
You can't answer the question because of the KPI, right?

594
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,780
I'm just kidding.

595
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,380
He is so handsome.

596
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,100
We are just a group of people.

597
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,100
We don't need to be so mean.

598
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,260
You are from the same group?

599
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,420
Yes.

600
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,340
You don't believe me?

601
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,540
Do you know Zhai Xiao?

602
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,180
Yes.

603
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,180
We play ball together.

604
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,220
What a coincidence.

605
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:03,980
You know him too?

606
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,780
I will tell you the details.

607
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,460
Tell me.

608
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,220
He will be here soon.

609
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,100
Why did he run away?

610
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,420
Big friend.

611
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,420
I'm sorry.

612
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,420
The machine is burning.

613
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,420
I need to wait a bit.

614
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,420
Are you satisfied?

615
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,420
I'll go get the right one.

616
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,420
I won't.

617
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,420
Fine.

618
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,420
If you don't want to,

619
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,420
I'll come again.

620
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,420
You can just give me the right one.

621
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,420
I won't.

622
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,420
I lost to you just now.

623
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,420
You're cheating.

624
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,420
It's a shame that you lost.

625
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,420
I'm sorry.

626
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,420
I'm sorry.

627
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,420
It's a shame that you lost.

628
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,420
It's not good.

629
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,420
Then why are you

630
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,420
cheating on me?

631
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,420
Because you're stupid.

632
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,420
I'm not afraid of O.

633
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,420
Ha, Ha, what's wrong?

634
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,420
Do you believe that

635
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,420
I let O to fix you?

636
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,420
O is the best.

637
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,420
O is the best team member.

638
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,420
Team member?

639
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,420
Isn't the team member

640
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,420
the best team member?

641
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,420
Brother,

642
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,420
you're already a few years old.

643
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,420
You're still a child.

644
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,420
How old am I?

645
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,420
I'm tired of you.

646
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,420
If you don't want to,

647
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,420
I can call you brother.

648
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,420
Enough.

649
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,420
Enough, brother.

650
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,420
I'll get you a new one.

651
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,420
Son.

652
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,420
Son.

653
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,420
What's wrong?

654
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,420
Son, what's wrong?

655
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,420
Dad, he took my seat.

656
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,420
What do you mean?

657
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,420
You're a grown-up.

658
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,420
You took the child's seat.

659
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,420
Are you embarrassed?

660
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,420
I'll go first.

661
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,420
You...

662
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,420
He cheated on me.

663
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,420
I was the one who cheated.

664
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,420
He hit me.

665
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,420
He's so painful.

666
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,420
Where did he hit you?

667
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,420
Where did he hit you?

668
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,420
He...

669
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,420
Listen to me. Where did he hit you?

670
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,420
He cheated on me.

671
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,420
He cheated on you?

672
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,420
He cheated on you?

673
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,420
Okay, kid.

674
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,420
You hit my son, right?

675
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,420
Let's just talk about it.

676
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,420
What do you mean?

677
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,420
What's wrong, brother?

678
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,420
Kid,

679
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,420
where did this brother hit you?

680
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,420
Does it hurt?

681
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,420
Sister, look.

682
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,420
He...

683
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,420
He cheated on me.

684
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,420
He cheated on me.

685
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,420
Brother, your shoes are too clean.

686
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,420
You didn't even put on a white pants.

687
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,420
What do you mean?

688
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,420
Our kid can't be clean.

689
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,420
You cheated on my son, right?

690
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,420
Uncle, don't worry.

691
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,420
I'm reasonable.

692
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,420
I... I'm not worried.

693
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,420
I'm not angry.

694
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,420
Let's be reasonable, right?

695
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,420
Who is uncle?

696
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,420
I'm so old.

697
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,420
He hit our kid.

698
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,420
Thank you, kid.

699
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,420
You...

700
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,420
You're back.

701
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,420
Dad, take a seat.

702
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,420
Slowly.

703
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,420
I didn't expect there are so many people in this store.

704
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,420
Be careful.

705
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,420
Be careful.

706
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,420
My dad is not a good kid.

707
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,420
We don't even dare to go to the toilet.

708
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,420
Luckily, this boy helped us to take a seat.

709
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,420
Here, your ticket.

710
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,420
What's going on?

711
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,420
Where's your bucket?

712
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,420
This...

713
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,420
Is it too late?

714
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,420
This is called a housekeeper.

715
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,420
It's not right to go down.

716
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,420
I'm going to go up and down.

717
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,420
Look.

718
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,420
Sorry.

719
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,420
Let's go home.

720
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,420
Dad, I want to eat some skewers.

721
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,420
I want to make it for you.

722
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,420
She's learning to cook.

723
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,420
Let's go.

724
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,420
Let's go home.

725
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,420
Let's go.

726
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,420
We want to eat skewers.

727
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,420
We can use it.

728
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,420
We can use it.

729
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,420
Thank you.

730
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,420
You're so good at acting.

731
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,420
Is it CLG?

732
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,420
I'll send you the recording.

733
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,420
Why are you looking at me?

734
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,420
My dad works at the hospital.

735
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,420
He's seen a lot of people looking for tea.

736
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,420
He told me that he needs to get used to it.

737
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,420
If he meets someone looking for tea,

738
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,420
he needs to be in a hurry to get the evidence.

739
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,420
Is this the second time you met him?

740
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,420
I thought we were friends

741
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,420
when we introduced ourselves.

742
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,420
You think so?

743
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,420
Of course.

744
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,420
I don't believe you believe that poor boy.

745
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,420
And they're all dead.

746
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,420
You're the only one.

747
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,420
I can't let you suffer.

748
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,420
Right?

749
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,420
What's wrong?

750
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,420
Nothing.

751
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,420
I don't want to eat.

752
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,420
I'm afraid I'll get fat.

753
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,420
You go upstairs first.

754
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,420
I'll look for it.

755
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,420
Didn't you just meet me yesterday?

756
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,420
You miss me again?

757
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,420
No.

758
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,420
I've prepared the materials for the trip.

759
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,420
I want to see you tomorrow afternoon.

760
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,420
Zhe Le.

761
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,420
You don't know which university it is.

762
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,420
It doesn't matter.

763
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,420
You can decide.

764
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,420
No.

765
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,420
It doesn't matter.

766
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,420
What do you want?

767
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,420
I'll hang up.

768
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,420
I'm going to hang up.

769
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,420
When are you going to send the recording to the abroad?

770
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,420
You're leaving the city.

771
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,420
Don't worry.

772
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,420
What's the reason for leaving the city?

773
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:11,420
You didn't want to send it to the abroad?

774
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,420
He's been here for more than ten years.

775
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,420
I've never seen him before.

776
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,420
You've touched his hand.

777
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,420
You've touched his finger.

778
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:26,420
But you didn't turn around to me.

779
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,420
I'm the one who touched his finger.

780
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,420
I'm an outsider.

781
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,420
I'm the same.

782
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,420
You know he's an outsider.

783
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,420
So I suggest you to stay here.

784
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,420
I've been thinking about it since I was a child.

785
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,420
I'm worried that he'll be tired and won't leave.

786
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,420
Mom.

787
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,420
Don't worry.

788
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:52,420
We'll eat the soup from the sixth century.

789
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,420
It's like a small dog.

790
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,420
He should know how to play.

791
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,420
It doesn't matter where I go.

792
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,420
I'm the last person.

793
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,420
I've been thinking about it since I was a child.

794
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:13,420
You're the only one left.

795
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,420
Both his eyes are cured

796
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:20,420
from the terrible wind.

797
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,420
How many Bishop나?

798
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,420
What are you thinking about?

799
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,900
A few days ago,

800
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,820
an auntie came to my house to clean up

801
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,940
and asked me to give her a few questions.

802
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,940
She gave me a bag of sweet potatoes.

803
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,020
If you need anything.

804
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,420
To your house?

805
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,420
Let's go.

806
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,980
Let's go.

807
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:14,780
Ballistic humor is simply not completely new.

808
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:20,840
The town is famous for being the city's best wine

809
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,460
and its very popular wine store?

810
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,860
I don't know which one.

811
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,300
It's none of my business.

812
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,580
It's likecc.

813
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:30,380
For a bit, it might be tasty.

814
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,900
Can I take off by my side?

815
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,580
Yes, sure.

816
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:42,460
Tekyung PT

817
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,700
The umbrella isn't small anymore.

818
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,140
Let's sit at ease there.

819
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,500
Thank you.

820
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,460
I love you.

821
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,100
Do you hate the rainy day?

822
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,580
I hate it very much.

823
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,940
If I knew it was rainy,

824
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:15,980
I wouldn't go out.

825
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:16,820
What about you?

826
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,940
I love the rainy day.

827
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,020
If I don't go out,

828
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:20,900
I won't go out.

829
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,740
Do you still like to walk on the rain?

830
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,140
You need to walk 45 degrees to the sky.

831
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,380
This way, you can't tell if it's rain or tear.

832
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,660
You won't feel sad.

833
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,580
You know so much.

834
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,180
What's good about it?

835
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,580
There are too many good things to do today.

836
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,380
For example, when I was a kid,

837
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,380
my parents took me out for fun.

838
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,380
They let me write homework at home alone.

839
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,580
As a result, I just got out of the house,

840
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,580
had a big rain,

841
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,580
and all the soups in the city were back.

842
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,380
What I said was,

843
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,980
you don't have to take me with you.

844
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,980
Isn't it interesting?

845
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,380
You're quite comfortable.

846
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,580
Life is already so hard.

847
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,380
You have to have some kind of self-satisfaction.

848
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,580
What about you?

849
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,980
Why don't you like Xia Li?

850
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,180
I don't want to sign it.

851
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,380
Don't even think about it.

852
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,380
Why?

853
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,380
I've been in the training for so long

854
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,980
just for this competition.

855
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,980
Look at this.

856
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,380
What's the wound?

857
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,780
Next time, you'll get hurt.

858
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,180
You'll get brain injury.

859
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,180
I'm helmet-headed.

860
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:49,980
Besides,

861
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,180
I've never been injured by any professional player.

862
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,380
You can sign it for me.

863
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,180
No way.

864
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:54,980
Forget it.

865
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,980
I'll pay you.

866
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,380
It's all that Xu Guangji

867
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,380
who made you get used to it.

868
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,780
I almost got married

869
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,380
when I was a kid.

870
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,580
I became a devil when I grew up.

871
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,180
You made yourself fall like this.

872
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,180
You never let me save my heart.

873
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,580
OK.

874
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:11,900
Stop.

875
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,220
If you get hurt again then do not go home.

876
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,760
Question the sadness of my mother.

877
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,520
I don't know about it.

878
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,220
What should I do now?

879
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,000
So it's a dream.

880
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,120
Damn it.

881
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:03,800
Hello?

882
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,820
Why hasn't mom answered the call?

883
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,620
She's going to stand in front of aizes

884
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,940
the people waiting for her.

885
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:11,980
She takes good care of it.

886
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,060
Why is she asking Dr. Guo?

887
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,500
Can't do that.

888
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,100
Why are you asking her?

889
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,380
It'saan for everyone.

890
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:18,820
Don't worry.

891
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:19,620
I'll behave like my daughter.

892
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:20,660
Give me some.

893
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,460
Well!

894
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,660
Let's go.

895
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:29,300
Go.

896
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:30,860
Thanks.

897
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,180
This way, please.

898
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,460
I even checked in

899
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,000
which escalator

900
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,200
I didn't ask you just now.

901
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,720
Is your mother at home?

902
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,880
Do you want her to be here or not?

903
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,480
If you want to see my mother,

904
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,680
you should be disappointed.

905
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,480
She doesn't live with me.

906
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,480
It's a pity.

907
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,840
But,

908
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,320
when aunt Xia Zha comes,

909
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,680
you should keep a seat for me.

910
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,040
Then you have to buy tickets today.

911
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
How much is it?

912
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,920
Sit down.

913
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,200
It doesn't matter.

914
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,360
Yes.

915
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,440
These tickets are for you.

916
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,600
Thanks.

917
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,200
Miss Xia Zha,

918
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,280
I have to pick you up.

919
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,440
I was really wondering

920
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,040
if you are leaving last time.

921
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,760
You're not leaving last time?

922
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,360
Yes.

923
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,320
Your mother is here.

924
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,560
I got all kinds of things here.

925
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,560
But,

926
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,760
You want to take the test at my place?

927
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,560
Can I?

928
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,760
My place doesn't have a Weibo account.

929
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,160
Really?

930
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:41,760
Really.

931
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,960
Our old madam thinks there's a service.

932
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,160
She won't let you do it.

933
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,760
There are a few more.

934
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,760
Two is enough.

935
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,160
Don't...

936
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:53,760
Okay.

937
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,560
Okay.

938
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,960
Do you usually cook?

939
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,960
I cook instant noodles.

940
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,960
Then your mother usually comes to cook for you?

941
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,960
She's here to serve the meal.

942
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,960
Is that okay?

943
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,160
Chen Yuzheng is so impulsive.

944
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,560
Then add a WeChat first.

945
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,160
My phone is dead.
