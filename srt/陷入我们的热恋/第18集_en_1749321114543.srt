1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
If there is only one rose in the world

2
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,920
Once you have left

3
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,180
I will accept you

4
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,640
I kinda like her.

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,680
Very Plaid.

6
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,280
I can't meet them because no one can say they're here

7
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,560
if I send a message.

8
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,160
Sorry.

9
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,880
That fact.

10
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,320
Good thing you didn't reply immediately.

11
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,280
Good thing that I can keep煮 feedback on.

12
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,520
Women like to move the oral ointment

13
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,000
to mind and세 light fish.

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,440
You're sorry.

15
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,760
You're right.

16
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,120
Okay.

17
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,520
I see.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,280
Wait a sec!

19
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,280
Give me my skin Laurence?

20
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,960
Whale?

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,860
What should you say to me?

22
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,080
You know am I a fairy?

23
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,920
What kind of fairy am I?

24
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,980
Fairy, what are your feelings and thoughts?

25
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,540
Are you a fairy?

26
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,160
Beauty loves universe

27
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,120
Beauty loves heaven

28
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,960
Mom has an entire school

29
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,640
And I am a fan of your intro

30
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,960
How many years have you been a fan of yours?

31
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,200
OK, how many years

32
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,660
recreational surroundings

33
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,280
Close the door

34
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,440
Let's take a good look.

35
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:13,960
I promised you before

36
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,240
that I will write my painting

37
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,280
withgradation moderately to make it fun.

38
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,000
Because I'm fined

39
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,040
by the KTV today.

40
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,960
Please remove your paper

41
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,280
if you like.

42
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,680
And then direct it.

43
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,200
I've met your mom before.

44
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,200
I never told you.

45
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,200
But don't worry.

46
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,200
She didn't say anything serious to me.

47
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,200
She didn't give me water.

48
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,200
But this is a pity.

49
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,200
You're not a good girl.

50
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,200
But since the beginning,

51
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,200
I can feel that she loves you.

52
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,200
Every word is on your mind.

53
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
She always says

54
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,200
she has a good son.

55
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,200
She has a good son.

56
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,200
And your mom also said

57
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,200
our relationship

58
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,200
was just a impulse.

59
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,200
Don't worry.

60
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,200
I'll always react to her.

61
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,200
She'll say no to me.

62
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,200
But then I thought

63
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,200
we were just a month old.

64
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,200
The heat wave was really impulsive.

65
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,200
No one can leave the fruit.

66
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,200
So in the end,

67
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,200
I didn't open the door.

68
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,200
I was afraid that

69
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,200
I'd be in the wind.

70
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,200
You'd really be in a relationship with your family.

71
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,200
When I returned to the house,

72
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
I found that Xu Zhi

73
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,200
wasn't as good as you thought.

74
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,200
You might regret it.

75
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,200
So I dare not call you

76
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,200
and miss you.

77
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,200
I'm afraid that

78
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,200
I'll be in a bad mood

79
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,200
and have to go through the mountains.

80
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,200
Because I don't want you to be poisoned

81
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,200
and you to be played by Dancheng.

82
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,200
Chen Lu Zhou,

83
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,200
if I just want to be in a relationship with you,

84
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,200
I can totally say no to you.

85
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,200
I admit that

86
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,200
it's romantic.

87
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,200
But I want to be with you

88
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,200
and be with you forever.

89
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
I always think

90
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,200
love is not just

91
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,200
the impulse and romance of regret.

92
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,200
Love should make it more emotional.

93
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,200
It's not bad.

94
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
Do you remember

95
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,200
the night you went to see the summer house?

96
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,200
After we broke up,

97
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,200
I went to see

98
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,200
the sculptor

99
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,200
who expressed the most

100
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,200
intense love in the world.

101
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
I want to make a call

102
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,200
this time.

103
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,200
If there is only one last rose in the world,

104
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
I will be 80 years old

105
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
and I will take the rose

106
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,200
and take it all for you.

107
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
After all,

108
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,200
my boyfriend Chen Jiaojiao

109
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,200
is a romantic little poem.

110
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,200
Let the moonlight

111
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,200
chase the heart of the sky.

112
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,200
The red rice in the heart

113
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:02,200
is like a roll of rice.

114
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
Crush

115
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,200
When the night is dark,

116
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,200
meet your name.

117
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,200
Crush

118
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,200
When the night is dark,

119
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,200
meet your name.

120
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,200
What does

121
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,200
the boyfriend Chen Jiaojiao mean?

122
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,200
So am I your boyfriend now?

123
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,200
Aren't you not

124
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,200
denying that you are Chen Jiaojiao?

125
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,200
I will go to the next time.

126
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,200
I will go to the next time.

127
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
Don't ask me that.

128
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
Okay?

129
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
Didn't my mom give you money?

130
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,200
Are you sad?

131
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,200
It's not sad either.

132
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,200
It's not disappointing either.

133
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,200
I just feel

134
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,200
she is not in a good mood.

135
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
I want to say it anyway.

136
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
What?

137
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
I mean

138
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,200
I spent Chen Ruizhou's child.

139
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
I plan to give birth.

140
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,200
The mental loss and the mental loss

141
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
of the adoptive husband

142
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,200
will definitely be bad.

143
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,200
I will add some more.

144
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,200
If our child grows up,

145
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
I will give you a refund

146
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,200
if I have a son.

147
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,200
You like to play with me, right?

148
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
You are a man.

149
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
You have been

150
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
calling me

151
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
for so long.

152
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
Do you really miss me?

153
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Do you really miss me?

154
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
You really miss me?

155
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
You called me

156
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,200
just because you miss me.

157
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,200
You said I was pregnant.

158
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
I...

159
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
What are you talking about?

160
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Why did you wait for me

161
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
to leave

162
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
just now?

163
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,200
You are angry, right?

164
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
It's a good thing

165
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,200
I wrote it.

166
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,200
I wrote it.

167
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,200
Tell me the truth.

168
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,200
Did you feel anything

169
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,200
when you saw me for the first time?

170
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,200
If I say no,

171
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,200
you might not believe me.

172
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,200
But, it's true.

173
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,200
I was in the house.

174
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,200
Your mother was in the training room.

175
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,200
She thought you were not good.

176
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,200
She wanted to send you abroad.

177
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,200
Actually, I was not

178
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
willing to contact you at that time.

179
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
I was afraid that you would be like Tan Xu.

180
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
If you were not good,

181
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
you would be in a bad mood.

182
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,200
Seeing other people is good.

183
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
I was not in a good mood.

184
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
At that time,

185
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,200
I thought that

186
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
a 18-year-old boy

187
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
really didn't get into trouble.

188
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
He would do anything

189
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,200
except talking.

190
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
So, at that time,

191
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
I still had to

192
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
talk about the result.

193
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,200
But, I found out later that

194
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,200
not all 18-year-old boys

195
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,200
were that beautiful.

196
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
Then,

197
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,200
I was praised.

198
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,200
That's right.

199
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,200
Tan Xu came to me.

200
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,200
He told me

201
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,200
that his abdomen was too strong.

202
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,200
He wanted to make a big move.

203
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,200
I didn't tell you

204
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
because

205
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
you didn't care about

206
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Jiang Yu before.

207
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,200
How can Tan Xu

208
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,200
and Jiang Yu

209
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,200
have a relationship

210
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,200
with each other?

211
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
I thought you didn't care.

212
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,200
Why do I think

213
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,200
Zhu Yanqi is more handsome than Jiang Yu?

214
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,200
Really?

215
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
Shouldn't you be

216
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,200
worried about Zhu Yanqi?

217
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,200
It's okay if you didn't have a certain relationship before.

218
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
But now,

219
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,200
if Tan Xu comes to you again,

220
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,200
what do you say?

221
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
I'll tell him that

222
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,200
my boyfriend is a super

223
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,200
invincible and fast-paced guy

224
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,200
who is not good at making mistakes.

225
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Why don't you talk to him first?

226
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
That's good enough.

227
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,200
By the way,

228
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,200
you have to follow the standard

229
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,200
of your vice-president Jiang.

230
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,200
No problem.

231
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,200
Hello, Lucy.

232
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,200
What's wrong?

233
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,200
Don't mention it.

234
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,200
I can't breathe.

235
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
What's wrong?

236
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,200
Your clothes are tight.

237
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
No.

238
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200
It's my girlfriend.

239
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
She confessed to me just now.

240
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
My friend?

241
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
I'm not your friend.

242
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
I'm your friend.

243
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,200
I'm your friend.

244
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,200
I'm your friend.

245
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,200
I'm your friend.

246
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
I'm your friend.

247
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
My friend?

248
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,200
You two are good friends.

249
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
You're a good boy.

250
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
You think I'm not me?

251
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,200
And your sister Cai.

252
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
Listen to me.

253
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
When can you be so stubborn?

254
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,200
You're a dog.

255
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
How about you ask me for two months?

256
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,200
I think I'm a little bit unrealistic.

257
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,200
Okay.

258
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
Tell me.

259
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
Don't talk nonsense.

260
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,200
Pack your bags and go home.

261
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,200
We haven't come home

262
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
until now.

263
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,200
What's wrong?

264
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,200
You're so rich.

265
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,200
You're so good at waiting.

266
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,200
You're so good at playing.

267
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,200
You're so good at catching people.

268
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,200
You're so good at helping.

269
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,200
You're so good at helping.

270
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
And you're so good at picking up.

271
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,200
Okay.

272
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,200
Send me the photo.

273
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
I'll hang up.

274
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,200
Okay. Bye.

275
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,200
Bye.

276
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,200
Finally.

277
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,200
I'm running out of time.

278
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,200
Oh no.

279
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
I can't get in.

280
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,200
Do you have a back door?

281
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,200
Yes.

282
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
Where?

283
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Over there.

284
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
Go.

285
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
Go.

286
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,200
Right here.

287
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
I'm out of clothes.

288
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,200
What are you doing?

289
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Hurry up.

290
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
You'll be found out later.

291
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,200
That's it.

292
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,200
Why are you kidding me?

293
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,200
You're not good at catching people.

294
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,200
I'm heavy.

295
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
You're so good at picking up.

296
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,200
What are you afraid of?

297
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
Hurry up.

298
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
I'll go up.

299
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,200
Go.

300
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,200
I'm stepping on it.

301
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,200
I'm stepping on it.

302
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,200
Go.

303
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,200
Go.

304
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
Don't look at me.

305
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
I'm not looking.

306
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,200
I'm not looking.

307
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,200
So high.

308
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,200
You should have your feet crossed.

309
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
I'm not looking.

310
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,200
Chenggong.

311
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,200
Are you okay?

312
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,200
I'm fine.

313
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,200
Wait a minute.

314
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,200
Hold on.

315
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,200
Your bag.

316
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,200
I'll give you a shirt.

317
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
Take it out.

318
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
I'm afraid you'll get cold.

319
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
Okay.

320
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,200
I'll go now.

321
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,200
I'll go now.

322
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,200
You...

323
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,200
Have a good rest.

324
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,200
Okay.

325
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,200
You too.

326
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,200
You're too thin now.

327
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,200
You must eat more when you're in the exam.

328
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,200
Keep your physical strength.

329
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
You should take the exam tomorrow.

330
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,200
I'm leaving.

331
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,200
Good night.

332
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,200
You should do your best.

333
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,200
You should have your own skills.

334
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,200
Don't be stubborn.

335
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,200
I...

336
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,200
I don't need time for myself today.

337
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,200
Why do you want to go back and forth with me?

338
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,200
Don't be so路id with me.

339
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,200
Subscribe me.

340
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,200
It'll be a live chat beat.

341
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,200
Got it.

342
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,040
I'm afraid.

343
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,000
I want to thank you.

344
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,840
Stop it.

345
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,560
I almost ate you last time.

346
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,480
Are you afraid of me?

347
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,680
I'm afraid of death.

348
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,880
Why didn't you see me before?

349
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,360
You know the kiss.

350
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,120
What about next?

351
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,040
Do you want to pick it up?

352
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,200
I'll see your performance.

353
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,600
Okay.

354
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,240
Please wait for me.

355
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,280
Do you want to go to the library later?

356
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,560
I've been busy with my maintenance and score.

357
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,800
I didn't manage other subjects.

358
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,960
Li Ke is trying to woo me again.

359
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,200
Look.

360
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,400
What time is it?

361
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,480
You guys are so professional.

362
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,400
When I was in the college entrance exam,

363
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,400
I didn't agree to it.

364
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,680
The school bar in different places

365
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,840
couldn't be seen properly.

366
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,560
Now I'm in the middle of it.

367
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,640
I've agreed to it.

368
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,680
Everyone wants to see their own level.

369
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,600
It's a high or low level.

370
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,360
Go to the library with me later.

371
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,800
We have to hurry up.

372
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,080
It's not easy to compete with the parents.

373
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,000
Here.

374
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,720
The library is opening.

375
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,120
The door is open.

376
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,520
You guys,

377
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,080
are so similar to each other.

378
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,840
Tell me.

379
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,320
Where in the world am I staying at?

380
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,880
I'm telling you,

381
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,080
even if you didn't go back to the dormitory twice,

382
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,520
everyone in the whole dorm would know you're in there.

383
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,080
Really?

384
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,140
I think you've brought

385
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,260
your boss to the dorm with you.

386
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,880
Why are there so many gossipers?

387
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,960
How could it be me?

388
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,320
Am I that kind of person?

389
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,880
Zhao... Zhao Jinqi, right?

390
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,240
Okay.

391
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,440
Zhu Yanqian is here.

392
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,360
I've been staying at his hotel for two days.

393
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,080
A strong smell.

394
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,800
Be careful.

395
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,160
I only have one girlfriend.

396
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,160
Don't get hurt.

397
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,680
Let him have a talk.

398
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,960
I heard you say one is not enough.

399
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,720
You... You two...

400
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Are you sure?

401
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,080
You're quite a man.

402
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,200
You insisted on coming to the library to study with me.

403
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,200
You're not taking the elevator as a test.

404
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,280
No, Chen Luzheng.

405
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,840
You've blown the cow away.

406
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,040
What's the point of arguing?

407
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,160
Sit down.

408
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,400
He's still here.

409
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,160
Little black horse is a little black horse.

410
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,440
Look at his heart.

411
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,720
He's so lazy.

412
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,920
He's much better than you.

413
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,920
I'm the first one to know.

414
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,040
No.

415
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,960
Second,

416
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,280
when we decided to get a call from Zhu Yanqi,

417
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,120
I...

418
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,640
Third,

419
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,240
when the food was already served, you were next to me.

420
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,240
I'm sorry.

421
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,080
You slept with Zhu Yanqi for a long time.

422
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,160
You still need to call him?

423
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,160
I have a lot of calls.

424
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,480
Can't I?

425
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,800
Sure.

426
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm looking for someone to promote you.

427
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:14,440
Let me state before you.

428
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,040
Hua Dao did a great job and committed surgery.

429
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,220
Zhang Yun from He Dong city asked me yesterday

430
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,920
about your pass that equals a certain number.

431
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,400
They knew you got a marks from a certificate

432
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,120
from other countries,

433
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,240
and they followed you.

434
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,280
Don't worry too much.

435
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,560
If theiryou keep pointing it like this,

436
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,400
I won't stand once again.

437
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,440
I knew I was in the party,

438
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,440
If I knew.

439
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,920
How do you take this ring to me?

440
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,160
This girl.

441
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,520
I don't pay much attention to

442
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,540
guys trying to get in.

443
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,640
Let's go.

444
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,560
Get it on the cart.

445
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,980
ברang, get off.

446
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,220
Bye.

447
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,220
Kisses.

448
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,520
Drop the chocolate.

449
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,300
You don't pay.

450
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,260
No, I'm not.

451
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,340
Whyama?

452
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,600
Longer and long.

453
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,720
You keeps heavier.

454
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,800
Give me.

455
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,860
Lucy,

456
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,100
we make it in my revenge.

457
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,760
Nothing but revenge.

458
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,020
We're only at the middle of the boat.

459
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:39,860
How can we ig.

460
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,040
It's okay.

461
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,040
I'll eat some food

462
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,440
and move to your school.

463
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,840
I didn't have any classes anyway.

464
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,040
It's convenient to take a rest.

465
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,440
Have you ever thought about me?

466
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,240
Is it convenient?

467
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,640
Are you thinking of making a move?

468
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,240
It's okay.

469
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,840
I live with you two.

470
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,440
No problem.

471
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,040
Uncle Ye, you're really not welcome.

472
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:03,840
I've got a lot of money.

473
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,840
I'm preparing for a professional course.

474
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,440
I have to make up for many classes.

475
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,440
I'll be more efficient in the school.

476
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,040
You really want to be a professional?

477
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,040
Let's wait and see.

478
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,040
Let's make a move.

479
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,640
I'm going to move out with Ke Ke.

480
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,240
I know he's planning to start a business.

481
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,440
You can come over later.

482
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,640
How about you, little pig?

483
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,840
You're still in the father's plan.

484
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,240
Don't be so anxious.

485
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,040
You're still saying I'll have some money?

486
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,840
Tony, Andy, Nancy.

487
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,240
You're the one in the painting.

488
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,040
You don't have enough money.

489
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,840
And Ke Ke.

490
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,640
Look at you.

491
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,640
You can't say that.

492
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,640
What can I compare with him?

493
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,640
Do you know how many

494
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,640
of your family's top-notch fans?

495
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,640
Full fans.

496
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,640
Only one of them.

497
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,240
That's really impressive.

498
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,040
But,

499
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,440
it's similar to our Lucy.

500
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,640
She's a little bit different.

501
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,840
She's a little bit different.

502
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,240
She's just a little bit different.

503
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,640
Don't be so serious.

504
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,240
Yu Jing is too big.

505
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,440
She's only 96.

506
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,240
Do you think you're not attractive enough?

507
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,840
She's not that good at dating.

508
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,240
Your experience is really not as good as before.

509
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,440
How can I not be as good as before?

510
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,440
Say it.

511
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,440
How can I not be as good as before?

512
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,640
I'm the last one to get in.

513
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,840
You two are so lucky today.

514
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:16,840
Yu Jing, Yu Jing.

515
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,440
Go, go, go.

516
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,640
And my boss,

517
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,240
is actually a little black.

518
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,240
You're so cute.

519
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,440
You can't stand it.

520
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,240
Let's go.

521
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,440
Wait a minute.

522
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:31,840
Wait a minute.

523
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,840
Are you still coming this weekend?

524
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,040
Are you coming this weekend?

525
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,040
What for?

526
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,840
Have you had a cold?

527
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,240
I haven't invited you to dinner

528
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,440
since I've confirmed the relationship with President Zhi.

529
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,640
I was thinking that

530
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,640
if you have time,

531
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,440
come to have a meal.

532
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,640
And you're going to help me celebrate my birthday.

533
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,240
You've not celebrated your birthday alone.

534
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,440
I've been hanging around for so many years.

535
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,240
It's my first time to celebrate my birthday.

536
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,440
I'm sure I'll surprise my girlfriend.

537
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:57,840
Right?

538
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,440
Yes.

539
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,440
Forget it.

540
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,440
Who cares about his girlfriend?

541
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,840
I'm busy with my work.

542
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,640
I'll be more tired if I surprise her.

543
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,440
But you're so carefree.

544
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,840
You're the most focused on your sense of ceremony.

545
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,640
President Zhi's professionalism

546
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,640
is very good at brainwashing.

547
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,640
They even made a adjustment to their professionalism.

548
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,640
They said that

549
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,840
they will work for the country's health

550
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,440
for more than five to ten years.

551
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,640
That's how long they've been doing it.

552
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,640
They've been working for so many years.

553
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,840
They've been drinking so much.

554
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,240
If you have time, come over here.

555
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:25,640
Right?

556
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,440
It's your birthday.

557
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,440
Everything is going to be fine.

558
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,840
So considerate.

559
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,640
Let's have a talk.

560
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:32,840
Let me tell you.

561
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,440
Let's spend our time together.

562
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,240
Let's spend our time together.

563
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,040
What do you want?

564
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,640
I want one.

565
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,440
Let's have a toast.

566
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,440
Let's have a toast.

567
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,240
Let's have a toast.

568
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,040
Right?

569
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,440
Let's have a toast.

570
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,240
Let's have a toast.

571
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,640
Brother.

572
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,640
President Zhi's lunch is here.

573
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,040
Two or three bottles of juice.

574
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,040
Not a surprise.

575
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,840
Look at this.

576
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,640
I know.

577
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,240
I'm willing to pay for the black horse.

578
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,040
Let me think about what I should do.

579
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,840
Think about it.

580
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,240
Say it.

581
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,040
I'm in Beijing now.

582
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,040
I'm hanging out in the middle of the world.

583
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,240
Come and take a break.

584
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,440
Just keep your mouth shut.

585
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,440
Hang out.

586
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,440
Hey.

587
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,040
How is it?

588
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,640
Do you miss me?

589
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,040
Chen Xingqi, you're really playing?

590
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,240
What's wrong?

591
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,440
Chen Xingqi.

592
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,240
You're finally here.

593
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,440
What are you doing?

594
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,440
What path?

595
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,240
You're making me mad.

596
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,640
Did anyone take your red light on the way?

597
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,640
You said I'd remember it.

598
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,440
When my dad drove,

599
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,440
he was looking at me.

600
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,440
Did he take my light on?

601
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,040
I think your dad

602
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,440
just wanted to take your light on purpose.

603
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,040
It's none of your business.

604
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,840
Anyway, he's my only son now.

605
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:17,840
He took my light on.

606
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,040
I'll take his key.

607
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,440
Why are you here in Beijing?

608
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,440
I miss you so much.

609
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,640
I'm not here.

610
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,240
I miss you so much.

611
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,240
I miss you, too.

612
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,240
Brother.

613
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,240
I'm going to take a bath.

614
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:35,840
Hurry up.

615
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,040
I want to eat.

616
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,440
Hurry up.

617
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,240
I need to eat.

618
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,240
Hurry up.

619
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,040
Okay.

620
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,640
Take the stuff.

621
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,240
Take it yourself.

622
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:43,840
Okay.

623
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,040
Bye.

624
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,440
This...

625
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,240
I'll take this.

626
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,440
Don't call me Hua Sheng.

627
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,440
My brother is allergic to rice.

628
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,040
He can't eat it.

629
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,840
Sister, what's your plan?

630
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,040
I don't have any.

631
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,640
Okay, thanks.

632
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,640
Okay.

633
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,240
Tell me.

634
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,440
What are you doing here?

635
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,040
I'm sorry.

636
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:12,640
Come out.

637
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,240
Since this year,

638
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,240
I've been a real master.

639
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,040
I'll leave this little misunderstanding

640
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,040
to Chen Zixuan.

641
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,640
Don't worry.

642
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,640
I'll come over to you in the future.

643
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,240
Okay, treat him well.

644
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,440
Gu Yiliang,

645
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,640
you've been here for three times.

646
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,440
It's almost the same.

647
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,440
I'll send you back after dinner.

648
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,440
What are you doing?

649
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,440
I'm ordering.

650
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,440
Give it to me.

651
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,440
Sit tight.

652
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,440
Will I follow you in the future?

653
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,240
What are you talking about?

654
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,240
I'm poor.

655
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,040
How can I raise you?

656
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,640
I'm a good person.

657
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,640
Just eat after you finish.

658
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,840
I can't do it.

659
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,640
I can pay for my work.

660
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:02,780
And my

661
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,140
skills aren't the same.

662
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,440
But I freshman come to you

663
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,940
out of guilt

664
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,640
so I can't stand it either.

665
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,040
Chen Zixuan owned you.

666
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,240
After my troubles,

667
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,040
you finally saw me.

668
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,440
I'm not going to go to school.

669
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,440
I'm going to study.

670
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,440
I have time to see you.

671
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:27,940
Okay?

672
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,940
You're lying.

673
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,440
You don't want me anymore.

674
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,940
Mom.

675
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,440
Where's your brother?

676
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,440
He's not here.

677
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,440
He's not here.

678
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,440
He's not here.

679
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,640
Where's your brother?

680
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,640
Mom.

681
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,640
Chen Xingqi.

682
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,840
You're still here?

683
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,240
You dare to steal my phone and buy tickets?

684
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,440
You're leaving the house.

685
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,440
What if you lose someone?

686
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,240
You don't have to take care of my business.

687
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,240
Chen Xingqi.

688
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,440
There's a guest.

689
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,640
Stay here.

690
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,840
I'm going to Beijing soon.

691
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,840
Lu Zhong.

692
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,840
We'll talk in a place later.

693
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,840
We'll talk alone.

694
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,840
President Zhou.

695
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,840
Look after him for me.

696
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,840
He's still him.

697
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,840
He's Anmen.

698
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,840
Don't move.

699
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,840
Why are you going?

700
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,840
My mom.

701
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,840
Sister-in-law.

702
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,840
When did you and my brother

703
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,840
get together?

704
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,840
I was in the children's school when I was a grown-up.

705
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,840
Which part of your development?

706
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,840
At least

707
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,840
you've had to cut your hand.

708
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,840
How's the current situation?

709
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,840
He won the game in the ball game.

710
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,840
Zhou Yingwen won the first place

711
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,840
in the speech.

712
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,840
He's amazing.

713
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,840
You should learn from him.

714
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,840
You should work harder in the class.

715
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,840
Don't be in the hands of the adults.

716
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,840
You haven't passed the exam.

717
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,840
What?

718
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,840
Just call me Xiwen.

719
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,840
Why do you care about me so much?

720
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,840
I can't care about you.

721
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,840
Where's your brother?

722
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,840
Where's Xu Zhi?

723
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,840
You and Xu Zhi...

724
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,840
They're good.

725
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,840
Well...

726
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,840
I'm sorry.

727
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,840
I'm sorry.

728
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,840
I'm sorry.

729
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,840
I'm sorry.

730
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,840
I went to look for him

731
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,840
when he was in the summer vacation.

732
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,840
I know.

733
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,840
If I were you,

734
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,840
I would be in trouble

735
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,840
between you and him.

736
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,840
Sorry.

737
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,840
What are you going to do next?

738
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,840
I'm going to leave Chen Xingqi

739
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,840
to Chen Jiasheng

740
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,840
for the celebration.

741
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,840
Actually, I have no choice.

742
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,840
The court is the judge.

743
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,840
The court is the judge.

744
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,840
What if the court judges him to you?

745
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,840
Will you abandon him?

746
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,840
You've abandoned me.

747
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,840
You're out of your mind.

748
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,840
You can't go if you can't.

749
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,840
You can't go.

750
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,840
You don't need to talk about it.

751
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,840
Why do you have to do so many things now?

752
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,840
I don't even have the right to speak.

753
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,840
Is it because of the accident?

754
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,840
I've been living with him for ten months.

755
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,840
I've abandoned him once.

756
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,840
I won't abandon him again.

757
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,840
If I knew he sent you to the welfare hospital,

758
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,840
I wouldn't have given you to him.

759
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,840
You mean...

760
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,840
Your biological father.

761
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,840
Don't be afraid.

762
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,840
Don't be afraid, Lu Zhou.

763
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,840
Call me mom.

764
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,840
Call me mom.

765
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,840
Mom.

766
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,840
I was so angry that I had to find a job.

767
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,840
I met Chen Jiasheng.

768
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,840
He was nice to me.

769
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,840
He was the one who could take care of my baby.

770
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,840
I thought...

771
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,840
That's it.

772
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,840
I could give you a home.

773
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,840
I was so angry.

774
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,840
I was so angry.

775
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,840
I was so angry.

776
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,840
I was so angry.

777
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,840
After that, your biological father...

778
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,840
I don't know how to find him.

779
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,840
I found him at Chen Jiasheng's company.

780
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,840
He was so upset.

781
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,840
He was so upset.

782
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,840
He pointed at my nose.

783
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,840
He had to let me keep you.

784
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,840
He said he couldn't leave me

785
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,840
and let his own biological son

786
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,840
be like other men.

787
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,840
Then why did he stop me?

788
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,840
He was so mad at his young age.

789
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,840
He was so mad that he had to drive.

790
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,840
He was so mad that he had to drive.

791
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,840
He was so mad that he had to drive.

792
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,840
He was so mad that he had to drive.

793
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,840
His mom...

794
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,840
was not so normal in terms of health.

795
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,840
She sent you to the welfare hospital.

796
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,840
After he woke up,

797
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,840
he suddenly remembered

798
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,840
that he had a son.

799
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,840
But he forgot what you looked like.

800
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,840
He was so upset that he came to me

801
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,840
and asked me to go to the welfare hospital.

802
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,840
I was so mad.

803
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,840
I couldn't let you go to him.

804
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,840
I lied to him

805
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,840
that you had been adopted by someone else.

806
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,840
During that time,

807
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,840
Chen Xingqi suddenly got a disease

808
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,840
and had a fever.

809
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,840
You know that

810
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,840
Chen Jishan is very superstitious.

811
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,840
I asked a master

812
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,840
to say that

813
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,840
Chen Xingqi must have a brother.

814
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,840
So you lied to Chen Jishan

815
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,840
and took me to Chen's house.

816
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,840
Yes.

817
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,840
Does Chen Jishan know my identity?

818
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,640
Yuan Hui!

819
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,840
Here it is, honey.

820
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,840
Open it.

821
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,840
You've been ignoring me since the beginning.

822
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,840
Right?

823
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,840
You should take a good look at yourself!

824
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,840
Jishan.

825
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,840
Jishan, I'm sorry.

826
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,840
It's my fault.

827
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,840
Don't take it personally.

828
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,840
Please forgive me.

829
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,840
Let go of me.

830
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,840
I'm sorry.

831
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,840
I'm really sorry.

832
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,840
I lied to you.

833
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,840
But Lu Zhuo

834
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,840
is still in the hospital.

835
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,840
I'm sorry.

836
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,840
I'm sorry.

837
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,840
I don't know anything about her.

838
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,840
Please forgive me.

839
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,840
Forgive me. I'm sorry.

840
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,840
Let her grow to 18 years old.

841
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,840
18 years old.

842
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,840
She's out of the country.

843
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,840
Okay.

844
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,840
I understand.

845
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,840
So you said

846
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,840
even if she agreed

847
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,840
that I'm not going abroad,

848
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,840
you wouldn't agree.

849
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,840
It's because you owe her.

850
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,840
Even if your dad gives you the idea,

851
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,840
I won't agree.

852
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,840
Let me let her get angry when she was young.

853
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,840
Let me be obedient.

854
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,840
I'm afraid she'll send me back to the welfare hospital

855
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,840
if she doesn't like it.

856
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,840
Do you want to be with mom forever?

857
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,840
Then you should be obedient

858
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,840
to grandma and dad.

859
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,840
Do you understand?

860
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,840
Let's go.

861
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,840
Don't let Chen Xin get up and wait for too long.

862
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,840
Lu Zhuo.

863
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,840
I'm sorry.

864
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,840
It's all mom's fault.

865
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,840
Can you forgive me?

866
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,840
Is mom okay?

867
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,840
Mom knows you're in a bad mood.

868
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,840
It's all mom's fault.

869
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,840
When will your brother come back?

870
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,840
Why don't you ask yourself?

871
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,840
I'll send him a message.

872
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,840
He'll be back forever.

873
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,840
You won't come back alone.

874
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,840
As long as you send the message,

875
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,840
he'll surely come back.

876
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,840
Are you sure?

877
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,840
Try it.

878
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,840
You ask.

879
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,840
You ask.

880
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,840
You know he's not my brother, right?

881
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,840
When I was in elementary school,

882
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,840
I was in the middle of school.

883
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,840
He decided to go to the police station

884
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,840
to play a game.

885
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,840
But my brother didn't bring any keys that day.

886
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,840
When he went back,

887
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,840
he couldn't open the door.

888
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,840
He didn't even talk to me.

889
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,840
He didn't even call me.

890
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,840
He ran to the police station nearby

891
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,840
and slept for a night.

892
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,840
When Tianming found him,

893
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,840
my mom's tears fell down.

894
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,840
Then he said,

895
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,840
I can't sleep at night.

896
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,840
Why did you call him?

897
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,840
Don't be so sad.

898
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,840
I'm so sad.

899
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,840
I've always felt

900
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,840
that my brother didn't bring any keys that day.

901
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,840
Maybe because he was adopted by the police.

902
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,840
He was angry with anyone on the surface.

903
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,840
Actually,

904
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,840
he was angry with anyone.

905
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,840
But

906
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,840
he was different from you.

907
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,840
He really likes you.

908
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,840
The secret I told you just now.

909
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,840
Thank you.

910
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,840
Hello, aunt.

911
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,840
Chen Xinqi,

912
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,840
are you getting bolder and bigger?

913
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,840
You came to Beijing alone.

914
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,840
You're trying to scare me.

915
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,840
Do you know how worried my mom is?

916
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,840
Okay.

917
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,840
Luo Zhong,

918
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,840
take the luggage and wait for me outside.

919
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,840
I'll talk to Xu Shi.

920
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,840
Hurry up. What are you waiting for?

921
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,840
Just wait for me outside.

922
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,840
Please sit down.

923
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,840
My mom wants to disband you.

924
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,840
I don't mind.

925
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,840
Why are you so worried?

926
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,840
How about this?

927
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,840
Let's add a WeChat.

928
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,840
Okay.

929
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,840
Tell me whatever you want.

930
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,840
Okay?

931
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,840
Come on.

932
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,840
I'll leave now.

933
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,840
I'll send you off.

934
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,840
Xinqi and I will go back to the camp.

935
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,840
You have to be careful here.

936
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,840
Don't stay up late.

937
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,840
Take care of yourself.

938
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,840
Aunt Mei is not here.

939
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,840
You should eat well.

940
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,840
Or you might get sick.

941
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,840
Xinqi,

942
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,840
the dishes in the company are good.

943
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,840
Take the luggage and leave.

944
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,840
Give me the box.

945
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,840
We're leaving.

946
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,840
Goodbye, aunt.

947
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,840
Goodbye.

948
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,840
Goodbye.

949
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,840
What did you talk about?

950
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,840
I told him

951
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,840
I returned your child.

952
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,840
I asked him to prepare the tickets at home.

953
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:19,840
What's wrong?

954
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,840
Nothing.

955
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,840
I'm sorry.

956
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:25,840
I'll call you later.

957
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,840
I'm sorry.

958
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,840
I'm sorry.
