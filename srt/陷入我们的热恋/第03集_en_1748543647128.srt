1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The wind blows my heart

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The world is burning

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The smile is being drawn into the distance

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The pain is being hurt, the hatred is being impregnated

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The wind blows my heart

6
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
If I cry out my eyes

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let the atmosphere of the city stay in the memory

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The sea is waiting for each other

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The sea is waiting for each other

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Crush

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Lucy, you've met a hard time this time

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Episode 1

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So Xu Zhi, on your side

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
He and other girls have different points of view

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
He has a boyfriend

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So?

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So you can't refuse him

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And this

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
This

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This kind of

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You can't say it in detail

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That kind of

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You know what?

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Chen Lu Zhou is sick, he must be cured

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You're sick

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Man Yong

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Do you want to be so far away?

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You're so anxious to sleep early

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We'll be back in shortly

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What's your problem?

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Let's have some snacks

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Ours is a big deal

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
For you

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's not a big deal

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,760
You should open a new門

36
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,800
You'll beשות any money

37
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,080
Since your body is BLACK

38
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,120
I'll give you the money

39
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,600
Don't worry

40
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
See you at the restaurant later.

41
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,760
Xu Zhi.

42
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,640
Don't mention you to me.

43
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,920
Be careful.

44
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,360
Chen Muzhou.

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,960
You're saved.

46
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,200
Good morning.

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,960
Good morning.

48
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,960
Morning.

49
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,680
Morning, Mr. Fu.

50
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:57,960
Morning.

51
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,200
How is it?

52
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,360
Is breakfast good?

53
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,320
Not bad.

54
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,200
It's not good, but it's like this.

55
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,600
I heard you've done an ad.

56
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:14,880
Yes.

57
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,080
Do it for me.

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
tät

59
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,840
OK, Lvzhot.

60
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,680
It's a good decision.

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,640
Put it easy.

62
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,640
Be patient.

63
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,400
That is it.

64
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,480
Open your eyes and smile.

65
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,840
They look good on you.

66
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,880
Not bad, not bad.

67
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,800
Good.

68
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,400
Be patient.

69
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,040
Don't be nervous, Lvzhot.

70
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,440
You have been reading our letters.

71
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,160
It looks great.

72
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,880
I'm so happy to see you.

73
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,680
Brother, are you here to take a photo with me?

74
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,080
You're so cute.

75
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,280
I'm so happy to see you.

76
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,320
You're so cute.

77
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,280
Bye, brother.

78
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,400
No.

79
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,400
Why?

80
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,800
I pay you 3,000.

81
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,920
I don't take 3,000.

82
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,600
I heard from Mr. Zhi that

83
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,840
you want to make money.

84
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,160
Isn't this a chance to be made?

85
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,840
And you have this condition.

86
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,480
I want to make money,

87
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,640
but I haven't got the opportunity

88
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,640
to make money by selling colors.

89
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,160
You're overthinking.

90
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,640
What I mean is

91
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,480
I want you to use your photography equipment

92
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,240
to take a photo of his garden.

93
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,640
I don't want to.

94
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:51,960
Well...

95
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,280
eventually I'll bring you the jam�

96
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,640
and we'll have the check-in.

97
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,400
Good luck, Mr. Fu.

98
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,680
Why are you jumpin' into high heels?

99
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,680
I already promised that

100
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,280
I'll go out on my own

101
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,080
just to thank you.

102
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,360
He told me a lot.

103
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,160
A warmhearted offer.

104
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,740
Let's not hire rich bosses on this job.

105
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,800
We'll do it.

106
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,280
Let's go.

107
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,380
fruits something up for long.

108
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,240
Bye.

109
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,200
Bye-bye.

110
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,280
I like this CB.

111
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,360
I'm not afraid of the rain.

112
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,360
I'm afraid of the rain.

113
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,360
I'm afraid of the rain.

114
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,360
I'm afraid of the rain.

115
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,360
I'm afraid of the rain.

116
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,360
I'm afraid of the rain.

117
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,360
I'm afraid of the rain.

118
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,360
I'm afraid of the rain.

119
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,360
I'm afraid of the rain.

120
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,360
I'm afraid of the rain.

121
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,360
I'm afraid of the rain.

122
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,360
I'm afraid of the rain.

123
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,360
I'm afraid of the rain.

124
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,360
I'm afraid of the rain.

125
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,360
I'm afraid that we can always start before midnight.

126
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,000
We are late in peace and limited time僕

127
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,360
there is only an eternalб입

128
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,000
under the daydreaming white night

129
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,960
we will have fun together

130
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,780
Keep this as long as we canoder

131
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,920
the smoke of our debit cards.

132
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,640
Hey.

133
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,480
I am sorry for the unfortunately bad resolutions for the third shift.

134
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,840
Get on now.

135
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,320
Go.

136
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,400
What's the matter?

137
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,720
Let's hope these con 챙价len행

138
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,280
work well.

139
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,800
Because Silah

140
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,160
allá will guarantee

141
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,440
the dam-上捛

142
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,240
I can't afford to hold the water so tightly.

143
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,240
Drink some water.

144
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,240
Send Chen to the hospital later.

145
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,240
Uncle, I'm a model and a runner.

146
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,240
I can't do this in the production team.

147
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,240
Do you know what the production team is?

148
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,240
Give it to me.

149
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,240
Here.

150
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,240
It's not my idea to bring you two here as a partner.

151
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,240
He did it?

152
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,240
He doesn't want to affect the progress of the tea farm.

153
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,240
So he asked you two to be models.

154
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,240
You say, my boss is here.

155
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,240
I can let these workers listen to the work at any time and cooperate with him.

156
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,240
But he is a department manager.

157
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,240
He is hiding in a small corner.

158
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,240
It doesn't affect their work.

159
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,240
Interesting.

160
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,240
Your theory is totally wrong.

161
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,240
It's not normal.

162
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,240
Of course.

163
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,240
It's not normal.

164
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,240
The line is messy.

165
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,240
There is no way to explain.

166
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,240
The basic debt is exposed.

167
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,240
It's better than the water quality I learned when I was a kid.

168
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,240
I think it's not good enough to see the water quality.

169
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,240
Students, come here.

170
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,240
Look at the supermarket.

171
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,240
This is the new work of our Chen Dahua.

172
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,240
Everyone, try it.

173
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,240
The silver is the sword.

174
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,240
Give it back to me.

175
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,240
If you say it again, I will fire you.

176
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,240
You fire me?

177
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,240
I said it's for you.

178
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,240
Why can't you go to college in the future?

179
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,240
You are crying.

180
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
I can't go to college.

181
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,240
Tell my brother.

182
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,240
Tell your brother.

183
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,240
Your brother is more difficult to listen to than me.

184
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,240
It's so beautiful.

185
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,240
Mr. Zhizong, look.

186
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,240
I have seen this face for so many years.

187
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,240
Why should I be so tired?

188
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,240
But I still got your experience.

189
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,240
But I think

190
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,240
Chen Dahua is so biased.

191
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,240
Mr. Zhizong has so many characteristics.

192
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,240
I don't even have a proper lens.

193
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,240
No.

194
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,240
You have to take a few more pictures for me.

195
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,240
Let me see.

196
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,240
I will stand in that position.

197
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,240
You take pictures for me.

198
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,240
Here?

199
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,240
The background is not so good.

200
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,240
You take a few pictures.

201
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,240
I won't change it.

202
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,240
Don't change it.

203
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,240
Don't change it.

204
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,240
You...

205
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,240
Are you okay?

206
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,240
Who is it?

207
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,240
Chen Daxi, put it down.

208
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,240
Let go of me.

209
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,240
You let go.

210
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,240
Let go of me.

211
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,240
Let go.

212
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,240
You let go.

213
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,240
It's a big victory.

214
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,240
Who is the winner?

215
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,240
Apologize.

216
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,240
Why should I apologize?

217
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,240
He is not the one who bullied me.

218
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,240
Why did you tell me first?

219
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,240
I didn't do it.

220
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,240
Apologize.

221
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,240
Did you hear that?

222
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,240
Why didn't you tell me to go out?

223
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,240
I am your brother.

224
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,240
Why did you help others bully me?

225
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,240
You didn't apologize, did you?

226
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,240
Fine.

227
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,240
I will apologize for you.

228
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,240
Go back and pack your things.

229
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,240
Say it.

230
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,240
Are you going to leave me like this?

231
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,240
I know.

232
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,240
It's the same as that stinky turtle.

233
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,240
You just hate me.

234
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,240
You just want to throw me away.

235
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,240
No, Xiaosong.

236
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,240
Why are you crying again?

237
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,240
You are bullying us.

238
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,240
It's your first throw.

239
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,240
You almost hit someone.

240
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,240
Boss Fu hasn't asked you to pay.

241
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,240
No way.

242
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,240
Boss Fu said he can understand him.

243
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,240
He really said that.

244
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,240
Boss Fu's original words.

245
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,240
He said,

246
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,240
If I were like this,

247
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,240
I would throw you away.

248
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,240
High.

249
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,240
High.

250
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,240
High.

251
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,240
High.

252
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,240
Boss Fu.

253
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,240
Wait for me.

254
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,240
You.

255
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,240
Chen Xinqi.

256
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,240
Forget it.

257
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,240
Don't apologize.

258
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,240
Go back and pack your things.

259
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,240
Come on.

260
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,240
Sit down.

261
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,240
It's too hot.

262
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,240
I think Xu Zhi is fine now.

263
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,240
It's fine.

264
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,240
If he can be your girlfriend,

265
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,240
someone will be able to control Chen Xinqi.

266
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,240
I think you are sick.

267
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,240
Where are you going?

268
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,240
To my boss.

269
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,240
Otherwise, you will be my mom again.

270
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,240
Wait for me.

271
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,240
Cool.

272
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,240
It's the same as that of Senior Brother.

273
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,240
Actually, I didn't mean to say that.

274
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,240
You know it.

275
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,240
Fu Shidou is not a good guy.

276
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,240
But.

277
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,240
But you don't want to make Chen Ruozhou suffer.

278
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,240
So you have to kill him.

279
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,240
It's fine.

280
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,240
Actually, I think your reasoning is right.

281
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,240
Chen Ruozhou is perhaps a good guy.

282
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,240
Look at his brother.

283
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,240
He is so arrogant.

284
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,240
He doesn't look like a family.

285
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,240
It hurts.

286
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,240
I just think,

287
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,240
If it's really like this,

288
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,240
what will his mom think?

289
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,240
Don't think so much.

290
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,240
You will know when you see him.

291
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,240
I know.

292
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,240
It seems that you are so angry with me today.

293
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,240
Let's go.

294
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,240
Please do a speech.

295
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,240
No need.

296
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,240
I just want to lie on my bed and rest.

297
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,240
Then I can only do it alone.

298
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,240
Don't regret it.

299
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,240
Go.

300
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,240
You really left?

301
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,240
He wore your clothes.

302
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,240
That's because he worshiped you.

303
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,240
Do you know?

304
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,240
Every time he invites his classmates to take classes,

305
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,240
he will take them to your room.

306
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,240
To attend your awards.

307
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,240
Really?

308
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,240
He worshiped me.

309
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,240
Then he asked me to give him something.

310
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,240
So you just hit his confidence, right?

311
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,240
That's a客's evaluation.

312
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,240
He can't even hear this.

313
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,240
How will he face the world of Chen?

314
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,240
Chen Xunqi, he is not smart.

315
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,240
He is not smart.

316
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,240
He can do anything he wants.

317
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,240
He has always grown up under your light.

318
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,240
So he needs protection more.

319
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,240
So?

320
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,240
Who is rude?

321
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,240
Chen Luzhou,

322
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,240
can you say something?

323
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,240
I am very busy at work now.

324
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,240
I don't have time to waste

325
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,240
in your three men's grudges.

326
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,240
Fine.

327
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,240
Then please wait for two months.

328
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,240
When I go abroad,

329
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,240
I won't be in your eyes.

330
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,240
Wait for me.

331
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,240
Please do me a favor.

332
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,240
Okay.

333
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,240
Why do you want to be�

334
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,240
clueless indeed?

335
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,120
Good night, Chu Yin Yin.

336
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,840
You really like bamboo geese?

337
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,160
I didn't do that on purpose.

338
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,000
It's not a first for me anyway.

339
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,240
I'm afraid that I'll be lost in the dream that you used to dream of.

340
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,240
I'm afraid that I'll be lost in the dream that you used to dream of.

341
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,240
I'm afraid that I'll be lost in the dream that you used to dream of.

342
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,240
I'm afraid that I'll be lost in the dream that you used to dream of.

343
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,240
I'm afraid that I'll be lost in the dream that you used to dream of.

344
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,240
I'm afraid that I'll be lost in the dream that you used to dream of.

345
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,240
I'm afraid that I'll be lost in the dream that you used to dream of.

346
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,240
I'm afraid that I'll be lost in the dream that you used to dream of.

347
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,240
I'm afraid that I'll be lost in the dream that you used to dream of.

348
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,240
I'm afraid that I'll be lost in the dream that you used to dream of.

349
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,340
Actually, I admire you a lot.

350
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,440
You want to be and support me every year any day.

351
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,280
I believe you won't totally understand this.

352
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,580
Wait and see.

353
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:41,780
myその

354
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,820
My mom does this, too.

355
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,900
She never speaks in panic.

356
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,500
She hits grand music

357
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,380
and skips the lyrics.

358
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,500
She put one behind her back

359
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,340
to express her special favor on me.

360
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,740
It's a little bit different.

361
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,180
But it doesn't mean he doesn't love me.

362
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,020
You're right.

363
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,980
But some people have become family.

364
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,380
From the beginning,

365
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,860
it's a exchange of what they need.

366
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,660
Why do you love Tan Qi?

367
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,740
You don't eat well.

368
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,100
What's wrong?

369
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,420
Grandma said

370
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,140
you took me back from the hospital

371
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,180
to give my brother a beating.

372
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,380
Is that true?

373
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,620
Is it really not important?

374
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,860
Chen Lu Zhou,

375
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,940
do you want to be with your mother forever?

376
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,500
Then you should listen to your grandma and dad

377
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,340
in this house.

378
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,540
Do you understand?

379
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:04,700
OK.

380
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:05,660
Bye.

381
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,940
All the conversations are conditional.

382
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,460
As long as you have let them down,

383
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,220
then you're сюж ain.

384
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:21,980
I'm glad you계

385
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,900
are

386
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,620
for our Lu Zhou.

387
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,820
Thank you.

388
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,420
I'm really envious of you,

389
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:32,660
Lu Zhou has a penance.

390
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,860
I won't let my family

391
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,940
be angry

392
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,060
and make them feel bad.

393
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,500
I'll thank God.

394
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,340
I won't go back after graduation.

395
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,220
I don't know anything about management.

396
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,140
I won't come back

397
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,020
and give my dad a sweet massage.

398
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,220
I'll go to the bathroom.

399
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,180
Go to the bathroom.

400
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,220
Mr. Jiang, you're fine, right?

401
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,420
You eat first.

402
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,380
Look at you.

403
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,220
Why did you come back to me?

404
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,660
Chen Ruzhou,

405
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,860
what's your relationship with Yin Yang?

406
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,060
You know what?

407
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,300
Many people

408
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,020
beg for the abroad books.

409
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,340
Remember,

410
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,580
you can live your life like this

411
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,700
because of your luck.

412
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,500
Don't say that.

413
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,740
Yes.

414
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,740
I'm lucky.

415
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,780
Thank you.

416
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,500
Thank me, too.

417
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,180
The most important thing for men

418
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,500
is to thank Chen Xinqi.

419
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,140
If you don't have her,

420
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,060
it's not me.

421
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,220
You two

422
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,500
don't say anything.

423
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,220
Since you know better than anyone,

424
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,140
it's the badmouth here.

425
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,340
You know it now.

426
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,900
I see.

427
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,980
Now you know what you should do.

428
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,060
What should not be done.

429
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:20,660
How?

430
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,380
Go back and do it.

431
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,180
Don't worry.

432
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,500
I won't let your reports go wrong.

433
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,140
Your JJonak Resort is here.

434
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,980
Dad.

435
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,540
You can't show your legs now.

436
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,020
Ye.

437
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,340
Zhuножian.

438
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,980
Dad would like to talk to you.

439
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,080
What happen if you drink with dad

440
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,660
in a noose and fall into his arms?

441
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:05,020
I can't disturb the guests.

442
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,420
That's right.

443
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,220
It's okay, brother.

444
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,620
Let's play.

445
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,820
I'm sorry, brother.

446
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,820
I promise I won't argue with you anymore.

447
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,420
Don't give my dad a bad review, okay?

448
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,620
No.

449
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,420
I'll give your dad a five-star rating.

450
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:24,020
Thank you, brother.

451
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,820
I'm sorry.

452
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,220
It's okay.

453
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,620
I'll scare you.

454
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,620
Be quiet.

455
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:48,820
The love of being unconditionally loved is to be lucky.

456
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,620
Let's go. I'll take you to a place.

457
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,420
Okay.

458
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,820
Hurry up.

459
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,620
Let me introduce my old friend to you.

460
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,620
This is your car?

461
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,620
Yes.

462
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,620
Put it on.

463
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,620
You're just a lawyer in the law firm.

464
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,620
You want to put it on me?

465
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,620
I'm a person who's on the court.

466
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,620
Okay.

467
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,620
Sit tight.

468
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,620
Okay.

469
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:25,620
The moon shines on the heart of the feeling.

470
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,620
The wind blows in my heart.

471
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:35,620
I'm like a rose.

472
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:42,620
Crush, when the night is dark, I meet you.

473
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:50,620
Crush, when the night is dark, I meet you.

474
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,620
Crush, are you feeling better now?

475
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,620
Wait a minute.

476
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,620
Here you are.

477
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,620
This...

478
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,620
I have it now. You have it too.

479
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,620
Lucky.

480
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:35,620
The love of being unconditionally loved is to be lucky.

481
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,620
Okay.

482
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,620
Let's talk about it when we get to the bar.

483
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,620
What?

484
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,620
Didn't you want to drink before?

485
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,620
It's mainly about this.

486
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:00,620
It's hard to say without drinking.

487
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,620
He...

488
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,620
Is he going to confess to me?

489
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,620
I'm not going to drink.

490
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,620
Drink some.

491
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:49,620
I can't say no without drinking.

492
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,620
I'm afraid you won't listen to me.

493
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,620
Okay.

494
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,620
Okay.

495
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,620
Okay.

496
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,620
Okay.

497
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,620
Okay.

498
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,620
Okay.

499
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,620
Okay.

500
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,620
Okay.

501
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,620
Okay.

502
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,620
I'll have some tea.

503
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,620
I'll know what you're going to say.

504
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,620
You know?

505
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,620
How many can you guess?

506
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,620
Do I need to say it?

507
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,620
Okay.

508
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,620
Say it again when the shadow comes.

509
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,620
I'm coming.

510
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,620
He's coming.

511
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,620
I'm coming.

512
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,620
Waiter, come and get some water.

513
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,620
He insisted on smoking.

514
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,620
It's a bit strange.

515
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,620
Is he going to confess to you?

516
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,620
I'll say it.

517
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,620
Wait.

518
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,620
I'm too lazy.

519
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,620
I just want to see your mom.

520
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,620
No matter what method.

521
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,620
When did you go to your house?

522
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,620
Is your mom at home?

523
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,620
When auntie comes next time,

524
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,620
remember to leave a seat for me.

525
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,620
Does your mom cook for you?

526
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,620
Do you want to come to dinner?

527
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,620
Can I?

528
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,620
What do you mean by using all the methods?

529
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,620
I mean,

530
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,620
if you want to be your girlfriend,

531
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,620
you'll see your mom.

532
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,620
She'll agree.

533
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,620
You...

534
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,620
You think I'm interesting to you, right?

535
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,620
No.

536
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,620
I'm not that self-love.

537
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,620
And I'm not interested in you.

538
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,620
I'm not interested in you.

539
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,620
And I'm not interested in you.

540
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,620
I wanted to add your WeChat.

541
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,620
I just want to see auntie.

542
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,620
It's just a simple thing.

543
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,620
I added your WeChat.

544
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,620
I didn't disturb you.

545
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,620
No, look.

546
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,620
I didn't even open my circle of friends.

547
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:35,620
The road to the return of the road in Chenlu.

548
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,620
Thank you.

549
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,620
Here.

550
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,620
Take a look.

551
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,620
It's a kind of high-level Qianni

552
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,620
that you don't know too well.

553
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,620
Then why did you break up with your boyfriend?

554
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,620
What boyfriend?

555
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,620
Don't worry about the reason.

556
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,620
It's not what you think.

557
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,620
No, no.

558
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,620
You're right.

559
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,620
How could you break up with him?

560
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,620
My...

561
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,620
My...

562
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,620
My girlfriend.

563
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,260
My pot. My pot.

564
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,220
Let me explain.

565
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,060
You haven't seen my friend?

566
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,780
We're just afraid that you won't come out and eat with us.

567
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,700
So we lied to you.

568
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:23,980
Okay, okay.

569
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,820
You lied to me?

570
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,860
You're making a sound.

571
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,380
What's wrong with you?

572
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,260
Enough.

573
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,140
Let go of me.

574
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,500
You...

575
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,340
Why don't you listen to my mom first?

576
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,380
Enough.

577
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,340
Sorry, sorry.

578
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,060
Sorry, sorry.

579
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:35,900
Look, you're eating.

580
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,940
I'm afraid that you'll misunderstand.

581
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,420
I'm afraid that he likes you.

582
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:38,900
You're right.

583
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,580
Thank you.

584
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,780
What are you doing?

585
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,620
You two.

586
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,300
You...

587
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,220
You drank too much.

588
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,500
Don't listen to him.

589
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,380
Tell your mom.

590
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,180
Why are you selling people?

591
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,780
You're talking about your mom, right?

592
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,260
I also think it's inappropriate.

593
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,180
Their voices and language are really the same.

594
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,820
If you don't mind,

595
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,300
can you take me to see my mom?

596
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,380
Just once.

597
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,500
As my girlfriend, it's okay.

598
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,460
You don't mind?

599
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,060
We're just pretending to be boyfriend and girlfriend, right?

600
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,780
I'm free.

601
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,900
I don't want to be in love with you.

602
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,660
I don't want to be in love with you either.

603
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,140
Zhi Zhi.

604
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,660
I don't want to be with him.

605
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,220
Slow down.

606
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,380
What's wrong with you?

607
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,540
Is this a glass of glass?

608
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,740
Let me have a look.

609
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,380
It hurts.

610
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,140
Where does it hurt?

611
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,820
Heart attack.

612
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,420
Are you crazy?

613
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,380
No.

614
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,900
I'm almost there.

615
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,900
I'm sorry.

616
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,140
He's drunk.

617
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,180
I'll take him back.

618
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,140
Why?

619
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,020
It's time to take medicine.

620
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,300
What? Is it good?

621
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,340
Slow down.

622
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:10,860
I'll see.

623
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,700
What?

624
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,860
Lucy,

625
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,660
what did you talk to Zhi Zhi after we left?

626
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,620
I was going to say I'm already完,

627
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,260
but with комилus,

628
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,180
I'm going to show her off.

629
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,980
You think I'm insane?

630
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,380
If so,

631
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,280
tell me more cutting from the beginning

632
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,260
to grow bigger.

633
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,300
I am at your command.

634
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,980
That's why I should open a Deutschlandium Company for you.

635
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,540
Who knows what will happen?

636
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,460
imagen.

637
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,980
I'm not sure.

638
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:01,940
Jian,

639
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,940
you can't refuse her.

640
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,780
Now you've misunderstood her.

641
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,460
You're still so sweet to her.

642
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,980
You can't refuse her.

643
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,900
Jian, I remind you.

644
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,220
Don't go to the water anymore.

645
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,220
Okay, okay. I'll go.

646
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,300
Okay.

647
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,500
You're so stubborn.

648
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,580
I'm from the hotel.

649
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,980
Can you recognize me?

650
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,580
Don't tell me you'll accept me.

651
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,180
I'm not the person who wanted the meal.

652
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,260
Rick.

653
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:15,980
Look,

654
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,620
you didn't even bother me

655
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,660
even when I remember your WeChat account.

656
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,820
Do you give me the love?

657
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,580
I want to.

658
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:30,860
Yes.

659
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,100
What else do you want to say?

660
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,900
I was just lying to you.

661
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,860
Who was it?

662
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,140
Are you thinking very carefully?

663
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:52,960
No.

664
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:53,720
This....

665
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,740
This is your balcony.

666
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,620
I didn't expect it.

667
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,280
Yin Yin just said that he's put a candle in the hotel room,

668
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,360
and asked me to ask about you.

669
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,640
Now, you finally found it.

670
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,940
Alright.

671
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,260
I'm leaving.

672
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,260
Take care of yourself.

673
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,740
Send for me

674
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:36,040
OK, OK, rocks out

675
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,580
Chen often dopi

676
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,340
Have you ever ok?

677
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,620
It's a try

678
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,060
I'm not sure

679
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,660
I've done something quite wrong

680
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,660
Go on. Go on.

681
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,660
It's just a mosquito.

682
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,660
Just eat it.

683
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,660
Mr. Wen, please.

684
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,660
Can you please do the magic?

685
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,660
Where's the mosquito?

686
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,660
Why am I not bitten?

687
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,660
What is this?

688
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,660
A mosquito.

689
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,660
I'm so disgusting.

690
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,660
Guys,

691
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,660
you've seen it.

692
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,660
It's like this when you wake up in the wild.

693
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,660
Sometimes,

694
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,660
bugs and mosquitoes are everywhere.

695
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,660
As a great artist,

696
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,660
we should learn to overcome them.

697
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,660
Got it?

698
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,660
Mr. Wen.

699
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,660
Go on. Go on.

700
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,660
You...

701
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,660
It's okay. Just answer the phone.

702
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,660
Answer the phone.

703
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,660
Come on.

704
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,660
Answer the phone.

705
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,660
I'm sorry.

706
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,660
Answer the phone.

707
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,660
Ying Ying, you...

708
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,660
Sir.

709
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,660
The mosquitoes have run away.

710
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,660
What should we draw?

711
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,660
What should we draw?

712
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,660
Can we draw you?

713
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,660
What should we draw?

714
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,660
The spring and the snow.

715
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,660
The snow is falling.

716
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,660
The autumn and the spring are all around.

717
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,660
It's winter and the summer are all around.

718
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,660
The four seasons are back.

719
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,660
Every tea here

720
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,660
is the first thing in time.

721
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,660
The freshness of the spring.

722
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:13,660
The harmony of the heart and nature.

723
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,660
The garden of the rich and the tea garden.

724
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,660
The one that is the reward for the ghost-grooming

725
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,660
in the garden.

726
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,660
The one that makes the ghost

727
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,660
in the garden have a good time.

728
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,660
Not bad.

729
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,660
Or I'll leave the rest to you.

730
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,660
Let me see.

731
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,660
Day 3.

732
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,660
I'll leave the rest to you.

733
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,660
Let's go.

734
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,660
Don't leave in a hurry.

735
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,660
Drink some tea.

736
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,660
Have a taste of the new tea.

737
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,660
Come in.

738
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,660
What?

739
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:58,760
Sweet

740
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,160
How is your � no,

741
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,160
I'm ok and not very cool.

742
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,160
Drink tea to townside personality,

743
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,660
but for the other character,

744
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,160
I reallyいた very elite.

745
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,160
To depend on the Tibiatres of tea.

746
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,760
Her father used to attend high school in an alcoholic road.

747
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,740
Did anyone really destroy it?

748
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,660
If I find a girlfriend that has someone god-treated,

749
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,380
they would even go putting sugar on the table.

750
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,860
This chat is really interesting.

751
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:37,300
Who do you think put it?

752
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,500
I'm not sure.

753
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,100
Then you should be in the College of Education.

754
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,300
What university do you want to go to?

755
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,500
You want to study in the College of Education.

756
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,100
The College of Education is just a hobby.

757
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,300
I'm going abroad.

758
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,900
Why do you want to go abroad?

759
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,300
I told you that I've been to several countries.

760
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,100
I really think that

761
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,300
the country is very good now.

762
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,900
You guys are not as good as you think.

763
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,900
You know what?

764
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,900
Uncle Fu.

765
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,300
I'm here just in time.

766
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,700
Tell him how good the country is now.

767
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,100
Uncle Fu.

768
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,300
Everyone has the right to choose freely.

769
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,700
What do you care about?

770
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,700
Right?

771
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,300
Well, I have something to do.

772
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,500
I'll go back to work.

773
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,300
Let's go.

774
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,700
Go.

775
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,900
Let's go out and have fun.

776
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,900
Let's go.

777
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,900
It's not Chen Luzhou.

778
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,300
Who are you?

779
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,300
Just come out and write a letter.

780
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,900
The teacher and the model are gone.

781
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,100
What should I do?

782
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,100
Tell me.

783
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,100
Isn't that great?

784
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,900
Pack up and go down the mountain.

785
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,900
Go back to your home.

786
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,500
Wait.

787
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,900
I think Chen Luzhou

788
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,500
and I just had a good talk.

789
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,500
He left when you came in.

790
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,300
He doesn't like you, does he?

791
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,100
Maybe he really has something to do with me.

792
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,700
He talked to you just now.

793
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,300
He said he helped you to make a move.

794
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,100
Did you add money to him?

795
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,900
I asked you to manage it.

796
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,700
You and Chen Luzhou should learn from him.

797
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,900
Look at his thoughts.

798
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,700
Use the lens to capture the beauty of the world.

799
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,700
Take a mountain camera and you'll be in a pair.

800
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,700
Look at you.

801
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:42,100
You should have talked more about the new

802
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,300
Don't waste money.

803
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,100
I think you should have a good talk.

804
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,900
You're so mean.

805
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,700
Why can't I say it?

806
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,100
I'm responsible for the person.

807
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,900
I think

808
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,500
you should write a letter in white paper

809
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,700
to avoid any trouble.

810
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,700
Isn't it boring for me?

811
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,700
Why did you still help me?

812
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,700
I'm sorry.

813
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,700
I'm sorry.

814
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,700
I'm sorry.

815
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,700
I'm sorry.

816
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,700
I'm sorry.

817
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,700
I'm sorry.

818
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,700
I'm sorry.

819
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,700
I'm sorry.

820
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,700
I'm sorry.

821
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,700
I'm sorry.

822
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,700
I'm sorry.

823
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,700
I'm sorry.

824
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,700
I'm sorry.

825
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,700
I'm sorry.

826
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:03,700
I'm sorry.

827
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:12,700
I'm sorry.

828
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,700
I'm sorry.

829
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,700
Don't worry about it.

830
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,700
Don't be afraid.

831
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,700
I'm sorry.

832
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,700
I'm sorry.

833
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,700
I'm sorry.

834
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,700
I'm sorry.

835
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,700
I'm sorry.

836
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:34,700
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you.

837
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:38,700
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you.

838
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:42,700
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you.

839
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:46,700
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you.

840
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:50,700
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you.

841
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:54,700
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you.

842
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:58,700
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you.

843
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:03,700
I see myself

844
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,700
into you

845
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,700
into you
