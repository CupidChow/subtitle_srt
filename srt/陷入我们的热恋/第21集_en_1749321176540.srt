1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The heart that is in the most emotional space

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The red shadow that is in my heart

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's like a broken heart

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Crush, when the dark night meets the secret

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Crush, from the people's eyes, I fall in love with you

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Baby falling my heart, the instant it burns, it burns

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The excellent sound, the long distance

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The pain, the hatred, the persistence

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Falling my heart, if tears fall

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Let the city's wind stay in the memory

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Let the sea stand by each other's side

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Crush

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I only have you now

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's good to be at home

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Right

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Take a rest

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You'll have to come for dinner later

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Did you put the price?

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
No

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
He'll be here soon

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Now he's in the couple's office

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Zhao Lishuo should work hard to study at home

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But I heard you're back

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Uncle Cai gave him a day's price

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Not bad

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm coming

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So fast?

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'll be there when I say it

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I miss you

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Didn't you meet me two weeks ago?

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I miss you

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Go, go, go

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm going to be disbanded

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Clothes, clothes

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Help me

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Come help me after you finish

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You're so stubborn

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You're always my boss

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Cut the vegetables

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Okay, okay, right away

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I forgot to ask you

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I saw your daughter came back this time

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
She's got a lot of money

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
This is the address of the address

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I miss you

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Three calls a day outside

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm afraid I can't eat well

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm not warm

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Look

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The pure sheep fur jacket I bought for me

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's so warm

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I think you're wearing the armor when you came

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Is it a little crazy now?

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm not

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Our Yingying is now obedient

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
No one is going out to play now

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Just finished the mock exam

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The language is 120, the math is 101

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The score is up

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I can't stop it

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The development is going down

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The Chinese university is looking for us

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The score is

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's the Chinese university

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We are the top

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yes

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This Yan Yan is a smart child since childhood

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Is that

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Is it your bad

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
By the way, I forgot to ask you

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That Wei Chun recently has no

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Child's sensitive

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I didn't tell him about this now

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I just want to let the child

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Just think about it

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Study hard

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This matter

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll mention it again

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Don't say it later

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It affects our daughter's mood

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yes, I know

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Mr. Zhi, only two weeks have passed

83
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Why are you in a circle

84
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The exam is big

85
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's not easy to eat

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Wait for Zhu Yangqi to come back

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Let's find him to build up

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I have a stomachache every day

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's not comfortable anywhere

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Okay, save it, ask for private lessons

91
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
He seems to come back next week

92
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Arrange

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Not yet

94
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Fortunately, there is no sound host in Beijing

95
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Otherwise, I have to be like Zhu Yangqi

96
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
When I get on the exam

97
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And stay at school

98
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Why don't you talk about Zhu Yangqi

99
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Don't you like him

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Is it so obvious

101
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
When is it

102
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Together

103
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Not yet

104
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I still have to focus on my father's cultural class

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
When I get on the university

106
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I will talk to him

107
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I think it's okay

108
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The two in the room

109
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Come out and eat

110
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Zhu Yangqi's matter

111
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Don't tell my father

112
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Chen Luzhe's matter

113
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Don't tell my father

114
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
good

115
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Come, good girl

116
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Eat a piece of fish

117
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Not at all

118
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Thank you for your hard work

119
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Look, they're all thin

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Dad, drink some chicken soup

121
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Come on

122
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Red bean and red dates

123
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Blood-stained

124
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Come

125
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Give me

126
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Drink a little, good mood

127
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Thank you dad

128
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Dad, I'll help you add some vegetables

129
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Eat more

130
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
good

131
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Have a good meal

132
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Good food

133
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
How is it

134
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Go to the restaurant

135
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Give dad a bowl of soup

136
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You don't have a hand

137
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I have a hand of oil

138
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Okay, I'll buy it myself

139
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What's wrong

140
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm here to show off

141
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
How is it

142
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Is the chicken food delicious

143
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's delicious

144
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Then eat more

145
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Our old sleeper is alone

146
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Come, this low-fat noodles

147
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Dad will make you a bowl of soup, okay?

148
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
OK, OK, more

149
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Okay, it's done

150
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
All good things are in your hands

151
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'll give you this bowl

152
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I don't want, I don't want

153
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I don't want to go

154
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I haven't finished talking to you for a long time

155
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Then say it again some day

156
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
No, it's okay

157
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Let's go, your dad is waiting for you

158
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Then I'm leaving first

159
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Bye bye

160
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Hurry up, bye bye

161
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Bye bye

162
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Bye bye, uncle

163
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Bye bye

164
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Bye bye

165
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Okay, you're like a birthday man

166
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Dad, I'll watch a TV with you

167
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Good

168
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What are you looking at

169
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Is it a sentence you've been chasing recently

170
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
All good

171
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
We're young

172
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
one person

173
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And that elder- eventual

174
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Awesome

175
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The image we tried to make

176
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,420
Help her to do it

177
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,000
Do it

178
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The video was appearing in the general

179
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Then dell only asked for this done

180
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Who is he

181
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,800
He asked myIs

182
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,000
vicious

183
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
JustGIll

184
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Then

185
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,720
What time is it?

186
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,600
Go to sleep!

187
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,800
I'm afraid one day,

188
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,960
I need to spend some time,

189
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,520
maybe I shouldn't

190
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,280
Go to sleep

191
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,800
Hello?

192
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,600
I was watching TV with my daughter.

193
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,800
I reported the situation today.

194
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,600
After dinner, I watched TV with my dad.

195
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,800
My dad was very calm.

196
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Now your boyfriend is not very stable.

197
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,600
He has no news for six hours.

198
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,000
I thought you were too drunk last time and fainted.

199
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,800
I was afraid my dad would suspect me

200
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,600
when he saw me going back to the news.

201
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,600
I thought it would be a good video.

202
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,600
It's not good. Don't think about it.

203
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,600
Then I'll go to bed. Good night.

204
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,600
You'd better pray that the snowstorm in Beijing can trap your boyfriend.

205
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,600
Otherwise, he'll kick you to death.

206
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,000
Ain't nothing too desperate.

207
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,200
It's a simpleENT.

208
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,600
Maybe, to say it over the top,

209
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,000
you like to lie on the mountain.

210
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,900
I am a startup.

211
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,280
Okay.

212
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,240
I'll go with your dad.

213
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,360
My boyfriend is on the second line.

214
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,040
Call me when you want.

215
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,200
I'll be there in a few hours.

216
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,120
Su이 Bei,

217
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,800
Qian Feng.

218
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,600
I'm Bloomberg ist.

219
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,960
Come in.

220
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,280
Irenai Mann.

221
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,080
Look here.

222
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,080
I found a book.

223
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,040
Answer it for me.

224
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,320
Come in.

225
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,720
What do you want to eat today?

226
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,320
I want to eat crab meat.

227
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,920
And peanut soup.

228
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,440
Just these three?

229
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,200
And a red soup.

230
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,320
Wait.

231
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,840
Where are you?

232
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,160
Have a meal.

233
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,440
What are you eating?

234
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,840
I'm eating your new and old shrimp.

235
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Do you have any sugar?

236
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,760
No.

237
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,720
Eat more.

238
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,240
Smells so good.

239
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,160
Dad, you haven't cooked yet.

240
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:44,960
What are you doing?

241
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,400
It's too late today.

242
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,720
You order a delivery.

243
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,360
I have to go to the hospital.

244
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,600
I'll go to the store.

245
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,120
When you come back,

246
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,040
bring me a small envelope.

247
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,080
Dad.

248
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,320
What do you want to eat tonight?

249
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,440
Don't eat.

250
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,640
I won't eat.

251
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,560
I won't die.

252
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,760
Wait a minute.

253
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,760
Dad, I...

254
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,200
When will you go home?

255
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,760
Order early.

256
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,520
It's cheaper.

257
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,200
Come on.

258
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,080
One for each.

259
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,880
Come on.

260
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,440
It's been a long time.

261
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,160
Have a good day.

262
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,640
Don't be afraid, sister.

263
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,560
I'm sure.

264
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,640
How is it? Recently?

265
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,720
It's necessary.

266
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,280
It's good.

267
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:56,680
It's okay.

268
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,520
You're good too.

269
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,640
I'm fine.

270
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,680
I'm a little tired recently.

271
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,240
Don't mind me.

272
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,000
I'll talk to you later.

273
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,600
It's okay.

274
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,000
Have this.

275
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,560
Have a try.

276
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,320
Hello, Mr. Zhi.

277
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,200
I'm in Beijing's boyfriend.

278
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,440
You haven't finished yet.

279
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,960
I just didn't see you

280
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,840
eating outside.

281
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,200
You didn't ask why

282
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,080
you ate so late at night.

283
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,800
Don't force yourself

284
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,920
if you don't love Mr. Zhi.

285
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,600
Don't be cheap.

286
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,760
I'm telling you the truth.

287
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,280
Mr. Zhi is not good recently.

288
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,160
Do you remember?

289
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,200
When I just came back,

290
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,160
I told you

291
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,000
he made me

292
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,320
some flowers every day.

293
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,760
Now,

294
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,720
I asked him what he was doing

295
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,360
last night.

296
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:34,880
He told me

297
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,040
he was starving.

298
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,760
He left today

299
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,520
and asked me

300
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,360
when I would go back to Beijing.

301
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,160
Don't think too much.

302
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,480
Isn't your parents all like this?

303
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,600
They are beautiful in the distance.

304
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,320
They don't want to die

305
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,200
if they don't follow the money.

306
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,080
They always want to die

307
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,000
if they follow the money.

308
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,600
But he's coming back

309
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,960
every day.

310
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,760
He's going back to Beijing.

311
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:56,800
Xu Zhen,

312
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,160
you look like Xu Zhen.

313
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,960
You were hurt by Zhazan

314
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,800
and then you came to

315
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,680
find a abandoned house.

316
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,280
Xu Zhen is really weird.

317
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,840
He called me last night

318
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,320
and said he left in a hurry.

319
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,080
What's the hurry?

320
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,960
There should be a hurry.

321
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,440
Think about it.

322
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,040
Those young and energetic

323
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,920
and single people

324
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,600
are very curious.

325
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,440
They blame themselves for playing in the hospital.

326
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,920
For example?

327
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,080
Yes.

328
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,840
How about...

329
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,040
We can talk about it later.

330
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,520
Just now,

331
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,240
my friend said

332
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,560
there's seafood soup here.

333
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,560
It's okay.

334
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,960
I haven't had seafood for a long time.

335
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,480
Fu Yue.

336
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,000
The big crab in Qingyi.

337
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,040
How many people are there?

338
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,840
Who are they?

339
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,000
Keke, Zhang Yu.

340
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,320
And some old classmates.

341
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,200
What are you talking about?

342
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,040
Brother, don't listen to me.

343
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,040
I'll go back later.

344
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,320
Wang Yue is in the dorm

345
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,320
waiting for me to change the thesis.

346
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,440
He just left.

347
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,360
Yes.

348
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,360
He's so good.

349
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:50,960
Yes.

350
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,280
What are you doing?

351
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,000
What are you doing tomorrow?

352
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,800
I'm with you.

353
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm with you.

354
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,200
Zhang Yu.

355
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,120
Your classmate is leaving.

356
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,920
Don't you stop him.

357
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,160
Chen Luzhou.

358
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,360
They're doing the magic competition now.

359
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,440
He's quite busy.

360
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,040
Don't drag him down, right?

361
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,440
No.

362
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,800
Don't talk about me and Zhang Yu.

363
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,920
It's nothing.

364
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,840
My girlfriend is still here.

365
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,720
She's hitting me.

366
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,840
I'll go back and see her.

367
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,120
My wife is in the check.

368
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,840
Your classmate.

369
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,160
Aren't you afraid of eating and drinking?

370
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,360
Don't come here.

371
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,360
What's wrong with your classmate?

372
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,080
Chen Luzhou, I'm jealous.

373
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,160
I want to tell you

374
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,160
what I said before.

375
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,120
I want to withdraw.

376
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,800
Because I miss you a lot in the dorm.

377
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,720
But I don't want to withdraw now.

378
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,560
Because I'm angry.

379
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,440
That's it.

380
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,160
Bye.

381
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,800
I'll go with you, okay?

382
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,240
Bye.

383
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:47,760
Bye.

384
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,360
I'm leaving.

385
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,480
I'm going back.

386
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,600
Take your time.

387
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:51,800
Okay.

388
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,360
See you next time.

389
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,200
Bye.

390
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,400
Bye.

391
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,360
Come in.

392
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,680
The hospital is a bit busy.

393
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,400
I have to go there.

394
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,960
You're going out again?

395
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,080
Stay in the soul stew.

396
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,800
Remember to eat.

397
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,480
Don't take off your clothes.

398
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,480
My son is still lying here.

399
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,600
No one is in charge of him.

400
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,080
Sir, your son is just an external injury.

401
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,240
We've already dealt with him.

402
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,040
There are still several more important things to do.

403
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,880
Our master's son is also in there.

404
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,760
He's injured and unwell.

405
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,440
He's giving the patient a bed.

406
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,880
What does the master's son have to do with me?

407
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,080
My son is still lying here.

408
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,200
Don't be noisy.

409
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:34,760
Don't be noisy.

410
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,320
Go upstairs.

411
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:35,920
How about this?

412
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,880
I'll arrange your son to go to the room.

413
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,840
Take a look.

414
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,560
Okay.

415
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,160
Okay.

416
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,000
I'll go upstairs.

417
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,720
Okay.

418
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,360
Okay.

419
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:42,920
Okay.

420
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,520
Okay.

421
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,040
Okay.

422
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,640
Okay.

423
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,200
Okay.

424
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,640
Okay.

425
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,200
Okay.

426
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:46,640
Okay.

427
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,200
Okay.

428
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:47,680
Okay.

429
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,040
Okay.

430
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,640
Okay.

431
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,880
Take a photo.

432
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,720
I'll make sure you're at ease.

433
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,760
Make sure you arrange it.

434
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,080
Okay.

435
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,440
Go ahead.

436
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:52,920
Don't worry.

437
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,960
There's no problem.

438
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,600
Thank you.

439
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,200
Go.

440
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,160
Go.

441
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,560
What's wrong?

442
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,920
There are so many people here.

443
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,560
Come on, Zheng He.

444
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,480
I have something to tell you.

445
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,120
I have something to tell you.

446
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,040
The master's son

447
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,560
just got a emergency.

448
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,720
It's so serious.

449
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,800
They're in the dormitory.

450
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,640
They're in a fire.

451
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,080
Look.

452
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,160
The burn wound shouldn't be given to us.

453
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,160
No, it's not a burn wound.

454
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,480
It's a serious wound.

455
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,080
I went to the dormitory to save my classmates.

456
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,640
They were smashed by Cheng Zheng Lu.

457
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,320
What happened there?

458
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,960
Don't worry.

459
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,520
You can't do anything.

460
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,680
I'm a man.

461
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,840
What do I do?

462
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,960
He thinks his mom

463
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,160
is a doctor.

464
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,000
He's here

465
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,840
to take care of the hospital's resources.

466
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,560
You know what?

467
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,640
He's going to

468
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,000
give the bed to his classmates.

469
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,760
His mom

470
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,360
is going to fight for it.

471
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,480
She's going to

472
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,760
persuade you.

473
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,760
If I didn't see so many people,

474
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,840
I would think you're a fool.

475
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,760
I...

476
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,720
I'm asking you.

477
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,400
You...

478
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,400
Are you all right?

479
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,400
Other places?

480
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,400
Right?

481
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,400
Does it hurt here?

482
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,400
It hurts so much.

483
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,400
Maybe it's a fracture.

484
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,400
We need to do a check-up.

485
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
You said

486
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,400
you've never been to a school

487
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,400
to perform in the fire.

488
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,400
You were staying outside

489
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
and you had to go to the fire brigade.

490
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,400
What did you think?

491
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,400
There are firemen and firemen

492
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,400
who perform in the fire brigade.

493
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,400
Do you need to

494
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,400
become a hero here?

495
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,400
How's Xiao Ling?

496
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
You're here, too.

497
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,400
My brain has a big problem.

498
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,400
I'm afraid that the hospital is not good enough.

499
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,400
I'm here to help.

500
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,400
I just said

501
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,400
that the situation is quite dangerous.

502
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,400
Xiao Ling,

503
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,400
you're brave.

504
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,400
Excuse me,

505
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,400
where is Dr. Xu Guangji?

506
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,400
He went to the emergency room.

507
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,400
Thank you.

508
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,400
He's a hero.

509
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,400
He knows how to become a hero.

510
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,400
What hero can he become?

511
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,400
I have a friend in my life.

512
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,400
I won't wake him up.

513
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,400
I'll kill him.

514
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,400
Right.

515
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,400
Right.

516
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,400
Then you're in this position.

517
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,400
No, don't worry.

518
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,400
Dr. Xu,

519
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,400
I didn't do anything wrong this time.

520
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,400
I'm a man.

521
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
I'm your support.

522
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,400
Be gentle.

523
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,400
My mouth is hurt.

524
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,400
Did I forget?

525
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
Forget it.

526
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,400
Let's go out and talk.

527
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,400
Okay.

528
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,400
Mom,

529
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,400
let's talk face to face.

530
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,400
I don't know if you two are in the same position.

531
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,400
What nonsense are you talking about?

532
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,400
I know it.

533
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,400
You're acting with me.

534
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,400
Just go out.

535
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,400
I won't say anything.

536
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,400
Xiao Ling,

537
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,400
take care of your wound.

538
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,400
After the hospital,

539
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
I'll prepare a big gift for you.

540
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,400
I'll show you the courage this time.

541
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,400
When you're out of the hospital,

542
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,400
I'll give you a big gift.

543
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
You're so young,

544
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
you live in such a luxurious big room.

545
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,400
Okay?

546
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,400
Thank you, Xu Baba.

547
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,400
What's your name?

548
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,400
Hurry up.

549
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,400
It's all late.

550
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,400
Take care.

551
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
Are you my daughter?

552
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,400
Niannian.

553
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,400
Why are you here?

554
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,400
I saw your phone is broken.

555
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,400
I was afraid something bad would happen to you.

556
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,400
Hello, aunt.

557
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,400
This is Director Wei.

558
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,400
Hello, Xi Zhi.

559
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,400
What's wrong?

560
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,400
I'm sorry.

561
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,400
Dad,

562
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,400
in fact,

563
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,400
you can tell me earlier.

564
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,400
It's okay.

565
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,400
Actually,

566
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,400
I told you

567
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,400
what I wanted to do.

568
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,400
It's okay.

569
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,400
I'll go back first.

570
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,400
Aunt,

571
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,400
you can come to our house to eat.

572
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,400
Let's meet.

573
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,400
Okay, thank you.

574
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,400
I'm leaving.

575
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,400
By the way,

576
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
go back to the car.

577
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,400
Be careful.

578
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
Okay.

579
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,400
Bye-bye.

580
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,400
Bye-bye.

581
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,400
I've made the copy and proof material.

582
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,400
Lu Cao,

583
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,400
you can go back there.

584
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
Lu Cao.

585
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
What's wrong?

586
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
Why didn't you answer the phone?

587
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,400
Don't worry.

588
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
They said they were jealous.

589
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
Yes.

590
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,400
They might be angry.

591
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,400
My daughter can't be like this.

592
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,400
It's okay.

593
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,400
Yes.

594
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,400
Maybe the phone

595
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,400
is charging you.

596
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,400
Right?

597
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,400
Yes.

598
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,400
Tell me.

599
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,400
There's no one at home.

600
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,400
Don't worry.

601
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,400
I'll go to the nearby area.

602
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,400
Okay.

603
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,400
Call me if you have any news.

604
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,400
Okay.

605
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,400
I'll go back to the car.

606
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,400
Don't worry.

607
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,400
I'll come back before the match.

608
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,400
It's okay.

609
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,400
Bye-bye.

610
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,400
Be safe.

611
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,400
Be safe.

612
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,400
Okay.

613
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,400
Bye-bye.

614
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,400
Bye-bye.

615
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,400
Bye-bye.

616
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,400
Bye-bye.

617
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
Bye-bye.

618
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
Bye-bye.

619
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,400
Bye-bye.

620
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,400
Bye-bye.

621
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
Bye-bye.

622
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,400
Bye-bye.

623
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,400
Bye-bye.

624
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,400
Bye-bye.

625
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,400
Bye-bye.

626
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
Bye-bye.

627
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,400
Xu Zhi.

628
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,400
Xu Zhi.

629
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,400
Xu Zhi,

630
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
you finally showed up.

631
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,400
Where did you go?

632
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,400
You didn't answer your phone.

633
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,400
I didn't answer the phone.

634
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,400
Where's my phone?

635
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,400
Do you know

636
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,400
you've lost your mind

637
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,400
after you said you've lost your mind?

638
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,400
Zhu Yangqi said she's booked the ticket.

639
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,400
Go and call her.

640
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400
Really?

641
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
Hello?

642
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,400
Where are you?

643
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,400
I'm on my way to the airport.

644
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
The match is about to start.

645
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
Why are you so mad?

646
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,400
I want to ask you.

647
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,400
Why don't you answer my phone?

648
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,400
I'm so mad at you.

649
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,400
How many times have you been on a plane?

650
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,400
Half an hour.

651
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,400
I'm fine.

652
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,400
Go back.

653
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,400
If the weather is bad,

654
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,400
I can't go back.

655
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,400
Your study hard work is wasted.

656
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,400
Chen Luzhou.

657
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,400
Are you worried

658
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,400
that I'll break up with you?

659
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,400
I don't know what to say.

660
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,400
Maybe I haven't seen you for a long time.

661
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,400
I've been busy

662
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
and I haven't had a good chat with you.

663
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,400
I'm worried that you'll...

664
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,400
And Mr. Cai said

665
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,400
he couldn't contact you.

666
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,400
I thought something happened to you.

667
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,400
I went to the hospital.

668
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,400
I didn't bring my phone.

669
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,400
Why did you go to the hospital?

670
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,400
Are you not feeling well?

671
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,400
No.

672
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,400
It's my dad.

673
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,400
He took a long time to get back to the hospital.

674
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,400
He didn't bring his phone.

675
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,400
I sent him there.

676
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,400
I'm sorry.

677
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,400
I'm sorry.

678
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,400
I'm sorry.

679
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,400
I'm sorry.

680
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,400
I'm sorry.

681
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,400
I'm sorry.

682
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,400
I'm sorry.

683
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
I accidentally met his girlfriend.

684
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,400
I delayed for a while.

685
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,400
Girlfriend?

686
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,400
When did your dad have a girlfriend?

687
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,400
He's actually the owner of my dad's hospital.

688
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,400
Chen Luzhou.

689
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,400
You're the only one I have.

690
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,400
As long as you don't break up with me,

691
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,400
we won't break up.

692
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,400
Wait for me at home.

693
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,400
I'll be back soon.

694
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,400
I'm fine.

695
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,400
I'm fine.

696
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,400
I'm happy for my dad.

697
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,400
I understand.

698
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,400
Chen Jiajia.

699
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,400
I'm a little angry now

700
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,400
because you were mad at me just now.

701
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,400
I was just serious.

702
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,400
How about this?

703
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,400
Wait for me to come back.

704
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,400
You can sit with me.

705
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,400
Why are you so cold?

706
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,400
If I dare to touch you,

707
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,400
you can fix me.

708
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,400
Okay?

709
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,400
That's enough.

710
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,400
Okay, it's too late now.

711
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,400
You should go back.

712
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,400
Wang Yue and Li Ke'ai are waiting for you.

713
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,400
Okay.

714
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,400
The house I rented on the 7th floor of the 903.

715
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,400
The two-story building is your house.

716
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,400
The password of the big door

717
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,400
is the high-end score of me and your college entrance exam.

718
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,400
I haven't packed my things yet.

719
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,400
You can do whatever you want with it.

720
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,400
Your family will have a lot of aunties in the future.

721
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,400
If you can't live well,

722
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
you can go to my place.

723
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,400
I only have your place in my house.

724
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,400
No one else will be there.

725
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,400
Chen Luzhang,

726
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,400
you are the best.

727
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,400
Here, this is awesome.

728
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,400
This is the year he was born.

729
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,400
I bought a baby red.

730
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,400
Today, we will make him a baby red.

731
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,400
Today?

732
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,400
Dad, didn't you say

733
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,400
we will drink it when I get married?

734
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,400
You have to wait until the wedding

735
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,400
until the wedding.

736
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,400
I decided to be nice to both of us.

737
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,400
Open it.

738
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,400
What wedding red?

739
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,400
I will bring a boyfriend back tomorrow.

740
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,400
Do you believe it?

741
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,400
Okay, but you can't be the one who will be the pig.

742
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,400
Don't call him a pig.

743
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,400
You are the pig.

744
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,400
I don't care what kind of pig he is.

745
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,400
Anyway, it's not okay.

746
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,400
Let's drink it.

747
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,400
Let's drink it.

748
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,400
It's been a long time.

749
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,400
I feel a little awkward.

750
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,400
This year,

751
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,400
we are not that many people.

752
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,400
How come the Spring Festival

753
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
feels a little different

754
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,400
from the previous year?

755
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,400
Actually,

756
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,400
they are going to school now.

757
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,400
They should go to school next year.

758
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,400
It's not half a year

759
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,400
after this trip.

760
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,400
So this year,

761
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,400
this reunion meal

762
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,400
is not a big deal.

763
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,400
It's meaningful.

764
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,400
It's okay.

765
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,400
As long as it's for the sake of the school,

766
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,400
I can see him once a year.

767
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,400
It's okay.

768
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,400
But it doesn't matter.

769
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,400
You don't have to put too much pressure on yourself.

770
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,400
No 211,

771
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,400
985,

772
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,400
it doesn't matter.

773
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,400
I don't have high requirements for you.

774
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
You just need to

775
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,400
make a normal one for me.

776
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,400
What do you mean by high requirements?

777
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,400
I've heard it.

778
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,400
A copy.

779
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,400
You can make a copy

780
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,400
and buy a dish from the market.

781
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,400
But fortunately,

782
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
your daughter has a good blood.

783
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,400
She can get a good grade soon.

784
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,400
She can also be a great host

785
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,400
in the future.

786
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,400
Right, sister?

787
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,400
Okay, okay.

788
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,400
Right, right.

789
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,400
You're a good cook

790
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,400
for our cultural history.

791
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,400
You're a professional cook.

792
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,400
I knew you were good.

793
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,400
Come on.

794
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,400
Let's enjoy the meal.

795
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,400
Come on. Happy new year.

796
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,400
Happy new year.

797
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,400
I'm going to the hospital to deliver the meal.

798
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,400
You're going out?

799
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,400
Go out.

800
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,400
Go out and wear more.

801
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,400
It's cold outside.

802
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,400
What a poor girl.

803
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,400
Your dad is so generous.

804
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,400
He won't hurt himself.

805
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,400
I've never seen him think like that.

806
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,400
He's more considerate than your dad.

807
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,400
Your dad is more considerate.

808
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,400
This year's Spring Festival,

809
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,400
Beijing has a campaign.

810
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,400
Many workers and brothers and sisters

811
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,400
have to build a country

812
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,400
that can't go home with their families.

813
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,400
The next show

814
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,400
will have a special team.

815
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,400
They will express their respect

816
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,400
and longing

817
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,400
to these great workers

818
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,400
through singing and dancing.

819
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,400
In this day of the He family,

820
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,400
let's share the joy

821
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,400
with the people.

822
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,400
This is so beautiful.

823
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,400
It's so beautiful.

824
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,400
Right, let's go down to the fireworks.

825
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Let's go down to the fireworks.

826
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,400
Let's go down to the fireworks.

827
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,400
It's not a kind of fireworks.

828
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
It's a kind of high-class ball.

829
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,400
It's a handball.

830
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,400
It's so beautiful.

831
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,400
Let's go.

832
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,400
How about my blood?

833
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,400
It's a little thin.

834
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Grandpa, where are you going to buy fireworks?

835
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,400
I brought you two meals.

836
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,400
You can eat ten meals.

837
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,400
You're thinking of going crazy.

838
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,400
I finally brought you the meal.

839
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,400
You said you wouldn't betray your sister.

840
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,400
I thought you were going to surprise me.

841
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,400
Let's go to play.

842
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,400
Let's go.

843
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,400
Sorry.

844
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,400
I'm late.

845
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,400
You're lying.

846
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,400
Happy New Year, Xu Zhen.

847
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,400
Happy New Year, Chen Luzhe.

848
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,400
Are you done?

849
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,400
No.

850
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,400
I've been sitting in a green-skinned train.

851
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,400
I haven't eaten.

852
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,400
You're sitting in a green-skinned train?

853
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,400
It's snowing.

854
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,400
There are no more half-sets of snow and high-speed railway.

855
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,400
Do you want to eat something?

856
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,400
Together?

857
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,400
I...

858
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,400
I'm leaving.

859
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,400
The restaurant is closing soon.

860
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,400
Can you stop blowing?

861
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,400
Doctor Xu.

862
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,400
Doctor Xu?

863
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,400
The New Year's Eve.

864
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,400
You're not going home?

865
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,400
What are you doing?

866
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,400
I'm here to give you something.

867
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,400
What?

868
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,400
A small one?

869
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,400
A book.

870
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,400
It's from the summer holiday.

871
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,400
Is this a box of books?

872
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,400
Yes, it's a box of books.

873
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,400
How heavy is it?

874
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,400
He can't carry it.

875
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,400
Come on, let me carry it.

876
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,400
It's a good thing to study.

877
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,400
Come on.

878
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,400
Okay, thank you, uncle.

879
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,400
Why are you standing there?

880
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,400
You're going home to read books?

881
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,400
I'm leaving.

882
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,400
Here, I'll carry the things inside.

883
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,400
You're so filial.

884
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,400
Is he with you now in the same school?

885
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,400
He left our school after he arrived in Beijing.

886
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,400
Okay, go to bed early.

887
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,400
I'll go to give grandma a half-year tomorrow.

888
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,400
Isn't it the third day?

889
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,400
I'll carry it on my own.

890
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,400
You can stay with grandma for a few more days.

891
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,400
Then the box...

892
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,400
You've packed the books and send them to her.

893
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,400
She's in a hurry?

894
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,400
No, no, no.

895
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,400
That's good.

896
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,400
I'll go to the school.

897
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,400
You're so mean.

898
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,400
Do you know I haven't eaten anything for you?

899
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,400
Who's that?

900
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,400
You sent me a picture of a pig before half an hour.

901
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,400
You're so hungry.

902
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,400
There's a name.

903
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,400
Fresh pork.

904
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,400
It's delicious.

905
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,400
Boss, give me five...

906
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,400
five scented ones.

907
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,400
And three pork.

908
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,400
So many.

909
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,400
It's just that you're a vegetable.

910
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,400
I'm a pig.

911
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,400
Isn't it good?

912
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,400
It's not good.

913
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,400
People only say that

914
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,400
the white cabbage was bitten by the pig.

915
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,400
Boss, you have two red beans.

916
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,400
Okay.

917
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,400
You've never eaten red beans?

918
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,400
Who loves it?

919
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,400
I shouldn't have...

920
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,400
Boss, do you have red beans?

921
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,400
Gu Yan, you're back to the New Year.

922
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,400
You've been popular recently.

923
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,400
I thought you were busy promoting.

924
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,400
I'm just a little playboy.

925
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,400
I'm not.

926
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,400
Which big boy is not a playboy?

927
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,400
Right?

928
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,400
Right?

929
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,400
I'm going to see you all the time.

930
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,400
I'm going to find the way to my classmate

931
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,400
who you gave me back then.

932
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,400
I can't afford to sell a lot of money in the next two years.

933
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,400
You haven't come to the competition recently.

934
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,400
It's okay.

935
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,400
When my main character is on the show,

936
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,400
I'll ask Master Chen to write me a film.

937
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,400
Miss,

938
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,400
the last two red beans were bought by this handsome guy.

939
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,400
You...

940
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,400
It's okay.

941
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,400
Give it to him first.

942
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,400
It'll take more than ten minutes.

943
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,400
Do you want half of it?

944
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,400
No, I want the red beans.

945
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,400
Okay.

946
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,400
Here.

947
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,400
Then I'll be in your care.

948
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,400
Okay.

949
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,400
Happy New Year.

950
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,400
Okay.

951
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,400
Bye.

952
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,400
Bye.

953
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,400
Is it warm?

954
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,400
It's hot.

955
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,400
Be careful.

956
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,400
Boss, is it ready?

957
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,400
Wait a minute.

958
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,400
It's ready.

959
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,400
I want two red beans.

960
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,400
Take this.

961
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,400
Thank you.

962
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,400
I'll catch two more.

963
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,400
It smells good.

964
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,400
I'm about to get a point.

965
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,400
I...

966
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,400
I have something for you.

967
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,400
What is this?

968
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,400
This is a peace book.

969
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,400
You'll definitely dream of Chen Zhen in the next year.

970
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,400
Thank you.

971
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,400
I wish you a happy New Year.

972
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,400
Dream of Chen Zhen.

973
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,400
Here.

974
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,400
Ying Ying.

975
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,400
What are you doing?

976
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,400
Actually, I didn't say anything.

977
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,400
I was going to tell you when you get to Beijing.

978
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,400
But...

979
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,400
You can't say it when you get to Beijing.

980
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,400
I'll tell you when I get to Beijing.

981
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,600
You're so good at it.

982
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,100
Happy New Year.

983
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,400
Happy New Year.

984
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,700
Happy New Year.

985
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,000
Miss Tian Lu, your delivery is here.

986
00:39:49,780 --> 00:40:14,120
Find GIRNET's

987
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,080
I'll go get it.

988
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,160
Well, Mr. Chen.

989
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,520
I forgot to remind you.

990
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,040
I made the tea machine myself.

991
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,360
Be careful when you use it.

992
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,120
It might not be very good.

993
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,800
Don't knock it.

994
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,680
Thus, Mr. Chen.

995
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,320
Well.

996
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,360
Let's check out the欲�� painting.

997
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,040
I don't know if房東 will be open.

998
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,720
Just take the thing out.

999
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,240
Hu vida

1000
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:11,960
What did you do?

1001
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,320
Smash the river tutorial

1002
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,440
If joined together after HK gave you something

1003
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:19,920
would brought you sick

1004
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,960
Did you smash the approaching calories

1005
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,200
I

1006
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,040
Didn't you go out for the meal just now

1007
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,480
Iора oden locked

999go bored

1009
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,460
Okay.

1010
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,700
There are two cans of cat food in the fridge.

1011
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,300
For the cat food.

1012
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,660
You deal with it first.

1013
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,360
Good boy.

1014
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:00,620
Don't force it if you don't love it.

1015
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,360
How my cousin human.

1016
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,980
How did you find this?

1017
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,740
My sister in law told me.

1018
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,560
903.

1019
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,480
Why are you asking me?

1020
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,520
Why don't you ask me directly?

1021
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,080
I'll ask you.

1022
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,320
You quarreled with your dad

1023
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,480
after you didn't go home for a year.

1024
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,240
The house is so big.

1025
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,440
Do you have any family members?

1026
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,040
Or do you want to live with you?

1027
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,880
I can't live with you.

1028
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:50,920
I'll go home.

1029
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:51,720
Brother.

1030
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,000
You can't live in this house.

1031
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,400
Why can't you hide from me?

1032
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,120
You're really paying your rent with your own money?

1033
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,160
Open the door, brother.

1034
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,000
Brother.

1035
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:09,920
Brother.

1036
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,080
How long have we been in the bed?

1037
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,280
Probably since

1038
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,520
I found out you were still in the bed.

1039
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,680
Brother, you have your own home now.

1040
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,520
Don't you know how to take part in it?

1041
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,920
Are you still my brother?

1042
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:33,880
Don't be so formal.

1043
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:34,720
Go to sleep.

1044
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,280
Why don't you answer me?

1045
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,720
You called me brother

1046
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,720
when you were talking.

1047
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
You won't change that much.

1048
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,440
Fine.

1049
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,600
I won't go back

1050
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:52,640
when I get there.

1051
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,640
I'll live with you.

1052
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,600
Don't think about it.

1053
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,520
Go back tomorrow.

1054
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,240
Do you hear me?

1055
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,320
You don't want to live in this house.

1056
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,360
Why?

1057
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,760
You can't live with me.

1058
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,720
I'm here to help you.

1059
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,600
Brother, don't worry.

1060
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,720
I won't disturb you and your sister-in-law.

1061
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,240
Should I go out and sleep on the couch?

1062
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,280
Shut up. Go to sleep.

1063
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,440
OK, OK, OK.

1064
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,360
Get ready.

1065
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,600
Hmm.

1066
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,800
I...

1067
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,320
need you to speak to my lady.

1068
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,940
Take care, do whatever you can.

1069
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,020
Seems like I'm not too proud to say no this time.

1070
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:52,920
I really have to take my grandma by my terms.

1071
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:53,520
OK.

1072
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,520
Inaudible.

1073
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,180
You...

1074
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,160
She's here with me now.

1075
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,160
I'll send her back tomorrow.

1076
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,160
Do you want to come to my place to spend the New Year?

1077
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,160
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

1078
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,160
No need.

1079
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,160
Lu Zhuang,

1080
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,160
happy new year.

1081
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,160
Happy new year.

1082
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,160
Mom.

1083
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,160
Happy new year.

1084
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,160
Happy new year.

1085
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:08,160
The sound of the wind.

1086
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,160
Who will be in the light?

1087
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:21,160
Be careful, don't fall into the fog.

1088
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,160
The air is cold.

1089
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:31,160
The courage has become a concern.

1090
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:41,160
Look, the sun rises and sets.

1091
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,160
Please hold me tight.

1092
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,160
You are my friend.

1093
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:52,160
Please hold me tight.

1094
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,160
I'll move forward.

1095
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,160
Because you are the wind.

1096
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,160
The hand that walks alone.

1097
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:07,160
The night is not stopping.

1098
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:11,160
We are each other.

1099
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:15,160
Please be careful.

1100
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:18,160
I'll move forward.

1101
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,160
I'll move forward.

1102
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,160
I'll move forward.

1103
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:32,160
Because you are the wind.

1104
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,160
The hand that walks alone.

1105
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:40,160
The courage has become a concern.

1106
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,160
We are each other.

1107
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:48,160
Please be careful.

1108
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:53,160
I'll move forward.

1109
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,160
In your eyes,

1110
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:01,160
I see myself.

1111
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,160
Into you.

1112
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,160
Into you.
