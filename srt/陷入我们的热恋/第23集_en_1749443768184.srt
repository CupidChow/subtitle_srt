00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,240
The heart Typeiro

2
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,180
Escape is white

3
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,820
я примерно

4
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,220
Афмет

5
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,140
Аф interesуя

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,860

7
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:51,820
Поном

8
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:53,580
Ну

00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:57,380
й

10
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:33,500
The sea is waiting for each other

11
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,300
A young man like you will always be the wind

12
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,740
Is it comfortable to see here?

13
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,700
It's okay, it's just a little bit

14
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,900
The water is coming, put it here

15
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,500
Okay

16
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,340
Dad, drink water

17
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:58,780
Drink water

18
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,060
Aunt, why don't we come and take care of Uncle Xu?

19
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:01,780
You go first

20
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:02,940
Okay

21
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,860
Okay, I'll go back to work

22
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,500
Go

23
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,780
I'll come to see you when I get off work

24
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,860
I'll leave it to you

25
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,100
Eat a orange, Uncle Xu

26
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,300
Okay

27
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,460
Xu, look who's here

28
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,860
Old man, why are you here?

29
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,100
What's going on?

30
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,060
Don't

31
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,220
I can't touch it

32
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,580
You two talk first

33
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,180
I have work, I'll go back to work

34
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,460
Okay, you go back to work

35
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,380
Let's change the day

36
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:30,980
Go

37
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,180
It's okay, don't mind him

38
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,220
What's going on?

39
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,300
Who did this?

40
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,900
I bought a car

41
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,260
He came all of a sudden

42
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,380
Where is he?

43
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,700
He's gone

44
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,220
Your dad is an old man

45
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,220
Why don't you call Uncle Fu?

46
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,620
Don't tell me

47
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,900
Uncle Fu is looking for you

48
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,340
Call me

49
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,620
Tell him

50
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,880
Call me

51
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,900
Mr Xu asked more people for his final evaluation

52
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,580
Why?

53
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,300
Uh

54
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,420
The change was late

55
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,820
You said you'd give Uncle Fu a proposal

56
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,940
That's good

57
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,420
Fish

58
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,580
Fish

59
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,700
Yes

60
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,940
In the meantime, Theatre made a move

61
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,540
I heard from a boyfriend.

62
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,140
Okay.

63
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,420
Chen.

64
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,540
Tell him.

65
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:28,940
Here.

66
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,340
Uncle Xu.

67
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,780
Since someone is looking after you, I'll go first.

68
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,700
Don't go to the cafeteria for dinner.

69
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,140
We'll send you some food.

70
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,020
Okay.

71
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,700
Then you...

72
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,260
You can go back together.

73
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,820
Okay.

74
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,340
Go to bed early.

75
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,660
Brother Chen.

76
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,080
What happened?

77
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,340
How am I going to be with selvage in your Xu's family?

78
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,500
Don't act against Chen?

79
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,120
I can't forth bedroom!

80
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,640
I'm not polite.

81
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,400
It's the son of the meeting.

82
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,000
Don't think too much.

83
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,000
If he knows,

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,640
he'll be in a bad mood.

85
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,560
Don't worry.

86
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,680
I've been dead for a long time.

87
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,440
I'm not used to it.

88
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,960
Ba,

89
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,440
I thought you didn't know how to face him.

90
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,600
Don't be a stranger.

91
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,800
Just be an airman.

92
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:56,960
Let's go.

93
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,280
Go somewhere with me.

94
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,680
What place?

95
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,760
Take the first step of the old man.

96
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:03,720
Okay.

97
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,680
And break his stomach.

98
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:06,960
Let's go.

99
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,560
Chen Luzhuo.

100
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,720
I want to see your old man.

101
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,880
What do you want?

102
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,120
You look like a dead person.

103
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,560
Ba,

104
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,160
don't fall in love with Chen Luzhuo.

105
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,600
It's hard to get married.

106
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,440
Yes.

107
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,840
Why don't you propose to me now?

108
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,800
Maybe I'll agree when my mind is hot.

109
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,160
Mr. Chen Luzhuo,

110
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,200
you...

111
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,440
have some face.

112
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,440
You...

113
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,760
I gave you that little dog.

114
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,160
Do you still have it?

115
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,160
It's on the floor.

116
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,600
Okay.

117
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,040
This is your first time to do handwork with a boyfriend.

118
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,880
It's done. Don't lose it.

119
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,760
Lu Zuo.

120
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,440
Okay. Go out.

121
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,240
Don't worry about me.

122
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,400
You're not going out?

123
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,800
I'll send you a meal later.

124
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,200
Aren't you afraid that your dad will break your leg?

125
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,640
He should take care of himself first.

126
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,320
Hello. Please come in.

127
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:48,640
Thank you.

128
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,360
You're welcome.

129
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,200
Here.

130
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,800
Your favorite red bean paste.

131
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,440
I don't drink tea anymore.

132
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,440
Hi.

133
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,440
Sorry.

134
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,240
It's all my fault.

135
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,360
What else?

137
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,000
It's all my fault.

138
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,400
I was too young and unreliable.

139
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,480
I didn't take the responsibility as a father.

140
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,880
I just pushed you.

141
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,360
I had no choice.

142
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,000
I just said

143
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,120
that the child was adopted by someone else.

144
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,800
Actually, last year,

145
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,360
I saw him in my dress.

146
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,040
He's so handsome.

147
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,920
He's good at teaching.

148
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,920
He knows how to do things.

149
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,240
He has his own ideas.

150
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,120
He's very good at raising his mother.

151
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,280
Thank you for your hard work these years.

152
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,120
What do you mean by

153
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,320
saying these beautiful words?

154
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,360
I don't want to take him to the tribule

155
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,120
because I didn't have good intentions.

156
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,880
Later I went to find him.

157
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,000
And you found out.

158
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,400
I did.

159
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,280
I still know

160
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:27,640
how do you think

161
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,880
he was linked to your father.

162
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,680
That makes me think

163
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,340
that this

164
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,060
has many stories to tell.

165
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,020
I'm not a good person.

166
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,540
I just want to discuss with you

167
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,020
how to make up for you two.

168
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,020
How to make up for you?

169
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,740
What do you want?

170
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,220
Take my dress.

171
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:50,740
Give it to her.

172
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,980
As far as I can.

173
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,180
I'll give her anything.

174
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,140
Do you think she will take it?

175
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,620
If she doesn't,

176
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,020
I'll give Xu Zhi.

177
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,180
After they come here...

178
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,340
Hu Yuching.

179
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,900
It's not that simple for you to take your son in.

180
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,980
You said you'd give him something.

181
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,580
I'll give him a head nod.

182
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,500
He'll agree.

183
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,300
Lu Zhou is not a child now.

184
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,060
He has his own understanding and judgment.

185
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:26,980
Yes.

186
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,340
You're right.

187
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,700
Do you have anything else?

188
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,940
It's good that she and Xu Zhi are now...

189
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,940
It seems that it has nothing to do with you.

190
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,300
It's okay. I'll go first.

191
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,020
Here.

192
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,020
It's good. Take a look.

193
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,140
My Xu family's son-in-law.

194
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:13,660
Look.

195
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,700
He's handsome and well-mannered.

196
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,140
The key is that he's good at cooking.

197
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,060
You made it?

198
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:21,620
Yes.

199
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,060
It's not bad.

200
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,140
Uncle Xu doesn't want to eat it.

201
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:25,940
How could he?

202
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,420
I'm not bragging.

203
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,260
I'm not bragging.

204
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,260
I'm not bragging.

205
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,260
I'm not bragging.

206
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,260
I'm not bragging.

207
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,260
I'm not bragging.

208
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,260
I'm not bragging.

209
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,260
I'm not bragging.

210
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,260
I'm not bragging.

211
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,260
I'm not bragging.

212
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,260
I'm not bragging.

213
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,260
Do you want to try it?

214
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,860
How is it?

215
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,500
It's not bad.

216
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,900
When will you be back?

217
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,620
Don't worry.

218
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,900
We'll talk when you're out.

219
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,460
I'll be out tomorrow.

220
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,020
I think

221
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,180
before you leave,

222
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,300
I'll cook for you.

223
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,140
You'll have to pay for it

224
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,380
when you come back.

225
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,540
We won't come back.

226
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,740
What's wrong?

227
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,740
Do you want to have a sprain?

228
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,460
Uncle Xu, I've received a brand.

229
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,700
I won't come back.

230
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,820
But Xu Zhi Xing can come back to accompany you.

231
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,300
Didn't we agree last night?

232
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,420
I'll be with you.

233
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,260
I didn't promise you.

234
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,180
Don't bother about the kid.

235
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,100
It's not appropriate to be a lamp.

236
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:28,980
Okay.

237
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,300
Yes.

238
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,060
After you go to Beijing,

239
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,900
you should study hard.

240
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,100
If you need money,

241
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,300
call us.

242
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,340
Call me?

243
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,260
Yes.

244
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,340
You have money.

245
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,180
Here.

246
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,620
This is my daughter.

247
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,780
She's my first boyfriend.

248
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,740
She's just in her new year.

249
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,220
I'm

250
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,060
a little bit worried about

251
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,660
this.

252
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,140
No, Uncle Xu.

253
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:12,900
Take it.

254
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,620
Take it.

255
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,420
If you don't take it,

256
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,660
Xu Zhi Xing will be given it.

257
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,500
Take it.

258
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,740
Take it.

259
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:21,940
Okay.

260
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,980
Thank you, Uncle Xu.

261
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,580
Thank you, Uncle Cai.

262
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,620
What's more?

263
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,140
You must have

264
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,220
more vegetables.

265
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,740
Then three.

266
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,660
You mean this one?

267
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,460
That one?

268
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,060
Yes.

269
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,460
You and Uncle Cai have taken it.

270
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,300
He can take it back.

271
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,660
He doesn't have money.

272
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,540
No money?

273
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,020
What's that?

274
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,500
Open it and you'll know.

275
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,900
Letter prophets.

276
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,860
For車 parks,

277
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,420
I forgot a pocket

278
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,460
for Uncle Cai and my dad.

279
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,540
Don't have money.

280
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,260
Will it pass?

281
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,140
으면 is finalised.

282
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,180
Of course.

283
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,340
Keep it.

284
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,940
Take a look.

285
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,020
8 procs?

286
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,520
I'm done.

287
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,560
Get the cart.

288
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,340
Is it ok?

289
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,580
Of course, I don't have any secrets.

290
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,140
How could you carry the package?

291
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,700
What else?

292
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,540
Foraki?

293
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,960
What if it needs agua and nanoelectromy

294
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,760
Xia Bu sent you money in the New Year.

295
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,520
I make you a little bit more money.

296
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,480
Is he对你好?

297
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,560
It's enough.

298
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,520
Your parents have become attorneys.

299
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,600
I know you can be a dinner Medical Officer Ruan.

300
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,480
I don't care.

301
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,160
I was helpingaturae.

302
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,200
What is he?

303
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,620
He's actually on

304
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,420
a diet.

305
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,140
to find the people who went to the door.

306
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,020
So,

307
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,220
my dad said that the way he said it was the same.

308
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,100
I don't believe he was that bad.

309
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,980
I don't believe

310
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,540
you said that.

311
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,620
Have you seen him?

312
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,700
Do you want to see him?

313
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,300
Of course not.

314
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,060
Yan Xing Kinda Guess?

315
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,780
Why are you buying him a full-time ticket?

316
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,900
It's no joke for me.

317
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,740
I'm thinking about it.

318
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,220
Immediately

319
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,060
let him

320
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,260
give me a gun

321
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,460
and then let the Masterumb Buy.

322
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,060
It will end with Masterumb Buy.

323
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,420
This kid is very healthy and not bad.

324
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,420
I heard that he's playing basketball every day.

325
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,420
Can you do it?

326
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,420
I'm not bad.

327
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,420
I'm a master.

328
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,420
Are you kidding me?

329
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,420
Didn't I give him two tickets?

330
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,420
Let him bring Xu Zhi with him.

331
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,420
As long as Xu Zhi comes,

332
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,420
he will keep it.

333
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,420
How can I beat him?

334
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,420
I think

335
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,420
he should be lazy to handle you.

336
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,420
Impossible.

337
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,420
He's my son.

338
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,420
I'm so touched.

339
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,420
He will bring Xu Zhi with him.

340
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,420
Is that okay?

341
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,420
I wish you success.

342
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,420
He won't be beaten up, right?

343
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,420
Uncle Xu will be discharged tomorrow.

344
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,420
The fixed account is tomorrow.

345
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,420
I asked Zhu Yangqi to borrow his SUV.

346
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,420
Uncle Xu will be better.

347
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,420
You and Cai Ying

348
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,420
will be in charge of cleaning the ward.

349
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,420
Okay?

350
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,420
Okay.

351
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,420
My boyfriend is so weak.

352
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,420
He's probably

353
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,420
the god of soul.

354
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,420
Is it possible

355
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,420
that he's the god of soul?

356
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,420
Chen Luozhou, don't be too much.

357
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,420
I mean it.

358
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,420
How about this?

359
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,420
I won't pretend.

360
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,420
I'll confess.

361
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,420
From now on,

362
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,420
you love me.

363
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,420
I love Xu.

364
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,420
Xu loves you.

365
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,420
Let's keep our hands together.

366
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,420
Are you stupid?

367
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,420
No.

368
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,420
You're stupid.

369
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,420
You're the stupidest.

370
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,420
Okay.

371
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,420
Go back.

372
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,420
Your dad knows

373
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,420
that you're with me these days.

374
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,420
How does he know?

375
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,420
I said you're stupid.

376
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,420
You don't believe me.

377
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,420
He calls your house every night.

378
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,420
He asks you

379
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,420
when you're home

380
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,420
and when you're home.

381
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,420
No?

382
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,420
No.

383
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,420
Hello?

384
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,420
Dad,

385
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,420
where's my homework?

386
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,420
Chen Luozhou.

387
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,420
You should call me brother.

388
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,420
Dad doesn't know that.

389
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,420
And you're silly.

390
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,420
You're so boring.

391
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,420
Are you done?

392
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,420
Okay, okay.

393
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,420
Okay.

394
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,420
I'll get it.

395
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,420
Hello?

396
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,860
Are you done?

397
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,180
Okay.

398
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,460
Xu Zhi's boyfriend

399
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,300
is the biggest fool in the world.

400
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,100
Is that enough?

401
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,900
How about you go to the hospital

402
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,780
and pick up Xu Shu tomorrow?

403
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,060
I want to do something.

404
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,820
Xu and I will wait for you at home.

405
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,020
Big fool.

406
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,140
You scared me.

407
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,380
Yes.

408
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,380
I'm on a shopping trip to go to China.

409
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,660
I like the trip.

410
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,060
I love the shopping that goes with the vibe and effort.

411
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,940
I have to wait.

412
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,940
Chen Luzhou didn't come?

413
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,940
He went to find someone to settle accounts.

414
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,940
Do you want to pick him up later?

415
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,940
I've told him that we'll have dinner and wait for him to come back.

416
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,940
You're still here for dinner?

417
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,940
I have to go to the kitchen to buy some food.

418
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,940
Take care.

419
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,940
Don't waste the food on the table.

420
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,940
I'll take all the fruits and flowers.

421
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,940
I'll take all of them.

422
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,940
Bye, Uncle Xu.

423
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,940
Uncle Xu is already like this. He even went to buy vegetables.

424
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,940
He really treats Chen Luzhou as his own son.

425
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,940
But I can't be his son.

426
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,940
I was scared to death the other day.

427
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,940
Exactly.

428
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,940
I almost became his sister-in-law.

429
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,940
I... I... I...

430
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:21,940
Fine.

431
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,940
You two are sisters-in-law.

432
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,940
I'll be your sister-in-law.

433
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,940
Then, little sister-in-law,

434
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,940
do you want to take a break?

435
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,940
The rest is your sister-in-law.

436
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,940
Lin Qing.

437
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,940
What's wrong?

438
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,940
Come on.

439
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,940
Why isn't Xu Zhi here?

440
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,940
Uncle Xu went to the hospital.

441
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,940
This guy.

442
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,940
Why don't we have another place to talk?

443
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,940
Let's go.

444
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,940
I thought you were ready to go to the hospital when you gave me the ticket.

445
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,940
Come on.

446
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,940
Come on.

447
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,940
Xu Zhi.

448
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,940
What's wrong?

449
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,940
They all hit me.

450
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,940
They're all pretty tough, you brat.

451
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,940
Come on, continue.

452
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,940
Hit it.

453
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,940
What about the boat for you?

454
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,940
Interesting, right, Fu Yuxian?

455
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,940
If something doesn't work out,

456
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,940
it'll be over in a few days.

457
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,940
We'll meet again in the best way we can.

458
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,940
Lu Zhou.

459
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:53,940
I really never thought about it.

460
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,940
I regret it.

461
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,940
I went to the hospital to see you.

462
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,940
I'm really sorry.

463
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,940
I'm sorry.

464
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,940
So I have to thank you, right?

465
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,940
Fu Yuxian.

466
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,940
It's because you're a man.

467
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,940
My mom has been prejudiced against me since I was a kid.

468
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,940
I just told a girl a few more words.

469
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,940
She felt like I was like you.

470
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,940
She was so upset.

471
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,940
It's also because of you.

472
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,940
I was sent to the welfare hospital since I was a kid.

473
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,940
I was picked up by others in the welfare hospital.

474
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,940
I didn't even know who you were the first 18 years.

475
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,940
But you made my life a mess.

476
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,940
You should have known it sooner or later.

477
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,940
Now you bought two full-time tickets.

478
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,940
And I'm here to give you a few.

479
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,940
Do you think that can change anything?

480
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,940
I'm sorry.

481
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,940
Forget it.

482
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,940
I can forgive you.

483
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,940
But it has nothing to do with you.

484
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,940
It's because Xu Zhi told me that you're very nice to him.

485
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,940
He likes you.

486
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,940
I don't want him to be a burden between us.

487
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,940
But don't think about the relationship between us.

488
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,940
You're just his uncle.

489
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,940
The past is the future.

490
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,940
If you really want to make up with someone,

491
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,940
it's me who's not the person.

492
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:13,940
It's Lian Hui.

493
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,940
I'm sorry.

494
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,940
Chen Jia Jia,

495
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,940
you can't even get the soup back.

496
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,940
Let's go ahead.

497
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,940
Let's go ahead.

498
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,940
Son of a gun.

499
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,940
Let's give him a break.

500
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,940
I'm thinking about him.

501
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,940
He will never give up.

502
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:52,940
Injured,

503
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,420
un kite dardering,

504
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,940
broken heart.

505
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:04,400
And all the secrets of the world War

506
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,120
Were the flashy and complicated traffickers.

507
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,620
Also call me

508
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:15,020
There are more strangers on the mountain

509
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,020
Do not stop her

510
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,340
May the girl destiny

511
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,560
please allow her Hoping forever

512
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,940
Reporting George

513
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,040
wait for me home

514
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,120
Here, crab is here.

515
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,120
Yay!

516
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,120
Smells so good.

517
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,120
Why hasn't Brother Lu Zhou come back yet?

518
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,120
You've already done three times for him.

519
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,120
Why do you always mention my boyfriend?

520
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,120
Your boyfriend is more charming than you.

521
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,120
Drink it.

522
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,120
Wait.

523
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,120
Wait until he's full.

524
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,120
Will he come back?

525
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,120
You've got a boyfriend now, forget about me.

526
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,120
Okay, I'll get you a crab leg.

527
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,120
Where's your bowl?

528
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,120
Here.

529
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,120
Here.

530
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,120
You're so fat.

531
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,120
You're going to eat until next year, right?

532
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,120
Enough, Sister Ying Ying.

533
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,120
Just now, you gave me a crab leg.

534
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,120
I'm not.

535
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,120
You haven't gotten married yet.

536
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,120
You're not going to go out with me, right?

537
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,120
I still love you the most.

538
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,120
Sorry, I'm late.

539
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,120
Cheng Lu Zhou.

540
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,120
Here.

541
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,120
Here.

542
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,120
I bought you a new one.

543
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,120
Dad, where's Cheng Lu Zhou's stuff?

544
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,120
There.

545
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,120
You brought so many things?

546
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,120
Come on, what else did you buy?

547
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,120
You're so polite.

548
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,120
No, I brought some fruits.

549
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,120
Okay, sit there first.

550
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,120
Come on, come on.

551
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,120
I'll wait for you.

552
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,120
Sit down.

553
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,120
Hello, Brother Lu Zhou.

554
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,120
Hello.

555
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,120
Pour some drinks for Brother Lu.

556
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,120
Okay.

557
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,120
Do you want some orange juice?

558
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,120
Thank you, I'll do it myself.

559
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,120
It's okay.

560
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,120
Uncle, sit down.

561
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,120
Wait for you. Sit down first.

562
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,120
You're my family.

563
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,120
Sit down.

564
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,120
You're my family.

565
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,120
You're my family's host.

566
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,120
Thank you.

567
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,120
Let's go.

568
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,120
I need a dish.

569
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,120
Wait a minute.

570
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,120
Slow down.

571
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,120
It's okay.

572
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,120
No need to serve.

573
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,120
Give it to me.

574
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,120
Here, Lu Zhou.

575
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,120
I said it's okay.

576
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,120
The chicken is stuck in the chicken.

577
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,120
It's a peanuts.

578
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,120
Sit down first.

579
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,120
What about the director?

580
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,120
You said Lu Zhou is a peanuts.

581
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,120
It's a bit too famous, right?

582
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,120
From today on,

583
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,120
Xu Shi's report is on the chicken.

584
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,120
There's no peanuts.

585
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,120
Here.

586
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,120
Try it.

587
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,120
You're so kind.

588
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,120
Okay.

589
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,120
How does it taste?

590
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,120
It's good.

591
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,120
It's good, right?

592
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,120
Okay.

593
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,120
I'll make it for you

594
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,120
when the chicken is cooked.

595
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,120
It's not like Zhang's daughters are picky.

596
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,120
I think Xu Shu is better

597
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,120
than Sister Xu Zhi

598
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,120
for Brother Lu Zhou.

599
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,120
That's not true.

600
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,120
It's so annoying when I first saw him.

601
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,120
He came to my place

602
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,120
secretly to hang up the phone

603
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,120
and gave me a red envelope.

604
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,120
Right?

605
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,120
Wait.

606
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,120
He went to see the patient with you.

607
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,120
Chen Lu Zhou is a man.

608
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,120
Right.

609
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,120
You're so...

610
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,120
It's a misunderstanding.

611
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,120
The indicators are very normal.

612
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,120
Lu Zhou,

613
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,120
keep it up.

614
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,120
I wish you all

615
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,120
a healthy life.

616
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,120
A healthy life.

617
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,120
A healthy life.

618
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,120
A healthy life.

619
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,120
A healthy life.

620
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,120
A healthy life.

621
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,120
What's going on?

622
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,120
I'm so angry.

623
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,120
I didn't mean it.

624
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,120
He told me

625
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,120
you were injured by playing ball.

626
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,120
You're very healthy.

627
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,120
Really?

628
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,120
Yes.

629
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,120
I'm not.

630
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,120
I'm not.

631
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,120
I'm not.

632
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,120
I'm not.

633
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,120
I'm not.

634
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,120
I'm not.

635
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,120
I'm not.

636
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,120
I'm not.

637
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,120
I'm not.

638
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,120
I'm not.

639
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,120
I'm not.

640
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,120
I'm not.

641
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,120
I'm not.

642
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,120
I'm not.

643
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,120
I'm not.

644
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,120
I'm not.

645
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,120
Stop it.

646
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,120
Good thing you told me.

647
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,120
Don't do that.

648
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,120
All right. I'm going home.

649
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,120
Xu had it for so long today.

650
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,120
I'm afraid it's inconvenient

651
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,120
for him to ride the horse and legs.

652
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
I'll take care of him.

653
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,120
Don't go over there.

654
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,120
Keep him away.

655
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,120
Where's the good thing about Xu?

656
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,120
I can't get by.

657
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,480
I

658
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,120
tilt my waist and

659
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,720
I'm

660
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,980
blame

661
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,880
plant

662
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,880
What's wrong with me

663
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,000
I ran away.

664
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,120
Be careful on the journey.

665
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,240
Coming.

666
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,240
The new care first.

667
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,440
There are no sne Xia possibility.

668
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,040
It's late night.

669
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:47,460
I just like the Shanghai

670
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,100
Thats follow as I have a talk with the world and deeper.

671
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,020
All of these are the latest data we have shown,

672
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,840
In year 2019 we haveCong foliage industry.

673
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,080
A proud university.

674
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,980
What do you want lunch for?

675
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,520
lunch

676
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,840
Do you want to ask Chen Luzhou?

677
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,960
If he comes to eat,

678
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,760
I can buy some more dishes.

679
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,760
He still has the face to see you.

680
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,560
He has such a thin face.

681
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,400
Still blushing?

682
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,320
It's because you're in charge of the situation.

683
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,120
It's good that a boy has a thin face.

684
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,640
Be careful.

685
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,520
Are you wearing socks?

686
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,280
No.

687
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,520
I'm fine.

688
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,560
I'll go out with him later.

689
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,680
I'll buy some things to wear when I go back to school.

690
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,920
I think he's quite good at some places.

691
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,720
Look.

692
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,680
You two are together in the Korean holiday.

693
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,800
You still have to be together when you come back to Beijing.

694
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,440
Aren't you tired?

695
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,360
I haven't said anything yet.

696
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,760
Then,

697
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,760
come on.

698
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,400
Take these things back.

699
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,200
What is it?

700
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,200
Look at it yourself.

701
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,840
The number you have dialed is busy.

702
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,840
The number you have dialed is busy.

703
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,840
Buy some.

704
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,320
I'll go cook.

705
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,120
I'll have breakfast first.

706
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Are you happy now?

707
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Yes.

708
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,640
I know that I have a new family.

709
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,240
I'm still very happy.

710
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,440
That's good.

711
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,680
I think the dog named Lucy was found.

712
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,440
Why does it sound like a curse?

713
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,320
No.

714
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,680
Do you know what's the happiest thing in the world?

715
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,680
I don't know.

716
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,280
It's that

717
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,640
everyone else on the street is single.

718
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,120
But we're in love.

719
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,000
Isn't it?

720
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,120
You're a man.

721
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,200
If you don't want to be hit,

722
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,400
just say a few words.

723
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,400
Then,

724
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,720
do you know what's the most miserable thing in the world?

725
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,720
It's that everyone else is single.

726
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,200
But we're not single.

727
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,720
Because of someone's appearance,

728
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,120
I don't hate you anymore.

729
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,240
I don't hate you anymore.

730
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,840
Why are you here?

731
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,720
You're not going there.

732
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,120
I can only come to you.

733
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:28,760
Before school,

734
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,680
we have to have a meal together.

735
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,120
I...

736
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,480
Open the door.

737
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,240
Wait for a long time.

738
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,200
I'll get it.

739
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:48,880
Here.

740
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,120
Bring the vegetables in.

741
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,080
No.

742
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:16,920
Sorry.

743
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,640
You can call.

744
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,120
How is it possible?

745
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,080
I can't bear to visit you

746
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,200
until I make an halibut.

747
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,000
That's why you are all healthy.

748
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,840
Your signature dishes

749
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,080
should stop ticking on thexit.

750
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,080
You underestimate me.

751
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:37,840
I taught Sisterauri

752
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,040
how to make

753
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:39,840
the signature dishes.

754
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,440
I'll let you wear it for a long time.

755
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,520
I'll take whatever you want.

756
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,520
I heard...

757
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,200
I heard you went to the whole house to find him.

758
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,520
What did he say?

759
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,600
Please forgive me.

760
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,880
What else can I say?

761
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:08,940
What about you?

762
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,740
I've forgiven him.

763
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:34,240
For his

764
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,180
Are you gonna tear his hand when you hit him?

765
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,680
iets ou comme ce sol.

766
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,040
Good sport.

767
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,040
My love has gone.

768
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:50,980
Look.

769
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,620
Actually,

770
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:54,860
it's time for you

771
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,180
to show your love

772
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,520
and respect.

773
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,080
Can you take my love?

774
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,480
Yes.

775
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,120
I can't so I can't.

776
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,700
Thank you for your kind tenderness.

777
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,840

781
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,520
Let me help you.

782
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,880
Where are you from?

783
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,040
Cooking.

784
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,000
I've prepared everything for you.

785
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,520
Well...

786
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,880
How are you热ped in?

787
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,640
When my hyungying stayed there,

788
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,600
I'm an old man.

789
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,920
Xu Zhi hasn't agreed to marry you.

790
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,320
Don't be so self-conscious.

791
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,880
How do you know that he doesn't want to?

792
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,200
Are you familiar with him?

793
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,480
By the way,

794
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,080
when you went to Beijing to pick up Chen Xingqi,

795
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,680
what did you and Xu Zhi want?

796
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,160
You're familiar with him, right?

797
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,120
Go ask him.

798
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,680
I don't know.

799
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:01,640
I'm sorry.

800
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,000
Don't be so careless.

801
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,640
I'll call you later.

802
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,640
Enough. Stop giving me a break.

803
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,040
Enough.

804
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,360
Sit down and wait for dinner.

805
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,200
It's too noisy.

806
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:07,920
It's really going to get dark.

807
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,200
Look, it's getting dark.

808
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,520
Hurry up.

809
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,320
You...

810
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,680
Okay, you do it.

811
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,520
You can see my brother

812
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,840
when you turn the door around.

813
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,200
Chen Luzhou,

814
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,680
give your dad a way out.

815
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,360
There's no real despair in the world.

816
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,240
Only the pain of being trapped by thoughts.

817
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,240
What are you looking at?

818
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,320
Dad,

819
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,040
you fell in love with Chen Luzhou?

820
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,840
Again?

821
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:11,680
Okay.

822
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,680
Are you childish?

823
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,240
I'm not.

824
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,400
You're a dog.

825
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,840
I made a movie.

826
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,680
I heard that everyone cries.

827
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:27,880
Do you want to watch it?

828
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,160
I don't.

829
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,160
It's boring.

830
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,160
You can't make me laugh.

831
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,800
What's wrong?

832
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,760
What is this?

833
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,400
This.

834
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,440
Actually,

835
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,640
we have an intervention call at Lu kupes.

836
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,840
All-round bras.

837
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,840
Exceptor

838
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,600
human.

839
00:39:49,840 --> 00:40:03,640
No.

840
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:09,200
Or be chivalry.

841
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,240
Okay, I'll be the one to open my eyes.

842
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,560
Next, a divider probability student representative,

843
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,200
Xu Zhi, will be your fuel for the speech.

844
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,040
Thank you.

845
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,200
Snow, sea, crow,

846
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:30,920
bitter porridge,

847
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,000
beautiful flowers, fragrant flowers,

848
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,880
bitter, coldness.

849
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,880
As long as we don't stop

850
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,000
the progress of the progress,

851
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,040
we can see Lin Ming's light.

852
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,880
Is there anyone here

853
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,120
who wants to oppose me?

854
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,200
Please.

855
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,240
Lin Ming's light

856
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,200
can be seen

857
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,480
without moving.

858
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,240
That's right.

859
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,440
I think you guys

860
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,280
will think

861
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,600
why we should sit here

862
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,720
and listen to these nonsense.

863
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,640
Then, let's talk about the actual thing.

864
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,560
For example,

865
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,040
what time is the night?

866
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,680
We don't look like

867
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,320
a ghost in the morning.

868
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,280
For example,

869
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,600
what time is it?

870
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,160
The red-hot ribs of the second floor

871
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,880
are far ahead of us.

872
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,080
After that,

873
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,520
let's talk about the progress.

874
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,320
For example, the morning bell.

875
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,720
What time is it?

876
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,920
It's the morning bell.

877
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,000
I know it's a very sensitive word.

878
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
But it won't disappear

879
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,720
because we don't mention it, right?

880
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,240
But I personally think

881
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,800
the precious three years of high school

882
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,960
should be as likely

883
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,760
to be promoted to the semester.

884
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,200
Because it's the highest

885
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,720
rate of performance and return rate.

886
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:44,800
Of course,

887
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,800
if you don't believe in love,

888
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,280
don't feel ashamed.

889
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,240
Because loving someone

890
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,640
is never a shameful thing.

891
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,200
You can turn your love

892
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,760
into a kind of motivation.

893
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,560
But you can't

894
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,720
be selfish

895
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,760
because others don't like you.

896
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,520
Because

897
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,560
he may only like himself.

898
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,360
Well,

899
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,880
the above is a personal opinion

900
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,520
about the school's position.

901
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,680
Please don't

902
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,760
post videos on the Internet.

903
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,600
If you don't go to school,

904
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,720
you'll definitely get a scholarship next year.

905
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,440
It's still your fault.

906
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,600
I'm just kidding.

907
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,400
I just want to say

908
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,680
a few words about the true heart of the fake sky.

909
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,600
When I was in high school,

910
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,320
I also studied in the first grade.

911
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,200
At that time, I felt

912
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,080
very confused in the future.

913
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,240
No matter what I did,

914
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,480
I felt very lost.

915
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,080
Later, I heard a word without a doubt.

916
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,000
It said,

917
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,840
there is no real hope in the world

918
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,400
but a picture of being trapped in thoughts.

919
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,520
At that moment,

920
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,000
I understood.

921
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,200
We can be very small,

922
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,960
but we can be very great.

923
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,680
If you have a normal heart,

924
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,080
the sun will be hot and hot.

925
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,680
As long as the sun is not up,

926
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,400
we will have the future.

927
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,680
Those days when we were in the rain,

928
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,680
we can still dry the water on our clothes.

929
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,080
As for whether you are happy or sad,

930
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,520
whether you are full of worries or not,

931
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,240
we always have.

932
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,680
In the end, we chose the world,

933
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,960
not the world, but us.

934
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,760
Lastly, I want to share with you

935
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,440
my boyfriend's favorite words.

936
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,840
Let's send to whom we are happy.

937
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,440
Finally, there are 1000 all-fLING friends,

938
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:39,480
eight fans.

939
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,520
Just want to show me how we do things.

940
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,080
Thank you!

941
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,720
Congratulations!

942
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,320
The song and the poem are written.

943
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:52,880
Don't worry.

944
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,520
Please stand up.

945
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,000
Raise your right hand.

946
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,640
The name of Qingchun.

947
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,520
Appear.

948
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,600
The name of Qingchun.

949
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,440
Xia's young master.

950
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,960
Xia's young master.

951
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,920
18 words.

952
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,960
18 words.

953
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,640
The wind blows.

954
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,320
The wind blows.

955
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,640
Our leaders.

956
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,280
Our dream will come true.

957
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,020
Didn't she say we should visit in preparatory?

958
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,200
Does she fear we will miss it?

959
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,560
I just displayed a mind to call with the car key

960
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,720
and wanted to go home to see.

961
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:30,680
Is it good news?

962
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,400
Mr. Ortiz.

963
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,000
Quite good news.

964
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,360
We've made theer a sn터.

965
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:36,640
I got it.

966
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,200
The liver-puff train driven by theerg!

967
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,320
The liver-puff train driven by theerg!

968
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:19,080
to hold our foundation

969
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,040
Like clouds on a rainy night

970
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:45,280
Free to give in, birds over do

971
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:50,320
The world is too quiet

972
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:57,320
All the sound is gone

973
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:03,320
Who will be in the light

974
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:11,320
Be careful, don't fall into the water

975
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,320
The air is cold

976
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:21,320
The world becomes care and care

977
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:31,320
Look, the sun rises and sets

978
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:38,320
Please push me to your world

979
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:42,320
Please push me

980
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:49,320
The future is moving because you are the wind

981
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:53,320
The hands that walk alone in the dark

982
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:57,320
The chase is not stopping in the dark

983
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,320
Are we hurt?

984
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,320
Don't be careful, don't fall into the water

985
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,320
Only you

986
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,320
Only you

987
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:22,320
The future is moving because you are the wind

988
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,320
The love is missing several times

989
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:30,320
Only then can we fight the hate

990
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:34,320
After the end of the world

991
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,320
I will walk away from the other side

992
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:43,320
I won't retreat

993
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,320
In your eyes

994
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:51,320
I see myself

995
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:55,320
Into you

996
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,320
Into you

997
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,320
Into you
