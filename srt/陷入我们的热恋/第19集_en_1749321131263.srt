1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The wind blows my heart

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The moment I look back

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The smile is drawn into the distance

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The pain is hurt, the hatred is impenetrable

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It blows my heart

6
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
If I cry out my eyes

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let the storm of the city stop and keep the memories

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The sea is flying in each other's arms

9
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Cry

10
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I want to give this gift to a 6-year-old Chen Ruzhou's little friend

11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The End

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Love them, get used to it, and be able to see them at night

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Welcome to watch our hot chain

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Do you want to eat the stewed lamb?

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Sure

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Add another stewed lamb

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Sure

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Let me see

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let's take a picture of the yellow melon

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Happy birthday, brother

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We can say it well

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
If I progress

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'll go to Beijing to play

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Then give me the little piece of cake

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Here we go

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The limited edition

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
How about it?

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Dad, let me play with you

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Okay, dad, let's wear it without any problems

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Where's Mr. Chi?

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Is he here?

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He's in class

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
He'll be here soon

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What did you order?

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I ordered a sujebi

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Okay

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Let me see

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
A big plate

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You're a big plate on the street on your birthday

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What are you thinking about?

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Why are you so serious?

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Don't make him worry

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's just a birthday

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay, okay, okay

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Thank you

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Okay, thank you

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Thank you

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Okay

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I just told you about that

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Think about it when you go back

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What's the matter?

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I want to take part in the magic competition

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But he's in this state recently

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I think dating is a little bit of a problem

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Come on

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
How many months is this training period?

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Training period?

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Three months

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I think we should see him

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
He's not that good at all

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
No way

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
He's so brainwashed

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The competition is over

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Who told you I'm not going?

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You're in the same class

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You're in the same class

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That's right

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Let's go

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
When you're in the second grade

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We'll be in the same class

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm here

72
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm here

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm here

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Oh no

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You're here on a birthday with your boyfriend?

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You said you don't need to prepare

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Okay

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What are you waiting for?

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Come on, have a look

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I ordered the Song Yunxi

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Don't hide it

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Take it out in the bag

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's so useless

84
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Boss, I'm thirsty

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's useless

86
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's useless

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Look

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's like a rubber band

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's really a chain

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Let me tell you

91
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
There's a basketball court over there

92
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Help me buy a basketball

93
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
No need to buy a expensive one

94
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
No need to buy a sports ball

95
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'll ask you this question

96
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You can hit me with a basketball

97
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I

98
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Family land

99
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's okay

100
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You're pretending again

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Let's go

102
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You're back

103
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yes

104
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Where's the ball?

105
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I asked the boss

106
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Which ball doesn't hurt

107
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The boss said

108
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The key is to have a bad injury

109
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I think you're so angry

110
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's better to be safe

111
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Okay

112
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Take it as a birthday gift

113
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Here

114
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Thank you

115
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'll try this

116
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Really

117
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Try it

118
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's so good

119
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'll get it for you

120
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's a gift

121
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Family land

122
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's sour

123
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's so bitter

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'll go to the bathroom

125
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Enough, you eat

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm hungry

127
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Last one

128
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Is dad's girl good?

129
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I don't have a birthday cake

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
How is that possible

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Dad loves you

132
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Thank you, son

133
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'll let you eat the old man's cake

134
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Hold it

135
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
No need

136
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Don't be so serious

137
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Come on

138
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Okay

139
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Happy birthday

140
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Okay, thank you

141
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Come on

142
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You can do it

143
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Shi Xiaosi and Shi Xiaoshi

144
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Come to the music studio together

145
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Shi Xiaosi, 14 years old

146
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Shi Xiaoshi, 40 years old

147
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's okay, sister

148
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You practice first

149
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
We'll sit down and be your audience

150
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Okay

151
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Then I'll start

152
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Welcome to watch our show today

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm so sorry

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm sorry

155
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm sorry

156
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm sorry

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm sorry

158
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm sorry

159
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm sorry

160
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm sorry

161
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm sorry

162
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm sorry

163
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The science world

164
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Sorry

165
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm not familiar with it

166
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You guys use it first

167
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You can go

168
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Good evening, audience

169
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
This is the broadcast room of tonight's news

170
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
No matter when

171
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We will always stick to the authenticity

172
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And objective

173
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The most valuable news information for you

174
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm the host, Zhou Lingyun

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Now I'm the latest news for you

176
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Someone is holding a crab and holding it

177
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Someone is holding a crab and pulling it

178
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Who is it?

179
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I won't say it

180
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'll kill you when I find a girlfriend

181
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Who can tell me how many months the heat train period is?

182
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's quite urgent now

183
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Help me ask the director

184
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
How to hold a crab with your hand

185
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
With your mouth

186
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The unique skill

187
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Who else wants to practice?

188
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What?

189
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You'll know in a while

190
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You'll know

191
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
This is the gift that Director Zhi prepared for me

192
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It looks good

193
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Thank you

194
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Sit down

195
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What?

196
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Sit down

197
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Sit down

198
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Good

199
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And then?

200
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
There's a surprise

201
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Wait a minute

202
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Happy birthday

203
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Happy birthday

204
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Happy birthday to you

205
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Happy birthday

206
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Here's yours

207
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Happy birthday to you

208
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Thank you

209
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Thank you

210
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Thank you

211
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Thank you

212
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Thank you

213
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Happy birthday to you

214
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You're really a nephew

215
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm not worried about helping my boyfriend

216
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You haven't finished your homework

217
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Come to the homework

218
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Okay

219
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Wait a minute

220
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You still have it?

221
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Of course

222
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
For Chen Yuzhou's little friend

223
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Take a look

224
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Chen Yuzhou is 19 years old

225
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
and he's 19 years old

226
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
This gift

227
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I want to give it to a 6-year-old

228
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Chen Yuzhou's little friend

229
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
If you're in the village

230
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
and you don't have a place to go

231
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
We can build

232
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
our own home

233
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Chen Yuzhou

234
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Happy birthday

235
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Happy birthday to you

236
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Happy birthday to you

237
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Happy birthday to you

238
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
How long have you been sitting here?

239
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Do you like it?

240
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
How long?

241
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Didn't you say I was going to ask you if you have a friend?

242
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Okay

243
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I just finished a few messages

244
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Don't cry

245
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's really simple

246
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
No need

247
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,220
good

248
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
The 달剧

249
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Are you sure

250
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Don't cry, Chen Jiaojiao.

251
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Let's cut the cake.

252
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Okay.

253
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
The birthday fairy cut it.

254
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Remember.

255
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Okay.

256
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Where should I cut it?

257
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
By the way,

258
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
what's your plan in Han family?

259
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I heard that

260
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
after the wedding,

261
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
there will be two weeks to go out to write.

262
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
The building of the White Tribe

263
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
may be two weeks later than you.

264
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Do you want to go back to the Star Camp?

265
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I may not go back.

266
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The magic competition is just a few days away.

267
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I may not be able to go back.

268
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Then I won't go back either.

269
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Don't come here.

270
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Your dad won't draw you.

271
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Then you'll be alone in the New Year.

272
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
What are you afraid of?

273
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Li Ke is with me.

274
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Li Ke is with you?

275
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You're getting closer.

276
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I found that you're really interesting.

277
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You're not a good cook.

278
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
What do you want to eat?

279
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You mean,

280
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
am I pretty or Li Ke is pretty?

281
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You're so crazy.

282
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Don't worry.

283
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
There's also Wang Yue from the computer.

284
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
We'll...

285
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Let's have a dance.

286
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Let's dance.

287
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Are you Li Ke or

288
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
is Wang Yue pretty?

289
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm going to the water.

290
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'll be with your dad.

291
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You save me first or your dad?

292
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
This question...

293
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
My dad...

294
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Hello, dad.

295
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
What are you doing?

296
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You're still awake?

297
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm writing homework.

298
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Do you have a lot of homework?

299
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You haven't called your dad for a long time.

300
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I heard that there's snow in Beijing tonight.

301
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's snowing.

302
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I think we'll be able to meet snowmen tomorrow.

303
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's your first time in Beijing.

304
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You should wear more clothes.

305
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Okay.

306
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
We have a warm-up.

307
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Don't worry.

308
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I can't find it.

309
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Did I buy you a winter pants?

310
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I got it.

311
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm so jealous of you.

312
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
The snow is over.

313
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Is there any new male guest?

314
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
No.

315
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
They're busy with homework.

316
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Don't you still like Chen Lu Zhou?

317
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Why would I?

318
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
We don't have a relationship.

319
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Okay.

320
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It's good that you don't have a relationship.

321
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It's not time yet.

322
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
After you finish your homework, go to bed.

323
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Okay.

324
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Bye-bye.

325
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You don't have a relationship with Yageng, do you?

326
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You're not lying at all.

327
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I didn't lie to you before.

328
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm afraid that you'll find a third child

329
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
if you don't lie to me.

330
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
How is that possible?

331
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
If you find a third child,

332
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I won't put you in the valley.

333
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'll bury you in the soil.

334
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You're so cruel.

335
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I heard from Zhao Tianqi that

336
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Chen Lu Zhou is holding a magic competition.

337
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
This competition is basically the second one.

338
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
They're competing in the first place.

339
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
That's amazing.

340
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It's okay.

341
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
He's 96 cm tall and has 100 cm in height.

342
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
We can have a higher height.

343
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
That's right.

344
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm not sure.

345
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm not sure.

346
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I'm not sure.

347
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm not sure.

348
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'm not sure.

349
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm not sure.

350
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm not sure.

351
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm not sure.

352
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Okay, students.

353
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Class is over.

354
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Teacher is here.

355
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
The last design meeting is done.

356
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
The three students

357
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
need to get back to work.

358
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm not that bad.

359
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
The three students are...

360
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
No, I'm not.

361
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Xu Yumu.

362
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Ma Yuting.

363
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Xu Zhi.

364
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
What's going on?

365
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Did you make a mistake?

366
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
He knows

367
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
our apprentice is here.

368
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
The three students

369
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
need to get back to work.

370
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Leave it to me

371
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
when you're in class next week.

372
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Okay, students.

373
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Class is over.

374
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Class is over.

375
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm going to tell you

376
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
what happened

377
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
in the previous class.

378
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Before we talk about

379
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
the architecture,

380
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I want to tell you

381
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
the structure of the architecture.

382
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Are you okay?

383
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
The structure of the architecture.

384
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Okay.

385
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
That's all for today.

386
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Class is over.

387
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Thank you.

388
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Thank you.

389
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Thank you.

390
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Class is over.

391
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Thank you.

392
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
What do you want to eat?

393
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Let's go.

394
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Looks like

395
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
we can't have dinner with us today.

396
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
What do I want to eat?

397
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I saw a new spicy soup

398
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
in the Yishi Hall.

399
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You go eat it yourself.

400
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm not hungry.

401
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm going to the library.

402
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Okay.

403
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
What's wrong with him?

404
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
He's not good at design.

405
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
He's been beaten up by Mr. Hu.

406
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And he knows

407
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
our homework.

408
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
We've done it.

409
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Go and have a look.

410
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Thank you.

411
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm sorry.

412
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm full.

413
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I have to go to work.

414
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
No.

415
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I can't.

416
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I'm tired.

417
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I lost my exam.

418
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
How did you send me?

419
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
No, I didn't.

420
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
You made me a fool.

421
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I can't do anything.

422
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I'm tired.

423
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm tired.

424
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I can't do anything.

425
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I can't do anything.

426
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I can't do anything.

427
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I can't do anything.

428
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I can't do anything.

429
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,160
I lost the exam.

430
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,040
How did you punish me?

431
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,800
I'll hold it first.

432
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,160
How about this?

433
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,520
I'll

434
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,240
accompany Mr. Zhi for a walk.

435
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:37,880
Okay?

436
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,720
Okay, let's go.

437
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:43,960
I'll be back.

438
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,520
The switch is red.

439
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,800
How do you film the movie?

440
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,560
Use it to save the time.

441
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,520
The fan is water-resistant.

442
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,680
The machine is fast.

443
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,920
The latest version.

444
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,080
Cool and comfortable.

445
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,280
Look, the water-resistant machine is so soft.

446
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,840
You don't need this juice?

447
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,520
The water is fast and the machine is fast.

448
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,200
I can't see it.

449
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,600
The fan is water-resistant.

450
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,200
The water-resistant machine is white.

451
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,640
Like a cloud in the clouds.

452
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,840
Great.

453
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,160
They are like air at theки吗.

454
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,280
Get down.

455
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,240
網民,

456
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,760
get down and lie down

457
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,800
and take some air.

458
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,480
How about it? Mr. Zhi?

459
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,640
You are the world's friend

460
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,640
Remember me

461
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,640
The future is moving

462
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,640
Because you are the wind

463
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,640
Loneliness is a song

464
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,640
In the dark, the chase is not stopping

465
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,640
Are we hurt?

466
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,640
I can't believe it

467
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,640
Tell me, you don't believe me?

468
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,640
The first time I felt like I was the one who helped you find out

469
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,640
We are always at the point of missing you

470
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,640
The best life for the whole family

471
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,640
Everyone is so hardworking

472
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,640
My talent is being picked up in that kind of environment

473
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,640
But Rui Jun is different

474
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,640
I was afraid that I would be too popular

475
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,640
So I was thinking about it the day I helped you find out

476
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,640
If I were in Rui Jun, I wouldn't be able to get to that level

477
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,640
Don't you love me so much?

478
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,640
I'm not loving you

479
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,640
It's true

480
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,640
I think you are not sure enough about your performance

481
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,640
So

482
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,640
You just need to put your heart out

483
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,640
Find the source of the problem

484
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,640
And then just let go of the hand and give it to the customer

485
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,640
I believe we can do everything we want

486
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,640
What's wrong?

487
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,640
Sorry, I'm in a hurry

488
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,640
Are you okay?

489
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,640
Xu Zhi, are you okay?

490
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,640
I'm fine

491
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
You are here, come here

492
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,640
I have something to talk to you

493
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,640
What?

494
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,640
Come with me

495
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,640
I'll talk about the competition

496
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,640
This

497
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,640
This is a warning, let her go, okay?

498
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,640
You, slow down, she can't catch up to you

499
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,640
Are you okay?

500
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,640
I'm fine

501
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,640
I've reminded you

502
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,640
What's wrong with you?

503
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,640
What are you doing?

504
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,640
Why are you calling me?

505
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,640
Li Ke, I'm here to save you

506
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,640
I'm in a hurry

507
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,640
The youth is a young man

508
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,640
It's because they have a new way of life

509
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,640
It's better to be honest and be honest

510
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,640
I'm not sure if I can do it

511
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,640
No matter how difficult it is

512
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,640
It's the young man who wants to be the master

513
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,640
And the young man who wants to be the master

514
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,640
They are all like this

515
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,640
I

516
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,640
You are the master

517
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,640
I'm the master

518
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,640
I'm the master

519
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,640
I'm the master

520
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,640
Professor, I've tried to draw a few lines

521
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,640
But I can't find the feeling

522
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,640
I want to ask you

523
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,640
Where is my design meeting?

524
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,640
Enter

525
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,840
Your drawings are accurate

526
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,640
Especially the space sense

527
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,480
You are my top(?)

528
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,640
So your requirement for me is better

529
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,640
The job this time

530
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,640
Is to build a small folk park for Chengchong Village

531
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,640
Your work

532
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,160
It can milk him.

533
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,360
But

534
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,020
your aunt is always отвеч for your progeny.

535
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,600
This is

536
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,360
a skill

537
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,400
to be fair to people.

538
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,000
It's a perfectTHORN SATUR Märl.

539
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,520
You can compare with me.

540
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,320
You need to learn

541
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,440
how to be r rational with your own body.

542
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,800
Thank you, Professor.

543
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,800
It's OK, let me...

544
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,380
She made us together.

545
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:03,900
Yet now ...

546
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,740
Xizhi.

547
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,240
Her Majesty has arrived back.

548
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,600
Who are you?

549
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,960
Don't waste your time.

550
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,000
I'm not afraid of you.

551
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,400
Then cry out.

552
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,600
Look at yourself.

553
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,400
You can't even cry.

554
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,800
What else can you do?

555
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,160
It's not as good as when you were young.

556
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,800
You cried so much back then.

557
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,400
You can't even eat sugar.

558
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:39,200
You'll cry if you keep the flowers.

559
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,200
Think about it.

560
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,200
How long have you not cried?

561
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,200
Xu Zhi.

562
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,400
If this is your decision,

563
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,600
you'll be bold to move forward.

564
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,200
Look forward. Don't turn back.

565
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,400
Mom.

566
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,800
Xu Guangzhu.

567
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,000
Nalin made another mistake.

568
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,800
Xu Guangzhu.

569
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,200
Mom.

570
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,200
Mom.

571
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,200
Mom.

572
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,200
Mom.

573
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,200
Mom.

574
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,200
Mom.

575
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,400
Xu Guangzhu.

576
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,200
Nalin.

577
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,400
I'm sorry.

578
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,600
I'm sorry.

579
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,000
I made another mistake.

580
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,800
I swear it's the last time.

581
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,400
Xu.

582
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,400
You're familiar with the game.

583
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,800
You're also a fitness instructor here.

584
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,600
I haven't been a fitness instructor for a long time.

585
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,800
You're not practicing?

586
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,000
How about we practice together next time?

587
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,000
Maybe I can teach you.

588
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,600
No need. No need.

589
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,600
I'm fine.

590
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,000
You're too shy.

591
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,800
How about we add a WeChat?

592
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
WeChat?

593
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,200
It's not appropriate.

594
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,400
Add a WeChat?

595
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,800
I'm sorry.

596
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,400
I'm late.

597
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Sorry. I don't know you.

598
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,000
She didn't eat.

599
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
It's okay.

600
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,600
She didn't eat even if she knew.

601
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,800
I won't disturb you.

602
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,600
Come on, Zhu.

603
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,800
What would you like to eat?

604
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,400
Order whatever you want.

605
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,600
Please have a seat.

606
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,600
Order whatever you want.

607
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,400
Really?

608
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,000
Wu Yan, some food.

609
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I want this.

610
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,600
Since we're participating in the game,

611
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,800
we're going to the South Hall to get the scholarship, right?

612
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,400
Yes.

613
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,000
Professor Liu has experience and resources.

614
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,600
He has brought several upcoming games.

615
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,600
For us,

616
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,000
that's the most reasonable way.

617
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:25,800
No.

618
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,000
But you know that there are only a few famous professors in the game.

619
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,600
If you're so famous like Professor Liu,

620
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,000
there must be a lot of people in the game.

621
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,600
Last time, I heard that there are more than 40 groups.

622
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,400
Do you think he can bring so many people here?

623
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,200
Mr. Bai is different from you.

624
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,400
He's a very good student to every student.

625
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,400
He's a very good student.

626
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,400
He's a good student.

627
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,600
But he doesn't even consider himself a good professor.

628
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,800
For us,

629
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,200
he's not a good student.

630
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,000
Keke, you don't understand.

631
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:49,800
Let me tell you.

632
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,200
What's wrong with Mr. Bai?

633
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,400
He's a very good student.

634
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,000
But his strength doesn't mean anything to others.

635
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,000
Lu Cao.

636
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,000
Lu Cao.

637
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,800
Lu Cao.

638
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,800
You can choose one.

639
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,000
What?

640
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,600
We know the teacher, Liu Ming and Bai Jiang.

641
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,200
You choose one.

642
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,400
Chen Lu Zhou, can you cry?

643
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,800
I have a nightmare.

644
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I can't get out of the room.

645
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,000
Where are you?

646
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,200
You're downstairs.

647
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,000
I'm going out.

648
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,000
Where are you going?

649
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,200
I have a nightmare.

650
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,200
I'm going to the toilet.

651
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,000
Do you want to take a bath?

652
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,600
Well...

653
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,800
It's okay.

654
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,200
He's not sick except his girlfriend.

655
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,600
It's good.

656
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,200
He's a good boyfriend.

657
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,800
I have a lot of friends with him.

658
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,400
You're such a liar, you single dog.

659
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,800
Who's single dog?

660
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,600
You're not single dog.

661
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,600
I have a girlfriend.

662
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,800
I'm with him in high school.

663
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,600
He's in your senior degree.

664
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,400
What are you doing?

665
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,600
Have you asked me?

666
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,600
I'm not single.

667
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,600
Okay, okay.

668
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,200
I'm a single dog, right?

669
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,600
Right.

670
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,000
I dreamed of my mom again.

671
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,400
She said I was not suitable for learning architecture.

672
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,600
She said I was not talented.

673
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,000
I wouldn't cry.

674
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,400
It's all the opposite.

675
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,600
Don't mind it.

676
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,600
But Professor Hu said the same.

677
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,200
She said my design is very rigorous.

678
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,200
I'm not good at it.

679
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,400
I'm not good at it.

680
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,600
I'm not good at it.

681
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,000
I'm not good at it.

682
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,000
I'm not good at it.

683
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,200
I'm not good at it.

684
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,200
I'm not good at it.

685
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,200
I'm not good at it.

686
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,400
I'm not good at it.

687
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,800
But I'm not good at it.

688
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,200
I probably know why she said that.

689
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I've known you for so long.

690
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,800
You've never been angry, right?

691
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,600
Even if you quarreled that time,

692
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,400
you left without a word.

693
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,400
What does it have to do with my homework?

694
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,600
I always feel that the inspiration of the designer

695
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,800
is all in the capture and the emotion of the boat.

696
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,000
So at this time,

697
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,000
the person who is more friendly

698
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,600
will have a advantage in this regard.

699
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,400
It's the so-called spirit.

700
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,400
But you seem to be used to

701
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,000
to suppress your emotions.

702
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,200
Maybe it has something to do with my mother.

703
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,400
My mother is a very outstanding architecture designer.

704
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,000
She is very strong, but she is also very good at it.

705
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,400
To me, the best thing is to be soft-hearted to others.

706
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,800
Later, she left

707
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,600
and left a bunch of bad guys.

708
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,400
She didn't let me clean up with my father.

709
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,000
You must have thought that

710
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,800
someone had a baby and asked my father for it.

711
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,800
She said that my mother left.

712
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,800
Those construction projects were all canceled.

713
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,800
No one took the money to give them.

714
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
No money to buy the baby.

715
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,600
It's all because my mother was poor before she was born.

716
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,000
She had a few accidents.

717
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,000
At that time, I thought

718
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,000
the most useless thing was the emotions.

719
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,800
Without emotions,

720
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,800
there is no sympathy.

721
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,800
There is no useless thing.

722
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,800
No wonder you said that when you were in the college exam.

723
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,800
But did you find out

724
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,400
that I didn't say anything on the spot?

725
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Really?

726
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,200
That's how you make people feel bad.

727
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,200
So don't be like this.

728
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,600
Let yourself be suppressed by your emotions.

729
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,800
Even let yourself be like this.

730
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,600
You will feel the power of the feeling

731
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,400
and the power of the emotions.

732
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,200
Really?

733
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,800
Anyway,

734
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,800
Zhizong,

735
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,600
if you want to cry,

736
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,000
you can find out if you are in a mood.

737
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,400
Don't be like this.

738
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,800
Help me then.

739
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,800
Sure.

740
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,600
You can do whatever you want.

741
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,000
Then I will do it.

742
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,200
What? You can't do that.

743
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,200
I will cry.

744
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,600
Don't you cry?

745
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,000
Don't say that I will hug you.

746
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,400
Is that okay?

747
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
What do you think?

748
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,800
I will hit you.

749
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,200
What are you doing?

750
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,600
Okay, it's okay.

751
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,000
Hug me.

752
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Come on.

753
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,200
Come on.

754
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,200
Let's go.

755
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,200
The charging is done.

756
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,400
I can take you home.

757
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,200
It's a pleasure to give Zhizong the charging.

758
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,200
Not that.

759
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,600
I am the one who is embarrassed.

760
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,800
Why are you so angry?

761
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,400
It's not your fault.

762
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,800
You are wearing too much.

763
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,800
It's not easy to be embarrassed.

764
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Otherwise, can you be seen by others?

765
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,400
It's troublesome for me.

766
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,600
Is it normal for you to wear a big one?

767
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,000
Well,

768
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,400
didn't you like to work with me before?

769
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,800
What's wrong with you today?

770
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,200
I saw you have a crush on me.

771
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,200
I will solve the problem for you.

772
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,400
Don't think too much.

773
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,200
Don't you think I have changed your good thing?

774
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,000
You are still not against me.

775
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,800
Why not?

776
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,600
Next time, I will tell the other person directly.

777
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,600
I will say...

778
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,600
Say what?

779
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,800
I already have a crush on you.

780
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,800
I came to your school gate just now.

781
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,800
I saw the promotion of the new exhibition.

782
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Will you participate?

783
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,000
What's the good thing about the new exhibition?

784
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,600
I have reached the next level.

785
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,200
I have to be a good painter.

786
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,200
I have a good idea.

787
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,200
I will come to your factory.

788
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,800
No need.

789
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,600
You run so fast. It's too troublesome.

790
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,600
It's okay. I can get married.

791
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:39,800
No.

792
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,400
I will send it here.

793
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,000
Go to sleep.

794
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:54,800
Good night.

795
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,200
By the way,

796
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,400
when are you free next week?

797
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,200
What's wrong?

798
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,000
You see me like this?

799
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,000
Didn't I make you cry?

800
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,400
Go to sleep early.

801
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,000
Go to sleep early.

802
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,000
Go to sleep early.

803
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,000
Go to sleep early.

804
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,000
Go to sleep early.

805
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,000
Go to sleep early.

806
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,000
Go to sleep early.

807
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,200
Go to sleep early.

808
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,400
Go to sleep early.

809
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,600
Go to sleep early.

810
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,000
Go to sleep early.

811
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,200
Go to sleep early.

812
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,200
Go to sleep early.

813
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,200
Go to sleep early.

814
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,200
Go to sleep early.

815
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,200
Go to sleep early.

816
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,400
Go to sleep early.

817
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,600
Go to sleep early.

818
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,600
Go to sleep early.

819
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,600
Go to sleep early.

820
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,600
Go to sleep early.

821
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,600
Go to sleep early.

822
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,600
Go to sleep early.

823
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,600
Go to sleep early.

824
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,600
Go to sleep early.

825
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,600
Go to sleep early.

826
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,600
Go to sleep early.

827
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,600
Go to sleep early.

828
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,600
Go to sleep early.

829
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,600
Someone called Hachi a mystery dog.

830
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,000
It's a place far away.

831
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,000
It's far away like a flower.

832
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,000
Really?

833
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,200
But no matter how, Hachi lost.

834
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,400
What's wrong with you, Hachi?

835
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,000
Why are you crying?

836
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,000
I just brought a bag of paper.

837
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,000
After you cry,

838
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,600
you'll be gone.

839
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,600
Don't cry.

840
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,000
You're fake.

841
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,600
You have it in your eyes.

842
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,600
Xu Zhi, you're really a good person.

843
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,400
We all know that the movie is fake.

844
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,400
But we all believe that

845
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,600
Hachi's love is real, right?

846
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,800
Yes, yes, yes.

847
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
It's my father's love.

848
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,600
Where's Zhang Xin?

849
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,600
Before,

850
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,000
Zhu Yangqi gave me this film many times.

851
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:52,000
He said he cried and said he didn't dare to watch it.

852
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,400
He was called a dog because of this film.

853
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,200
He was beaten by his father.

854
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,200
Because he was too old to be called a dog.

855
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,200
Chen Xiaoxiao.

856
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,600
I was wrong.

857
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,200
This is real world change.

858
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,400
You're crying.

859
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,800
When the staff sees you,

860
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,400
they'll think that how did you win?

861
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,400
I'm sorry.

862
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,400
I'm sorry.

863
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,400
I'm sorry.

864
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,400
I'm sorry.

865
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,400
I'm sorry.

866
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,400
I'm sorry.

867
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,400
I'm sorry.

868
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,400
I'm sorry.

869
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,400
I'm sorry.

870
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,400
I'm sorry.

871
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,400
I'm sorry.

872
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,400
I'm sorry.

873
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,400
I'm sorry.

874
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,400
I'm sorry.

875
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,400
I'm sorry.

876
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,400
I'm sorry.

877
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,800
Are we hurt?

878
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,480
I just want to be with you

879
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,800
Into you

880
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,480
Into you

881
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,760
The future is moving

882
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:14,400
Because you are the wind

883
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,480
I still need to use it several times

884
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:22,520
To be able to fight courage

885
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:26,080
After the first stop

886
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:30,840
I want to let go of the other side

887
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:35,880
I don't retreat

888
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,440
In your eyes

889
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:44,080
I see myself

890
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,480
Into you

891
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:50,480
Into you
