1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The wind blows my heart

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The world is burning hot

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The smile is echoing in the distance

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The pain is in the hatred and hatred

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The wind blows my heart

6
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
If I'm full of tears

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let the storm of the city stop and doubt

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The sea is floating in each other's arms

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Let's go to the future together

10
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The future

11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Episode 1

12
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Mr. Zhi.

13
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You talked in your dream yesterday.

14
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What did you say?

15
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You called a man's name.

16
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Impossible.

17
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Really?

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's your dad.

19
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
No.

20
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm angry.

21
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm not angry.

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm not angry.

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm angry.

24
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm angry.

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm angry.

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm not angry.

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Listen.

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Did we get angry just now?

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm scared to death.

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm afraid of the rain.

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Who am I?

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What do you mean?

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Who?

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Who else can I have?

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I have only one love.

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm hungry.

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm hungry.

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm hungry.

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You're really dark.

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You're not only talking about the silent words.

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You're also a devil.

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Who is more than twenty years old?

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You're also a devil.

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Who is a devil?

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Don't be shy when I love you.

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Be shy and love me.

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm getting up.

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'll go out for a while.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Where are you going?

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm going to the bookstore.

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Do I have to accompany you?

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
No need.

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I can go by myself.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Really?

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm going to the bookstore.

57
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Are you really going to marry me?

58
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
OK.

59
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Follow me.

60
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
This bookstore is your house.

61
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Why are you reading Professor Bai's book all of a sudden?

62
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Isn't this Professor Chen's book?

63
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's not finished yet?

64
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Your future father-in-law

65
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
called me.

66
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
My future father-in-law called me.

72
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
He said he would treat you dinner tonight.

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Tonight?

74
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I bought it.

75
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So sudden?

76
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You two.

77
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Dad.

78
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Hello.

79
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You look really good.

80
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Look at these two.

81
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You're so compatible.

82
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Uncle Xu.

83
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Aunt.

84
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You're here.

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Give it to me.

86
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Aunt.

87
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You haven't paid for the wedding.

88
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's a bit late to go to the university.

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You have to go there in two days.

90
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Look.

91
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Do I look like a son?

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Not like that.

93
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I look like a daughter.

94
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You two are almost done.

95
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Why are you talking to Dad?

96
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Really.

97
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Why are you talking to your Dad?

98
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Compared to that,

99
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
you really are a new son.

100
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You should love me more than your old daughter.

101
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Look at you.

102
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You should go home and cook.

103
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yes.

104
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's not too late.

105
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Let's go.

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What?

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Nothing.

108
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I feel like I love you more.

109
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Do you remember the Great Aunt's family?

110
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yes.

111
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Chen Jiajiao.

112
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I found out that I miss you a lot when I was in Beijing.

113
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But I didn't miss you that much when I was in Qingyuan.

114
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You should play the game.

115
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Come on.

116
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Who is it?

117
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Which one is it?

118
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You're still shouting.

119
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Are you annoyed?

120
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'll say it like that later.

121
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You...

122
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Don't eat all the food.

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Dad.

124
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Uncle Xu.

125
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
He kicked me.

126
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I think he might have a violent image in the future.

127
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You should take care of him.

128
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What else do you want to say?

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I can't take care of these.

130
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What?

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Dad, take care of him.

132
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I can't take care of him.

133
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Dad, you have to take care of him.

134
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You...

135
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What do you plan to do?

136
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You have to take care of him.

137
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You...

138
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What do you plan to do?

139
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You have to take care of him.

140
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yes.

141
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Girls should take care of this.

142
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Boys should be more active.

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Do you want to see it?

144
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Uncle Xu said he and my aunt went back to the six-packed bowl.

145
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
They saw a new fruit shop.

146
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
They asked me what they wanted to eat.

147
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Why didn't he ask me?

148
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Didn't Uncle Xu say it?

149
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I love him more than you.

150
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So fast.

151
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Uncle Xu.

152
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You...

153
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Ying Ying.

154
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm sorry.

155
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm sorry.

156
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Is Ying Ying not with you?

157
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Why are you here?

158
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
She's not with you.

159
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
She's looking for Ying Ying.

160
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You two are fighting again?

161
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What's the problem this time?

162
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's too hard.

163
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Let me tell you.

164
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
We started to do it together in the second year.

165
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
No matter what I say or do,

166
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
she thinks it's wrong.

167
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But I'm doing it for her.

168
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
She doesn't understand.

169
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
She even blacked me out.

170
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
She even beat me up.

171
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I really can't live on.

172
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I really want to answer for you.

173
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But we really don't have any experience in this.

174
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
We don't have much time.

175
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Okay.

176
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Right.

177
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
When I thought of when President Chi

178
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
made you go to the movies,

179
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I thought you were really miserable.

180
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I didn't expect that I'm more miserable than you.

181
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
When did I become miserable?

182
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
President Chi treats me very well.

183
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Did anyone make a living for you?

184
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Did anyone make a living for you?

185
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
President Chi gave me two years of living.

186
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I forgot.

187
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You've been living for four years.

188
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Chen Luzhou, you're a bad guy.

189
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You're talking about food, right?

190
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Go over there.

191
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
What did you say?

192
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You...

193
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Is there a delivery?

194
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Can you come?

195
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yes.

196
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Are you going?

197
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yes.

198
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Then...

199
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
This one, three rounds.

200
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
This one, three rounds.

201
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Brother Yang.

202
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You're here.

203
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Is this good?

204
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You're here again.

205
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Which girl is waiting for me in the store?

206
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Why do you always do this?

207
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm going to ask her.

208
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You.

209
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Go on.

210
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Three rounds for this one.

211
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Three rounds?

212
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yes.

213
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Two rounds?

214
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yes.

215
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
President Chi.

216
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
What?

217
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Go.

218
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
No one asked you to come.

219
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Why are you so enthusiastic?

220
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I didn't say anything.

221
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Look at him.

222
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I asked him to come.

223
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
We're not busy with work.

224
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
We haven't had a meal for a long time.

225
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I ordered almost all the dishes.

226
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
This morning, you see what you want to eat.

227
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You...

228
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
No need to order the dishes.

229
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Buy some food.

230
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Okay, let's go.

231
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Let's go.

232
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I...

233
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Buy some medicine.

234
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
We're going to eat the dishes.

235
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Let's go.

236
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Okay.

237
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Wait a minute.

238
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What's going on?

239
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Are you going to cook?

240
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Is it going to be dark?

241
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Why are you mentioning him?

242
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's a clean letter.

243
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You're almost graduated from college.

244
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
What's your plan?

245
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I don't have any plans.

246
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I just want to work.

247
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I can't break up with him.

248
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Okay.

249
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Don't be so impulsive.

250
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You're going back to the restaurant.

251
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I don't care.

252
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You still have to kneel down and be a dog.

253
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Hey.

254
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You're quite experienced.

255
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Who said you never complained?

256
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I really didn't.

257
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
As long as it's the end,

258
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
we have to be the best.

259
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Right?

260
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Why do you have to sit down yourself?

261
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And then hit yourself?

262
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You just have to kneel down.

263
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You're too much.

264
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You can't be a good cook.

265
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You're a pain in the neck.

266
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Thank you.

267
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You're welcome.

268
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I received several buildings and

269
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
a construction company's offer.

270
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm choosing.

271
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
He's been working as a project

272
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
with Professor Ren.

273
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
He's going to graduate soon.

274
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I guess he's going to graduate from college.

275
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Then you're going to leave him to be a teacher?

276
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Do you think he's going to?

277
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
He's been staying at the school all the time.

278
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
He's not going to try other jobs.

279
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
He has a teacher named Bai Jiao.

280
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
He's not qualified to be a professor.

281
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But he's a very good student.

282
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
He's a very good student.

283
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I guess he wants to be a street bump

284
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
of Mr. Bai.

285
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
He wants to be a contestant with the teacher.

286
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Then you're not worried?

287
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What are you worried about?

288
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Those beautiful female students

289
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
are not a burden to your Professor Chen.

290
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I don't think I need to worry about that.

291
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
He's going to get married soon.

292
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
He should be happy.

293
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Congratulations!

294
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You're going to be a contestant with Zhu Yangqi.

295
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Are you going to be a contestant?

296
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
No wonder you're so ungrateful.

297
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Did you guys get along well?

298
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Then Chen Longzhe went to the pool

299
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
and got a gift from him.

300
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
He got married with me.

301
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
How could that be possible?

302
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You're still going to be a contestant.

303
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You're still not going to admit it?

304
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You're not good at acting.

305
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I...

306
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Isn't he coming?

307
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Hey,

308
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm giving you a lift.

309
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Yingying, stop being angry at me.

310
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's all my fault.

311
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Let's not fight, okay?

312
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Stop messing around.

313
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I have a phone call.

314
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Hello.

315
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm just around here.

316
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Come over here.

317
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I have a interview at the table.

318
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The host can't go.

319
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'll go and wait a while.

320
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You guys go ahead.

321
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'll go with him.

322
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,960
I'll go with him.

323
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,600
He's leaving.

324
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,280
What do you want to say?

325
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,040
What?

326
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,280
Why did you send me flowers?

327
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,200
I bought a tree for Mr. Cai.

328
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,120
I was afraid that

329
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,240
you'd be unhappy

330
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,240
if he didn't have you.

331
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,640
What do you mean?

332
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,400
Chen Jiaojiao,

333
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,120
you're such a romantic guy.

334
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,520
What?

335
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,680
You think I'm going to ask for a divorce?

336
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,720
Shut up.

337
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,040
Are you going to close the door?

338
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,600
I haven't received the news yet.

339
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,400
According to the public,

340
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,560
you refused to deal with the payment of the membership card.

341
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,840
Is the situation right?

342
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,680
I don't know.

343
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,600
Well, you have to ask my boss.

344
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,920
But your boss has been turning off.

345
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,520
How should I explain this?

346
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,400
I...

347
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,200
What are you doing?

348
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,920
What are you doing?

349
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,720
Stop filming, okay?

350
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,200
Stop filming.

351
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,200
Don't touch me.

352
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,520
What are you doing?

353
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,880
What's going on?

354
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,320
Stop filming.

355
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,080
How could he lay a finger on one of his servants?

356
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,040
Stop filming.

357
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,360
What should I do?

358
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,080
Don't feel bad.

359
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,520
What are you doing?

360
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,880
Are you crazy?

361
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,600
Is this what problems are?

362
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,120
Are you crazy?

363
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,560
Yes.

364
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,960
What's wrong with you?

365
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,360
It's just as serious.

366
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,080
Come here.

367
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:29,240
It'sจang Jun of Profile Guards.

368
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,120
What did he do?

369
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,120
He made a big scene.

370
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,760
Yeah.

371
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,920
He was transferred to Non constitute National Monument.

372
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,920
I'm not good.

373
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,720
But I also want you to believe me.

374
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,120
I'm a mature man.

375
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,720
I can protect myself.

376
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,320
But you have to promise me.

377
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,520
You can't force it.

378
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,120
If you meet someone like me again,

379
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,320
you can't just leave the police station.

380
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,520
If you encounter any trouble, you can find the police.

381
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,520
I promise you.

382
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,120
There's one more thing you must promise me.

383
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,120
What is it?

384
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,320
I'll take you out of the black rice bag.

385
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,520
You're so good.

386
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,320
Think about it.

387
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,920
Okay, then think about it.

388
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,720
I'll take you to a place.

389
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,320
Hello, Mr. Bai.

390
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,120
Do you still remember the words?

391
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,520
Just call them my friends.

392
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,920
I'll take you to a place.

393
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,920
You can't just leave the police station.

394
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,520
This one.

395
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
What are you doing here?

396
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,920
Why are you playing with me?

397
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,720
Let's play together.

398
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,320
Let's play.

399
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,920
Let's play.

400
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,520
This one.

401
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:45,720
Let's play.

402
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,320
Let's play.

403
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,320
This one.

404
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:49,920
Let's play.

405
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,520
Qi'an.

406
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,520
This is Qi'an.

407
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,120
Qi'an.

408
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,120
Let's play.

409
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,520
Okay, let's play.

410
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,120
You'll be scared.

411
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:15,920
Okay.

412
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,520
Qi'an...

413
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,920
It's because of Shaoyi.

414
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:25,720
Yi Ran.

415
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,720
Don't you remember me?

416
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,320
Right.

417
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,240
Because of that,

418
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,880
I've dreamt of retiring early

419
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,000
until several years ago.

420
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,560
I'll take the kids

421
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,520
to the guild.

422
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,400
Wait a minute.

423
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:44,960
Sir.

424
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:46,920
Come on.

425
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,360
Sir.

426
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,400
Come on up.

427
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,600
KTV.

428
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,360
Mr. Han.

429
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,400
Mr. Han.

430
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,520
Mr. Han.

431
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,360
KTV.

432
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,280
Hurry up.

433
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,240
Can we drinkug countries and shape CDs?

434
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,440
Great.

435
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,200
Go on.

436
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,320
What's wrong with the duck army?

437
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,080
What's wrong with the duck army?

438
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,240
The duck army can't be overlapped.

439
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,080
What about the duck army?

440
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,440
Come on.

441
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,040
Come on.

442
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,680
Come on.

443
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,160
Come on.

444
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,760
Three, two, one.

445
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,360
Maybe this matter is not

446
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,960
meaningful to them.

447
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,960
But those kids made me think

448
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,360
that even if they are 50 years old,

449
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,840
they won't care

450
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,960
if others are watching the debate.

451
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,800
After the game,

452
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,960
out of the top within portfolio was just a shaken sword.

453
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,680
He's a very excellent man.

454
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,800
Whatever於 any way he mention,

455
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,040
I always expect to Ohhh

456
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,280
convince him I'm his brother.

457
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,280
He was a man who also estás me

458
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,200
in those reloc rigs in the dispute.

459
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,600
He said to Mr. Bai,

460
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,680
Mr. Bai,

461
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,600
you look handsome

462
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
from any angle.

463
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,600
You're very kind.

464
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,600
After all, I've been in the army for more than 50 years.

465
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,600
No one has ever praised me for being handsome.

466
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Okay.

467
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,600
Let's make a deal.

468
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,600
I'm done.

469
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,700
Nonsense.

470
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,600
Nonsense.

471
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,600
Nonsense.

472
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:36,700
Come in.

473
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:37,900
Come in.

474
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
Feels like aensening.

475
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,060
Mo.

476
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,600
Please sit down.

477
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,040
I'm going to have a meal

478
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,560
sneeze

479
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,420
try this

480
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,760
рач

481
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,220
What?

482
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:17,680
Two 것을

483
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,540
Thank you

484
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm fifty percent taller than Sx

485
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,200
What kind of professional?

486
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,400
My dad wants me to learn medicine.

487
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,000
My dad wants me to do the online media.

488
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,800
I think the online media is pretty good.

489
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,000
I like it.

490
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,600
What about you?

491
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,800
I...

492
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,400
I'm going to learn acting.

493
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,800
Not bad.

494
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,800
Time flies.

495
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,200
So many shops are not here anymore.

496
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,000
I heard that the residential building is about to be demolished.

497
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,800
Let's go and have a look.

498
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,000
Let's go.

499
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Is it closed?

500
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Let me see.

501
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Welcome.

502
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Welcome.

503
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
What's going on?

504
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Let's go.

505
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You can't get past.

506
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Go.

507
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Hurry.

508
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Be careful.

509
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It's hot.

510
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's a bit hot.

511
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It's like a air conditioner.

512
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Are you sure?

513
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Are you nervous?

514
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
My heart rate is almost 180.

515
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Do you want to give me a 120-degree angle?

516
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I still have a photo.

517
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Do you want to go and pack it up?

518
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Don't I look good now?

519
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You look good.

520
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
As long as I have a mirror for you,

521
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
you can be as beautiful as you want.

522
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You look so hot.

523
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You're so hot.

524
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Then you should kneel down.

525
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Give me your phone.

526
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
What?

527
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Brother.

528
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
What?

529
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,500
Brother...

530
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
No.

531
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Why are you...

532
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Why are you here?

533
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
There doesn't need to be a break at the scene now.

534
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I have to obsolescence after course.

535
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,920
He's the one we have been talking about.

536
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,040
But he suddenly

537
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,960
violently appears

538
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,200
to catch up with us.

539
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:21,760
We'd get him

540
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,840
ready urgently.

541
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,240
Didn't expect that

542
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,760
you'd risk it all.

543
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,440
Mom.

544
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,760
Mom.

545
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,220
North and west,

546
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,780
abyrinth is onlyment.

547
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,560
Someday,

548
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,120
will you start

549
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,000
defying our imperial spirit?

550
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,080
What?

551
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,680
What?

552
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,480
I'm not seeing you.

553
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,200
You don't see me?

554
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,160
I don't see you.

555
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,120
I'm not seeing you.

556
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,320
Xu Zhi.

557
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,160
Will you marry me?

558
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,480
Okay.

559
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,440
Deal.

560
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,280
Great.

561
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,080
I want to be alone.

562
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,080
The weak.

563
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,080
The weak.

564
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,080
The little dog is a little tail.

565
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,080
Because the little dog is a tail.

566
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,080
Don't be afraid of the lost things.

567
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,080
You will realize the dream of the past.

568
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,080
Open your eyes and think of the wind.

569
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,080
Congratulations.

570
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,080
I'm so happy.

571
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,080
Look at the window, the city is full of laughter.

572
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:51,080
I will tell you who is the future.

573
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,080
I believe you will find the future.

574
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,080
Come on, take a picture, okay?

575
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,080
Come on.

576
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,080
Come on.

577
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,080
Take a picture.

578
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,080
The little child is down.

579
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,080
Take a good position.

580
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,080
Come on.

581
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,080
Hurry up.

582
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,080
Chen Lu Zhou, go and see me.

583
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,080
I'm so happy.

584
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,080
I'm so happy.

585
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,080
The little child can't see.

586
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,080
What are you doing?

587
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,080
I'm so happy.

588
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,080
Hurry up.

589
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,080
Come on.

590
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,080
I'm still taking pictures.

591
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,080
The teacher is taking pictures.

592
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,080
Don't care.

593
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,080
Come on.

594
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,080
One, two, three.

595
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,080
Take a picture.

596
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,080
You are afraid of the lost things.

597
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,080
You will realize the dream of the past.

598
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,080
Open your eyes and smile.

599
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:45,080
I'm with you.

600
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:50,080
Listen to the song of the past.

601
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,080
The story never stops.

602
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,080
I will always be with you.

603
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:05,080
I believe you will find the future.

604
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,080
Why did you bring me here?

605
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,080
I have a letter.

606
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,080
It's been a long time since I came here.

607
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,080
You want to take a bus stop, right?

608
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,080
I thought you would propose to me

609
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,080
when you quarreled with Zhu Yangqi.

610
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,080
But it turned out to be a misunderstanding.

611
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,080
Aunt Wei told me

612
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,080
that you should be the man to propose to me.

613
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,080
But I don't think so.

614
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,080
I think

615
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,080
who is so important to you.

616
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,080
Right?

617
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,080
So you are going to propose to me first.

618
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,080
I think

619
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,080
if you can't, I will do it.

620
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,080
But you still have to do it.

621
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,080
You are the chief.

622
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,080
Then

623
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,080
the house is ready.

624
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,080
Can you marry me?

625
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,080
Can you marry me?

626
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,080
Please.

627
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,080
It seems that the man behind the post

628
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,080
is happy.

629
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,080
I think you should marry him.

630
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,080
Yes.

631
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,080
What should I do, Xu Zhen?

632
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,080
It's been almost five years.

633
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,080
I still love you.

634
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,080
You have been together for so long.

635
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,080
If I buy a ex-girlfriend and make a living,

636
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,080
I am now a married woman.

637
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,080
You are really cheap when you talk.

638
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,080
You like it when you are so cheap?

639
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,080
I don't like it.

640
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,080
I don't like it at all.

641
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,080
I like it.

642
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,080
Do you know

643
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,080
I have a feeling recently.

644
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,080
What feeling?

645
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,080
It feels very happy.

646
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,080
It feels a little scary.

647
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,080
Are you the one who is happy?

648
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,080
If we didn't meet,

649
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,080
forget it.

650
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,080
I don't think so much.

651
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,080
I have thought it through.

652
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,080
There are always bright times in life

653
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,080
and dark times in life.

654
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,080
We can move forward when it's bright.

655
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,080
We can move forward when it's dark.

656
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,080
Then we can hold each other's hands tightly.

657
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,080
I love you.

658
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,080
Chen Qiaoqiao.

659
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,080
I love you too.

660
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,080
Xu Zhen.

661
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,080
I love you.

662
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,080
I love you too.

663
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,080
I love you.

664
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,080
I love you too.

665
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,080
I love you.

666
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:17,080
Ah...

667
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:21,080
A bowl of light and a bowl of warm rain.

668
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,080
Hello.

669
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,080
What are you doing?

670
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,080
I'm cooking.

671
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,080
I'll be back in a few days.

672
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,080
The driver of the night is not going back for dinner.

673
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:47,080
But I promise to see you off at the airport tomorrow.

674
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,080
Don't worry about me.

675
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,080
You're used to it?

676
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,080
Do you want to move forward when you hold my hand?

677
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,080
Chen Qiaoqiao.

678
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,080
You're so sour.

679
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,080
I'll be back early.

680
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,080
I've made a night snack.

681
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,080
I'll hang up.

682
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,080
I'll be back soon.

683
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,080
I'll be back soon.

684
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,080
Hello.

685
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,080
Are you still here?

686
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,080
Chen Luzhou.

687
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,080
You treat me as a person, all right?

688
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,080
You're still here to find me when you don't go home to eat.

689
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,080
You're not here to find me.

690
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,080
Don't be ridiculous.

691
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,080
See you at the airport.

692
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,080
Hurry up.

693
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,080
I'm here.

694
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,080
Hello.

695
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,080
Hello.

696
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,080
Hello.

697
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,080
Hello.

698
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,080
Tell me.

699
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,080
The little girl who just called me.

700
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,080
She's a traitor.

701
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,080
We're just friends.

702
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,080
We know you're going to Rui Cheng's school.

703
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,080
You can't go to the school with your hands.

704
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,080
I don't know.

705
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,080
I thought she was afraid to break up with you.

706
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,080
You're almost there.

707
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,080
What's wrong with your five-year anniversary in Rui Cheng?

708
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,080
Aren't you almost there?

709
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,080
Mr. Zhi.

710
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,080
I didn't say I'd give you money.

711
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,080
Or I'll give you a loan back.

712
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,080
Chen Luzhou.

713
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,080
It's been five years.

714
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,080
You and Xu Zhi's passion.

715
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,080
I finally got it.

716
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,080
Are you drinking or not?

717
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,080
I'm leaving.

718
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,080
Luzhou.

719
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,080
Just say it.

720
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,080
My passion for Xu Zhi is over.

721
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,080
I'll transfer you 1,000 yuan right now.

722
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,080
Brotherhood is a big deal.

723
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,080
What does my wife count?

724
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,080
I'll drink with you till dawn.

725
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,080
No need.

726
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,080
What does my brother count?

727
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,080
My wife will introduce new friends to me.

728
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,080
Okay.

729
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,080
I'll go to the airport.

730
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,080
Okay. I'll send you off.

731
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,080
I'll see you in the airport.

732
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,080
Mr. Zhi.

733
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,080
I'm so tired of you.

734
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,080
Don't think about it.

735
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,080
Xu Zhi.

736
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,080
Don't force yourself if you don't want to.

737
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,080
Are you talking to me?

738
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,080
If you don't want to, just say it.

739
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,080
I can die early.

740
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,080
I'm so tired.

741
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,080
Have a good meal there.

742
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,080
Study hard.

743
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,080
Don't embarrass your family.

744
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,080
I'll cook a big meal for you when you come back.

745
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,080
Won't your husband mind if you go to your house?

746
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,080
Just tell him.

747
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,080
It's okay. Go back to work.

748
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,080
I'll go to the airport.

749
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,080
I'm sorry.

750
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,080
The leader wants a document.

751
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,080
I'm in a hurry.

752
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,080
Go.

753
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,080
It's a safe trip.

754
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,080
Okay.

755
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,080
I'll go when I get the papers.

756
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,080
Go.

757
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,080
Be careful.

758
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,080
I'll go to the airport.

759
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,080
Go.

760
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,080
Cheers.

761
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,080
Cheers.

762
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,080
It's not easy to be in Beijing.

763
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,080
You should come to see me often.

764
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,080
Of course.

765
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,080
I can go to see you.

766
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,080
Okay.

767
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,080
You're always here to see us.

768
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,080
What are you doing tomorrow?

769
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,080
Chen Luzhou.

770
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,080
What are you doing, Chen Luzhou?

771
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,080
The director is here.

772
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,080
They've been to Beijing for a show.

773
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,080
They're having a good time.

774
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,080
Go on.

775
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,080
Come on.

776
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,080
What's wrong?

777
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,080
Nothing.

778
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,080
Okay.

779
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,080
I miss you too.

780
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,080
What are you doing tomorrow?

781
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,080
What did you say?

782
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,080
The film director of the film department

783
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,080
seems to be holding a film exhibition in the West Coast.

784
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,080
If you're not in class tomorrow,

785
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,080
go and have a look.

786
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,080
This is the right place, Chen Luzhou.

787
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,080
You bought that for me.

788
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,080
You bought that thing?

789
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,080
Let him send it to me.

790
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,080
Send it to Cai Yingying.

791
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,080
Okay.

792
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,080
Go.

793
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,080
I'll send it to myHereafter.

794
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,080
You can have whateverلك your boyfriend likes.

795
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,780
He even cooked for youob.

796
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,080
Five?

797
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,080
Okay, I think

798
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,560
so you guys could come out to be pretty

799
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,680
a little rubber

800
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:47,900
I'll go

801
00:39:54,080 --> 00:40:01,080
But the sea is waiting for each other

802
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:14,440
When moon breaks,

803
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,640
the magazine appears

804
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,640
I'm the only one who's worried

805
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:31,640
Crush, the world is for you

806
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,640
Baby falling my heart

807
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,640
If tears fall

808
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:45,640
Let the storm of the city stay in memory

809
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:51,640
Let the sea fly in each other's body

810
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,640
Crush

811
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,640
Why are you here suddenly?

812
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,640
I'm happy this year

813
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,640
I was so busy with my work

814
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,640
I came to Rui Cheng to accompany me

815
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,640
Of course

816
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,640
I can't let Chen Jiaojiao be alone

817
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,640
Then you're so busy

818
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,640
Why do you still look for Zhang Yu and them to drink?

819
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,640
Zhang Yu and Li Ke

820
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,640
kept their work so well

821
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,640
Because your girlfriend is so good at supervising

822
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,640
I have to thank you

823
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,640
You're still a good director

824
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,640
Tell me

825
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,640
What do you want to take me to eat later?

826
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,640
I don't eat first

827
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,640
I'll take you to a place

828
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,640
What place

829
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,640
You'll know when you go

830
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,640
I'm so hungry

831
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,640
You're not going to sell me, are you?

832
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,640
You're so smart

833
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,640
I can sell you

834
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,640
You sold me

835
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,640
It's almost the same

836
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,640
I'll sell you later

837
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,640
You can't sell me here

838
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,640
I can't make a good price here

839
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,640
Do you want to take a photo here?

840
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,640
Okay

841
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,640
Then it's okay

842
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,640
Come here

843
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,640
Don't look here

844
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,640
Looks good

845
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,440
Give me your phone

846
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,640
Okay

847
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,640
I'll take it

848
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,640
How did you find it?

849
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,640
I haven't searched it for a long time

850
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,640
What can't you do after you found it?

851
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,640
Didn't you say that

852
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,640
you want to learn architecture

853
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,640
to take the road of your mother?

854
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,640
I know you want to see this

855
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,640
when I see this portrait

856
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,640
Go and have a look

857
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,640
Let's go

858
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,640
This is the work

859
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,640
that my mother worked on before

860
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,640
Come with me

861
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,640
Happy 50th year

862
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,640
July 20th, 7.02

863
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:56,640
It feels like

864
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,640
he will like the architecture style

865
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,640
July 21st, 6.15

866
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,640
Please

867
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,640
July 24th, 7.31

868
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,640
Please

869
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:14,640
What time is it?

870
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,640
It's 7.02

871
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,640
It's 7.02

872
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:18,640
It's 7.02

873
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,640
It's 7.02

874
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,640
It's 7.02

875
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,640
It's 7.02

876
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,640
It's 7.02

877
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,640
July 27th, 6.23

878
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,640
He should have received

879
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,640
the notice of the road

880
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,640
July 30th, 6.32

881
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,640
He got it

882
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,640
August 9th, 7.37

883
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,640
Time flies

884
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,640
August 10th, 8.01

885
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:56,640
I miss him

886
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,640
Room service

887
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:06,640
Miss Xu

888
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,640
Your dinner is here

889
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,640
I miss you

890
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,640
I have passed

891
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,640
How many scenery

892
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:36,640
Waiting for this encounter

893
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,640
Heartbeats, heartbeats

894
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,640
Is there anything you want to say?

895
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:42,640
Chen Zhe

896
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:44,640
What do you think

897
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:45,640
is love?

898
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,640
It's hard to write

899
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,640
Can this be Chen Dashi?

900
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,640
Love

901
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,640
Until you come to the mountain with me

902
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,640
I see you

903
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,640
But in the rain

904
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:20,640
You dare to look back

905
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,640
You dare to cut off the gold

906
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,640
You dare to be in the wind and rain

907
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,640
It's a long way to go

908
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,640
Love is a white cloud dog

909
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,640
I have a romantic and a romantic

910
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:43,640
Love is a story of the past

911
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,640
We walk together

912
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:46,640
To the future

913
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,640
To the future

914
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,640
Are you okay?

915
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,640
It's a big river

916
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:10,640
Coming

917
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:11,640
Come

918
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,640
The complicated world

919
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,640
This is a world of happiness

920
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,640
A white night

921
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,640
We can run together

922
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,640
Time

923
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,640
Let the good things

924
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,640
Wait, the fire is coming

925
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,640
It's our time

926
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,640
Come

927
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:34,640
Come

928
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:35,640
Come

929
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,640
Come

930
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,640
Come

931
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,640
Come

932
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,640
Come

933
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:40,640
Come

934
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,640
The wind blows through your summer

935
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:44,640
Ready

936
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,640
Open your head

937
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,640
Three

938
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,640
I just want to remember this moment

939
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,640
With you, let the world begin

940
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,640
The day

941
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,640
You become a little color

942
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,640
How can we stick to the moon

943
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,640
We can run together

944
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,640
Time

945
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,640
Let the good things

946
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,640
And the moon

947
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,640
Are all like our season

948
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:16,640
No matter what the future will be like

949
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,640
We will still have many

950
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,640
Shining lights and lights

951
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:25,640
Let's touch this world together

952
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:29,640
All the sadness and the wish

953
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:34,640
Are all like our season
