1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
this compassion imitated

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
the fragments of the truth

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
turn into tears

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
crush

5
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:51,000
当黑夜遇见閲迷

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
crush

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
our meeting in the scribble

8
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,560
I'm waiting for each other

9
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,120
to set out

10
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,760
to crush

11
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,800
I'm chasing my ex-girlfriend

12
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,560
You don't know

13
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,000
how lively the school is

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,120
the first month of college

15
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,400
There's a student

16
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,600
at 8 o'clock

17
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,880
at the dormitory

18
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,920
to send him breakfast

19
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,440
What did you say to him?

20
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,280
What did he say?

21
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,000
He said

22
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,120
Senior,

23
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,240
I've already

24
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,240
had your breakfast

25
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,760
and then he asked her

26
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,920
how many breakfasts do you eat?

27
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,120
She said four

28
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,680
and then she told the dormitory

29
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,080
at the turn of the day

30
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,160
saying that she's not a good girl

31
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,360
She said she's a sixth grader

32
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,280
and she doesn't feel

33
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,560
so complete

34
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,400
Who's the fourth grader at college?

35
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,960
She's indeed a fourth grader

36
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,960
How do you know?

37
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,400
You think black horse is so good?

38
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,160
We Jun has been

39
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,160
tired so long

40
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,480
He's so fluent

41
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,040
When our grades

42
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:53,180
notamment

43
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,240
Come on.

44
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,120
Are there many people chasing her?

45
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,960
Anyway,

46
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,320
there are many.

47
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,880
I've seen her

48
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,800
a few times.

49
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,360
She was blocked by others

50
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,200
and asked for a WeChat.

51
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,400
But now there are many people.

52
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,600
Everyone knows

53
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,440
she can't chase her.

54
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,320
After all, she hasn't even chased Jiang Yu.

55
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,800
Other people

56
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,160
don't even bother to chase her.

57
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,040
Jiang Yu?

58
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,720
She just met that one?

59
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,200
Fine.

60
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,560
She's pretty cool.

61
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,040
Fine.

62
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,360
You've got it.

63
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,240
I'm not.

64
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,080
If she wants to date,

65
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,280
she'll meet a real girl.

66
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,920
I don't have any idea.

67
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,680
Fine.

68
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,520
I've asked you about it.

69
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,880
Jiang Yu

70
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,520
is a good girl.

71
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,040
Xu Zhi

72
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,520
is also in her department now.

73
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,240
What department?

74
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,240
I heard

75
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,600
there's a senior

76
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,080
who's in a dorm with Xu Zhi.

77
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,800
Xu Zhi is in the promotion department.

78
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,600
She's also in the department.

79
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,840
She's always in the water with you.

80
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,360
Bro,

81
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,800
can you get me some water?

82
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,480
Let me know when she's done.

83
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:29,480
I'll start.

84
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,600
Can I have some water, Bro?

85
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:51,640
I'll start with Zhen

86
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,240
I think the business of next week's Lanxan competition

87
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,040
is almost done.

88
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,040
Let's discuss these two companies.

89
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,240
Let's see which one is more suitable.

90
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,040
Okay?

91
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
Good job.

92
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
Okay.

93
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,040
Senior, look.

94
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,040
We have so many partners now.

95
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,240
How do we choose a better business partner?

96
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,840
Should we choose one or

97
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,040
should we choose one?

98
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,640
It's more convenient to consider.

99
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,240
Okay.

100
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,440
Let's see.

101
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,440
Should we choose this or this?

102
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,240
Which one do you think is better?

103
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,640
I think we should consider

104
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,640
which one is more suitable for students.

105
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,640
There's a new problem.

106
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,640
It's not comfortable there.

107
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,440
Yes.

108
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
Yes.

109
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,040
Let's look at this one.

110
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,040
Okay.

111
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,240
Let's make a decision then.

112
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,040
Go back and have a good rest.

113
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,640
Look.

114
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,840
I'll tell you when I'm back.

115
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,240
Uncle, send me the information.

116
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,840
No problem.

117
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,440
Okay.

118
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:45,840
Okay.

119
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,040
Send me one.

120
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,640
Come on. Pack up.

121
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,240
Okay.

122
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,040
Okay.

123
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,840
Thank you, senior.

124
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,440
I'll give you one.

125
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,240
Okay.

126
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,440
Take a look at this.

127
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,040
Let's take this and then

128
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,240
go to the office.

129
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,640
Okay.

130
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,440
Okay.

131
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,640
Senior, don't be angry.

132
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,640
Chen Dongzhuo is not that kind of person.

133
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,840
Which kind?

134
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,440
He's the kind of person who comes and goes

135
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,840
and doesn't take responsibility.

136
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,840
Do you know him?

137
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,840
No.

138
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,040
I think he

139
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,840
may not have his own difficulties.

140
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,640
I found out

141
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,240
Chen Luzhou is so big.

142
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,640
You seem to be surprised.

143
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,640
Tell me honestly.

144
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,040
When I came to Beijing,

145
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,440
didn't I go to look for Zhu Yangqi?

146
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,240
I wanted him to cooperate with me

147
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,640
and give you a surprise.

148
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,240
But he went out of the house

149
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,040
and met Chen Luzhou who just came back.

150
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,440
He saved me in the middle of the night.

151
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,840
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

152
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,440
Zhu Yangqi didn't let me do it.

153
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,040
Okay.

154
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,040
No need to explain.

155
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,640
You're really mad at me.

156
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,040
I've been studying for 24 hours since now.

157
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,240
Where are you going?

158
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,040
To the dorm.

159
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,440
I'm writing a letter.

160
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,440
Is this the way back to the school?

161
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,040
Finally, you're back.

162
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,440
Xu Zhi.

163
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,040
How is it?

164
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
Do you look handsome?

165
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,040
Do you look handsome

166
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,240
and handsome as a natural?

167
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,840
Fine.

168
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,840
Let's do it like that.

169
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,840
You can't eat grapes.

170
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,840
You can't buy them.

171
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,640
It's a good thing.

172
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,040
It means Xu Zhi is not in your favor.

173
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,040
Besides,

174
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,640
I really think Jiang Yu is good.

175
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,840
She's reliable.

176
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,640
Why don't you consider it again?

177
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,240
You can't tell.

178
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,440
Xu Zhi doesn't like Jiang Yu at all.

179
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,040
He just said that he doesn't want to talk anymore.

180
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,440
Why did he force her?

181
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,040
No.

182
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,040
I'm worried about her.

183
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,040
Besides,

184
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,840
look at her.

185
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,240
Is she in this state now?

186
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,640
Is she very obvious?

187
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,040
She didn't come out of her previous relationship.

188
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,840
Jiang Yu is good.

189
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,840
Don't you think so?

190
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,440
I don't think so.

191
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,040
Thank you for your kindness.

192
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,240
But I really don't mean to Jiang Yu.

193
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,840
Okay.

194
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,440
We're all in the same dorm.

195
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,840
Why are you so serious?

196
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,440
Right?

197
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,440
Okay, okay.

198
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,840
We'll just ignore it.

199
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,840
It's okay.

200
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,840
I'm sorry.

201
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,840
I was too excited just now.

202
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,040
I'm sorry.

203
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,440
What's wrong, Sisi?

204
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,440
Aren't you happy recently?

205
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,640
I'm angry with my boyfriend.

206
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,840
Boyfriend?

207
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,040
When is it?

208
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,640
We were together before we went to college.

209
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,640
Then we got into a big school together.

210
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,440
You can do it, Sisi.

211
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,040
You're a big fan of me.

212
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:40,640
Tell me.

213
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:41,840
Which show?

214
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,440
What's the name?

215
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,240
Do you have a photo?

216
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,240
Jiang Jixue.

217
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,240
Zhao Tianqi.

218
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,040
Jiang Jixue?

219
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,840
Zhao Tianqi?

220
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,840
I don't know him.

221
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,440
I don't know him.

222
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,240
No.

223
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
He's handsome.

224
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,240
He's also in the 20th grade.

225
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,240
Really?

226
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:55,840
Yes.

227
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,840
Then bring him over next time.

228
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,840
Let's meet him.

229
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,640
Then I have to see my mood.

230
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,440
Let me see if Jiang Yu is handsome.

231
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,440
But, Sisi.

232
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,240
How did your boyfriend

233
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,440
tease you?

234
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,840
If you don't want to say it,

235
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,040
just ask me.

236
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,840
Because...

237
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,040
He's always making his own decisions.

238
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,840
He's the one who arranged this and that for me.

239
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,640
But I don't like it at all.

240
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,440
So I'll be so big

241
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,040
when I hear the words from the school.

242
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,440
Then why don't you tell him

243
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,640
if you don't like it?

244
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,640
I don't want to sweep his name.

245
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,640
And I'm afraid it will affect our relationship.

246
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,240
Then it won't affect now?

247
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,240
The more you don't say it,

248
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,840
the more he doesn't know your feelings.

249
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,040
The longer you go down,

250
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,440
the more you think he's boring.

251
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,840
He doesn't know where the problem is.

252
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,640
Exactly.

253
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,840
What age is this?

254
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,640
Just say it if you have anything.

255
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,040
Can you stop talking about

256
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,440
the ungrateful love?

257
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,040
I'm worried for you.

258
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,840
Yes.

259
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,840
You're right.

260
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,840
Psi psi.

261
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,640
Psi psi.

262
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,840
Psi psi.

263
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,440
Yanqin.

264
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,640
Your girlfriend is also a playwright, right?

265
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,240
Yes.

266
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,640
Do you have her signature?

267
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,840
Can you send me one?

268
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,240
Why do you want this?

269
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,240
I want to go to the next door.

270
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,840
I've sent you one.

271
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,640
Thanks.

272
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,440
It's okay.

273
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,640
I'll send you one.

274
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,440
Okay.

275
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,640
I'll send you one.

276
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,440
Okay.

277
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,440
I'll send you one.

278
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,240
Okay.

279
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,440
I'll send you one.

280
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,240
Okay.

281
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,440
I'll send you one.

282
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,240
Okay.

283
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,040
Okay.

284
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,640
Okay.

285
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,040
Okay.

286
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:51,640
Okay.

287
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,240
Okay.

288
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:52,640
Okay.

289
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,440
Okay.

290
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:53,840
Okay.

291
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,440
Okay.

292
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:54,840
Okay.

293
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,440
Okay.

294
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,040
Okay.

295
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,640
Okay.

296
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,240
Okay.

297
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:57,840
Okay.

298
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,240
Okay.

299
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:58,640
Okay.

300
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,040
Okay.

301
00:10:59,240 --> 00:10:59,440
Okay.

302
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,040
Okay.

303
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,640
Okay.

304
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,040
Okay.

305
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:01,640
Okay.

306
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,240
Okay.

307
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,440
Okay.

308
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:02,840
Okay.

309
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,440
Okay.

310
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,040
Okay.

311
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:04,640
Okay.

312
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,240
Okay.

313
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,240
Okay.

314
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,840
Okay.

315
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,440
Okay.

316
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,240
Xu Zhi.

317
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,840
I'm sorry.

318
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,640
I'm sorry.

319
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,440
I'm sorry.

320
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,240
I'm sorry.

321
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,240
I'm sorry.

322
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,040
I'm sorry.

323
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,840
I'm sorry.

324
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,640
I'm sorry.

325
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,440

I'm sorry.

327
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,040
I'm sorry.

328
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,640
I'm sorry.

329
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,440
I'm sorry.

330
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,240
I'm sorry.

331
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,040

336
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:54,840
I'm sorry.

337
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,640
I'm sorry.

338
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,240
I'm sorry.

339
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,040
I'm sorry.

340
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:57,840
I'm sorry.

341
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,640
I'm sorry.

342
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,240
I'm sorry.

343
00:11:59,440 --> 00:11:59,840
I'm sorry.

344
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,640
I'm sorry.

345
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,640
I'm sorry.

346
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,640
I'm sorry.

347
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,640
I'm sorry.

348
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,640
I'm sorry.

349
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,640
I'm sorry.

350
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,240
I'm sorry.

351
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,240
I'm sorry.

352
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,240
I'm sorry.

353
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,040
I'm sorry.

354
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,240
I'm sorry.

355
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,040
I've been thinking about it all the time.

356
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,040
I'm afraid to tell you who's the spy.

357
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,640
I believe you can't find the reason.

358
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,040
I won't answer your question.

359
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:27,040
I'm sorry.

360
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,040
Do you want to have breakfast with me?

361
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,640
The dorm is so old.

362
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,240
It's not like the style of your Chen Luozhou.

363
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,640
It doesn't matter if it's old or not.

364
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,640
You can do it if you can.

365
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,040
You can do it.

366
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,440
I'm leaving.

367
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,240
Thank you.

368
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,640
Thank you.

369
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,240
Thank you.

370
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,640
How many hours have you been here?

371
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,440
Four.

372
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,640
You won't send me a WeChat first?

373
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,040
I did.

374
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,640
You didn't reply me.

375
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,040
What's the matter with your expression?

376
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,240
I know you're busy today.

377
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,640
I'll say two words.

378
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,640
I won't delay you.

379
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,440
How do you know I'm busy today?

380
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,040
Your social friend, Liu Yisi,

381
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,440
boyfriend is my social friend.

382
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,240
I asked them for your WeChat number.

383
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,440
Your social friend is Zhao Tianqi.

384
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,440
Okay.

385
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,840
I've finished talking.

386
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,640
You can shut up now.

387
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,840
Don't drink milk.

388
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,040
Don't drink milk.

389
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,640
Don't drink milk.

390
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,840
Don't drink milk.

391
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,840
Do you think I'm funny?

392
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,040
Do you think I'm funny?

393
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,840
Say it if you're not.

394
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,440
I didn't want to hit you.

395
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,440
I'm not sure.

396
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,440
Then?

397
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,440
I was thinking of getting a new one tomorrow.

398
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,440
But I saw the plan for the supplementation on Huadao.

399
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,440
The public business management didn't hire a full-time employee.

400
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,440
I thought it was a genius.

401
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,440
So I tried to see how it was going.

402
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,440
Why didn't you say it earlier?

403
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,440
I didn't know if I could make it.

404
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,440
So I didn't dare to tell you.

405
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,440
Are you planning to keep learning this business?

406
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,440
Let's move to the economy.

407
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,440
Or study in the double-study position.

408
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,440
Okay.

409
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,440
Then you can stop talking about this one-month course.

410
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,440
You'll be waiting for the book of the professor's high school in the afternoon.

411
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,440
You want my book too?

412
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,440
Where do you sit in the class of the professor's?

413
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,440
It's the first and the second row.

414
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,440
What?

415
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,440
You want to sit next to me?

416
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,440
No.

417
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,440
I just want to see

418
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,440
how we can be a student in the class.

419
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,440
Okay.

420
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,440
When did they get to know each other?

421
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,440
I don't know.

422
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,440
You're so bold.

423
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,440
You're the first row in the book of the day.

424
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,440
Where did you go?

425
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,440
I didn't have a meeting.

426
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,440
I was busy.

427
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,440
I was a official and a businesswoman.

428
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,440
You're so busy.

429
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,440
Everyone,

430
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,440
which one is coming up?

431
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,440
Pick up this question.

432
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,440
I'm not sure.

433
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,440
I'm not sure.

434
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,440
Pick up this question.

435
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,440
It seems that some students have done their homework.

436
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,440
Girls,

437
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,440
come up here and answer this question.

438
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,440
Okay?

439
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,440
Okay.

440
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,440
The answer is here.

441
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,440
You can do it yourself.

442
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,440
Pick up the old man.

443
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,440
Thank you.

444
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,440
Let's encourage him.

445
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,440
In the past,

446
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,440
you've known many problems.

447
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,440
It's not difficult to solve them.

448
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,440
It's hard to solve them.

449
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,440
You always have this kind of definition.

450
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,440
The definition.

451
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,440
Do you eat it?

452
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,440
This is very important.

453
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,440
Good.

454
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,440
Good.

455
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,440
In fact,

456
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,440
this question

457
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,440
can solve the definition of the day.

458
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,440
Everyone,

459
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,440
use the definition of today

460
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,440
to think about it.

461
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,440
I'll give you time.

462
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,440
Okay?

463
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,440
Okay.

464
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,440
You've learned it secretly at home.

465
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,440
The day of the day

466
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,440
is coming.

467
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,440
Gao Zhong has learned it.

468
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,440
We didn't expect him to speak so fast.

469
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,440
He has been speaking to Ding Ji for a month.

470
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,440
If he changes the topic,

471
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,440
we'll be surprised.

472
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,440
You've learned the day of the day at home.

473
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,440
It's too far from the 11th grade.

474
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,440
I'm teaching at the competition.

475
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,440
I'm teaching at the physics competition.

476
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,440
It's better to have a day at the physics competition.

477
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,440
Okay.

478
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,440
You've finished it.

479
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,440
Let's see

480
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,440
what's the answer to the next question.

481
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,440
This boy.

482
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,440
Tell me.

483
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,440
B.

484
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,440
This girl is right.

485
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,440
The answer is A.

486
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,440
Is it true that

487
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,440
the first love is still the same

488
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,440
as the first love?

489
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,440
Yes.

490
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,440
It's a precious thing to learn.

491
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,440
What are they talking about?

492
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,440
I can't hear them.

493
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,440
Is there any free time?

494
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,440
What?

495
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,440
I want to give you some math.

496
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,440
Have you seen the decoration?

497
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,440
Ming Long,

498
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,440
kneel down.

499
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,440
Big Sister, please do something.

500
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,440
Is this the one you just said?

501
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,440
Then help me to make it up.

502
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,440
No time?

503
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,440
You're so close.

504
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,440
There must be a story.

505
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,440
Tell me the truth.

506
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,440
What's wrong with you and that handsome guy?

507
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,440
He went to work late.

508
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,440
He just had a job.

509
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,440
Stop it.

510
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,440
Did you know each other before?

511
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,440
We are both young.

512
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,440
No wonder.

513
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,440
I saw you two talking about the class.

514
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,440
You were happy.

515
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,440
Tell me.

516
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,440
Do you like your hometown?

517
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,440
A little bit.

518
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,440
If I had the confidence of half of you,

519
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,440
I wouldn't be able to find a boyfriend.

520
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,440
Mr. Zhi, please help me.

521
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,440
What's wrong with you?

522
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,440
Stop pretending.

523
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,440
You can't be like this.

524
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,440
Hurry up and stop the class.

525
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,440
I'll hug you.

526
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,440
Try your best.

527
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,440
I guess you'll have to stay up late.

528
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,440
Then,

529
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,440
don't wait for me for breakfast.

530
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,440
Let's share.

531
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,440
Who are you going to eat with?

532
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,440
Jiang Yu?

533
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,440
You're so mean.

534
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,440
Didn't you tell Zhu Yangqi

535
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,440
that I can't be friends with Jiang Yu?

536
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,440
Hello.

537
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,440
What else did Zhu Yangqi tell you?

538
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,440
Nothing.

539
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,440
You should learn first.

540
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,440
After the exam,

541
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,440
you should talk about it.

542
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,440
Okay.

543
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,440
When I finish the rest of the class,

544
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,440
we can have a good chat.

545
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,440
Chen Luzhou,

546
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,440
you're so talented.

547
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,440
I thought that

548
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,440
all the students in the first round would know.

549
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,440
Not all the students in the first round

550
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,440
would know anything.

551
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,440
But Chen Luzhou

552
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,440
must know a little bit about it.

553
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,440
Who asked the question just now?

554
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,440
My brother.

555
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,440
Chen Sanzhou.

556
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,440
Okay.

557
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,440
Let's see how many points

558
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,440
you can get in the exam.

559
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,440
I'm also looking forward to

560
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,440
the performance of Qinyi and Xiaohuima.

561
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,440
Wait a minute.

562
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,440
I'm hanging up.

563
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,440
Qinyi and Xiaohuima.

564
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,440
What are you?

565
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,440
Did you beat me up?

566
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,440
I've been drunk for a long time.

567
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,440
I've been feeling sad.

568
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,440
It's been twenty hours.

569
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,440
Am I still your best friend?

570
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,440
Where is my best friend?

571
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,440
I only saw a green grass.

572
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,440
I'm sure there's no next time.

573
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,440
No matter what the advantage is,

574
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,440
I'm sure my sister is in danger.

575
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,440
I swear, if I didn't do it,

576
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,440
I'll...

577
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,440
Okay.

578
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,440
I won't force you.

579
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,440
So,

580
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,440
Chen Luzhou explained it to you.

581
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,440
Are you going to forgive him?

582
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,440
Let's forgive him first.

583
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,440
Not bad.

584
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,440
Xu Zhi forgave you.

585
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,440
Forget it.

586
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,440
Study hard in the library.

587
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,440
Ask Dongwen Xi.

588
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,440
Please.

589
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,440
What's the situation between you two?

590
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,440
How are you going to do it?

591
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,440
How am I going to do it?

592
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,440
You don't know?

593
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,440
How are you going to do it?

594
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,440
Is there anyone in this position?

595
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,440
Well...

596
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,440
No.

597
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,440
Okay.

598
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,440
Isn't this the western flower I liked last time?

599
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,440
I was so wrong.

600
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,440
I was wrong about Xu Zhi.

601
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,440
I was so wrong about Xu Zhi.

602
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,440
If you have the talent,

603
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,440
you can't just answer me.

604
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,440
You've never been this kind of person before.

605
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,440
Chen Luzhou.

606
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,440
Our group of students

607
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,440
asked if you're interested in joining the photography club.

608
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,440
I'm not.

609
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,440
Sorry.

610
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,440
Isn't it the basketball game the day after tomorrow?

611
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,440
I heard you brought a drone to the school.

612
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,440
Is it convenient for you to thank me?

613
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,440
Student.

614
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,440
If you have something to say, just say it.

615
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,440
If it's not convenient, we can change the place.

616
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,440
It's your hometown.

617
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,440
It seems to be the play area next to it.

618
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,440
Xu Zhi.

619
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,440
What a coincidence.

620
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,440
What a coincidence.

621
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,440
It's not a coincidence.

622
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,440
Thank you.

623
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,440
Let's go.

624
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,440
Do you have a girlfriend?

625
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,440
No.

626
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,440
Then can I...

627
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,440
But I'm chasing my ex-girlfriend now.

628
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,440
Ex-girlfriend? Who?

629
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,440
Don't you know Chen Luzhou?

630
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,440
What does he look like?

631
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,440
Is he very pretty?

632
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,440
Not bad.

633
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,440
Not bad.

634
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,440
You're jealous, aren't you?

635
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,440
Sorry.

636
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,440
Who is he?

637
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,440
Chen Luzhou's ex-girlfriend.

638
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,440
You're right.

639
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,440
You're in a state of shock.

640
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,440
You're in a state of shock.

641
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,440
What did you say?

642
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,440
He said it was a coincidence.

643
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,440
He's lost it.

644
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,440
Then hurry up and go to the lake.

645
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,440
Let him be for a while.

646
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,440
He'll be fine in a while.

647
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,440
No.

648
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,440
No.

649
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,440
I'm sorry.

650
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,440
I'm sorry.

651
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,440
I'm sorry.

652
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,440
I'm sorry.

653
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,440
No.

654
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,440
How do I feel?

655
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,440
I don't know I'm jealous.

656
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,440
He might be jealous.

657
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,440
Yes.

658
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,440
The average of the storm and the rain.

659
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,440
No.

660
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,440
Have you ever seen a girl

661
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,440
who loves to eat vinegar?

662
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,440
You've seen her.

663
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,440
I...

664
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,440
I've never been in a relationship.

665
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,440
But I know that.

666
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,440
It's a good thing to eat vinegar.

667
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,440
Just count it.

668
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,440
What do you mean?

669
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,440
I'm warning you.

670
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,440
If you're jealous,

671
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,440
it might be a good thing.

672
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,440
At least it means

673
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,440
he cares about you.

674
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,440
But if he's not jealous,

675
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,440
it's a big problem.

676
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,440
It means he's

677
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,440
a total mess.

678
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,440
Go.

679
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,440
Look at this.

680
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,440
Isn't it this?

681
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,440
It's different.

682
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,440
This is the shape.

683
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,440
This is the shape.

684
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,440
It's natural to use your hands.

685
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,440
Chen Lu Zhou.

686
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,440
Chen Lu Zhou.

687
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,440
What?

688
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,440
What's the matter?

689
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,440
I just want to ask.

690
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,440
Have you ever mentioned me

691
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,440
in the past few days?

692
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,440
No.

693
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,440
What's wrong?

694
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,440
He's probably still mad at me.

695
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,440
I don't know

696
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,440
whether he's mad at you

697
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,440
or not.

698
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,440
But we should not think about it anymore.

699
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,440
In case Mr. Zhi gets mad at me.

700
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,440
Bye.

701
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,440
Mr. Zhi.

702
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,440
I want to ask you something.

703
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,440
Go.

704
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,440
Go.

705
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,440
Go.

706
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,440
Go.

707
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,440
Go.

708
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,440
Go.

709
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,440
Go.

710
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,440
What's your name?

711
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,440
Go.

712
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,440
Go.

713
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,440
Go.

714
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,440
Go.

715
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,440
Hello, Lu Zhou.

716
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,440
You must be busy recently.

717
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,440
I know you didn't take the bank card.

718
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,440
I'll pay you back

719
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,440
every month

720
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,440
to get your WeChat.

721
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,440
Don't pay me back.

722
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,440
I'll try to get Jiang Xuejing back.

723
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,440
Jiang Xuejing is the highest.

724
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,440
Only 15,000 yuan.

725
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,440
What else can I use after I get the tuition?

726
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,440
I've done some work before.

727
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,440
I've been working on it.

728
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,440
I've done some work before.

729
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,440
I can save some money.

730
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,440
I know.

731
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,440
But as long as you continue to study,

732
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,440
I'll have the right

733
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,440
and the obligation

734
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,440
to support you.

735
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,440
I'll give you the money

736
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,440
on time.

737
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,440
You don't need it.

738
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,440
You can do it yourself.

739
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,440
Okay?

740
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,440
I miss you a lot.

741
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,440
You have to take care of yourself

742
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,440
outside.

743
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,440
See you.

744
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,440
Lu Zhou.

745
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,440
You're back.

746
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,440
There are many

747
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,440
auditions at our school.

748
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,440
Why don't you take a look?

749
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,440
You've misunderstood.

750
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,440
I just don't want

751
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,440
to spend money on my family.

752
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,440
I just said

753
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,440
that you should take care of your family

754
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,440
and the house condition

755
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,440
should be good.

756
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,440
But

757
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,440
you really want to start a family?

758
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,440
Yes.

759
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,440
You want to start a family?

760
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,440
I have an idea.

761
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,440
But it seems that

762
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,440
it's hard to start a family.

763
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,440
The foundation must be above 4.0.

764
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,440
And it can't be dropped.

765
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,440
Not every professional has a name.

766
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,440
Is it harder to pursue a girl than to pursue a girl?

767
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,440
Wait.

768
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,440
The reason you asked me

769
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,440
to be the director

770
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,440
is to pursue a girl.

771
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,440
A daughter-in-law?

772
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,440
A director?

773
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,440
Is your ex-girlfriend Xu Zhi?

774
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,440
What's wrong?

775
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,440
Is it that Zhao Tianqi

776
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,440
who made a mess of your plan again?

777
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,440
No.

778
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,440
I've made it clear to him.

779
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,440
Don't worry about me.

780
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,440
Then why are you so angry again?

781
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,440
I'm angry.

782
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,440
Look.

783
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,440
Oh my god.

784
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,440
No foundation, no space, no consciousness.

785
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,440
It's too narrow.

786
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,440
You said I wouldn't hang up, right?

787
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,440
No.

788
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,440
It's my first time doing it.

789
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,440
But

790
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,440
our senior sister said

791
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,440
that our architecture design

792
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,440
is super high in hang-up rate.

793
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,440
What should we do?

794
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,440
Ask Xu Zhi.

795
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,440
His engineering design

796
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,440
is our top priority.

797
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,440
Mr. Xu,

798
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,440
can you open the package for me?

799
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,440
Please help me.

800
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,440
No problem.

801
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,440
Here you are.

802
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,440
Mr. Xu can bless me.

803
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,440
The space is too big.

804
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,440
If I'm that good,

805
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,440
I don't need to learn.

806
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,440
I can even get my clothes.

807
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,440
I remember

808
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,440
we always said

809
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,440
that we can use a drone

810
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,440
to shoot and build a view

811
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,440
to help us understand.

812
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,440
I remember

813
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,440
Chen Lu Zhou.

814
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,440
Can you lend us a hand?

815
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,440
Please, Mr. Xu.

816
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,440
I'm begging you.

817
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,440
Xu Zhi.

818
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,440
Okay, I'll try.

819
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,440
I'm saved.

820
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,440
What's wrong with you?

821
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,440
My face is all green

822
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,440
after eating salad these days.

823
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,440
When can we

824
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,440
eat well

825
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,440
together?

826
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,440
I get it.

827
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,440
Come on, buddy.

828
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,440
We're getting close to each other.

829
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,440
Chen Lu Zhou.

830
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,440
Let's go.

831
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,440
Can I help you?

832
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,440
Yes.

833
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,440
I want to see your drone.

834
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,440
Sure.

835
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,440
I'll teach you.

836
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,440
Really? That's great.

837
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,440
No need.

838
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,440
Give me a certificate.

839
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,440
I'll study it myself.

840
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,440
Mr. Zhi.

841
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,440
You're so kind and independent.

842
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,440
Why don't you ask me?

843
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,440
You don't need to

844
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,440
come to Pailu.

845
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,440
No matter what.

846
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,440
Mr. Zhi,

847
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,440
you're up.

848
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,440
Eat more.

849
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,440
Don't talk.

850
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,440
You don't have anything else to say?

851
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,440
Then...

852
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,440
Thank you for your drone.

853
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,440
Thank you for your drone.

854
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,440
You're welcome.

855
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,440
I'm also welcome.

856
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,440
What's going on?

857
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,440
The drone is gone.

858
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,440
What's going on?

859
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,440
The drone is gone.

860
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,440
What's going on?

861
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,440
The drone is gone.

862
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,440
What's going on?

863
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,440
The drone is gone.

864
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,440
Your roommate loves to be fast.

865
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,440
No.

866
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,440
I'm a good person.

867
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,440
I'm a good customer.

868
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,440
And I'm good at acting.

869
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,440
I can always find the big one.

870
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,440
What's the big one?

871
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,440
I think you didn't lie to me before.

872
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,440
I like you a lot.

873
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,440
Really?

874
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,440
What's the big one?

875
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,440
No.

876
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,440
I think you two are good at eating.

877
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,440
I'm full.

878
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,440
You eat slowly.

879
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,440
I'll go first.

880
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,440
What did you say to me before?

881
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,440
He said I was jealous of your ex-girlfriend.

882
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,440
He also said I couldn't eat grapes.

883
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,440
I can't say I couldn't eat grapes.

884
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,440
If you're jealous of my ex-girlfriend,

885
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,440
you can admit it.

886
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,440
And grapes are sweet.

887
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,440
I suggest you try it.

888
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,440
You can leave if you want.

889
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,440
You'll be back when you're young.

890
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,440
Not all girls will wait for you to be named.

891
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,440
Besides, I'm jealous of your ex-girlfriend.

892
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,440
After all, you're not that good at that time.

893
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,440
I'll discuss the future with my girlfriend.

894
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,440
He Ge's ex-girlfriend needs to learn to avoid the suspicion.

895
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,440
What's wrong?

896
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,440
You're avoiding the flower?

897
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,440
I'm afraid to wait for you to be eliminated.

898
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,440
Now everyone knows

899
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,440
my ex-girlfriend is in Huada.

900
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,440
And I'm chasing after her.

901
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,440
Who dares to chase after me?

902
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,440
Who knows?

903
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,440
Chen Luzhou.

904
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,440
Can you add a WeChat?

905
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,440
Excuse me.

906
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,440
You may have to ask my ex-girlfriend first.

907
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,440
I'm sorry.

908
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,440
It's so embarrassing.

909
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,440
How could it be?

910
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,440
But they're sweet.

911
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,440
Xu Zhi.

912
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,440
What's wrong?

913
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,440
Sit down.

914
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,440
Oh, my God, Xu Zhi.

915
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,440
I've never reacted to it.

916
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,440
So you're the ex-girlfriend of Chen Luzhou.

917
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,440
Oh, my God.

918
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,440
You're so good at hiding things.

919
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,440
So,

920
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,440
are you two together?

921
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,440
It's all in the past.

922
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,440
We've been together for a long time.

923
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,440
I don't believe it.

924
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,440
You two were just in the cafeteria.

925
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,440
You were so excited.

926
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,440
Your eyes were almost torn.

927
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,440
You two

928
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,440
were just thinking about it.

929
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,440
I almost forgot.

930
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,440
I'm going to have my boyfriend

931
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,440
tomorrow.

932
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,440
And his roommate, Chen Luzhou.

933
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,440
But if you're interested,

934
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,440
I'll call him.

935
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,440
Wait.

936
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,440
Chen Luzhou is your boyfriend's roommate?

937
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,440
And he's my roommate's ex-boyfriend.

938
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,440
He's so friendly.

939
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,440
How can I not call him?

940
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,440
I have to call him, right?

941
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,440
Xu Zhi.

942
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,440
Didn't you say you're going to be a fan?

943
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,440
I'm sure you won't mind if I'm a fan.

944
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,440
You two call him.

945
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,440
I don't mind.

946
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,440
He doesn't mind.

947
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,440
He agreed.

948
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,440
I'll call him.

949
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,440
Call him.

950
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,440
I'll call him.

951
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,440
Call him.

952
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,440
Call him.

953
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,440
Call him.

954
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,440
Sorry to keep you waiting.

955
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,440
This is my boyfriend, Tianqi.

956
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,440
Hello.

957
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,440
Hello.

958
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,440
Thank you for giving Yisi a birthday.

959
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,440
Happy birthday.

960
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,440
Happy birthday.

961
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,440
Thank you.

962
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,440
Happy birthday.

963
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,440
Thank you.

964
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,440
This is...

965
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,440
Hello, everyone.

966
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,440
Chen Luzhou.

967
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,440
My hometown.

968
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,440
Don't explain it.

969
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,440
We all know.

970
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,440
Thank you.

971
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,440
Yisi, give me a hug.

972
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,440
Give me a hug.

973
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,440
Thank you.

974
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,440
He's so handsome.

975
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,440
I'm embarrassed.

976
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,440
No.

977
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,440
I'm going to do it today.

978
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,440
Shall we order first?

979
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,440
Okay.

980
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,440
I guess Jiang Yixue

981
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,440
is in the toilet now.

982
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,440
I'm a straightforward person.

983
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,440
I'll just say it.

984
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,440
Chen Luzhou.

985
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,440
When are you going to

986
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,440
turn from your ex-boyfriend

987
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,440
to your ex-boyfriend?

988
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,440
Ex-boyfriend is the reason

989
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,440
why he's an ex-boyfriend.

990
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,440
There must be a reason for that.

991
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,440
Why is he

992
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,440
so long?

993
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,440
Why is he

994
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,440
two times in a pit?

995
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,440
Jiang.

996
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,440
Jiang.

997
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,440
Jiang.

998
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,440
The number you have dialed

999
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,440
is currently unavailable.

1000
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,440
Please call the number.

1001
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,440
The number you have dialed

1002
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,440
is currently unavailable.

1003
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,440
I'm sorry.

1004
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,440
I'm sorry.

1005
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,440
I'm sorry.

1006
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,440
How was the meal?

1007
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,440
It was delicious.

1008
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,440
It was delicious.

1009
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,440
I'm sorry.

1010
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,440
It was delicious.

1011
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,440
Okay.

1012
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,440
I'm sorry.

1013
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,440
I'm sorry.

1014
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,440
Let's go.

1015
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,440
Tianxi.

1016
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,440
Let's practice for a while.

1017
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,440
Let's go.

1018
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,440
Let's practice for a while.

1019
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,440
Let's practice for a while.

1020
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,440
You are

1021
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,440
Xu Zhi's ex-boyfriend,

1022
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,440
Chen Luzhou, right?

1023
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,440
You are

1024
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,440
the director of Xu Zhi, Jiang Yu, right?

1025
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,440
I'm not bad.

1026
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,440
You're not bad either.

1027
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,440
Oh, right.

1028
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,440
I want to give

1029
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,440
a little advice to the director.

1030
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,440
What do you think?

1031
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,440
The press conference

1032
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,440
of the promotion department

1033
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,440
is about to start.

1034
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,440
I'm not sure

1035
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,440
if there are any important things

1036
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,440
to discuss in the future.

1037
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,440
The director

1038
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,440
will be finished in time.

1039
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,440
Don't delay the promotion.

1040
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,440
I got it.

1041
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,440
You will pay attention in the future.

1042
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,440
I have a little advice

1043
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,440
to get here.

1044
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,440
You need to learn to cherish.

1045
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,440
If you don't know how to cherish,

1046
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,440
just be your ex-boyfriend.

1047
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,440
Don't let Xu Zhi

1048
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,440
be your ex-boyfriend.

1049
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,440
Don't let Xu Zhi

1050
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,440
be your ex-boyfriend.

1051
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,440
He told you

1052
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,440
that I hurt him.

1053
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,440
He never mentioned you to me.

1054
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,440
How do you know

1055
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,440
who hurt him?

1056
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,440
Do you know

1057
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,440
why he passed

1058
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,440
my friend's application?

1059
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,440
Because my WeChat profile

1060
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,440
is also a reliable one.

1061
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,440
He thought it was your nickname,

1062
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,440
so he married you.

1063
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,440
He thought it was your nickname,

1064
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,440
so he married you.

1065
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,440
You sent Erding, too, right?

1066
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,440
He lost Erding

1067
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,440
at the New Year's Day party.

1068
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,440
He was very polite.

1069
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,440
I helped him find it.

1070
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,440
He just thanked me.

1071
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,440
He said that

1072
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,440
it was important

1073
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,440
to Erding.

1074
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,440
It's time to go to the factory.

1075
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,440
Don't lose your confidence.

1076
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,440
Don't give me a chance.

1077
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,440
Ge Ge,

1078
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,440
you made a big mistake.

1079
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,440
Who told you to make a big mistake?

1080
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,440
Come on.

1081
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,440
Let's celebrate.

1082
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,440
Cheers.

1083
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,440
Cheers.

1084
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,440
Let me have a meal.

1085
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,440
Why are you so close to me?

1086
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,440
It's none of your business.

1087
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,440
You're always close to me.

1088
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,440
It's none of your business.

1089
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,440
You're always close to me.

1090
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,440
Ge Ge,

1091
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,440
happy birthday to you.

1092
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,440
Yes, happy birthday to you.

1093
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,440
Why don't you sing?

1094
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,440
I'm birthday boy.

1095
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,440
Sing.

1096
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,440
Happy birthday to you.

1097
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,440
Wait.

1098
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,440
I'm not happy.

1099
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,440
I'm not happy.

1100
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,440
I was a pig in my previous life.

1101
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,440
I'm going to learn to build this life.

1102
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,440
I regret it.

1103
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,440
I want to be a professional.

1104
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,440
I'll go to the rain.

1105
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,440
You're the best.

1106
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,440
It's raining.

1107
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,440
Hurry up.

1108
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,440
The quilt is still in the shade.

1109
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,440
It's in the shade.

1110
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,440
It's in the shade.

1111
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,440
Go, go, go.

1112
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,440
It's in the shade.

1113
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,440
It's in the shade.

1114
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,440
The wind is blowing.

1115
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,440
The moonlight is shining.

1116
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,440
The heart is in the sky.

1117
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,440
The red leaves are falling.

1118
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,440
Do you miss me?

1119
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,440
No.

1120
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,440
You're still so jealous.

1121
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,440
You're not the first day of the day.

1122
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,440
Tell me.

1123
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,440
The wind is blowing.

1124
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,440
I still remember.

1125
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,440
The sea is flying.

1126
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,440
Waiting for each other.

1127
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,440
Run.

1128
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,440
The moonlight is blowing.

1129
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,440
The moon is in the shade.

1130
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,440
The quilt is still in the shade.

1131
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,440
It's in the shade.

1132
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,440
Crush.

1133
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:34,440
The tears are still in the heart.

1134
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,440
Crush.

1135
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:42,440
The world is still for you.

1136
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,440
The clouds and the trees are in the shade.

1137
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:57,440
The sky is always clear.

1138
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:02,440
The world is too quiet.

1139
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:10,440
All the sound is in the room.

1140
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:16,440
Who will be in the light?

1141
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,440
Be careful.

1142
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,440
One by one.

1143
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,440
Go into the fog.

1144
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:27,440
The wind is blowing.

1145
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:33,440
The world is still for you.

1146
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,440
The sun is rising.

1147
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,440
The moon is in the shade.

1148
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,440
The sky is still for you.

1149
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,440
The moon is in the shade.

1150
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,440
The sun is in the shade.

1151
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:58,440
The sun is in the shade.

1152
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,440
Because you are the wind

1153
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,440
The lonely heart is a bear

1154
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,440
In the autumn night, the chase is not stopping

1155
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,440
We are like pain

1156
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,440
I don't care about the past

1157
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,440
Who is like you

1158
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,440
Who is like you

1159
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,440
The future is moving

1160
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,440
Because you are the wind

1161
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,440
The love is missing several times

1162
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,440
Only then can we be brave and brave

1163
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,440
After the long and long

1164
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:51,440
I want to let go of the other side

1165
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:56,440
I won't retreat

1166
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,440
In your eyes

1167
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,440
I see myself

1168
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,440
Into you

1169
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,440
Into you
