1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The wind blows my heart

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The moment my face is burned

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The smile is drawn into the distance

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The pain is hurt, the hatred is impregnated

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The wind blows my heart

6
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
If I cry for a long time

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The wind of the city is still in my memory

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The sea is flying, waiting for each other

9
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The city is still

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Crushed

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
How should I say it?

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The city is still

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
1034 Chen Luzhou, Qizhen City

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's your turn.

15
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Hello, this way.

16
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Doctor.

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Where are you feeling uncomfortable?

18
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I bumped into someone when I was playing basketball.

19
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Your name is Chen Luzhou?

20
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm Chen Luzhou.

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What do you do at home?

22
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I do business.

23
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Do you have a brother or sister?

24
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I have a brother.

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Is this related to the disease?

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Well,

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'll do a check first.

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Check?

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay, follow me.

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You're always like this?

31
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's normal to see it this way.

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Really?

33
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Hey,

34
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm not a bad guy.

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm not a bad guy.

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm not a bad guy.

37
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm not a bad guy.

38
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm not a bad guy.

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm not a bad guy.

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm not a bad guy.

41
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Hey, what's up?

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What did the doctor say?

43
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Slow down.

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What did he say?

45
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I don't know.

46
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
He said this.

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Why did he say this?

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Could it be...

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Did the doctor say anything else?

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
He asked me about my family.

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Did he say anything about my brother or sister?

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
He must want to ask you about the red envelope.

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What?

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
My dad said that

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
some doctors are not good at thinking.

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
They ask about the red envelope.

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But this doctor seems to be

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
quite positive.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Have you seen a doctor

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
who has paid the money

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
on the brain?

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But other things are not important.

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The most important thing is the disease.

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You have to pay attention to the happiness

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
in your life.

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
How about I buy you a red envelope?

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
No need.

68
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Don't bother me.

69
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The envelope is signed.

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll show you when I get back.

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay.

72
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What about you?

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
1034.

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Come in.

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Doctor Xu.

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm sorry to let you come in.

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Are you okay?

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I...

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I...

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm very sick.

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Is this check-up

82
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
supposed to be done?

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Not that.

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'll change it for you.

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
No need.

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I just felt a bit.

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't think it hurts that much.

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Why don't I go back to Yangyang

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
and come back next week?

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I have to tell you

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
that your treatment

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
is not bad,

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
but it is not very effective.

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,160
You're not a good person.

95
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,120
You're a foreigner.

96
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,720
You may have a rest for a few days.

97
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,640
But if you feel uncomfortable

98
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,840
for more than a week,

99
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,680
I suggest you come and help.

100
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,680
Okay.

101
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,880
Here.

102
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,680
I'll give you a few suggestions.

103
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,240
Have you found a girlfriend?

104
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,640
I suggest you

105
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,840
not to find a girlfriend for now.

106
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,040
Take care of your illness

107
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,800
and observe for a while.

108
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Okay.

109
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
Thank you, doctor.

110
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,680
Go.

111
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,840
Next.

112
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,840
1035.

113
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
Hello, director.

114
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,440
Go to work.

115
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,440
Okay.

116
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,240
Did you see him?

117
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,000
You're still here.

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,880
He's gone.

119
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,880
Let him go.

120
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,480
Isn't that...

121
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,680
Yes.

122
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,640
I'll do it for you.

123
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,640
Chen Luzhou, right?

124
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,080
Sorry.

125
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,000
Look.

126
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
That guy next to you.

127
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Right?

128
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,320
Yes.

129
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,720
He's a good boy.

130
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,320
He's quite handsome.

131
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,760
19 years old.

132
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
This...

133
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,680
This...

134
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,800
This...

135
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,360
Let me see.

136
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,680
You didn't leave my desk.

137
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,360
You saw it.

138
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,160
He just left.

139
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,640
Doctor Xu,

140
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,160
please observe.

141
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,160
What's going on?

142
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,480
I know.

143
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,360
It's the fifth floor, right?

144
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,200
The foundation.

145
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,520
Come on.

146
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,160
He's still young.

147
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,040
Why is he always so young?

148
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,760
Is this thing reliable?

149
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,000
I've known it for so long.

150
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,560
If it weren't for a handsome guy,

151
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,840
I would have turned my face.

152
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,680
Is it him?

153
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,000
How could it be?

154
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,160
He's not good at acting.

155
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,640
Is he the same person as him?

156
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,000
Call him.

157
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,720
Okay.

158
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,160
Hello.

159
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,160
Hello.

160
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,160
Hello.

161
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,160
You...

162
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,160
Okay.

163
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,560
Hello.

164
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,160
Hello.

165
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,160
Just wait.

166
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
I'm Feng Jin.

167
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,160
I'm from the school of horse riding.

168
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
I'm from the school of sword.

169
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,160
Hello.

170
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,160
I'm Xu Zhi.

171
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,160
I'm Cai Yong.

172
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,160
Hello.

173
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,160
Get in the car.

174
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,160
The car is here.

175
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,760
Okay.

176
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,160
I'll get you the luggage.

177
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,160
Thank you.

178
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,160
Let me ask you.

179
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,160
Thank you.

180
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,160
Let me show you the photo I took.

181
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,160
Take a look.

182
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,160
This is in Yunnan.

183
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,160
This is Guili.

184
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,160
This is Zhu Mulan Ma Feng.

185
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,160
You went to Zhu Mulan Ma Feng?

186
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,160
Of course.

187
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,160
I'm like a movie actress.

188
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,160
I went to the mountain top.

189
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,160
I was sitting on the camp site.

190
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,160
And I was so excited.

191
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,160
But no matter what,

192
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,160
I've been to so many places.

193
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,160
I'm already good.

194
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,160
Am I right, Mr. Zhi?

195
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,160
It's not a big deal.

196
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,160
I have a friend.

197
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,160
He's also a photographer.

198
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,160
He's really good at that.

199
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,160
The photo of Gao Yi

200
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,160
was taken by the magazine.

201
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,160
A group of people

202
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,160
went to the country.

203
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,160
Later, they went to Qingtang High School.

204
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,160
They took a photo of

205
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,160
a very good documentary.

206
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,160
They were on the market.

207
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,160
They were selling the original film.

208
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,160
Is he handsome?

209
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,160
If he's not handsome,

210
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,160
no one will be handsome.

211
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,160
I heard that

212
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,160
he's been a big boy.

213
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,160
He likes his girl.

214
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
She's like a grape.

215
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,160
She's like a grape.

216
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,160
She's like a grape.

217
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,160
She's like a grape.

218
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,160
She's so exaggerated.

219
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,160
The key is that

220
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
he's the most unworthy

221
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,160
of the advantage of a girl.

222
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,160
Tell me.

223
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,160
Did you want to come here?

224
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,160
I hope that you can come here.

225
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,160
Fine.

226
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,160
I'll tell you later.

227
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,160
Since you're so familiar with it,

228
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,160
why don't you invite

229
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,160
the four of you to come here?

230
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,160
Because of the麻將,

231
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,160
I'm 3-1.

232
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,160
Yes.

233
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,160
I can eat more

234
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,160
if there's not many people.

235
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,160
How did you find me?

236
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,160
Go away.

237
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,160
Go away.

238
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,160
Go away.

239
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,160
Go away.

240
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,160
Go away.

241
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,160
Go away.

242
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,160
Go away.

243
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,160
Go away.

244
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,160
Go away.

245
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,160
Go away.

246
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,160
Go away.

247
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,160
Go away.

248
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,160
Go away.

249
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,160
Go away.

250
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,160
Go away.

251
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,160
Go away.

252
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,160
Go away.

253
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,160
Is this Su Youcha?

254
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,160
If I hadn't been to Xi Zao,

255
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,160
I would have thought

256
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,160
Su Youcha is so hard to drink.

257
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,160
Isn't this the Internet celebrity market?

258
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,160
Why is it looking so good?

259
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,880
It's so hard to eat.

260
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,520
Everyone,

261
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,840
is the tea good?

262
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,360
It's good.

263
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,440
This is our signature dish.

264
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,240
The whole Internet shopping street

265
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,480
is our first-class.

266
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,880
You all try it.

267
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,560
Okay.

268
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,400
Wenyu,

269
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,160
write some good comments

270
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,600
and write some good comments.

271
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,960
I'll give you some more snacks.

272
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,520
Okay.

273
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,080
Thank you.

274
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,920
You're welcome.

275
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,080
I'll get back to work.

276
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,920
You can teach me.

277
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,560
Okay.

278
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,280
Thank you.

279
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,080
Didn't you say

280
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,240
it's hard to drink tea?

281
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,440
It's soft.

282
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,720
It's hard to eat.

283
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,360
But I think

284
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,800
it's okay.

285
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,680
I'll get it.

286
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,600
It's so good.

287
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,640
You beat me.

288
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,200
Tasty.

289
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,320
No.

290
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,480
Yes.

291
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,600
What can I do?

292
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,880
We can

293
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,920
just noisy

294
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,000
with money and monkey.

295
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,880
You really want to civilization?

296
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,640
I'm still fun to眠.

297
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,800
She is kidding.

298
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,800
Put it here.

299
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,000
They confide in after narcissistic.

300
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,280
Make do with noodles.

301
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,720
This is someone you wanted.

302
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,080
She's marrying Hu Da Hai.

303
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,280
Why are you Watchu saying Miao?

304
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,360
Why?

305
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,920
Watchu actually wants to work in the office.

306
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,880
Why don't you work in the office

307
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,840
where Wang Xiaomme also works here?

308
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,880
Why don't you work here?

309
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,400
Actually,

310
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,440
I'm doing a job of rapport and commissioning.

311
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,640
If I commissioning,

312
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,000
I may not possess you,

313
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,240
but I can promised our Xu Yaning in the new office.

314
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,120
So the only thing I need is

315
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,640
a divorced face,

316
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,440
right?

317
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,960
I'm still helping,

318
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,040
so she's not married at my home.

319
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm not a thief.

320
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,960
A scapegoat.

321
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,560
You haven't said anything?

322
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,320
Don't talk nonsense, okay?

323
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,880
Why are you in the office?

324
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,800
Boss Fu asked me to do a work

325
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,040
for the motorbike team.

326
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,960
You have time for Boss Fu's work.

327
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,440
You don't have time for my work, right?

328
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,360
He gave you more money.

329
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,800
What do you want to talk about?

330
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,280
I can't make money

331
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,280
for that scoundrel.

332
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,800
You don't want to make money

333
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,760
because of WeChat?

334
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,360
Yes.

335
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,480
It doesn't matter

336
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,480
whether you make money or not.

337
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,280
It depends on whether you want it or not.

338
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,280
If you think WeChat is good,

339
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,040
you should go home.

340
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,880
And you have to believe

341
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,000
that with your ability,

342
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,680
you can't make money.

343
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,280
He's right.

344
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,880
Before I came to see you today,

345
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,680
I was going to go back to my home.

346
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,680
But I changed my mind now.

347
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,920
You have to continue your work.

348
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,560
It has nothing to do with you.

349
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,180
Not really,

350
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,560
I'm bored,

351
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,680
I don't want to travel.

352
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Then you should go home from now on.

353
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,360
See you.

354
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,840
Let's go home.

355
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,920
Let's go out of here.

356
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,060
I have friends living in Beijing now.

357
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,080
Great.

358
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,360
Ah held it in his mind,

359
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,920
now I want to see him.

360
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,320
I'll do it.

361
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,240
Chen Lu Zhou.

362
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,880
Do you like the wedding?

363
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,480
I spent money to ask you for a chat.

364
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,560
You're here for a small dinner.

365
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,960
Are you really going?

366
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,240
It's okay if it's not convenient.

367
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,640
I mainly want to see

368
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,640
what kind of fire you're in.

369
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,520
Remember to wear pants if you come.

370
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,160
When did you see me?

371
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,880
I didn't wear pants.

372
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,560
I mean,

373
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,520
don't wear a dress.

374
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,920
It doesn't look funny.

375
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,800
Just have some.

376
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,680
I promise.

377
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:57,760
Eat some.

378
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,360
You ordered it yourself.

379
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,720
Give you four fees.

380
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,080
But the match-making rice cake

381
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,840
Speaking of Studio Zhou,

382
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,420
how about getting a new page, Mr. He?

383
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,600
Leave it.

384
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,540
The perma-menace is doubt increasing.

385
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,480
It's so much pray

386
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:29,920
that me and Yingying

387
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,380
left for the whole day today.

388
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,400
I've never had anything good with her,

389
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,780
but we also had a degreaser.

390
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,620
Boys always have a big perma-menace,

391
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,980
yeah, some 000-menace�

392
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,980
broke out hot.

393
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,580
Thank you.

394
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,620
I'm hanging up.

395
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,700
Okay, let's go.

396
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,440
Outside the dragon's hands,

397
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,740
Wuatao can be taken to Facile.

398
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:19,820
Give me your certificate

399
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,740
Leave your certificate

400
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,700
No

401
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,100
Your Number

402
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,460
Love

403
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,780
Goodbye

404
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,740
Goodbye

405
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,860
Be Nash

406
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,340
A member in some kind of agency can win this power.

407
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,500
What are you thinking while the words are silent?

408
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,740
If one girlautomatically gives you a Ashley miej,

409
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,240
such things won't affect it.

410
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,220
What else does that mean?

411
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,660
It means we need to contact next time.

412
00:16:59,100 --> 00:16:59,800
Let me tell you

413
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,800
You have a reason to meet her next time?

414
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,680
Really?

415
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:05,960
No.

416
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,680
And she's not interested in you.

417
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,360
She's not a normal girl.

418
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:12,720
No.

419
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,680
Why not?

420
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,280
Anyway, she won't be angry at you

421
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,280
when you tease her.

422
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,520
Interesting.

423
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,120
That's just a fake image of the love of the girl.

424
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,120
Before you fall in love,

425
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,720
the girl's heart

426
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,320
is as big as the universe.

427
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,680
Anyway, no matter how you tease her,

428
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,880
she can be exposed.

429
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,440
After falling in love with you,

430
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,920
the girl's heart

431
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,280
is as small as the real one.

432
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,280
What if you reflect on yourself?

433
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,040
Reflect on myself?

434
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,080
What do you mean?

435
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,400
She treats you as her universe.

436
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,840
You fill her universe.

437
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,720
Her eyes will naturally be small.

438
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,320
I'm so jealous.

439
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,400
That is such a huge deal.

440
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,600
You should try it.

441
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:00,680
That's nothing.

442
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,440
Takes back what's in you.

443
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,680
That's nothing.

444
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,240
People are insatiable.

445
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,560
Oh.

446
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,880
You don't know her, right?

447
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,200
Judging by the behaviors,

448
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,240
for your ifs and讀ings,

449
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,760
you have never laid someone down who does not know.

450
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,800
No one's bad.

451
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,480
It's not like your martial arts or anything.

452
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,520
You hate me, So...

453
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,440
I was forced to go to the hospital.

454
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,640
He knows I'm going to see you tomorrow

455
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,840
and he wants to follow me.

456
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,160
Can I take him with me?

457
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,640
Jianing.

458
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,040
Can our photographer go with us?

459
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,400
You're so quick to save us, right?

460
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,600
Jianing.

461
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,200
How many times have I told you?

462
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,400
This rain is not welcoming me.

463
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,800
I think he's busy.

464
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,720
I'm not a robot.

465
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,720
You're far away from me.

466
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,720
Don't affect my training.

467
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,840
Can't you understand?

468
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,800
I'm sorry, Brother Yang.

469
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,840
You're going to ruin my car.

470
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,720
Yueyang.

471
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,920
Our team.

472
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,520
The car was good.

473
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,960
But we're in a difficult situation.

474
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,200
No one can take it.

475
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,480
Brother Yang, I'm really sorry.

476
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:29,800
I'm sorry.

477
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,080
Do you believe I ruined your car?

478
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,920
Don't, Brother Yang.

479
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,520
I...

480
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,800
What are you?

481
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,400
The car is your treasure.

482
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,880
The camera is also someone else's treasure.

483
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,000
What about you?

484
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,760
Who are you?

485
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,680
Thank you.

486
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,040
Want to buy a charger?

487
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,120
I'll do it for you.

488
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,480
Just for you.

489
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:54,880
Good job.

490
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:55,440
Good job.

491
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,120
Since you did that for him.

492
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,960
Hurry up.

493
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,120
Look at the camera.

494
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,280
Perfect.

495
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,120
Kalia, go and see it.

496
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,280
What do you want to see?

497
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,320
Nice.

498
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:15,800
Yes.

499
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,760
Good Highteam looks.

500
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,120
These jerks are so cool.

501
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,920
You're so handsome.

502
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,320
If it's not convenient,

503
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,720
forget it.

504
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,720
You can go ahead.

505
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,720
You're so handsome.

506
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,720
What are you doing?

507
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,920
I'm watching your friend.

508
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,720
Don't you say you've never watched it?

509
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,720
I'm going to send a video

510
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,720
to the YouTube channel.

511
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,120
But I don't know what to send.

512
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,520
So I want to find some inspiration in your friend's channel.

513
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,320
Xu Zhi,

514
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,520
not everything needs explanation.

515
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,920
Sometimes, it's windy,

516
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,120
flowers and trees are everywhere.

517
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,920
Who would say that?

518
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,520
I don't know.

519
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,520
But people are not plants.

520
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,720
They should know what they're talking about.

521
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,120
So they won't misunderstand.

522
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,520
Go to bed early.

523
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,720
If you come tomorrow,

524
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,720
I'll pick you up.

525
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,120
Good night.

526
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,520
Good night.

527
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,520
Dr. Chen,

528
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,720
long time no see.

529
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,320
Didn't I tell you to pick you up?

530
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,320
Why are you here?

531
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,320
I've troubled you enough.

532
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,520
We've given up on the探net plan.

533
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,720
We have time.

534
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,320
Right?

535
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,520
We'll come here ourselves.

536
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,520
You two?

537
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,320
And...

538
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:20,920
Hi.

539
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,520
I'd like to have some milk tea.

540
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,120
Thank you.

541
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,720
I'll have some milk tea.

542
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,320
Thank you.

543
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,920
Chen Luchou?

544
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:31,920
Wenjing.

545
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,920
It's me.

546
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,320
I'm Zhu Yangqi's classmate.

547
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,720
He always tells me to remind you.

548
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,720
This is the photographer

549
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,520
I told you about.

550
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,720
I didn't expect you to invite your friends.

551
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,320
You're so mean.

552
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,720
I've never seen you so excited.

553
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:48,720
No.

554
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,120
I think I'm going to be dizzy.

555
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,520
You're exaggerating.

556
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,120
I think he doesn't know you.

557
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,920
He recognized me.

558
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,520
Obviously, he's been a good boy to me.

559
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,120
I'll take you to the rest room.

560
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,720
So you're here.

561
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,120
Lu Yang is on the air.

562
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,120
No one is here.

563
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,720
What else do you want?

564
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,120
I have to take my friends to the rest room.

565
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,520
It's okay. Go to work.

566
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,120
Okay.

567
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,520
This is the thing you told me.

568
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,720
The paper.

569
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,920
Go to the rest room.

570
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,120
Let's go together.

571
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:25,720
Okay.

572
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,120
Zhu Yangqiang,

573
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,520
you want to go to the rest room?

574
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,720
I should have pushed you.

575
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,120
Get ready to eat.

576
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,720
Finally.

577
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,920
I'm starving.

578
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,920
Smells good.

579
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,520
Chen Luzhou,

580
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,520
aren't you going to go with us?

581
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
I think he's still filming.

582
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,320
Do you know what his college report is?

583
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,920
You're so close to him.

584
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,520
I'm not close to him.

585
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,320
Okay.

586
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,320
Thanks.

587
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,120
Chen Luzhou,

588
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,120
look.

589
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,120
We've been together for so long.

590
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,720
You're friends.

591
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,320
You're on WeChat.

592
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,320
This scenery is so incredible.

593
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,320
The main thing is that

594
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,320
if you're not embarrassed,

595
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,520
it's just others.

596
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,120
In the future,

597
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,120
we...

598
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,320
Since you two have WeChat,

599
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,520
we won't talk about it in the future.

600
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:46,520
Let's go.

601
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,520
Go buy me some clothes.

602
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,520
I can't move.

603
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,920
Come and eat.

604
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,560
Come on.

605
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:28,920
Thank you.

606
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,920
Are you going to shoot tonight?

607
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,920
No.

608
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,920
Then come back with us tomorrow.

609
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,920
You guys...

610
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,920
You guys go back first.

611
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,920
We still have a couple days to go.

612
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,920
Are you familiar with that room?

613
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,920
I'm not familiar with Zhu Yang.

614
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,920
Then why don't you have a grandpa?

615
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,920
I get it.

616
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,920
You're familiar with anyone, but not me.

617
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,920
You don't know Liu Xin Yu.

618
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,920
You don't know him either.

619
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,920
You're still familiar with where I work.

620
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,920
What do you think?

621
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,920
I think you're familiar with me.

622
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,920
Is it possible that I have no business with Feng Jin?

623
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,920
Is it because the flower sales we came out today

624
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,920
can be canceled?

625
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,920
Then you guys talk earlier.

626
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,920
You were angry at this just now.

627
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,920
I'm not angry.

628
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,920
You're quite angry.

629
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,920
You're always talking about the chopsticks.

630
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,920
You're like a bone in my bones.

631
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,920
I just think I'm a little bit heartless.

632
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,920
I just want to have a meal.

633
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,920
I just want to have a chat.

634
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,920
But you turned around and said we're not familiar.

635
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,920
Is that normal?

636
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,920
I told them we're not familiar.

637
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,920
I didn't mean anything else.

638
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,920
I just think

639
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,920
I don't know you very well.

640
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,920
What about you?

641
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,920
For example, Feng Jin said

642
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,920
your work is a magazine.

643
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,920
And the one you took was a comedy.

644
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,920
You were broadcasted by the TV station.

645
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,920
And...

646
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,920
You think

647
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,920
he thinks it's cool

648
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,920
but you don't know me.

649
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,920
What is the magazine for my work?

650
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,920
When I was seven or eight,

651
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,920
I went out of the house and got a newspaper.

652
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,920
The original film was broadcasted by the TV station.

653
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,920
My mother was on the radio station.

654
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,920
At that time,

655
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,920
their editor had a problem.

656
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,920
So she took my film and uploaded it.

657
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,920
By the way,

658
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,920
I'm shooting a scene with Zang Liyang.

659
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,920
Do you want to hear it?

660
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,920
How about I tell you a joke?

661
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,920
You want to talk to me?

662
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,920
It's fine.

663
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,920
Mr. Zhizong!

664
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,920
Come with me!

665
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,920
I have a good chance to make money.

666
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,920
Let's go.

667
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,920
Wait a minute.

668
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,920
Mr. Jiang!

669
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,920
Get ready!

670
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,920
This is the best.

671
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,920
There are too many.

672
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,920
Brother.

673
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,920
Jiang Hu is here.

674
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,920
Please pick up my sister for me.

675
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,920
Please.

676
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,920
Are you sure there are 5,000 prizes?

677
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,920
It's a good thing to miss this.

678
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,920
It's on the other person's head.

679
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,920
We want to sign it.

680
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,920
What did you do last night?

681
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,920
I played.

682
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,920
Sign it.

683
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,920
I was the first one to play with a female player.

684
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,920
What's wrong with a female player?

685
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,920
Patmos has been a male player for five years.

686
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,920
He won the Lali game.

687
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,920
It's fine.

688
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,920
If Mr. Zhizong

689
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,920
wins 5,000 yuan,

690
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,920
he will be more than we can think of.

691
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,920
I remind you.

692
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,920
Everyone can participate.

693
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,920
But if you don't win,

694
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,920
you won't have the chance to win.

695
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,920
It's fine.

696
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,920
You can participate.

697
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,920
What do you mean?

698
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,920
I won't sign it.

699
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,920
Is it still here?

700
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,920
Is it still here?

701
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,920
Yan Lunlin?

702
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,920
You are the one

703
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,920
Chen Luzhou sent to me?

704
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,920
I heard you call your brother

705
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,920
and thought you were ten years old.

706
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,920
I'm 17 years old.

707
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,920
I'm only ten years old.

708
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,920
Let's go.

709
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,920
Luzhou.

710
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,920
Can you help me with the bag?

711
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,920
I'll give you 500.

712
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,920
500?

713
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,920
Let's go.

714
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,920
So beautiful.

715
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,920
It's so hot.

716
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,920
Can you buy a ice cream

717
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,920
to help Luzhou?

718
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,920
I'm not your brother.

719
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,920
He's in the competition.

720
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,920
You are my brother's friend.

721
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,920
You are my brother.

722
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,920
No. We are not that close.

723
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,920
Here is the ice cream.

724
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,920
It's not a competition.

725
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,920
Why is it so hard to make money?

726
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,920
Chen Luzhou

727
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,920
is not good at looking at it.

728
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,920
He brought two girls to work.

729
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,920
Is he here to work

730
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,920
or to call his sister?

731
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,920
I can't stand it.

732
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,920
I'm taking a picture.

733
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,920
I can't see it.

734
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,920
It's not professional at all.

735
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,920
I'm rich and I feel so good.

736
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,920
I met the broken person

737
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,920
who was like a dead person

738
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,920
to him last time.

739
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,920
I'm telling you.

740
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,920
You

741
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,920
say it again

742
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,920
if you have the guts.

743
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,920
What's wrong?

744
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,920
Are you hurt?

745
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,920
It's raining.

746
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,920
Let's sing together.

747
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,920
Just you?

748
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,920
I don't want to

749
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,920
if you say it.

750
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,920
What do you want?

751
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,920
Won't you let me kiss you?

752
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,920
Sure.

753
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,920
No need to be so generous.

754
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,920
Didn't you take the first place?

755
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,920
Just give me the prize.

756
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,920
Are you sure you can win?

757
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,920
Don't be so surprised.

758
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,920
If you win,

759
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,920
we will be in the same boat.

760
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,920
I'll say it first.

761
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,920
Okay.

762
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,920
I have another condition.

763
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,920
What condition?

764
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,920
If you lose,

765
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,920
apologize to Chen Ruozhou.

766
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,920
Hello, I want a 4-year-old strawberry.

767
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,920
Okay.

768
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,920
Thank you.

769
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,920
Brother,

770
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,920
do you want chocolate

771
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,920
or strawberry?

772
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,920
It's okay.

773
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,920
I'll give you.

774
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,920
What's your attitude?

775
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,920
You are

776
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,920
soft-hearted.

777
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,920
Maybe

778
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,920
you should take me

779
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,920
to the WeChat account.

780
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,920
It's over.

781
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,920
It's over.

782
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,920
It's over.

783
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,920
Okay.

784
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,920
Brother,

785
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,920
you have 8 more.

786
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,920
He will pick the rest.

787
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,920
Okay.

788
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,920
8.

789
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,920
What can you sell for 8?

790
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,920
Hello.

791
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,920
Hello, where are you?

792
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,920
I got it.

793
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,920
I'll be back tonight.

794
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,920
Xu Zhi is about to go to the competition.

795
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,920
Come back soon.

796
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,920
Why is he going?

797
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,920
I don't know.

798
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,920
Why is he with Lv Yang?

799
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,920
He is a little bit lower than Lv Yang.

800
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,180
Eight armies are stronger

801
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,680
than a tough outlets in the village.

802
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,160
It's even less powerful trusted than an bloke.

803
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:16,840
Eight armies are stronger than

804
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,920
those without borders without laws

805
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,160
and systems of supremacy.

806
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,440
Eight armies are stronger

807
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,920
compared withobi.

808
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,880
I like a girl

809
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,500
and she is

810
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,880
a man

811
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,040
on poor terms.

812
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,420
Six我

813
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,640
can't help you.

814
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,920
Who is it?

815
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,920
She is a lover.

816
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,920
This girl is really extraordinary.

817
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:34,920
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

818
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:39,040
Oh, great My country

819
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:45,760
Do you still want to go a underground bridge, one at the end?

820
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,000
He is a reputable and w entitled monument

821
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,440
Beloved

822
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,440
Thank you

823
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,100
Thank you

824
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,320
Shang radiohner

825
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,740
I have turned back on R2.

826
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,420
I had to prove myself before it's too late to try it.

827
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,420
How could he not see it and misunderstanding to prove it?

828
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,380
That's what I didn't do to hurt someone's heart.

829
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,860
Why did you break the rule?

830
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,080
If here it's done along with it...

831
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,180
then it must be yours then.

832
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,760
Lu Yuqing is in an incredible lead.

833
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,680
If he didn't pass Edm victory...

834
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,000
soetuously and hard,

835
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,800
You win.

836
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,200
Well, if you will.

837
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,960
I'm happy to vote for him then.

838
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,960
Right?

839
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,400
The opponent let me win.

840
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,400
No wonder.

841
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,400
We were the best drivers at that time as I'm afraid.

842
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,400
Did you see that?

843
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,400
Lu Yang's entry was a big shot.

844
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,400
Xu Zhi's entry was a small shot.

845
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,400
And the transformation technology was very powerful.

846
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,400
He's now lagging behind,

847
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,400
so he might just not adapt to the race yet.

848
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,400
Maybe he's a bit nervous now.

849
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,400
If he goes back,

850
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,400
we'll still have a chance to overtake him.

851
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,520
Let's go!

852
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,720
I find that Xu Zhi He is smart

853
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,160
when because of his promise

854
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,720
is a lucky ?"

855
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,120
I'm afraid he will bully girls

856
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,780
so he给 Her a request

857
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,520
we get only one

858
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,700
thatулиan

859
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,160
than others

860
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,380
enough time

861
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,640
can helpcep 301

862
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,640
full of luck

863
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,640
thấy

864
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,800
This isit

865
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:46,500
This is because of Wang Yang

866
00:36:46,500 --> 00:37:01,080
Wang Yang

867
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,400
Come on!

868
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,400
Come on, get up.

869
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,400
Speed up.

870
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,400
Come on.

871
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,400
Next turn, you'll definitely pass Lüang.

872
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,400
It's too late. Lüang is doomed this time.

873
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,400
Lüang is doomed.

874
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,400
What's going on?

875
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,400
Come on!

876
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,400
Jin Ze!

877
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,400
Hurry up and take a look here.

878
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,400
Hurry up.

879
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,400
Hurry up.

880
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,400
Xue Zhi!

881
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,400
Are you okay?

882
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,400
I'm fine. I'm a little bit dizzy.

883
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,400
Move aside.

884
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,400
Give it to me.

885
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,400
Come on.

886
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,400
Come on.

887
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,620
Who'd wronged how I aquí

888
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:06,280
Everyone is home in a different place now,

889
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,720
we can see how trustees work,

890
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,880
and luncheoners work in line.

891
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,680
Won't they feel like they've left for the inspection?

892
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,520
Well, there's a weakness

893
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,160
in Tuesday's meeting.

894
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,000
Or is it...

895
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I'm not afraid of you.

896
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I'm not afraid of you.

897
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I'm not afraid of you.

898
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I'm not afraid of you.

899
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I'm not afraid of you.

900
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I'm not afraid of you.

901
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I'm not afraid of you.

902
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I'm not afraid of you.

903
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I'm not afraid of you.

904
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I'm not afraid of you.

905
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I'm not afraid of you.

906
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I'm not afraid of you.

907
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I'm not afraid of you.

908
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I'm not afraid of you.

909
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Please push me to the end of the world.

910
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Please sacrifice me.

911
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
The future is moving.

912
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Because you are the wind.

913
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Loneliness is singing.

914
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,000
In the dark night, the heart does not stop.

915
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
We are not hurt.

916
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I want to be with you.

917
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I'm not afraid of you.

918
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I'm not afraid of you.

919
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
The future is moving.

920
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Because you are the wind.

921
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Only when I Chile지는 I can express my anguish to the world.

922
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:04,000
You impossible only remember to let go.

923
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:10,000
And I regret.

924
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
When you had tears in your eyes,

925
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I saw myself.

926
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,900
invulnerate you
