1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,400
Falling my heart

2
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,200
The world is burning hot

3
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,800
The smile is echoing in the distance

4
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,200
The pain is so heavy

5
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,200
Falling my heart

6
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,800
If tears fall

7
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,200
Let the city's scenery stay in memory

8
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,400
The sea stands beside each other

9
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,400
Run

10
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,400
Crush

11
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,800
So you like him?

12
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,200
Good

13
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,200
Get up

14
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,200
Brother, is this an average?

15
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,200
The car that caused the enemy to lose

16
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,200
And the car that was not in the car

17
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,200
The name of the car that was left to fall

18
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,200
It's effective

19
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,200
So so

20
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,200
Miss, you win

21
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
I'm sorry

22
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,200
I'll sign it

23
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,200
In order to be so good at it

24
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
And so smart

25
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
That's 5000 yuan

26
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,200
It's been many times since you came back to Qingying with me

27
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
I'm serious

28
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
Be serious

29
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,200
Thank you

30
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,200
Why are you here?

31
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
You've been looking for me for a long time

32
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,200
What's wrong?

33
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,200
Brother Lu Zhou

34
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,200
This is for you

35
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,200
Okay

36
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,200
I won't bother him

37
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,200
I'll go

38
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
Okay

39
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,200
I won't bother him

40
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,200
Yan Le Tong's sister said she wants ice cream

41
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,200
I just bought you one

42
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,200
I bought you one on the way

43
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,200
Brother Lu Zhou is familiar with anyone

44
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200
His ice cream is eight pieces

45
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
Your 80

46
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,200
Who do you think I'm more familiar with?

47
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,200
Your standard of whether you are familiar with it

48
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,200
So simple and simple

49
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,200
We use money to make ice cream

50
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
Isn't it just right?

51
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,200
If I give you 5000

52
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,200
Let you sign it now

53
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,200
Will you agree?

54
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,200
But since one second

55
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,200
It's disrespectful to 5000

56
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,200
Four leaves

57
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,200
Eat

58
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,200
I'll go back

59
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,200
I won't eat

60
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,200
I'm leaving

61
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,200
Oh, right

62
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,200
You still owe me a joke

63
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,200
I'm going down

64
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,200
I'm going down

65
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
Didn't you go back to the hotel?

66
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,200
I have something to do

67
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,200
I have to go back to Qing Yi tonight

68
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,200
So I came to you

69
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
to drink

70
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,200
Is there anything?

71
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,200
Sorry

72
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
What?

73
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,200
Sorry

74
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,200
You're awake?

75
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,200
Did you sleep well?

76
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
You're awake

77
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,200
What's the situation?

78
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
Xu Zhi didn't tell you?

79
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,200
When you went out to pick up people

80
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,200
This woman said you were bad

81
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
She caught us

82
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,200
She said you were crazy and crazy

83
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,200
She even took a girl to the scene

84
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,200
She didn't know if it was work or a meeting

85
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,200
She said you were good at photography

86
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
Xu Zhi couldn't stop

87
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
She had to compete with him

88
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,200
If she lost

89
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
She would pay the bonus

90
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,200
There's another condition

91
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
What condition?

92
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,200
If she lost

93
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,200
I'll apologize to Chen Lu Zhuo

94
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,200
I can't stand it anymore

95
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
I have to go

96
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,200
I'll go to the toilet

97
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
I'll wait for you here

98
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,200
Hello

99
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,200
Did you get the water?

100
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,200
No

101
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,200
Why did you stop?

102
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
You must be drunk

103
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
I'll help you

104
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,200
How do you know it's raining?

105
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
Didn't you say it?

106
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,200
I won't stop

107
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,200
I'll go to the toilet

108
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,200
I'll go to the toilet

109
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,200
Oh, right

110
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
I just apologized to you

111
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
Don't think too much

112
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,200
Apologizing is a burn

113
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,200
As long as you want to earn her bonus

114
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
Okay

115
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Whatever you say

116
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Lv Yang

117
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,200
Just got a temper

118
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
I guess today

119
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,200
I lost to Xu Zhi in front of so many people

120
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,200
I can't fight him

121
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,200
But he's been self-protected for a while

122
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
I heard you said

123
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,200
Xu Zhi doesn't like getting a temper

124
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,200
He thought it was a soft girl

125
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,200
But today

126
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,200
He's so violent

127
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,200
He's trying to get me out

128
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,200
Brother, your shoes are too clean

129
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,200
You didn't even put on a white pants

130
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,200
What do you mean?

131
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,200
I'll record a sound

132
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,200
I'll pass it to you

133
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,200
You have to write a letter in black

134
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
No need to be so polite

135
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
Tea

136
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
Thats when you asked me

137
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,200
I possibly answered

138
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,200
If I really harded for him

139
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
Then I would have been more blow up

140
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,200
If the river in the world is dry,

141
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
I'll melt the ice with my tears.

142
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
If the sun doesn't rise,

143
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
I'll try to light up all the lights.

144
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
The moon or the clouds are fine.

145
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,200
I'll be by your side forever.

146
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
I'll be by your side forever.

147
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,200
I'll be by your side forever.

148
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,200
I'll be by your side forever.

149
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,200
I'll be by your side forever.

150
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
I'll be by your side forever.

151
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
I have a backup.

152
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,200
But what did you write in the last sentence?

153
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,200
How did you withdraw it?

154
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,200
I withdraw it casually.

155
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
It has nothing to do with you.

156
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,200
I'll be by your side forever.

157
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,200
I will be by your side forever.

158
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
I have a backup.

159
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
Be by your side forever.

160
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,200
I'll be by your side forever.

161
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,620
That's why Amitabha's drama is called

162
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,980
Yu Kun Hui arranged

163
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:54,680
everyone's

164
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,080
with whom

165
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,920
I find that

166
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,360
Qu Guang

167
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,300
She will die

168
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,820
your friend

169
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,620
Yu Kun's

170
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,340
Brother, you're so lucky.

171
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,700
This is the first time

172
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,140
I've ever seen a player

173
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,260
with a thousand-meter-long goal.

174
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,060
It'll be worth it.

175
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:21,900
I'm leaving.

176
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,060
Yan Le Tong,

177
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,700
you don't care about me, do you?

178
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,700
Hurry up.

179
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,500
Brother Lu Zhou, bye.

180
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,620
The End

181
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,860
If I'm strong enough,

182
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,540
I'll build a more solid foundation.

183
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,980
If the rivers in the world are dry,

184
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,740
I'll use the face-to-face melting ice.

185
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,700
If the sun no longer rises,

186
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,140
I'll try to light up all the lights.

187
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,500
Yuan Su Jun,

188
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,340
you have such a big head.

189
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,220
Can't you see?

190
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,540
I come back to give you

191
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:20,440
a new

value of you could you call me

194
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,420
I can't see

195
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,960
the ambient

196
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,500
kiln

197
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,660
yeah

198
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:30,840
Do things

199
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,200
have

200
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,340
thought

201
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,420
that no matter what

202
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,660
I can't see

203
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,180
the late you can see

204
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,460
a new

205
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,960
Come here.

206
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,300
Give me some.

207
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:54,260
This is yours,

208
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,140
do no harm.

209
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,780
That's better.

210
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,940
Full of resistance.

211
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,300
How did Feng Jin come here?

212
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,100
Lin Shi?

213
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,900
Lucy is also in Lin Shi?

214
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,220
You're trying to encourage me, right?

215
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,740
Don't think too much.

216
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,900
Lin Xin.

217
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,580
I heard you went to the hotel in the city.

218
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,580
So it's real.

219
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,140
Hello, I'm in the house.

220
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,420
Hello, sir.

221
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,420
Is your room booked enough?

222
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,700
Wait a minute.

223
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,900
You live here, too?

224
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,580
Yes.

225
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,380
I'm going to the back of the car.

226
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:13,780
Go out.

227
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,140
Yes.

228
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,820
Ying Ying has eaten too much last night.

229
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,580
I'll buy her some snacks.

230
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,820
How's your leg?

231
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,020
Much better.

232
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,820
It doesn't hurt anymore.

233
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,060
It's just a little bit weak.

234
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,620
Why don't you come with me?

235
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,580
I have a small piece in my bag.

236
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,740
I'll give you something.

237
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,740
Okay.

238
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,180
You go first.

239
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,460
Okay.

240
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,460
Here.

241
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,460
Thank you.

242
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,460
And this.

243
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,220
The silver coin I gave you.

244
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,460
It's said that it was brought by your Chinese-style technique.

245
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,460
This is...

246
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,860
He asked me to transfer you.

247
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,460
This is the signature of the future champion of the big team.

248
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,460
Okay.

249
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,220
In this kind of training,

250
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,460
you've finally found the opponent.

251
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,460
You have nothing else to say?

252
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,860
What?

253
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,860
You've already said it.

254
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,460
Forget it.

255
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,060
And this.

256
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,460
You have to remember to stick to the plan

257
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,860
when you buy it.

258
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,460
Thank you.

259
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,860
You want to transfer me again?

260
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,460
If you keep mentioning it,

261
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,460
you'll think I don't know you.

262
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,860
Why are you angry again?

263
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,860
You're getting old and easy to get married.

264
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,460
Then don't be angry with me.

265
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,860
Can you think about others' feelings?

266
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,260
I brought you here today.

267
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,060
What if something happens to you and Li Yang's car?

268
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,060
How can I explain it to your father and the boss?

269
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,660
You're talking about this?

270
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,260
Then you don't have to worry about it.

271
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,060
If my father knows that I'm playing car and driving,

272
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,060
he'll feel really alive

273
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,860
and then take me to his hospital.

274
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,860
Then you don't have to worry about your father and the boss.

275
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,260
Like a car,

276
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,860
he's the one who's the most professional in his eyes.

277
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,860
You've been over it?

278
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,260
Yes.

279
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,860
When he took me to the practice ground,

280
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,660
I didn't have enough strength to play the role.

281
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,060
I fell down.

282
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,460
Luckily, I didn't have a big problem.

283
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,660
But I fell to the knees.

284
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,660
The key point is,

285
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,660
you'll feel really bad in the rainy day.

286
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,060
And you'll be in a bad mood.

287
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,460
So I hate going out in the rainy day.

288
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,060
I'll listen to you.

289
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,860
You're still proud of yourself, aren't you?

290
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,060
No.

291
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,660
The old people say that

292
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,260
there's a good fortune in the future.

293
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,660
I'm just a dead man.

294
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,660
I'll be in a bad mood.

295
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,260
You're still angry.

296
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,460
How about

297
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,660
I sign you a smile

298
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,660
and you two smile together?

299
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,660
How is it?

300
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,060
Do you remember?

301
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,460
Of course.

302
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,060
Let me tell you something.

303
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,060
Okay.

304
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,060
It's not a joke.

305
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,660
It's fresh.

306
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,860
I can also tell you something.

307
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,660
My father came to a handsome man two days ago.

308
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,260
He said he was really handsome,

309
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,260
but he was not good at it.

310
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,060
But he insisted.

311
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,860
But he couldn't even do a test.

312
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,260
My father said that young people like him

313
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,460
are good at cooking, smoking, drinking.

314
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,060
They're not good at keeping their cells in order.

315
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,460
That's scary.

316
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,860
Are you a doctor?

317
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,060
Your name is Chen Luzhou?

318
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,860
Where are you going?

319
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,660
Are you thirsty?

320
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,860
No.

321
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,060
What did your father say?

322
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,460
What did he say?

323
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,460
He said

324
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,860
you must bring him here to check on your boyfriend.

325
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,460
What's wrong?

326
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,660
Why are you so nervous?

327
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,660
I think you're quite free.

328
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,260
You shouldn't be in this situation.

329
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,060
Of course I'm not in this situation.

330
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,860
Okay.

331
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,660
Thank you.

332
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,860
Don't I look like a bad guy?

333
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,660
Let me change my name.

334
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,660
No need.

335
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,860
You look like a good guy. Thank you.

336
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,860
I'm sorry.

337
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,860
I know you.

338
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,260
Be careful.

339
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,660
Forget about the injury.

340
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,060
You're like a person from Lyu Yang.

341
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,060
What if you get caught up in trouble?

342
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,260
Then you should look for a bodyguard.

343
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,060
Remember to send so many security guards.

344
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,260
Who is it?

345
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,460
I don't know.

346
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,220
Okay,パ Dy.

347
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,260
Please take care of me and everyone else.

348
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,100
happy

349
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,120
Can you tell me the room that Xu Xiao come to according to the law

350
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,780
C L C

351
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,840
Hello, we can't move our guests

352
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,580
I just started

353
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,940
Zhen Sheng, you can help me to contact your tour guide

354
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,540
Ying Ying

355
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,980
Zhou Shangxin, why are you over here?

356
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,140
One of you guys are all coming to Linsheng

357
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:21,780
I can't come

358
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,860
I'm here to looking for Lucy

359
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:23,740
Lucy …

360
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,600
Xu Xiao

361
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,780
He also lives here

362
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,300
Yeah, he has just moved in

363
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,840
But I've been calling him for half an hour

364
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,620
I don't answer

365
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,460
Gu Yan?

366
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,580
Why are you here?

367
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,500
Something happened to Cheng Le Zhou.

368
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,900
What happened?

369
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,580
Look.

370
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,260
Let's go there first.

371
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,100
Okay.

372
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,500
I've explained.

373
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,140
My room is set up by a car.

374
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,620
The previous question was if I was in the group.

375
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,540
I thought it was the car's design team.

376
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,420
It's quite similar to what happened.

377
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,100
I'm not being honest, am I?

378
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,700
Do you believe I'm warning you?

379
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:59,580
Mr. X now-

380
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,300
It's a misunderstanding.

381
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,020
Xiao Mi Xing.

382
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,100
She is my classmate.

383
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,100
She just finish the exam.

384
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,740
She's not a dog稱.

385
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:18,900
But are highly Tagged

386
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,100
Had a secret ?

387
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,300
What...

388
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,060
My parents迈 believed that

389
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,540
Comrade Bao An is too shy to work.

390
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,860
I'm sorry, Mr. Cheng.

391
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:27,740
I'm sorry.

392
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,180
It's okay.

393
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,100
We're all ourselves.

394
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:31,980
I'm sorry.

395
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,820
Let's have dinner together next time.

396
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:35,980
Thank you.

397
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,500
You can rest in Cheng Ru Zhou.

398
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,460
I'm here to help him.

399
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,620
Why is he so kind?

400
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,260
Then

401
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,940
let's go buy some drinks.

402
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:52,700
Let's chat.

403
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,220
Let's chat.

404
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,940
What's the relationship between Gu Yan and Cheng Ru Zhou?

405
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,980
He's a king.

406
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,220
You know him.

407
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,420
He's a big fan of her.

408
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,420
He's crazy.

409
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,580
Do you have a girlfriend?

410
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:13,700
No.

411
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,300
I miss you so much.

412
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,940
Are you still mad at me?

413
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,380
Cheng Ru Zhou,

414
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,820
I really like you.

415
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,220
He's not my girlfriend.

416
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,540
So he is.

417
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,300
Cheng Ru Zhou is so true.

418
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,820
He's a man of the art.

419
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,060
Don't say that.

420
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,620
Everyone likes him.

421
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,100
Lucy is the only one in our family.

422
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:40,540
Mr. Cheng,

423
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,980
you should give him 100 stars.

424
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,140
I'm not worried.

425
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,940
It's okay to be with me.

426
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,340
If he hears Lucy,

427
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,340
he'll break the law.

428
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:00,900
Lucy.

429
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:04,780
Where's Gu Yan?

430
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,780
He went back to the factory.

431
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,460
No one drank the milk tea he bought.

432
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,580
Then drink it.

433
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,300
Don't waste it.

434
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,540
You bought it for him?

435
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,460
Yes.

436
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,100
He did something for us.

437
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,060
We shouldn't

438
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,980
show him anything.

439
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,060
You're so generous.

440
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,060
Well,

441
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,620
how about we go to eat hot pot tomorrow?

442
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,420
Tomorrow?

443
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,020
No.

444
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,540
I'll go with Mr. Zhi to visit him.

445
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,140
We'll be out of the shop

446
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,740
and we'll have to find a place to stay.

447
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,860
And we're going to get married soon.

448
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,820
There's a male nurse nearby.

449
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,500
She's very smart.

450
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,060
Do you want to go with her?

451
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,620
I'm still editing.

452
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:45,860
Forget it.

453
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,580
We'll meet again when we get back.

454
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,420
Why is he another male nurse?

455
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,020
I don't know.

456
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,100
Let's go.

457
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,300
I'm so happy.

458
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:21,900
I'm so happy.

459
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,500
I'm so happy.

460
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,460
I'm so happy.

461
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,300
I'm so happy.

462
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:24,820
I'm so happy.

463
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,460
I'm so happy.

464
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,060
I'm so happy.

465
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:26,540
I'm so happy.

466
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:34,860
I helped you.

467
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,460
How can you thank me?

468
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,500
When you get back,

469
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:39,980
let Xu Zhi

470
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,780
treat you to a meal.

471
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,340
Xu Zhi?

472
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,140
The girl just now?

473
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,860
You must call her.

474
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,740
You can't call us two.

475
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:50,900
No.

476
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,300
Why?

477
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:53,940
You helped us.

478
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,500
Of course we have to pay you back.

479
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,500
So you like her?

480
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:03,700
I get it.

481
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,620
Does she like you?

482
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,500
It has nothing to do with you.

483
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:23,100
I feel good together with them.

484
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:35,700
Dad.

485
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,300
You're back.

486
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,220
So fragrant!

487
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,820
What's the profit?

488
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,740
Their sweet taste.

489
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,100
Are you tired?

490
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,300
What do you think?

491
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,100
Congratulations, Mr. Xu.

492
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,780
You failed your career and came back with a murder.

493
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,020
Who is so good-for-nothing?

494
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,500
I'm encouraging you.

495
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,140
You're only 18 years old, right?

496
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,820
The road ahead is long.

497
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,980
Now that you've failed,

498
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,620
you're about to succeed.

499
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,660
Who's so good?

500
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,100
He can walk on the road.

501
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,380
Finally, you know that people are hungry.

502
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,580
Big brother.

503
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,140
The driver Pei,

504
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,100
there's an incident coming.

505
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,260
Old Zheng,

506
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,300
what happened?

507
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,820
What's the matter?

508
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,900
Something happened.

509
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,420
Say it!

510
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,660
If by accident

511
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,420
Songz cave camp is closed,

512
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,460
fireworks probably happen.

513
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,620
If it's related to

514
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,460
Chen Ji with the enemy,

515
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,460
Come on.

516
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,460
Sit down.

517
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,460
Sit down.

518
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,460
Thank you.

519
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,460
You're welcome.

520
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,460
Come on.

521
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,460
Brother.

522
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,460
Another two.

523
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,460
One more.

524
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,460
You two.

525
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,460
Two gentlemen.

526
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,460
You're not going to work, are you?

527
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,460
You drink so much.

528
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,460
No, I'm only six.

529
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,460
Okay, okay.

530
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,460
Be careful.

531
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,460
I'll call you later.

532
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,460
No problem.

533
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,460
You know what?

534
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,460
Chen Luzhong is a dog.

535
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,460
Is he human?

536
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,460
No matter if he's human,

537
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,460
I'll ask him first.

538
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,460
What does your boss say?

539
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,460
He says

540
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,460
he's a man of will.

541
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,460
No matter if he's a man of will

542
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,460
or not,

543
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,460
he's still young,

544
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,460
isn't he?

545
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,460
Be a little bit younger.

546
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,460
So?

547
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,460
I...

548
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,460
I...

549
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,460
I took the knife with me.

550
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,460
Did he go to the forest with you?

551
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,460
Why did you hide it from me?

552
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,460
No.

553
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,460
It was Fu Shu who introduced

554
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,460
a car team to shoot.

555
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,460
He was in the forest.

556
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,460
If you don't believe me,

557
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,460
go ask Fu Shu.

558
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,460
Don't mention me.

559
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,460
Say that.

560
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,460
That thing about Guan Yin.

561
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,460
It's like this.

562
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,460
Isn't it about time?

563
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,460
Yingying and I want to go shopping.

564
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,460
Chen Luzhou is so straightforward.

565
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,460
He's just next to me.

566
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,460
We'll go.

567
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,460
The thing is,

568
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,460
there's a Songzi Guan Yin in it.

569
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,460
It's a big mess.

570
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,460
It's that simple?

571
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,460
Yes.

572
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,460
Nothing more?

573
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,460
Anything else?

574
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,460
Nothing.

575
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,460
That's good.

576
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,460
Tell me.

577
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,460
Is Chen Luzhou

578
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,460
really that person?

579
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,460
I'm a little bit

580
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,460
short on your big and strong spirit.

581
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,460
You're making me so anxious.

582
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,460
Fine.

583
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,460
It's not that great.

584
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,460
Anyway,

585
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:50,460
is it what we think?

586
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,460
Of course not.

587
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,460
If it's what you think,

588
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,460
I can let it go.

589
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,460
That's enough.

590
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,460
Here.

591
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,460
Our Mr. Zhi has told me

592
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,460
that he's not talking.

593
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,460
Now, I asked him

594
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,460
what Chen Luzhou is doing.

595
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,460
He's just going to tell me a story.

596
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,460
No.

597
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,460
No.

598
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,460
No.

599
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,460
It must be a cat.

600
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,460
If it's really good,

601
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,460
you should have done this earlier.

602
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,460
The recipe.

603
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:25,460
If they really talk about it,

604
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,460
then it's a talk.

605
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,460
If Chen Luzhou

606
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:33,460
wants to bully our Mr. Zhi,

607
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,460
I'll help him.

608
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,460
You have the ability.

609
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,460
I'm not afraid of him.

610
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,460
He's young.

611
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,460
He's so good at physical training.

612
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,460
Dr. Shi.

613
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,460
I...

614
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,460
I have no problem

615
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,460
with all the instructions.

616
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,460
It's good that you're fine.

617
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,460
But it doesn't mean

618
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,460
that you can promise me.

619
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,460
Don't let your youth

620
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,460
be forgotten.

621
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,460
You have to do your job.

622
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,460
You should know that.

623
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,460
You still have to...

624
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,460
I'm still a man.

625
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,460
What nonsense are you talking about?

626
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,460
I'm asking you.

627
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,460
Let's stop here today.

628
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,460
You can leave.

629
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,460
Okay.

630
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,460
Don't move.

631
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,460
Let me show you something.

632
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,460
Is it yours?

633
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,460
How old are you?

634
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,460
Just like a doctor sending red packets.

635
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,460
What's this?

636
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,460
This is Zhi Luo Luo's meeting.

637
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,460
Sorry, Dr. Xu.

638
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,460
I didn't do it again.

639
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,460
You still want to do it again?

640
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,460
Go out.

641
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,460
Go to the fifth floor.

642
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,460
Remember to close the office.

643
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,460
Take the red packet.

644
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,460
Goodbye, Dr. Xu.

645
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,460
Not a god.

646
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,460
Or not a god?

647
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,460
How is it?

648
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,460
Is it as powerful as

649
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,460
the image of you in front of Dr. Xu?

650
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,460
If you don't help me,

651
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,460
I can get better.

652
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,460
I told you not to give me the red packet.

653
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,460
I...

654
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,460
I thought he was going to give you the red packet.

655
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,460
No, no.

656
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,460
I'll explain.

657
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,460
Okay.

658
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,460
Don't go.

659
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,460
It's getting dark.

660
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,460
Xu Zhi.

661
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,460
Do you know what's going on?

662
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,460
You should know.

663
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,460
He's been contacting me recently.

664
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,460
Did he contact you?

665
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,460
No.

666
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,460
Did you provoke him?

667
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,460
How come he doesn't even know

668
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,460
how to use his friends' rings?

669
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,460
Wait a minute.

670
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,460
Hello?

671
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,460
Are you playing basketball?

672
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,460
No, I'm injured.

673
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,460
I can't play anymore.

674
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,460
Give me the red packet.

675
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,460
You're still playing?

676
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,460
You're not in the mood to win.

677
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,460
Dr. Xu said

678
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,460
he'll have to do a re-exam next month.

679
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,460
He's not training.

680
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,460
How can they say that?

681
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,460
I'm just trying to persuade you.

682
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,460
If you talk to someone,

683
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,460
you should be more careful.

684
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:17,460
Don't let the patient think too much.

685
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,460
That day,

686
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,460
I was wrong.

687
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,460
But I thought it all out

688
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,460
at that time.

689
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,460
It was our CEO.

690
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,460
So I asked him

691
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,460
what time to do it.

692
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,460
I understand.

693
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,460
What?

694
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,460
You...

695
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,460
Ask your niece.

696
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,460
What did they do?

697
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,460
They said their family was doing business.

698
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,460
What kind of girl?

699
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,460
They even drank my tea.

700
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,460
What's wrong?

701
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,460
You still want to talk to her?

702
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,460
No, I mean

703
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,460
what if you misunderstand them?

704
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,460
What if they're a good guy?

705
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,460
Red packet is indeed a misunderstanding.

706
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,460
But I have to investigate other things.

707
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,460
For example,

708
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,460
from the beginning to the end,

709
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,460
you have to come here.

710
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,460
You have to be a healthy person.

711
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,460
How about this?

712
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,460
After you check his men's paper,

713
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,460
you can send it to me.

714
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,460
I'll check

715
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,460
the eye-catching paper.

716
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,460
Eye-catching is definitely not a problem.

717
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,460
It must be that

718
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,460
our CEO

719
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,460
is the one who looks like him.

720
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,460
His eyes

721
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,460
are definitely not a problem.

722
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,460
In the future,

723
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,460
you can change some good tea.

724
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,460
I'll leave it to you.

725
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,460
Then give me some.

726
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,460
Let's have dinner together later.

727
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,460
Is it bad?

728
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,460
Let's go.

729
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,460
Let's go.

730
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,460
Come on.

731
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,460
Come on.

732
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,460
Who is this?

733
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,460
Who has seen him?

734
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,460
He's a newbie.

735
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,460
I'll take care of him.

736
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,460
Don't be too serious.

737
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,460
Come on.

738
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,460
Come on.

739
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,460
Come on.

740
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,460
Come on.

741
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,460
You're so strong.

742
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,460
You're a good boy.

743
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,460
You're a good boy.

744
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,460
You're a good boy.

745
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,460
Come on.

746
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,460
Come on.

747
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,460
Good ball.

748
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,460
Good ball.

749
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,460
Why are you so strong?

750
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,460
Just hit it well.

751
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,460
You hit it well.

752
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,460
You didn't let me keep it.

753
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,460
Now the situation has changed.

754
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,460
This sand

755
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,460
is not a rub.

756
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,460
You're here to do the Kangpu training.

757
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,460
You hit it and you still give it to the two-hand man.

758
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,460
I'll beat you to death.

759
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,460
Kangshan Fu.

760
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,460
You didn't kick me out.

761
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,460
Kick who?

762
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,460
Xu Zhi?

763
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,460
He has to give you a chance.

764
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,460
You're trying to be cool, right?

765
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,460
I won't play the main team.

766
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,460
We'll play the team four to two.

767
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,460
No.

768
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,460
You hit it well.

769
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,460
You hit it well.

770
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,460
I'll tell you where Xu Zhi is.

771
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,460
Don't be too excited.

772
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,460
Tian Xiaozhu.

773
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,460
Let's go.

774
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,460
We're off.

775
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,460
Good ball.

776
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,460
Good ball.

777
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,460
Good ball.

778
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,460
It's fine.

779
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,460
Good ball.

780
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,460
You hit it well.

781
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,460
It's fine.

782
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,460
Good ball.

783
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,460
Good ball.

784
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,460
Good ball.

785
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,460
I'm going to help you.

786
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,460
Wait, wait.

787
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,460
Hurry up.

788
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,460
What's going on?

789
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,460
Didn't you say you were going to score a 2?

790
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,460
Don't be so hasty.

791
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,460
No way.

792
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,460
So you're going to score a 8?

793
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,460
Yes.

794
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,460
I'm going to help you.

795
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,460
Lu Xi, start the ball.

796
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,460
Red ball.

797
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,460
Red ball.

798
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,460
Red ball.

799
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,460
Red ball.

800
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,460
Thank you.

801
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,460
Are you okay?

802
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,460
Are you okay?

803
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,460
Are you okay?

804
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,460
Do you want to play the devil?

805
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,460
We didn't score a goal, Miss Xiao.

806
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,460
Do you want to play the devil?

807
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,460
We've been playing for several days.

808
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,460
There are no guests.

809
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,460
Can we really score a goal like this?

810
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,460
I don't know.

811
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,460
But at least we've scored a 3.

812
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,460
We don't need to lie to others.

813
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,460
But we can't score a goal

814
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,460
with 5 or 10.

815
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,460
When can we

816
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,460
achieve freedom of interest?

817
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,460
I think

818
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,460
we should achieve freedom of milk tea first.

819
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,460
How about we learn photography?

820
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,460
Maybe we can make money

821
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,460
just like Chen Luzhu.

822
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,460
Don't you think photography

823
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,460
is so powerful?

824
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,460
We can't buy

825
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,460
a camera

826
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,460
before we're under pressure.

827
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,460
I'll be a good model.

828
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,460
What's Chen doing recently?

829
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,460
He's probably

830
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,460
working on the details

831
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,460
of the country.

832
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,460
I saw the comments

833
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,460
from your friends.

834
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,460
You didn't reply to them.

835
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,460
Who told him

836
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,460
to ask me to pay for the son-in-law?

837
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,460
I need to thank him.

838
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,460
Mr. Zheng, I'll go get the milk tea.

839
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,460
Help me drive it.

840
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,460
Look at this.

841
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,460
Look.

842
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,460
Life is like a flower.

843
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,460
No one can say

844
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,460
it needs roses.

845
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,460
It can be taught by yourself.

846
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,460
So,

847
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,460
as long as the goal is achieved,

848
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,460
we'll be

849
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,460
a happy family

850
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,460
when you finish your job.

851
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,460
Okay.

852
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,460
He's a rose seed.

853
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,460
He doesn't grow roses.

854
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,460
What does he grow?

855
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,460
I'm telling you,

856
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,460
can you be more logical?

857
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,460
What are you talking about?

858
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,460
What am I talking about?

859
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,460
I'm telling you,

860
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,460
can you be more logical?

861
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,460
Tell me,

862
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,460
how many roses have you come to pick?

863
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,460
Every time,

864
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,460
you bring different girls.

865
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,460
You're a rose seed.

866
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,460
You're a rose seed.

867
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,460
I'll have them

868
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,460
be your wife.

869
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,460
You can look at them.

870
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,460
No, listen to me.

871
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,460
Ke Yi.

872
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,460
What do you mean?

873
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,460
Can you take your blanket?

874
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,460
Who are you?

875
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,460
What does it have to do with you?

876
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,460
I'm doing business with him.

877
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,460
What does it have to do with me?

878
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,460
Brother,

879
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,460
this is a fake shop.

880
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,460
What's wrong?

881
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,460
I don't allow you to be in love.

882
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,460
Sit down.

883
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,460
Iron snake,

884
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,460
spider snake,

885
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,460
and green giant.

886
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,460
Let's go.

887
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,460
We'll call you when we're done.

888
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,460
Let's go.

889
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,460
Let's go.

890
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,460
It'll be good to wait for you tonight.

891
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,460
You really...

892
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,460
You really do it?

893
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,460
Isn't this your dream?

894
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,460
Why do you feel

895
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,460
like you're a little bit jealous?

896
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,460
No.

897
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,460
Just let me do it.

898
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,460
I haven't done it yet.

899
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,460
I have only one.

900
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,460
Do you want to pay?

901
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,460
And this.

902
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,460
This is beautiful.

903
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,460
A woman is wearing a jacket

904
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,460
for a man's face.

905
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,460
She's even wearing a jacket

906
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,460
to make a man feel ashamed.

907
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,460
Who wrote this?

908
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,460
I've seen Yun Geng.

909
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,460
That girl, Zheng Long,

910
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,460
is going to participate in the competition.

911
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,460
She has nothing to do

912
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,460
with her boyfriend.

913
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,460
What do you mean by writing it?

914
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,460
To make her feel ashamed?

915
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,460
I'm sorry, Hui.

916
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,460
What time is it now?

917
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,460
Don't write anything about girls.

918
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,460
Everything you did

919
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,460
is for men.

920
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,460
I brought you here today

921
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,460
for what?

922
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,460
Just to let your junior

923
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,460
come with me.

924
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,460
Just to let you

925
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,460
investigate the junior.

926
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,460
There are many cases and news.

927
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,460
They're all born

928
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,460
in the lives of people.

929
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,460
I'm sorry.

930
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,460
Is your mom busy?

931
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,460
You still want to see my mom, right?

932
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,460
Can't I?

933
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,460
Sure.

934
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,460
But my girlfriend

935
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,460
is not allowed to see my mom.

936
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,460
Even if it's a surprise,

937
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,460
I have to give her a lift.

938
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,460
Morning, Yun Geng.

939
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,460
Here's your milk tea.

940
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,460
You're back.

941
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,460
Thank you.

942
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,460
Chen Yun Geng.

943
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,460
Chen Luzhou.

944
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,460
Why are you here?

945
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,460
I heard that

946
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,460
you're having a dinner here

947
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,460
at the jewelry store.

948
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:42,640
I came to the

949
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,460
jewelry store.

950
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,460
Okay.

951
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,460
One for men.

952
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,460
Let's have a look.

953
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,460
You're a good guy.

954
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,460
You don't want to take me away.

955
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,460
You're not getting any more.

956
00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:59,460
Didn't I tell you

957
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:00,460
that you asked me to wear

958
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:01,460
a Songzi style dress.

959
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:02,460
I haven't given you a account.

960
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,460
What Songzi style dress?

961
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,460
You don't know

962
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,460
that the four of you

963
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,460
are wearing Songzi style dresses.

964
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,460
I don't know.

965
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,460
I don't know

966
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,460
why my friends are here.

967
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,460
I'll take a look.

968
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:18,460
No need.

969
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,460
You're welcome.

970
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:25,460
I'll take a look.

971
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:26,460
No need.

972
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,460
You're welcome.

973
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:33,460
Everyone,

974
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:34,460
pay more attention to the observation.

975
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:35,460
The news is on the ground.

976
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:36,460
We're waiting for you to find it.

977
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:38,420
If you have any

978
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,460
eyes that you've found,

979
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,460
go and have a look.

980
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:43,460
Miss Hu.

981
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:44,460
I'm worried about the girl.

982
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,460
I'm not even thinking about it.

983
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,460
Am I right?

984
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,460
Yes.

985
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,460
Hurry up.

986
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:00,460
I heard that

987
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:01,460
someone was biting the dog.

988
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,460
No.

989
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,460
No.

990
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:04,460
The dog bit the person.

991
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:05,460
You should go and have a look.

992
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:06,460
There must be some special news.

993
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:07,460
Okay.

994
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:08,460
You need to know the investigation.

995
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,460
Okay.

996
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:10,460
Hurry up.

997
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:14,460
