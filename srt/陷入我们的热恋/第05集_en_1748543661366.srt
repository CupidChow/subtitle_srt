The idol of A pictorial

The chemical cosmos

00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,740
Crash

5
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:49,440
When the dark night comes

00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:52,420
Crash

7
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,660
From day to night

8
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:33,780
Let the sea fly by each other's side

Crush

10
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,700
Don't you feel anything at all to me?

11
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,580
You are really lucky.

12
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,140
You are a good girl.

13
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,180
Thank you.

14
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,460
Lu Zhou, you are back.

15
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,380
Let me introduce you to him.

16
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,700
This is Auntie Xue.

17
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,100
He is the wife of Professor Jiang.

18
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,860
This is Lu Zhou's son.

19
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,020
Hello, Auntie Xue.

20
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:07,860
Hello.

21
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,740
Come on, sit down.

22
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:09,900
Sit down.

23
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,060
Please sit down.

24
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,260
This is Hui Hui.

25
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,140
The daughter of Professor Jiang who said

26
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,260
she has also gone to the university of Rui Cheng.

27
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,460
She will go there in a few days.

28
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,220
So you two can take care of each other there.

29
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,500
Right, Hui Hui?

30
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:26,820
Okay.

31
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,020
By the way, your father will go to the airport later.

32
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,140
You go and pick him up.

33
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,380
Send Hui Hui to the airport.

34
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,660
He won't watch a movie.

35
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,740
Okay.

36
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,940
Thank you, Auntie.

37
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:41,740
You're welcome.

38
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:42,900
Come on, come on.

39
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,820
Have some fruit.

40
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,500
Don't be too polite.

41
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,340
Dad, I'm washing the tree.

42
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,780
How about that?

43
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,740
Didn't you watch the meteor shower last night?

44
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,740
How did you know?

45
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,140
I told you.

46
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,420
Look at your circle of friends.

47
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,100
Well...

48
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,940
Who is Chen Lu Zhou?

49
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:10,860
Oh, no.

50
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,140
I'm separated.

51
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,340
I'm just...

52
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,860
a friend I've known recently.

53
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,620
Nana.

54
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,420
She has a good photo.

55
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,020
Why do you ask this?

56
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,420
Nothing.

57
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,260
Well...

58
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,100
What kind of photo

59
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,780
is good?

60
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,500
Listen.

61
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,220
I'll hang up now.

62
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,340
Oh, right.

63
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,740
I think you'll have a typhoon in a few days.

64
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,460
If you're done,

65
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,260
come back early.

66
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,380
I'm hanging up.

67
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,300
Hello? What are you doing?

68
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,420
He is waiting for me.

69
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,700
Chen Xun Qi doesn't wanna make a葛ira.

70
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,740
Why the tree?

71
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,980
You can't put him above it.

72
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,380
Let me observe.

73
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,780
Don't phones youists

74
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,980
fear the gods,

75
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:11,540
just a real measure.

76
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,820
Fine, I'll help you.

77
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:14,740
Would you help Lu Zhou

78
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,240
bring him back?

79
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,380
Yes, I won't.

80
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,420
Just one day?

81
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,000
Fine, sure.

82
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,560
Where is stinky условia?

83
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,860
He could never bring him back.

84
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,180
She went to the blind date with Lu Zhou today.

85
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,500
The blind date.

86
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,100
The car is a bit far from the door.

87
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,180
Please take a walk.

88
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,140
Hello?

89
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,860
I'm coming out right away.

90
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,740
My boyfriend is at the door.

91
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,660
Don't need to see him off.

92
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,100
Boyfriend?

93
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,980
Don't tell my parents.

94
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,060
I'm going out with him.

95
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,660
Don't worry after you arrive abroad.

96
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,900
I won't trouble you.

97
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,460
Don't get me wrong.

98
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,180
I don't like to talk to you.

99
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,140
It's my mother's problem.

100
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,380
Aunt Lin is actually quite nice.

101
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,660
She's actually very proud of you.

102
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,900
You may not know that

103
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,340
she often tells my mother in the unit

104
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,900
that you are so good and hardworking.

105
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,540
My mother said she is soft-hearted.

106
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,940
She can actually tell.

107
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,100
She cares about you.

108
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,800
I will keep an eye on you.

109
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,900
You are one 중, aren't you?

110
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,460
You are good looking and handsome like this

111
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,580
and must have enough boys to chase you.

112
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,140
Not many boys.

113
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,160
How can you

114
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,220
get a girlfriend?

115
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,460
No.

116
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,180
It means cowumo lovers.

117
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,060
You're going?

118
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,660
There's a WeChat message.

119
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,180
I invited you to eat there.

120
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,200
It's a random gift from you

121
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:51,960
to give me.

122
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,740
Please be my boyfriend then.

123
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,700
Let's go.

124
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,020
Let's go.

125
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,780
Let's have a look.

126
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,540
Let's eat.

127
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,100
Okay.

128
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,220
What did you just eat?

129
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,620
Xu Zhi is indeed pretty.

130
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,580
But the girl who was chasing you before

131
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,620
is not pretty.

132
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,940
She is different from other girls.

133
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,140
She has a boyfriend.

134
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,380
Rong Jin, you are wrong.

135
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,460
I don't like girls with boyfriend.

136
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,740
I just...

137
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Where did you find Chen Xingqi?

138
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,060
Tell me.

139
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,500
Xijiao City?

140
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,380
Chen Xingqi's feet are so ugly.

141
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,980
Chen Xingqi's face is so green.

142
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,300
In your old Chen's house,

143
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,020
who dares to suspect her?

144
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,780
Chen Xingqi is here today.

145
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,020
I told you before.

146
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,700
If Xu Zhi can be your girlfriend,

147
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,740
at least someone can control Chen Xingqi.

148
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,820
How is your blind date?

149
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,220
I told you, it's not true.

150
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,500
You told Xu Zhi that I went to blind date.

151
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,740
I told him.

152
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,660
What did he say?

153
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,260
He said you were a full-time driver.

154
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,180
You said you wanted to go to the interview.

155
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,140
You even went to blind date?

156
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:21,900
And?

157
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,060
He asked you if Chen Xingqi's business is good.

158
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,060
If not,

159
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,580
he will be on the stage.

160
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,900
Tell him to go to the interview.

161
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,260
Don't you feel anything to me?

162
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,820
Lin slept very well.

163
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,940
Who are you calling?

164
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,860
It's not right.

165
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,540
Leave.

166
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,780
Wu Xue is Li Jiyong.

167
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,140
Let us do some

168
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,220
torturing.

169
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,760
I'll get

170
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,480
good cold.

171
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,680
Why are you taking my shoes?

172
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,000
Will you play with me?

173
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,800
I'm good, okay?

174
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,040
Hello, welcome.

175
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,400
Hello.

176
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:31,880
Excuse me.

177
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,640
Excuse me.

178
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,760
Take off your shoes.

179
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,400
Okay.

180
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,840
Bastard.

181
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,480
I'll clean them up.

182
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,600
Wait a minute.

183
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,280
Look.

184
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,000
This place is good.

185
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,560
I've been here with my family.

186
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,600
It's good.

187
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,760
He is...

188
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,160
Chai Xingqiu.

189
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,720
No, no.

190
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,560
I bought it.

191
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,360
My sister is so weird.

192
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,240
It's hard to clean up.

193
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,240
How many times do I have to

194
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,240
go to the studio?

195
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,640
How to clean up?

196
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,440
How to clean up?

197
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,160
We have it.

198
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,800
We'll take a picture and then we'll protect her.

199
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,360
How to open it?

200
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,040
Open it.

201
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay, welcome.

202
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,000
Okay.

203
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,720
Thank you.

204
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,480
Don't move.

205
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,120
What?

206
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,520
It's a trick.

207
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,360
It must be a tree.

208
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,160
I'll send it to you.

209
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:19,680
Give it to me.

210
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,560
Why are you so dangerous?

211
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,080
Give it to me.

212
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,920
You.

213
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,000
Use my little number

214
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,440
to open Xingqiu's WeChat.

215
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,680
Hello.

216
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,080
Hello.

217
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,880
Give me some water.

218
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,560
Okay.

219
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,760
Who is it?

220
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,680
It's okay.

221
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,840
Please slow down.

222
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,160
Mr. Chen,

223
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:50,980
are you okay?

224
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,620
Mr. Chen,

225
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,840
please check your Senioboo light.

226
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,240
Okay.

227
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,680
Sir,

228
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,040
there's

229
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,300
a Chinese e-mail.

230
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,040
Your過去 looks a bit narrow.

231
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,160
How did it get there?

232
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,800
Not a little.

233
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,480
We don't have a schedule.

234
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,920
Don't go.

235
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,920
Listen to me explain.

236
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
I'll... I'll...

237
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,920
Don't explain to this man.

238
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,920
Hurry up.

239
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,920
You're going to call the police?

240
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,920
You bastard.

241
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,920
I'll go.

242
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,920
Lingling.

243
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,920
Cai Yingying?

244
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,920
You guys are doing this?

245
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,920
What's wrong with us?

246
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,920
You fell in love with me, right?

247
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,920
You followed me and Zong Daozhan.

248
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,920
What's the relationship between us?

249
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,920
Do you have to be so entangled with me?

250
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,920
Entangled with you?

251
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,920
We have a good marriage.

252
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,920
5.3.

253
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,920
Let's go out.

254
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,920
What are you doing?

255
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,920
What are you doing?

256
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,920
Let's go out.

257
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,920
What are you doing?

258
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,920
Let's go out.

259
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,920
Are you fighting?

260
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,920
Do you know that this villa is built by Uncle Xu Zhi?

261
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,920
What's the good thing about being the owner's wife?

262
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,920
You...

263
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,920
Wait a minute.

264
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,920
Thank you for your reminder last time.

265
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,920
I'm not good enough.

266
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,920
I don't know what I want.

267
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,920
But now I'm sure that I don't want anything.

268
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,920
For example, the rubbish you can't talk about.

269
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,920
You all know it.

270
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,920
Wait.

271
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,920
Don't be angry.

272
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,920
Be careful.

273
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,920
Make room.

274
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,920
Ryan.

275
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,920
Ryan.

276
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,920
Ryan.

277
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,180
Ryan

278
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,920
Give me some firewood.

279
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,800
I'm not sure.

280
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,440
By the way,

281
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,400
the school is well-ventilated.

282
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,400
I bought you a apartment nearby.

283
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,480
It's more comfortable than living in a dorm.

284
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,840
Thanks, dad.

285
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,280
Let's go.

286
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,520
It's too early.

287
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,080
I packed some soup.

288
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:01,880
Look.

289
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,560
It's so nice.

290
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,360
You're back.

291
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,600
You're back.

292
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,240
You must be tired.

293
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,760
Go wash your face.

294
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,960
Mei Yi made soup for you.

295
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,440
Give me the money.

296
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,600
I'll call you later.

297
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,480
Come out and drink.

298
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,360
Okay.

299
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,840
Lu Zhou, come on.

300
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,960
Drink the soup.

301
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,720
Thank you, Mei Yi.

302
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,680
Here.

303
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,840
Do you want a spoon?

304
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:29,920
No.

305
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,800
You can drink it without washing your hands.

306
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,920
The battery is so fast.

307
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,560
The spoon...

308
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,200
I won't look at you when you change your face.

309
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,000
No.

310
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,800
You're not coming?

311
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,760
Drink it first.

312
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,040
No.

313
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,160
I'm thirsty.

314
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,360
What did your dad tell you on the way here?

315
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,080
He told me that

316
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,880
when I'm abroad,

317
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,720
he'll buy me a apartment.

318
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Listen to me.

319
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,960
Your dad loves you so much.

320
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,920
Do you remember last time

321
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,360
we went to Xie Wanyuan for a trip?

322
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,920
You didn't even buy your favorite

323
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,720
box for Xin Xin.

324
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,200
Your dad bought you a box

325
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,400
before he bought his own suit.

326
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,080
I laughed at him.

327
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,400
He said that a suit can last for more than ten years.

328
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,760
Can a suit last for more than ten years?

329
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,760
Is it worth it?

330
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,320
He said it's worth it.

331
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,160
As long as my son likes it,

332
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,080
it's worth it.

333
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,680
I know.

334
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,800
I know he's good to me.

335
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,520
I won't let him down.

336
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,000
Alright.

337
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,800
Let's go.

338
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,520
I'll never forget you.

339
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,160
When I looked at the language of my cousin,

340
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,160
he said he didn't want to go to work.

341
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,720
He said,

342
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,680
my sister doesn't love you.

343
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,360
And she doesn't have money.

344
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,360
I can't keep on paying.

345
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,280
On the 18th birthday,

346
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,680
the teacher gave me a gift of a gift.

347
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,520
He thought it was a valuable family treasure.

348
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,440
But he said,

349
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,440
it was when I was young,

350
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,760
I can start to work.

351
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,320
I'm going to work.

352
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,920
Where are you?

353
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,320
I'm not on the mountain.

354
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,320
You brought something when you came back.

355
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,040
You're starving.

356
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,240
What do you want?

357
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,200
A few bags of instant noodles.

358
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,960
Don't forget your water.

359
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,960
You can have the rest.

360
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,560
Where's Xu Zhen?

361
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,360
Tell him yourself.

362
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,720
Chen Luzhou.

363
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,760
Which way?

364
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,640
The short way.

365
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,280
Okay.

366
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,000
Forget it.

367
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,080
I brought you some apples when I wanted to come back.

368
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,920
The road to the wind,

369
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,600
the road to the big road,

370
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,760
the road to the road to the road to the road.

371
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,920
It's late.

372
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,800
It's not late.

373
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,160
You'll buy it.

374
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,880
I'll buy it.

375
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,920
Hello.

376
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,240
Where are you going?

377
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,840
You went to the Beilond tea shop.

378
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,280
Son Guoqian needs to return.

379
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,800
I'm so anxious to see you.

380
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,080
Warning the idiot.

381
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,000
You must be super到了 of the moment.

382
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,160
I'm sorry, Ms. Xun.

383
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,400
Don't check my card.

384
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,360
How long is Australia Station waiting for?

385
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,680
Can you accompany me there?

386
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,600
Okay.

387
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,120
Capture them back.

388
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,040
And we will see each other on a summer evening.

389
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,000
Okay.

390
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:54,920
Hello.

391
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,280
How are you?

392
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,040
Hi.

393
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,600
Sorry, I left this glass of juice here.

394
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,200
Then do you like it?

395
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,680
I don't want to waste your kindness.

396
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,440
I think there's a place near here.

397
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,200
Dai Lu.

398
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,840
Come in.

399
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,600
Sorry.

400
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,520
This is the only place we have.

401
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,680
Look.

402
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,800
It's okay. Just save him.

403
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,560
Okay. Thank you.

404
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,080
Okay.

405
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,080
What do you want to see?

406
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,360
I'm fine. Just do it.

407
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,720
I'll just order.

408
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,200
Thank you.

409
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,080
Are you unhappy?

410
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,520
No.

411
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,240
Is it because of Xiang Jin?

412
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,560
Don't listen to Zhu Yang.

413
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,840
I was ignored by my mom.

414
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,400
She took me to meet a girl

415
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,240
and told me to take care of her after I left the country.

416
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,640
But she has a boyfriend.

417
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,400
Why do you say so much?

418
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,320
I didn't ask.

419
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,960
I don't care about this.

420
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,200
I just think

421
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,920
you look a little strange today.

422
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,480
Compared to the speed,

423
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,800
you need to come here.

424
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,840
I'll just ask casually.

425
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,840
Don't worry.

426
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,680
Go ahead.

427
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:35,960
Have you ever thought about

428
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,080
what kind of boyfriend you want

429
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,520
for your future boyfriend?

430
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,720
I haven't thought about it.

431
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,680
Although I'm a rich man,

432
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,280
I'm a rich man.

433
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,920
I like smart girls.

434
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,400
I can make money.

435
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,400
Because I'm too stupid,

436
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,160
I don't like

437
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,360
the handsome guy.

438
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,600
I don't like him.

439
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,080
I'm too tired to work.

440
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,120
I'm not patient.

441
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,680
But how do you judge

442
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,800
on the IQ?

443
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,520
People's IQ is not bad.

444
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,200
Except for a few differences,

445
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,240
you even took her to the hospital

446
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,360
before you fell in love.

447
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,560
You did IQ testing.

448
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,480
So I'm rich.

449
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,560
I can only feel it for a while.

450
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,960
But the college entrance exam is a branch.

451
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,560
It's good and bad.

452
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,360
Of course, I'll get a good grade.

453
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,440
I'm talking about you.

454
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,360
You're in the same class.

455
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,280
You're more handsome than Ma.

456
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,840
So you're going to

457
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,360
go to the college to fall in love?

458
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,240
To see the fate.

459
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,240
I'm pretty good.

460
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,680
What college is good?

461
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,480
I can go to the top of the world.

462
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,920
You're so stupid.

463
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,560
You're even good at the top of the world.

464
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,160
You even want to do this after the exam.

465
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,520
It's a dream come true.

466
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,320
What's wrong?

467
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,000
Nothing.

468
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,040
I think your idea is good.

469
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,140
I'll apply a proper deposit

470
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,680
for college entrance exams.

471
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,240
Okay.

472
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,280
You need to know

473
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,560
everything about my show.

474
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,960
You know when it opens.

475
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:19,840
I'll see you soon.

476
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,640
Bye.

477
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,560
I'm Afraid

478
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,540
to be separated再見

479
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:39,960
forลIs the future

480
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,180
Like a flashgroans

481
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,560
overnyred the sky

482
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:08,560
I'll wipe away the regrets

483
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,560
I'm done. I don't think you'll drink it.

484
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,560
I just want to help you with the labor.

485
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,560
Thank you.

486
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,560
Then I'll have the labor.

487
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,560
What are you thinking about?

488
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,560
The master of the magic magic palace just now

489
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,560
if he didn't care about others' eyes

490
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,560
wouldn't he have taken that step?

491
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,560
Everyone has a strong heart.

492
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,560
He seems to be stubborn.

493
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,560
But he needs to say something to destroy him.

494
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,560
A moment of regret.

495
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,560
What if your heart is broken?

496
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,560
What will you do?

497
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,560
I'll find out the answer to this question.

498
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,560
Okay.

499
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,560
The typhoon is coming.

500
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,560
I'm going to go down the mountain tomorrow.

501
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,560
My dad is going to transfer to the class soon.

502
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,560
I can't put the old lady at home alone.

503
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,560
I should take Cheng Xinqi down.

504
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,560
Oh, right.

505
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,560
I've received a letter today.

506
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,560
I'm going to send it to you.

507
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,560
I received a letter today.

508
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,560
I need a photographer.

509
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,560
How much do you plan to take?

510
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,560
How much do you want?

511
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,560
I'll give you a price.

512
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,560
Don't be too reasonable.

513
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,560
Think about it.

514
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,560
Okay.

515
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,560
Good night.

516
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,560
Good night.

517
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,560
Dad.

518
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,560
You're back.

519
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,560
You're so crazy.

520
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,560
You have guests today.

521
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,560
No guests.

522
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,560
I'm going to pick up the wind for you.

523
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,560
That's a good thing.

524
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,560
Where's my wife?

525
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,560
She suddenly said she was in the city.

526
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,560
She insisted on going to the countryside.

527
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,560
I'm telling you.

528
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,560
She just wanted to go to the countryside

529
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,560
to find her old sisters.

530
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,560
I brought you the tea.

531
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,560
I'm going to go to the countryside.

532
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,560
I'm going to go to the countryside.

533
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,560
I'm going to go to the countryside.

534
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,560
I'm going to go to the countryside.

535
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,560
I'm going to go to the countryside.

536
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,560
I'm going to the countryside.

537
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,560
You really think of me?

538
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,560
Wash your hands.

539
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,560
Have a meal.

540
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,560
Smells good.

541
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,560
Go and wash your hands.

542
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,560
Dad.

543
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,560
You go first.

544
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,560
Do you think my dad has any changes today?

545
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,560
You're in a different style.

546
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,560
You're much more energetic than before.

547
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,560
Of course.

548
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,560
Then let's see what changes

549
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,560
there are in the house.

550
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,560
In the house?

551
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,560
Nothing.

552
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,560
You're asking for auntie?

553
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,560
What are you asking for?

554
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,560
I cleaned up the house

555
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,560
and cleaned it up.

556
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,560
I did it all by myself.

557
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,560
And then?

558
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,560
Then the hospital said that we should reunite.

559
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,560
This time I'm going to Sanya.

560
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,560
Then I thought that

561
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,560
I'd rather take your grandma

562
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,560
to Beijing

563
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,560
than have a holiday.

564
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,560
What do you want to say?

565
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,560
I hope you

566
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,560
can study in Beijing.

567
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,560
Dad.

568
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,560
I've told you

569
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,560
everything about your uncle.

570
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,560
He also said that

571
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,560
staying in Qingda with your aunt

572
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,560
is really a sin.

573
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,560
And you, Mr. Xu,

574
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,560
especially called me

575
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,560
to tell me.

576
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,560
He must have told me to persuade you.

577
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,560
He thinks you're young and excellent.

578
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,560
You should go out and have a look.

579
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,560
Don't worry.

580
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,560
Look.

581
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,560
I can take good care of myself

582
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,560
when you're not around.

583
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,560
Look at how well

584
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,560
you've done at home.

585
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,560
This is my last breath.

586
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,560
I'll make you a doctor.

587
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,560
Where did you get so much money?

588
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,560
Didn't I tell you?

589
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,560
The sales ticket

590
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,560
of Uncle Lin

591
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,560
owes us 5 million yuan.

592
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,560
Fine.

593
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,560
Our family's savings

594
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,560
is more than grandma's.

595
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,560
Fine.

596
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,560
Then you should think about

597
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,560
what I just told you.

598
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,560
I'm going to the hospital now.

599
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,560
Wash the dishes tonight.

600
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,560
Okay.

601
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,560
I'm going to the hospital.

602
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,560
I'm going to the hospital.

603
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,560
I'm going to the hospital.

604
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,560
When is your coming?

605
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,040
Go find a

606
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,560
Look for a film

607
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,560
I can still afford to play a movie.

608
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,560
I can also watch a movie.

609
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,560
The school in Rui City is starting to get over.

610
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,560
Pay attention to the oil smell recently.

611
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,560
Is the money any smaller?

612
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,560
Which money should I buy?

613
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,560
What?

614
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,560
I'll buy the tea!

615
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:55,860
90.

616
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,400
Xu,

617
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,460
Beijing doesn't care about all the велicoproteins,

618
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,860
but you've prepared an teacup

619
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,180
for me to array blankets in the winter?

620
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:54,260
Shall we

621
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,820
let them drive you out?

622
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,240
Didn't you two look so好了

623
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,140
while we were in the禿衣 dressing room?

624
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,140
What?

625
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,740
You suddenly got a pig?

626
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,140
I've been thinking about it for the past few days.

627
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,740
Why would I have feelings for her?

628
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,740
A love affair?

629
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,940
Maybe.

630
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,740
But I think it's because of Zhen Fuyu.

631
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:18,940
I see.

632
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:23,540
It's because she's not interested in you.

633
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,540
So she's different from the other girls

634
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,740
who admire you and pursue you.

635
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,740
Or because you don't believe

636
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,340
she's just interested in your mom.

637
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,540
I just don't know what she's thinking.

638
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,540
Sometimes I think she's

639
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,940
pretending to be confused.

640
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,140
But sometimes I think she's really not open-minded.

641
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,740
But no matter what,

642
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,940
it's too passive anyway.

643
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,340
I don't want to guess anymore.

644
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,340
Besides, we're going abroad soon.

645
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,740
We won't have any results.

646
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,140
Don't know you'll let us get toater island.

647
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,540
I think it's enough.

648
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,540
See if you need some kindness.

649
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,540
Let me take a think.

650
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,340
This...

651
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,060
I almost lost a photographer.

652
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,940
What did Chen Luzhou say?

653
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,340
He didn't say yes or no.

654
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,740
He said he was looking for time.

655
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,660
How about asking him again?

656
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:41,860
Okay.

657
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,060
Xiao Jing.

658
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:54,820
Xiao Jing.

659
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,060
When you're done trying to hide,

660
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,260
tanta ch & drop.

661
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:09,880
Are you

662
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,920
afraid of anger?

663
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,420
You're so mean.

664
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,340
You want it or not?

665
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:31,300
Dad.

666
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,840
Is this混 with me?

667
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,040
Dad.

668
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:55,640
Wait.

669
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,300
Let me get the car lock

670
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,380
for her attempt.

671
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,960
It should not be sent.

672
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,700
Does it look strange?

673
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,440
It looks good on the acrylic.

674
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,020
The photographer Chen Dare not coin with us

675
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,700
Luckily Akiva sent it to us

676
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,560
He lists the المUD money

677
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,220
Look

678
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,140
It's a little wood-edged

679
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,640
It's nice to sing

680
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,120
I didn't treat us as friends.

681
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,840
What do you mean?

682
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,960
Nothing.

683
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,000
I just think

684
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,600
even if we get to know each other,

685
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,960
whether it's a good or bad relationship,

686
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,640
we can still be friends.

687
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,800
Even if it's normal,

688
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,200
she's going abroad anyway.

689
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,120
We won't have any trouble in the future.

690
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,040
Were you cakes ordered?

691
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:00,800
Priceless.

692
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,920
Fuck it!

693
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,280
Check if he's doing us a favor!

694
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,560
Nothing!

695
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,180
I'm only looking for a photographer

696
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,220
with movie tools.

697
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,440
No matter who you are,

698
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,520
that's it.

699
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,460
By the way,

700
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,220
don't you like my car,

701
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:23,540
doppelganger

702
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,360
lately?

703
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,440
Oh?

704
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,160
I'll go.

705
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:29,960
You guys go first.

706
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:30,800
I'll go.

707
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,280
Cheng Du Zhou, what are you hiding from me?

708
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,360
He's a piece of cake.

709
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,600
It wasn't like this before.

710
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,200
If you leave again, I'll cut you off.

711
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,480
Please forgive me.

712
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,920
Didn't you tell me he was a pervert?

713
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,040
I should have paid for it.

714
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,600
Stop talking nonsense.

715
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,640
You dare not fight him.

716
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:58,720
Be quick.

717
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,520
Stay here.

718
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,640
Show up, show up.

719
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:04,720
Come.

720
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,000
Speed up.

721
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:09,800
Let's go.

722
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,240
Speed up.

723
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,300
Pull harder.

724
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,480
Come on.

725
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,360
Run hard.

726
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,160
What?

727
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,200
Wait.

728
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,400
What's the matter?

729
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,000
Come closer.

730
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:36,880
Over there.

731
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,320
This way.

732
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,040
Don't move.

733
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,080
Lu Xun.

734
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,640
Are you okay?

735
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,560
Are you okay?

736
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,520
Are you okay?

737
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,040
Yes.

738
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,520
Han Xun, I'm going to kick you.

739
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,720
Go. Go.

740
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,560
Come.

741
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,400
Lu Xun, get up.

742
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,000
Mr. Wang.

743
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,880
Be careful.

744
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,680
Be careful.

745
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,680
I'll finish it.

746
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,680
That's the air conditioner.

747
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,440
Look.

748
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,440
It's closed.

749
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,960
The air conditioner makes you sick.

750
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,440
Come on.

751
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,920
Tell me.

752
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,760
What made you unhappy?

753
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,600
I'm happy.

754
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,680
Why do you think

755
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,320
people are getting older and less happy?

756
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,760
In theory,

757
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,920
they've grown up

758
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,000
because of your age and age.

759
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,760
Your world has become bigger and bigger.

760
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,960
The things you can't handle

761
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,400
can't stimulate you anymore.

762
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,400
For example?

763
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,000
For example, you were unhappy when you were young.

764
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,880
At that time, I only wanted to give you a candy.

765
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,360
You can be happy for a whole day.

766
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,680
But later, you've grown up slowly.

767
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,000
You've grown up.

768
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,600
At that time, I only wanted to take you to the amusement park

769
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,000
and buy you a nice dress.

770
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I also wanted to help you choose the monitor.

771
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,560
I was like this when I was little.

772
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,080
Look.

773
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,440
I'm protecting my daughter's monitor's video.

774
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,160
I've been keeping it on my phone.

775
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:09,960
Come.

776
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,840
Keep it.

777
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,200
Hello, everyone. I'm Xi Shi.

778
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,840
La Polan once said

779
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,440
I don't want to help Jiang Jing's video.

780
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,560
It's not a good video.

781
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,960
Although I don't have money from Lin Zixian,

782
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,960
I'm beautiful.

783
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,400
Lin Zixian can't give you all the money.

784
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,320
But I'm beautiful and I'm not a treasure.

785
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,680
You have a lot of eyes.

786
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,720
I hope you can choose me.

787
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,600
But if I'm a senior monitor,

788
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,400
I hope you can cooperate with me.

789
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,960
Don't make me feel embarrassed.

790
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,920
Thank you, everyone.

791
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,360
Okay. You can leave it to yourself.

792
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,800
But I can't tell you.

793
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,920
You can be happy when you have a candy.

794
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,840
You won't be happy

795
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,200
when you have a candy.

796
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,320
I know.

797
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,240
One day,

798
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,600
I'll be afraid of you.

799
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,880
I'll have someone to help you.

800
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,240
But I hope that person can be born sooner.

801
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,520
Dad, don't worry.

802
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,120
I don't need anyone now.

803
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,560
I just need to make money.

804
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,720
Make money?

805
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,960
You think I'm going to Beijing to go to school?

806
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,400
I'm sure I'll be more generous than my aunt.

807
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,800
I need to make some money.

808
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,320
I have time.

809
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:30,200
I'm going to a forest tomorrow.

810
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,840
I'll make some money.

811
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,480
You can make money?

812
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:36,960
Awesome.

813
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:44,760
I'll see if I can make money.

814
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,640
I'm sorry.

815
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,240
I'm sorry.

816
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:47,640
I'm sorry.

817
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,040
I'm sorry.

818
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:48,200
I'm sorry.

819
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:48,520
I'm sorry.

820
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:48,680
I'm sorry.

821
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,200
I'm sorry.

822
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:49,560
I'm sorry.

823
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:49,720
I'm sorry.

824
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,040
I'm sorry.

825
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:50,320
I'm sorry.

826
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:50,760
I'm sorry.

827
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,000
I'm sorry.

828
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,080
I'm sorry.

829
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,360
I'm sorry.

830
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:51,960
You...

831
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,360
It was a sleep last night.

832
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:53,880
I woke up in the morning.

833
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,960
I was dizzy.

834
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,520
I was in a sleep.

835
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,520
You were sleeping?

836
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,640
Why did you sleep?

837
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,520
I suspect that our director has a problem.

838
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,520
What's the problem?

839
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,520
We're in the hospital.

840
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:04,960
What's the problem?

841
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,880
I have to see him.

842
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,320
It's not a doctor's problem.

843
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,160
Since he came back from the recovery clinic,

844
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,760
I felt something was wrong.

845
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,680
He took the air conditioner last night.

846
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,120
He went to the clinic.

847
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,400
He asked me weird things last night.

848
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,040
Why is he getting older and less happy?

849
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,480
He's been acting all day.

850
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,160
Do you think he's in love?

851
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,320
No way.

852
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,280
You asked the kid.

853
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,920
He said that he needs

854
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,200
his classmates to know him.

855
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,640
He needs to know him.

856
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,080
He needs to know him.

857
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,400
Look at the phone.

858
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,480
Look at the phone.

859
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,400
Look.

860
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:48,960
Look.

861
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,080
Chen Luzhou.

862
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,560
He's good.

863
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,760
You...

864
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,880
I think you need to check it.

865
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,360
Ask the kid.

866
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,760
How?

867
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,280
Ask him.

868
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,520
He must be...

869
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,320
He needs to check it.

870
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,000
Su Nong.

871
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,720
Your doctor please check the cases.

872
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,760
1034 Chen Luzhou is investigated.

873
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,400
Congratulations.

874
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,400
I'll check it.

875
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,560
Okay.

876
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,400
I'll see you there.

877
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:28,920
Hello.

878
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,600
This way.

879
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,600
Doctor.

880
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,200
Where are you feeling unwell?

881
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,600
I bumped into someone when I was playing basketball.

882
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,400
Your name is Cheng Luzhou?

883
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,400
I'm Cheng Luzhou.

884
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,400
I'm a little worried.

885
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,400
I'm afraid I'll be late.

886
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,400
I'm afraid I'll be late.

887
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,400
I'm afraid I'll be late.

888
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,400
I'm afraid I'll be late.

889
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,400
I'm afraid I'll be late.

890
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,400
I'm afraid I'll be late.

891
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,400
I'm afraid I'll be late.

892
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,400
I'm afraid I'll be late.

893
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,400
I'm afraid I'll be late.

894
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,400
I'm afraid I'll be late.

895
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,400
I'm afraid I'll be late.

896
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,400
I'm afraid I'll be late.

897
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,400
I'm afraid I'll be late.

898
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,400
I'm afraid I'll be late.

899
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,400
Like a cloud in the tree

900
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,400
Free to go across the sky

901
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,400
The world is too quiet

902
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:53,400
Let all the sound

903
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,400
Who will be in the light

904
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:06,400
Be careful, I'm going to fall into the ground

905
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,400
The lonely atmosphere of the ice

906
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:16,400
Let the world become a relationship and care

907
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,400
I'm afraid I'll be late

908
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,400
I'm afraid I'll be late

909
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,400
Look, look, look away

910
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,400
Look, look away

911
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,400
Look at theister

912
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,680
The exit is fool

913
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,680
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

914
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,680
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

915
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,680
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

916
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,680
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

917
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,680
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

918
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,680
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

919
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,680
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

920
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,680
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

921
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,680
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

922
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,680
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

923
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,680
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

924
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,680
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

925
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,680
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

926
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,680
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

927
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,680
As the true wind Keep stressing me.

928
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,680
As the true wind Keep stressing me.

929
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,680
That's whatito remains unplugged until you touch me.

930
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,680
Time stops.

931
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,680
Time stops.

932
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,680
Time stops.

933
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,680
Time stops

934
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,920
Time stops.

935
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,680
The sun sets for another place

936
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:35,680
Now the time of reincarnations

937
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,680
Is about to end

938
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,680
Until we meet again

939
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,280
In your eyes

940
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:48,080
I see myself

941
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:51,280
Into you

942
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,080
Into you
