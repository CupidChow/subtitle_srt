1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,840
It's

2
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,320
a

3
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:52,080
level

4
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:58,320
so

5
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,200
Don't wait for me.

6
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,120
Calm...

7
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,840
Calm...

8
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,480
Yeah.

9
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,360
Congratulations.

10
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,500
Master Xusheng.

11
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,620
Your opinion was very amazing.

12
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,460
Your passion.

13
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,740
Don't worry about me.

14
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,900
Just care about yourself.

15
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,500
Your family is back.

16
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,100
Over.

17
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,900
Put it down.

18
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,660
Put it down.

19
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,380
Good girl.

20
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,220
You can walk with Chen Luzhou.

21
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,180
Is he

22
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,020
serious about Chen Luzhou?

23
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,740
What's the matter?

24
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,340
Of course it's fake.

25
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,260
Don't believe it.

26
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,020
Don't believe it.

27
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,380
Don't believe it.

28
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,020
Don't tell me.

29
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,660
WeChat group is out of the question.

30
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,860
Besides,

31
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,260
if he doesn't talk,

32
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,540
then Gu Yan will be worried about Chen Luzhou.

33
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,340
Is that possible?

34
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,300
Da Ye,

35
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,100
is it possible to report to the police?

36
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,380
What's so good about Gu Yan?

37
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,060
He's a man of entertainment.

38
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,300
He's a man of private life.

39
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,420
I admit it.

40
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,780
He's pretty.

41
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,740
But it's useless.

42
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,140
He's a man of private life.

43
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,780
He likes to fool women.

44
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,860
Lin Ye,

45
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,100
do you know how to pick a man?

46
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,660
How?

47
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,780
He's a man.

48
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,780
He doesn't need to look.

49
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,220
He just wants to see if he can run fast.

50
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,740
He can run fast.

51
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,540
Then,

52
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,220
he can run in the front

53
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,780
when he's old.

54
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,180
I...

55
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:35,980
I object.

56
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,020
The man you just mentioned

57
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,060
is a poor man.

58
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,340
Is he rich or old?

59
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,940
He can use the super power to take the eggs?

60
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,740
So I pick a man who looks fierce.

61
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,020
He's fierce,

62
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:46,860
bold,

63
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,660
and broad.

64
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,180
He's safe.

65
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,140
One more thing.

66
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,060
Do you know what's so good about being fierce?

67
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,340
I don't know.

68
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,540
I've never told you.

69
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,780
Let me tell you.

70
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,060
When you wear the suit,

71
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,500
you're so confident.

72
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,300
Sometimes,

73
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,180
that's how you fall in love.

74
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,140
You always get tired of

75
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,340
facing the same face.

76
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:13,900
If he doesn't change,

77
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,140
he'll make you happy.

78
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,660
Who will go home?

79
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,420
Wu Xie,

80
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,020
you're so naive.

81
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,700
You're still going to wear the suit

82
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,140
and take the eggs?

83
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,100
You must pick an employee old.

84
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,380
You must物.

85
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,540
I'd like to say something.

86
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,900
You're so antial Moder Zero.

87
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,580
All three of us.

88
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:39,900
Authentic,

89
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,260
man.

90
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,780
What are you talking about?

91
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,180
That's why.

92
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,300
As a swindler,

93
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:56,900
What?

94
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,020
Did I tell you?

95
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,340
No.

96
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,540
Get up and apologize.

97
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:05,780
Sorry.

98
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,340
Sorry.

99
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:06,940
Sorry.

100
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,460
Sorry.

101
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:08,980
Tell me.

102
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,220
Apologize to him.

103
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,540
Sorry.

104
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,260
Sorry.

105
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,460
Sorry.

106
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,980
We were all talking on the computer.

107
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,780
сознized Though Obscconity

108
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,420
Do you know what Chen Lushou

109
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,020
and I know?

110
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,260
In high school,

111
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:47,900
there was a course

112
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,220
where we asked my students

113
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,020
to teach and film.

114
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,540
I wanted to take Die-In-Aided suitcase.

115
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,660
I had no time to write

116
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,060
I was afraid I would drag them down.

117
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,060
He was the only one who was willing to do it.

118
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,860
At first, I thought he was kind to me.

119
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,260
But then I realized

120
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,060
he didn't like being disturbed.

121
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,060
He was separated from me

122
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,660
and could finish his work alone.

123
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,860
He couldn't bear to do it.

124
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,060
He was quite good at it.

125
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,660
Actually, I want to say that

126
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,260
Cheng Ruizhou is a very strong person in the border.

127
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,060
Especially for girls.

128
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,860
He has always been a good person.

129
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,060
I know.

130
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,460
He is a rare guest.

131
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,660
He is a good person.

132
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,860
He is a good person.

133
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,260
He is a good person.

134
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,060
He is afraid that he will be lost.

135
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,260
So what they said just now is a rumor.

136
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,460
Don't put it in your heart.

137
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,060
I know.

138
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,060
But you don't know

139
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,660
that he is so proud of you.

140
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,060
He likes you secretly.

141
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,660
Even if he doesn't know your heart.

142
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,660
So you like him?

143
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,460
Yes.

144
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,660
Do you like him too much?

145
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,460
It has nothing to do with you.

146
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,460
Xu Zhi.

147
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,060
There are not many people who can make me envious.

148
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,860
You are one of them.

149
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,460
Cherish Cheng Ruizhou.

150
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,060
Hu Hangan.

151
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,260
Hu Hangan.

152
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,260
Hu Hangan!

153
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,660
Qian Ruozhou.

154
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,660
It's such a long time since we played.

155
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,060
Are you just coming and messing with me?

156
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,860
Who is the person who can't play with me?

157
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,860
Isn't it you, the person who doesn't know how to trust?

158
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,860
No wonder I said he can't play with me.

159
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,860
He will be angry.

160
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,860
Hello?

161
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,860
Hello?

162
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,860
Who is this?

163
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,860
Anjuan.

164
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,860
You are the one who said that.

165
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,860
Why? You want to see the movie?

166
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,860
The movie will be changed.

167
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,860
I will ask you to eat some night food first.

168
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,860
Okay.

169
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,860
See you later.

170
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,860
Okay.

171
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,860
More pig ears.

172
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,860
More firewood.

173
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,860
Come on, eat.

174
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,860
Thank you.

175
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,860
You haven't come yet?

176
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,860
Yes.

177
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,860
You are so nice.

178
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,860
I will eat more later.

179
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,860
What's the time?

180
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,860
It's time.

181
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,860
It's 10 o'clock.

182
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,860
Eat more in 10 minutes.

183
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,860
Dandan.

184
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,860
You are waiting for this person?

185
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,860
Do you know how long he has to wait for you?

186
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,860
He has a son like this.

187
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,860
Be careful next time.

188
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,860
Sorry, I can't do it next time.

189
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,860
Eat fried chicken.

190
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,860
Please.

191
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,860
He is Dandan.

192
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,860
Can't a man call him Dandan?

193
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,860
Don't do anything.

194
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,860
Don't be so mean.

195
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,860
Come on, eat fried chicken.

196
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,860
Thank you, Dandan.

197
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,860
Mr. Zhi has been waiting for other boys here.

198
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,860
You bought this stall.

199
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,860
Ask him yourself.

200
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,860
He knows everything.

201
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,860
Come on, eat.

202
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,860
Thank you.

203
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,860
No.

204
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,860
It's a long trip.

205
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,860
There must be a demon.

206
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,860
Is it because of the demon?

207
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,860
No.

208
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,860
It's a long trip.

209
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,860
It's a long trip.

210
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,860
It's a long trip.

211
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,860
It's a long trip.

212
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,860
That demon...

213
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,860
is it because of something?

214
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,860
Did you do something wrong

215
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,860
and want to make up for me?

216
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,860
Do you want to eat it?

217
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,860
Yes.

218
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,860
Does it taste good?

219
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,860
Is it good?

220
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,860
It's a long choice.

221
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,860
Delicious.

222
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,860
Why don't you eat?

223
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,860
Isn't it for you?

224
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,860
Just eat it.

225
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,860
I've used it for a couple of days.

226
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,860
Why is the taste so big?

227
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,660
It seems that the restaurant that Feng Jing chose today is not going to be good either.

228
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,260
It's fine.

229
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,660
The men who picked them are not a good choice.

230
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,660
You didn't come to hang out, you didn't eat much.

231
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,860
I have to be the one who's good at it.

232
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,860
But those few wontons are indeed a bit of a waste.

233
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,860
What did Gu Yan ask you to say?

234
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,060
Don't mention the girls.

235
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,660
Do you want to come to my number 8 birthday party?

236
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,660
Number 8?

237
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:17,660
I might have other things to do. I might not be able to go.

238
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,260
Okay.

239
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,860
I didn't tell you.

240
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,260
My dad was cheated by 100,000 yuan in my college entrance exam.

241
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:31,460
Although we've already been dating, but this 100,000 might not be able to catch up.

242
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,260
I told him before that I said that I'm a dad.

243
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:38,460
You're selling this old car. You can buy a new car every 100,000 yuan.

244
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,460
He can't bear to do that. He's really regretting now.

245
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,660
Why?

246
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,660
This car doesn't have money.

247
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,460
Only people can afford it.

248
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,060
So why did I tell you before that it's useless to think so much and press the button?

249
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,460
You have to enjoy it right now.

250
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,460
I really can't go. I'm not going to argue with you.

251
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,860
Thank you. What's wrong?

252
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,260
Tell me the good news.

253
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,860
Your university's offer has come down.

254
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:12,060
You're going to have a celebration party next Friday.

255
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,260
Next Friday?

256
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,260
Can you change it?

257
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,060
Change it?

258
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,860
What's so important about you?

259
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,260
I'll make you change your life.

260
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:31,260
If you want to tell me about this next time, just let me know.

261
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,060
Don't call me back.

262
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,460
I think you can discuss it with me.

263
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:43,260
Chen Lu Zhou, what's your attitude?

264
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,060
It's okay. It's important to have a family.

265
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,860
And who told you that I wouldn't want to talk about it now?

266
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,060
Ju Zhi.

267
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,460
You can't play with me like this.

268
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,860
Are you sure?

269
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,060
I'm not looking forward to playing with you.

270
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,260
Chen Da Shi.

271
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,260
I'm sorry to bother you. I'm from the box next door.

272
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:38,260
I lost the game and I have to find a girl to sing a song.

273
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,060
I'm sorry.

274
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,860
I'm sorry.

275
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,460
I'm sorry.

276
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,060
I'm sorry.

277
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,860
I'm sorry.

278
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,060
I'm sorry.

279
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,060
I'm sorry.

280
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,060
I'm sorry.

281
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,060
I'm sorry.

282
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,060
I'm sorry.

283
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:03,060
It's not fair.

284
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,060
You're Fresh sprout?

285
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:11,660
I don't know if I can sing a love song for you.

286
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,460
I'll sing for you.

287
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,460
I'm the best.

288
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,060
What are you going to sing?

289
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,160
No.

290
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,060
I登об НАIU.

291
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,660
Let me sing for you.

292
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:25,060
We are not suitable to singing love songs.

293
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,260
You are worse than me.

294
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:35,640
Nan tea

295
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,560
I don't have anything

296
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,740
He and JiaDeng are also yours

297
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,200
They are human

298
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,460
Be fancier than you

299
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,660
That's mean

300
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,940
If you and Mingasonic sing

301
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,860
Chen Lu Zhou still will be psych of me

302
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,020
Yes, yes, yes.

303
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,460
My mission is complete.

304
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,460
You guys play.

305
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,300
I'm leaving.

306
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,820
You're leaving?

307
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,220
Welcome.

308
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,260
Welcome.

309
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,620
Thank you.

310
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,620
Come on.

311
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,220
Lu Zhou is such a good boy.

312
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,820
He's good at teaching grandma.

313
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,100
Yes.

314
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,820
Come on, sit down.

315
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,300
Come on, eat.

316
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,140
Sit down.

317
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,620
Okay.

318
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,620
Come on, eat.

319
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,900
If you want to say that my grandson

320
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,460
is very good at acting.

321
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,020
He's very sweet.

322
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:30,860
Right?

323
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,780
He really doesn't seem to let us worry.

324
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,300
He's all about being good.

325
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:35,940
Yes, yes.

326
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,260
Lu Zhou.

327
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,980
We're leaving soon.

328
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,460
You're abroad alone.

329
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,820
You must miss home, right?

330
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,100
You miss the taste of your home.

331
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,660
Grandma made you a home-cooked meal today.

332
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:49,780
So good.

333
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,780
Mei.

334
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,540
Come on.

335
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,620
Coming.

336
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,540
Lu Zhou.

337
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,420
Grandma made this dish today.

338
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,980
Have a try.

339
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,540
Have a try.

340
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,140
Yes, yes.

341
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:01,820
Eat more.

342
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,020
Eat more.

343
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,740
You won't be able to eat it when you're abroad.

344
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,860
Yes.

345
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,540
Lu Zhou can't eat it,

346
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,580
he doesn't know.

347
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:15,980
Eat this.

348
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,180
Lu Zhou, why don't you eat it?

349
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,980
Grandma can't even eat it.

350
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,180
Grandma.

351
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,060
Did you forget that

352
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,700
my brother is allergic to peanuts?

353
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,180
You're so mean.

354
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,220
Is there anything else?

355
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,340
It's okay, grandma.

356
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,660
I...

357
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,060
I'll eat chicken.

358
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,020
Come on.

359
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,620
Aunt is not prepared.

360
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,900
I'll prepare a pot for you.

361
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,500
We have one too.

362
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,340
It's okay.

363
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,380
Thank you.

364
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,140
Here.

365
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:50,980
Thank you, aunt.

366
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:51,660
Take it.

367
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:52,860
Don't take it.

368
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,660
Thank you.

369
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,740
It's so expensive.

370
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,340
Lu Zhou.

371
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,060
Here.

372
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,740
Come in.

373
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,620
Thank you.

374
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,380
Okay.

375
00:16:59,380 --> 00:16:59,980
Thank you.

376
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,500
Thank you.

377
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,420
Lu Zhou,

378
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,740
you've grown up.

379
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,620
It's hard to be a family member.

380
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,900
It's okay to drink alcohol.

381
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,260
It's okay to drink something

382
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,780
for kids.

383
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,500
Uncle is so kind.

384
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,260
I have something to do.

385
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,580
I've brought the tea.

386
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,700

392
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:22,900
Drink it.

393
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,340
Colorful

394
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:05,740

I'm so happy.

404
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,380
The fish is gone.

405
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,300
Where are you?

406
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,820
I'm so happy.

407
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,260
Come on.

408
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,780
Eat more.

409
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:36,660
Eat more.

410
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,660
Okay.

411
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,260
Thank you.

412
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:38,860
Come on.

413
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,860
You're welcome.

414
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,500
Cheers.

415
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:40,940
Cheers.

416
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,500
Grandma.

417
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,060
I really have to go.

418
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:43,700
This one.

419
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,580
Okay.

420
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,460
Dear brothers.

421
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:45,940
I might...

422
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,140
What's so important?

423
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,460
Can't you change the day?

424
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,340
Do you want to ruin everyone's life?

425
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,300
What's wrong?

426
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,300
Did I say something wrong?

427
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,100
Younger brothers.

428
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,620
I really have to go.

429
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,180
I'm done with this cup.

430
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,260
You can go.

431
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,340
Okay.

432
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,700
Okay.

433
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,540
Take your time.

434
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,300
Where are you going?

435
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,100
My baby.

436
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,100
Sister.

437
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,300
Why are you so drunk?

438
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,380
Why are you so drunk?

439
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,940
Chen Lu Zhou, you bastard.

440
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,740
I thought he loved you so much.

441
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,380
But you didn't even come to celebrate his birthday.

442
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:24,940
I announce

443
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,700
he's out.

444
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:27,500
Okay.

445
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,140
Out.

446
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:28,820
Out.

447
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,060
Bye.

448
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:31,980
Bye.

449
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,580
Bye.

450
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,060
Bye.

451
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,700
Bye.

452
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,460
Bye.

453
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,980
I'm on a bus to the internet.

454
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,780
I'm almost there.

455
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,140
Why don't you two go back first?

456
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,020
No.

457
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:40,980
My dad is here to pick me up.

458
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,940
You go back first.

459
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,420
No.

460
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,860
I want to be with you.

461
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:44,580
Are you okay?

462
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,460
Okay.

463
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,660
You go back first.

464
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:48,820
I'm here.

465
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,380
Take care.

466
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,580
I'm not leaving with us.

467
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,540
You two go back first.

468
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,180
My heart hurts.

469
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,900
Is it time for the emo again?

470
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,540
How do you know?

471
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,620
You have a new book.

472
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,660
So scary.

473
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,580
We're leaving now.

474
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,180
Okay.

475
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:07,980
Okay.

476
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,300
Send us a WeChat message.

477
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:09,820
Okay.

478
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,700
Bye.

479
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,180
Take care.

480
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:12,580
Okay.

481
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,660
Happy birthday.

482
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,020
Okay.

483
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,460
Bye.

484
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:14,900
Bye.

485
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,780
Bye.

486
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:16,900
Master, let's go.

487
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,660
Bye.

488
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,420
Happy birthday.

489
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:18,980
Bye.

490
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,500
Bye.

491
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,140
Let me tell you that

492
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,100
when you come here,

493
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,660
your thoughts on me will know that

494
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,860
I'm quite 다 sesleri.

495
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,400
Not really.

496
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,700
Only a kind of巧s super executive.

497
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,840
Kind fifteen conditions.

498
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,460
Only worth Oregon songs.

499
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,820
What I did in the mail

500
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,120
I added at the beginning of October.

501
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,480
So

502
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,180
the live streaming

503
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,660
have to be

504
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,140
short and quiet.

505
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:10,820
And

506
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,660
even it's a record,

507
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,060
no mind will survive.

508
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,900
Maybe

509
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,920
when I

510
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,580
speak about myself in detail,

511
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,900
Then you can go ahead.

512
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,780
I won't disturb you.

513
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,700
I don't have the phone number.

514
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,580
I'll hang up first.

515
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:25,900
Okay.

516
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,260
Good for you.

517
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,060
Xiao Jian.

518
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,380
Sahara!

519
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,900
Where are you going?

520
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,860
I need to talk to Miss Cai Yiyin.

521
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:17,860
Be careful.

522
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,860
They've left.

523
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,740
They've left.

524
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,220
Yes.

525
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:20,820
Thank you.

526
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,220

527
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,340
What should I do?

528
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,340
I really like her.

Sorry.

569
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:44,100
Let the moon shine

570
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:47,980
and drive away the throbbing hearts

571
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,620
The photos have died

572
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,940

574
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,800
That Mosquito

575
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,520
A shrub

576
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,660
seek to leave home

577
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,420
The first time I saw a girl with a white face, I was surprised.

578
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,420
I was surprised.

579
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,420
I was surprised.

580
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,420
I was surprised.

581
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,420
I was surprised.

582
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,420
I was surprised.

583
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,420
I was surprised.

584
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,420
I was surprised.

585
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,420
I was surprised.

586
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,420
I was surprised.

587
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,420
I was surprised.

588
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,420
I was surprised.

589
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,420
I was surprised.

590
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,420
I was surprised.

591
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,420
We miss each other as they love,

592
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,420
only him.

593
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,420
He is my favorite car driver.

594
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,420
He is acting man, too.

595
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,420
In the childhood.

596
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,620
When I see him, I miss him a lot.

597
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,640
Car dynamism

598
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,420
A guy Hooma

599
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,420
He use to be close to me.

600
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,720
한테

601
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,420
a boy

602
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,500
Let's welcome the new discovery.

603
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,500
Take a look at me.

604
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,340
Hold on.

605
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,540
Okay.

606
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,900
Go back and get clothes just in case.

607
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,060
Just this video doesn't require you to look for them.

608
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,260
Come here.

609
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,020
Why do I feel that you were quite different today?

610
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,480
You already saw it for yourself.

611
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,060
I'll go to the summer vacation.

612
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,060
I haven't seen the movie yet.

613
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,060
I still have a feeling of my legs.

614
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,060
This leg is so long.

615
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,060
I'll change it.

616
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,060
I'll change it.

617
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,060
I'll change it.

618
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,060
I'll change it.

619
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,060
I'll change it.

620
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,060
I'll change it.

621
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,060
I'll change it.

622
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,060
Did you die of a fever today?

623
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,060
I'm so tired.

624
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,060
Do you still want to watch it?

625
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,060
Yes.

626
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,060
Then I'll take you home.

627
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,060
No.

628
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,060
I just saw

629
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,060
the new clothes

630
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,060
that Pili Ke's father bought him.

631
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,060
But he wasn't happy for too long.

632
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,060
So he was sent to the dormitory

633
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,060
by his father.

634
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,060
What's wrong?

635
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,060
Can you still remember this?

636
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,060
I'll give you

637
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,060
a record of the Guinness World Record

638
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,060
that used to be used.

639
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,060
You didn't mention the record

640
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,060
in the recording.

641
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,060
Can you give me

642
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,060
the Guinness World Record?

643
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,060
Can you give me the Guinness World Record?

644
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,060
I'll take you home.

645
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,060
I have to take you home.

646
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,060
I'll take you home.

647
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,060
I have to take you home.

648
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,060
Did you see it just now?

649
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,060
A boy wants to hold the girl's hand.

650
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,060
But his hand is more nervous

651
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,060
than my mother-in-law's hand.

652
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,060
After all, like a papa,

653
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,060
you're so light and delicate.

654
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,060
How many can you hold?

655
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,060
They keep in contact

656
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,060
and keep in contact.

657
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,060
The process is not easy.

658
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,380
You want to stay, right?

659
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,780
Fine, I'll make it up for you.

660
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,180
You don't have enough hands.

661
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,740
I'll make it up for you.

662
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,220
Chen Yuzhao,

663
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,900
you're so fast.

664
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,460
Yes.

665
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:33,860
O Mm.

666
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,980
Wang Quan asked me to wechat

667
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:35,860
last night.

668
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,020
You passed?

669
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,700
I didn't control it.

670
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,540
He added one more time.

671
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:41,740
He asked me

672
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,180
whether you want to be a guest.

673
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:43,980
Hmm.

674
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:44,980
Tell me if you want to

675
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,060
do that,

676
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,220
I'll make 20%

677
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,140
off from the money of my job.

678
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,900
Why don't you makeflag for Li Ke?

679
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:52,660
шиеLi Ke?

680
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,500
Yeah.

681
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,500
Then do you want to

682
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,460
have a discussion with Wang Quan

683
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,640
and take the

684
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,180
cutoff from snug in my money?

685
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:58,780
Okay.

686
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,620
They can give you their own

687
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,820
Do you want to add something?

688
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,900
For example, you tell Li Ke

689
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,340
I will pay the bill

690
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,620
Or you give your own

691
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,660
Or I will go to Wang Quan

692
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,540
You really can't do that

693
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,740
Don't go to the gym with your head

694
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,780
Just work

695
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,260
You can't talk about it

696
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,500
But I can't make a black material

697
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,900
You are an artist

698
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,820
I can sell your black material with Zhiyangqi

699
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:30,140
And then we all sacrifice you

700
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,380
Don't worry, I will raise you

701
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,380
You still raise me

702
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,660
You took money and ran faster than anyone

703
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,300
Who doesn't know you

704
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,500
Do you want to know me so much?

705
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,700
No need

706
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,020
You can be safe

707
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,740
Oh my god

708
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,580
Hurry up

709
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,880
It's not good to be in the public

710
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,820
My dad is waiting for me there

711
00:30:59,140 --> 00:30:59,940
See

712
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,660
Xu

713
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,980
You are back

714
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,820
Didn't I tell you not to wait for me?

715
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,060
Why are you still waiting for me?

716
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,860
What did you eat last night?

717
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,860
Braised pork

718
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,220
Braised pork

719
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,620
Why is there no smoke?

720
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,740
What's the barbecue?

721
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,580
Now it's popular

722
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,660
No smoke

723
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,180
And there's that smell of kitchen

724
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,220
There's a peach smell

725
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,300
I'm allergic to peaches

726
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:36,820
You forgot

727
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,060
You are allergic to peaches

728
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,780
Hurry up and call back

729
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,740
Your grandpa is going to tell you

730
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,740
Happy birthday

731
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:42,700
Ok

732
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,460
Hurry up

733
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,380
Mr. impostor

734
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,220
Good night.

735
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,140
Are you sure that Jiaojiao is here with me?

736
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,620
Jiaojiao.

737
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,300
What did your dad say?

738
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,300
He said you were already on his side.

739
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,140
You should be more careful.

740
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:49,980
I'm not.

741
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,940
I'm going to look for you tomorrow.

742
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,140
You see me every day.

743
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,500
Are you tired?

744
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,380
Yes.

745
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,140
Let me explain.

746
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,900
I want to check the result of your computer.

747
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,620
After all, he forgot about me.

748
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,060
Okay. See you tomorrow.

749
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,140
Yang Qizhu.

750
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,540
What should I do?

751
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,140
The classmates who can't even hit the 8th liver

752
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,340
are all asking about our love details.

753
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,540
How can I find a boyfriend in the future?

754
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,140
What are you afraid of?

755
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,740
You can't get married in the future.

756
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,340
You can't even have a pig.

757
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,340
I don't want to.

758
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,140
I want to go to the Nigu.

759
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,140
You're thinking too much.

760
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,940
Nigu An doesn't have to take you.

761
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,540
Every researcher has his own way.

762
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,540
I...

763
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,340
What's going on?

764
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,540
Do you really like Cai Yingying?

765
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,140
Of course not.

766
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,540
You have a high taste in the eyes.

767
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,540
You don't know...

768
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,340
I like Cai Yingying.

769
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,740
Absolutely impossible.

770
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,540
Let's drink.

771
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,740
Let's drink.

772
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,540
Let's drink.

773
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:20,940
Let's drink.

774
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,140
What's that?

775
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:29,740
I...

776
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,540
I have something to do.

777
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,340
You can go first.

778
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,340
I'll go next time.

779
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,340
Let's go.

780
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,540
A'Zhu.

781
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,340
Mr. Lu is not feeling well today.

782
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,140
Why?

783
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,340
He was smiling at his phone just now.

784
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:45,940
Really?

785
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,740
Yes.

786
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,540
He was not smiling at his phone that day.

787
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,340
And he smiled today.

788
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,740
He was so sad.

789
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,140
Yes, I saw that too.

790
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,540
Really?

791
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,940
If I'm not wrong,

792
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:03,140
he's now being secretly in love with you.

793
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,940
Who's in love?

794
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,340
I'm in love.

795
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,140
I think that

796
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,140
looking at his phone,

797
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,340
he must be looking at his own photo.

798
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,740
He's still a single dog.

799
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,540
If you're curious,

800
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,740
you can click on my history search.

801
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,540
Let's see what I usually search.

802
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,540
Is that okay?

803
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,140
Yes.

804
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,340
Shi Zhi.

805
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,340
You must keep the desire to win.

806
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,140
You're the next one to get the award

807
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,940
for the next Nobel Prize in China.

808
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,540
You're a dog after you're in the middle of the road.

809
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,140
Let me drink with the dog.

810
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:53,740
Okay.

811
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:54,940
I'll get you a big dog

812
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,140
when I get there.

813
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:56,940
I'll get you a big dog.

814
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:57,940
Thanks.

815
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,540
Have a look.

816
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,340
Okay.

817
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,740
Let me do it.

818
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,340
Okay.

819
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:24,940
No.

820
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,140
I told you once.

821
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,140
You remembered it.

822
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,340
You're so good at it.

823
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,340
Did Luo Nan's 713A come from the white-out?

824
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,540
Why are you still closed?

825
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,540
I'm selling a coffin.

826
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,140
I don't know anything.

827
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,740
I'll know sooner or later.

828
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,540
Buy a ticket.

829
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:48,940
680.

830
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,340
A building.

831
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,740
Are you unhappy?

832
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:58,940
I heard

833
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,140
the winter in Beijing is very dry.

834
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,340
Will I bleed if I go there?

835
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,340
It's not the time to think about it.

836
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,340
Let's go.

837
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,740
Let's go to eat a big bone.

838
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,740
I'll go change first.

839
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,540
Wait for me.

840
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,540
It's not like that.

841
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,740
You're just talking.

842
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,540
Well,

843
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,140
how about tomorrow?

844
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,540
I'll be brave.

845
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,340
You're so beautiful.

846
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,340
I don't even want to look at the camera.

847
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,740
I'm so curious.

848
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,540
You're still playing with the boy.

849
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,540
You should be more reserved.

850
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,340
What do you mean?

851
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,540
You want to see it, right?

852
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:49,740
Fine.

853
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,940
I'm not reserved.

854
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,540
I'm cheap.

855
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,140
Is that okay?

856
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:53,940
Okay.

857
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,540
I won't talk to you anymore.

858
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,940
I have to go back tomorrow.

859
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,940
The next day,

860
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,140
I might be very busy.

861
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,340
There shouldn't be many chances to meet.

862
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,940
I'll go to Li Ke now.

863
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,940
Can I let him leave you?

864
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:09,940
No.

865
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,540
We signed the contract.

866
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,340
I'm leaving.

867
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,540
Don't miss me too much.

868
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:18,740
You...

869
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,540
Bye.

870
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,140
Who is it?

871
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,340
He ran after talking.

872
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,140
Read the book.

873
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,540
Don't leave.

874
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,140
I'm busy.

875
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:43,940
I know.

876
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,140
I'm busy.

877
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:50,940
I know.

878
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,540
I'm busy with the plane.

879
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,340
I'm going to rest in the parking lot.

880
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,740
Liu Tongqian.

881
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:14,540
Do you know him?

882
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,940
Sister Xu Zhi is in class.

883
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,140
Is this your name?

884
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,940
His name is Liu Tongqian.

885
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,540
You named him.

886
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,140
There are hundreds of thousands of people in China.

887
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,140
Who do you care?

888
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,340
Fine.

889
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,540
I'll call you your girlfriend.

890
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:32,740
Xiaoming.

891
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,740
Her name is Baofei.

892
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,740
Fine. You can call her.

893
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,140
Read the book.

894
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,740
Have a seat.

895
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,340
Tomorrow is the delivery.

896
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,740
Do you want to go with me?

897
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:53,740
No.

898
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,340
The weather is about to enter the competition.

899
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:58,740
The schedule is so full.

900
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,740
You think you don't know the rules?

901
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,940
Remember to sign a contract before the next event.

902
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,140
Fine.

903
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,140
I'll find someone to accompany me.

904
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,340
Okay.

905
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,540
If you go alone, you will be a dog.

906
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,340
I'm going to class. Good night.

907
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,340
President Zhi.

908
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:38,740
How is it?

909
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,540
The person who found it is with you.

910
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,540
I'm on my way here.

911
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,540
You're a dog.

912
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,540
What do you think?

913
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,740
Fine.

914
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,740
I think you will like it.

915
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:51,940
Really?

916
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,740
You won't deny me anymore?

917
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,740
Did you see any special works?

918
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,140
I'm a man.

919
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,340
There are rules in the world.

920
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,340
I can't control myself.

921
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,340
Are you trying to trick me?

922
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:10,140
It's a pity that you're here.

923
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:12,340
Fine.

924
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,940
Aren't you going to Donghuang in a few days?

925
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,340
Do you want to see me tonight?

926
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,340
I'll arrange it tomorrow.

927
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,340
Okay.

928
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:42,940
What's wrong?

929
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,340
I need to take a shower.

930
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,340
I'm very tired today.

931
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,340
Let me hug you for a while.

932
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,340
I'm not tired.

933
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,340
I'm just tired.

934
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,340
I'm not tired.

935
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,140
I'm just tired.

936
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,140
I'm just tired.

937
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,140
I'm just tired.

938
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,140
I'm just tired.

939
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,340
I'm just tired.

940
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,540
I'm just tired.

941
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,140
I'm just tired.

942
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,140
I'm just tired.

943
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,140
I've been working for two or three days.

944
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,140
I've been working for seven or eight years.

945
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,740
Do you think

946
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,740
I'm old enough to be a man?

947
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,740
Why do you have a coffee?

948
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:34,540
I bought a cup of coffee on the way back.

949
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:35,740
I accidentally spilled it.

950
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:38,540
Otherwise, I thought I'd spill it.

951
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,340
You're not working.

952
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,940
You're too close to your mouth.

953
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,140
You know that?

954
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,940
So you know how to play the piano.

955
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,540
What's wrong with Chen Luzhou?

956
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:01,340
Donghuang, open the door.

957
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:02,740
Your father is here.

958
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:03,740
What's wrong?

959
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:04,540
It's not easy.

960
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,740
I've been playing the piano for a long time.

961
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:09,040
Wait, what's wrong?

962
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,140
I'll get a Fashion医.

963
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,540
What should we do?

964
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:17,740
I came here alone.

965
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,340
Just go certificates.

966
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,540
What's that in the car?

967
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:24,540
Another one.

968
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,540
What do you want?

969
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,140
For你.

970
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,540
You're taking my child?

971
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:33,540
Nothing.

972
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:35,540
Is she dumped?

973
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,220
What do you think?

974
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,220
The ripened doll

975
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,460
makes me so sleepy.

976
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,380
If I don't do it...

977
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:43,460
What's this and a piece of trash?

978
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:44,180
The family's friend

979
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,580
has a message for you.

980
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:47,220
Do you know

981
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,260
we have a boy?

982
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,380
Never touched his.

983
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:52,500
Haven't seen his trip yet.

984
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,380
I can't read him.

985
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,180
Mr. Zhou.

986
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:00,540
I got work to do. I must get going.

987
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:01,460
Will you transfer the allowance

988
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:05,680
to this Давайте

989
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:07,940
for me?

990
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:12,900
Why are you drinking with me?

991
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:17,380
In this enraptured state home

992
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:18,620
Congratulations my new wife

993
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:30,980
Why did you just leave me here?

994
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:34,820
Because

995
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,340
I want to talk to my wife

996
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,540
You RMB

997
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:43,680
Extremely easy.

998
00:44:55,980 --> 00:45:01,220
Now many years have passed

999
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:13,740
自由来去遇过天气 世界太安静

1000
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:27,560
放了所有的瞬息 会有时光临
