3
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,640
In the end I mog tears

4
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,040
We couldn't stand with each other

5
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,720
Oh my god

6
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,240

00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,320
The Axe and Enrators

10
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,140

11
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,380
Pour in

12
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,180
The water in the park is warm.

13
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:56,860
Please take a look.

14
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,980
It's our hot chain.

15
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,420
I just heard that

16
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,300
someone is biting the dog.

17
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,180
No, no.

18
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,980
The dog bit the person.

19
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,220
You should go and have a look.

20
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,540
There must be something special.

21
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:08,940
Okay.

22
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,580
You need to find out.

23
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,300
Okay.

24
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:10,940
Okay.

25
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,340
What are you doing?

26
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,700
Nothing.

27
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,260
Show me your hand.

28
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,340
Give me a break.

29
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,860
Don't let your dad see it.

30
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,580
Come with me.

31
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,580
Come with me.

32
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,220
Are you okay?

33
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,340
I'm fine.

34
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,620
Mr. Zhi.

35
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,700
This is Chen Lu Zhou's mom.

36
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,620
You always said

37
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,500
Chen Lu Zhou's mom sounds like Aunt Lin.

38
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,500
I don't believe it.

39
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,180
I was lying

40
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,220
when the doctor said so.

41
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:17,900
How is it?

42
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,900
Finally, I met the person I want to see.

43
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,940
How are you feeling?

44
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,100
I always thought

45
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,620
he was like my mom.

46
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,940
But when I met him today,

47
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,500
I feel that he's different from my mom.

48
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:48,940
You're back.

49
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,580
What's wrong?

50
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,320
Why are you here again?

51
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,300
Tell me.

52
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,980
How many pairs of this?

53
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,940
You just bought yourself some bad luck.

54
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,500
Why are you still sad?

55
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,220
What's wrong?

56
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,020
Why didn't you tell me?

57
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:24,580
Yun'e Art Director

58
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,460
Abruptly

59
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,820

60
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,860
it's qiadas,

61
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,260

62
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,420
and its vital target

63
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,940
cannot be

64
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,560
Look

67
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,380
I'll tell you,

68
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,120
Impossible andGO

69
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,200
in your future life.

70
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,980
Thank you for my hard work.

71
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,840
Enjoy.

72
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,600
Do we talk about male sisters now?

73
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,280
How same as before,

74
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,640
don't you know?

75
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,680
Although my mother always Minnesota me,

76
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,440
she always possible to insult my error.

77
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,600
Aunt Lin Bad mouth,

78
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,800
Blue白 mind.

79
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,840
Chen Lu Zhong's mom,

80
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,200
even if it's personal.

81
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,040
But the talk is forced.

82
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,480
but the talk is forced.

83
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,840
Maybe because

84
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,480
Chen was adopted,

85
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,960
even though he often accuses me.

86
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,320
No wonder he said

87
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,160
being loved by the unmarried

88
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,040
is a little bit of luck.

89
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,320
I've made a deal with your dad.

90
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,120
The school and the professor

91
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,240
are very satisfied with you.

92
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,280
Now it's just a sign.

93
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,680
After I finish working these days,

94
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,920
I'll go to the ceremony with you.

95
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,720
I'm going.

96
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,920
I'm going.

97
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,920
I'm going.

98
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,120
I'm going.

99
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,920
I'm going.

100
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,920
Have you ever been out?

101
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,520
You've planned this for so long.

102
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,720
You suddenly said you wouldn't go out.

103
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,920
I can't go to Huada.

104
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,920
I can just go to the college

105
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,720
and have a cold drink.

106
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,920
Chen Luzhou,

107
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,520
now I'm sending you out of the country

108
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,920
to pay for your salary.

109
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,520
Don't make yourself so upset, okay?

110
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,720
If you're worried about it, it's okay.

111
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,920
I can sign a guarantee.

112
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,720
I promise I won't take anything from Chen Ji Sheng.

113
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,120
As long as I can stay in the country.

114
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,720
What nonsense are you talking about?

115
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,720
Even if your dad changes his mind,

116
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,720
I won't agree.

117
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,320
Song Jie, we have some good pictures.

118
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,320
Come and take a look.

119
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,120
Okay, I'll be right there.

120
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,920
As for that girl,

121
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,520
I still have to say that

122
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,520
no matter what kind of relationship you are,

123
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,720
it's best to have a cold drink before you leave the country.

124
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,920
Do you understand?

125
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,120
Cheers.

126
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,120
Cheers.

127
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,120
Thank you, boss.

128
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,320
Cheers.

129
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,060
Ox Sensitivity

130
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,620
Meeting You, Ren Qian.

131
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,220
Be careful.

132
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,640
It is inspecting the Here.

133
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,000
The electrical guitar is coming up.

134
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,080
Let's take a look.

135
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,120
Here.

136
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,380
How much?

137
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,160
The produce is available, you too.

138
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,280
Why is it so big?

139
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,660
For fun.

140
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,880
I'll send him back home.

141
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,680
It's raining so hard. How can you send him back?

142
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,720
It's okay. I have a umbrella.

143
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,520
Here.

144
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,920
Help me hold it. I'll put it on.

145
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,320
C L Z.

146
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,920
It's Lu Zhou.

147
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,920
Look.

148
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,920
Ms. Zhi.

149
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,120
Do you know what a flower is?

150
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,720
A flower is...

151
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,520
Although it's the summer day you hate,

152
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,720
you still have a lot of things to do.

153
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,920
I'm not sure.

154
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,920
You still have a lot of things to do.

155
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,120
You still have a lot of things to do.

156
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,120
How's your business?

157
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,920
Uncle Xu, why are you here?

158
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,720
You two are doing business.

159
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,120
I don't have to come and see you.

160
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,720
Welcome. Welcome.

161
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,920
I heard that there's no phone.

162
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,920
Is it a bracelet?

163
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,920
No.

164
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,720
It's a...

165
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,920
A fake customer.

166
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,120
It's here.

167
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,520
A woman?

168
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,720
Uncle Xu, you're so funny.

169
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,720
How could a fake customer be a man?

170
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,720
Well,

171
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,320
you can help me pack it.

172
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,920
Bye.

173
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:34,320
Oh...

174
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,520
A bowl of light and a bowl of rain.

175
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:47,920
Oh...

176
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,920
Who gave you up in the heart?

177
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,720
The answer is starting to wake up.

178
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,120
The rain is falling.

179
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,720
The face is getting closer.

180
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,520
The wind blows in the rain.

181
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,120
The mountain is flowing.

182
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,720
The sound of the river is very deep.

183
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,120
The star is dancing.

184
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,520
The world is listening.

185
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,520
The world is searching for me.

186
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,920
Why?

187
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,520
It won't be named after you.

188
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,520
I shouldn't be here.

189
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,920
Li automation Ma Z mornings the什么

190
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,520
Do you forget the technology?

191
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,520
Thank you.

192
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,720
Did you go to drink wine?

193
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,720
Still unhappy?

194
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,840
My love for you.

195
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,160
Is it okay if we kept our mother together in the letter?

196
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,960
Why aren't you talking about the important things?

197
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,680
Your mother said

198
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,600
that you have a family background.

199
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,040
Do you need....

200
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,080
something else?

201
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,040
If you want to answer my mother's question,

202
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,520
I haven't thought of

203
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,200
talking about her instructions.

204
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,840
You also saw

205
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,320
that she is a very awkward person.

206
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,480
It's okay.

207
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,600
I'm not here to see your mother.

208
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,720
Really?

209
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,720
Say it.

210
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,720
Last time, I asked for your service

211
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
and I lost my voice.

212
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,720
Xu knew about it.

213
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,720
He almost thought I was pregnant

214
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
and got you a knife.

215
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,720
I was scared.

216
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,720
Then I have to thank you.

217
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,720
The answer is not limited.

218
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,720
But I really need to

219
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
spend some money on you.

220
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,720
No, the one who was cut by the knife

221
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,720
is me.

222
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,720
What do you mean?

223
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,720
Xu was at home every day.

224
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,720
He was so loud that

225
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,720
I was so scared.

226
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,720
Do you know how many

227
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,720
I've lost to him?

228
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,720
Fine, say it.

229
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,720
How much do you want?

230
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,720
How much do you want?

231
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,720
I have 5 million.

232
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,720
Do you want it?

233
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,720
Just pay it.

234
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,720
It's a huge sum.

235
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,720
It's hard to pay it.

236
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,720
Are you ready to get married?

237
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,720
Of course not.

238
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,720
You're still young.

239
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,720
We haven't got married yet.

240
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,720
We're getting married at a young age.

241
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,720
I'm not getting married at a young age.

242
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,720
Marriage is a serious matter.

243
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,720
I didn't expect you to be so professional.

244
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,720
So don't talk about me anymore.

245
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,720
I don't want to misunderstand you again.

246
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,720
The first golden gift in my life.

247
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,720
Congratulations on the re-establishing of Lucy.

248
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,720
Thank you, Jiang.

249
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,720
For your treat.

250
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,720
Bai Ling?

251
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,720
It's him again.

252
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
I'm sorry.

253
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,720
I'm sorry.

254
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,720
I'm sorry.

255
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,720
I'm sorry.

256
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,720
I'm sorry.

257
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,720
It's him again.

258
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,720
Look.

259
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,720
Don't press the line.

260
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,720
I'm watching.

261
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,720
It's a bird.

262
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,720
It's a bird.

263
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,720
It's a bird.

264
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,720
Come on.

265
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,720
It's a bird.

266
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
It's a bird.

267
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,720
Don't open the line.

268
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,720
Don't open the line.

269
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,720
Open the cage.

270
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,720
Open the cage.

271
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,720
It's a bird.

272
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,720
Did the tiger-eating mushroom last time come out?

273
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,720
It's a good idea.

274
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,720
It's a bird.

275
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,720
Who said it's a bird?

276
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,720
Open the cage.

277
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,720
Hurry up.

278
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,720
Go and have a look.

279
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,720
They're all over.

280
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,720
It's raining today.

281
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,720
It's a coincidence that it's a hot pot.

282
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,720
It's raining.

283
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,720
It's not important.

284
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,720
It's a game.

285
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,720
Come on.

286
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,720
It's raining.

287
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,720
It's raining.

288
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,720
It's raining.

289
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,720
It's a good idea.

290
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,720
It's a good idea.

291
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,720
Remember to wear a umbrella.

292
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,720
It's okay.

293
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,720
It's a good idea.

294
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,720
I can have a look.

295
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,720
It's a good idea.

296
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,720
Don't hang up.

297
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,720
It's not hanging up.

298
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,720
It's a good idea.

299
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,720
It's a good idea.

300
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,720
I'm going to leave.

301
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,720
Open the cage.

302
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,720
Let's help him.

303
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,720
Save me, Jiang Cheng.

304
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,720
Hurry up.

305
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,720
He's going to catch me.

306
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,720
I don't know you.

307
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,720
Guys.

308
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,720
I have to go.

309
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,720
Let's go.

310
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,720
What are you doing?

311
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,720
What's going on?

312
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,720
Don't come in.

313
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,720
It's my cup.

314
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,720
My cup.

315
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,720
I've had it before.

316
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,720
I didn't notice.

317
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,720
You mean I'm the one who's been eating.

318
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,720
I'm happy.

319
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
It's okay.

320
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,720
Do you remember 5,000 and me?

321
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,720
This is a discount.

322
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,720
I'll give you a discount.

323
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,720
2,500.

324
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,720
Find me a WeChat.

325
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,720
I'll give you a discount.

326
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,720
I'll give you a discount.

327
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,720
How about a drink?

328
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,720
You'll give me 2,500.

329
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,720
Are you feeling better?

330
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,720
What else can I do?

331
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,720
Take me out for a ride?

332
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,720
The weather is bad.

333
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,720
Wait until the weather is good.

334
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,720
If I'm not happy,

335
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,720
I'll have a meeting with you in advance.

336
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,720
Then...

337
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,720
Don't do it again.

338
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,720
Let's watch a movie.

339
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,720
I'll send you back when it rains.

340
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,720
It's so hot.

341
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,720
It's so hot.

342
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,720
It's so hot.

343
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,720
It's so hot.

344
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,720
I'm not feeling well.

345
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,720
My neck is fine.

346
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
I'm not feeling well.

347
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,720
Go in and sleep.

348
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,720
Everyone is fine.

349
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,720
I feel like I'm in a hurry.

350
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,720
I'll stay here for a while.

351
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,720
Okay, it's okay.

352
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,720
It's raining soon.

353
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,720
Remember to drink.

354
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,720
Don't stay at home.

355
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,720
You still drink.

356
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,720
I'll go to the bathroom.

357
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,720
Here.

358
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,720
Have some meat.

359
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,720
Thank you.

360
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,720
What's the relationship between

361
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,720
Yizhou Xiaobai Ling and Chen Luozhou?

362
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,720
I think it's a good idea to write a letter.

363
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,720
It's a letter for you.

364
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,720
It's a water delivery.

365
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,720
According to my observation of Chen Luozhou,

366
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,720
most girls are eight years away.

367
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,720
Let's read it.

368
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,720
Who asked you to ask?

369
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,720
Xu Zhi.

370
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,720
What's wrong with me helping my sister?

371
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,720
Okay, okay.

372
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,720
It seems that we're in the same team.

373
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,720
Come on.

374
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,720
Don't be so hard on me.

375
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,720
Since the beginning,

376
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,720
what's the relationship between them?

377
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,720
Nothing.

378
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,720
She's Lucy's sister.

379
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
What about Yan Lanlin?

380
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,720
What about Chen Luozhou's brother?

381
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,720
How good is she?

382
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,720
She's really not bad.

383
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,720
Xiaobai Ling is Lucy's daughter.

384
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,720
She's the real sister of the eight-year-old.

385
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,720
If you dare to lie to me,

386
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,720
I don't believe you can marry Chen Qingqi.

387
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,720
Okay, I'll marry you.

388
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,720
But I think

389
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,720
your sister is quite straightforward.

390
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,720
Of course.

391
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,720
I can't watch

392
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,720
you get hurt by Chen Luozhou.

393
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,720
It's not certain who gets hurt.

394
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,720
It's not certain who gets hurt, okay?

395
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,720
Lucy is the pure and beautiful

396
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,720
and young man

397
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,720
who is so gentle and gentle.

398
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,720
Pure and gentle?

399
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,720
You don't believe me?

400
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,720
Wait a minute.

401
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,720
Take a look.

402
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,720
What's wrong with this?

403
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,720
Isn't it just a hundred-foot-long chair?

404
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,720
I'll send it to you.

405
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,720
It's my turn.

406
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,720
Don't touch me.

407
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,720
Don't touch me.

408
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,720
Don't touch me.

409
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,720
How many letters

410
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,720
of the July's denunciation

411
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,720
are there in the police?

412
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,720
Mr. Zhi,

413
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,720
check if Chen Luozhou

414
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,720
has a blue chair.

415
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,720
Don't touch me.

416
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,720
My boss is a July.

417
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,720
My boss is a July.

418
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,720
That's his special move

419
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,720
that he prepared for you.

420
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,720
Don't touch me like that.

421
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,720
I'll send it to you.

422
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,720
Don't touch me.

423
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,720
I'll send it to you.

424
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,720
Okay.

425
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,720
Jia Gu, if you want to hear me out,

426
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,720
contact me first.

427
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,720
I'll make a move for you.

428
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,720
Right.

429
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,720
I'm sorry.

430
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,720
You said it yourself.

431
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,720
Jia Gu posted a message

432
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,720
and made a move for me.

433
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,720
I'm a little tired now.

434
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,720
Can you help me

435
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,720
take a picture with me?

436
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,720
I'm sorry.

437
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,720
I cooked some ginger soup on the tea machine.

438
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,720
Drink it while you sleep.

439
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,720
When I was a cat,

440
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,720
my mom cooked this for me.

441
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,720
It's really good.

442
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,720
Yes.

443
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,720
I left you some water.

444
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,720
Remember to wash the nail and nail

445
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,720
and the tape tomorrow.

446
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,720
The world is too quiet

447
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:35,720
When all is yours

448
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,720
Who will be there

449
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,720
Who will be there

450
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,720
Be careful, I'm going to fall into the water

451
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,720
The cold air is so lonely

452
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,720
The world becomes a relationship

453
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,720
PPS

454
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,720
Finally, I want to say something to you.

455
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,720
There is no real despair in the world.

456
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,720
Only the picture of being trapped by thinking.

457
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,720
The world is too quiet

458
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:18,720
When all is yours

459
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,720
Who will be there

460
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,720
Be careful, I'm going to fall into the water

461
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,720
The world becomes a relationship

463
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,720

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,500
The developingventional

Be careful.

468
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,980
Be careful.

469
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,740
You're so hard at work.

470
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,820
If you don't mean that,

471
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:24,860
As long as that 봉

472
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,580
Is it the foundation of life?

473
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,980
Last night, I was eating the human army's 1000.

474
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,980
Someone gave you the fan-shaped hot pot on the toilet.

475
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,780
You're such a unlucky person. You can only eat the soup at home.

476
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,980
The earth dog only eats the fan-shaped hot pot.

477
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,980
Yes, you're the romantic one. You're always the autumn fan.

478
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,780
What are you doing?

479
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:02,580
In exchange, you're a new broadcaster. Aren't you going to check the score?

480
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,380
You should give the family a speed test.

481
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,180
It'll guarantee that you'll be able to check it for the first time.

482
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,780
This thing is light and light.

483
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:12,180
After you press it, the speed will be fast.

484
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,380
Why is it not working?

485
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,380
The clock is also quite fast.

486
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:26,980
Don't you understand? I'll go get some water.

487
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,740
When the power is off,

488
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,980
everything will go astray, even if you swipe it.

489
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,580
What are you doing?

490
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,380
Okay.

491
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,780
Your hand is not bright enough.

492
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:01,780
Take a good picture.

493
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,580
Okay.

494
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,380
Are you angry?

495
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,180
I just saw something.

496
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:28,780
Oh.

497
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,380
I thought you were happy.

498
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:35,780
No.

499
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,780
It's not that easy to be angry.

500
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,780
That's right.

501
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,380
I've never seen you angry.

502
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,780
So what's the point of making you do this?

503
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,580
You can try.

504
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,780
You're so idle.

505
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,780
You're idle.

506
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,180
It's bright.

507
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,780
Who will leave a message for you?

508
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,780
I'm just your tool for time.

509
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,180
I don't give tools to the main boss.

510
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:18,980
Really?

511
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,380
What's the point of doing that last night?

512
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,380
Hello?

513
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,980
How about writing a 3000-word little folk tale

514
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,580
to remember the story of the heart?

515
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,580
Xu Tianming.

516
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:28,780
Yes.

517
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,980
The one behind him.

518
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,180
Do you know how much light is in Qingzhang?

519
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,580
More than a thousand years.

520
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,180
I don't remember it clearly.

521
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,180
You'll know when you see it.

522
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,980
Xu is the one who loves me the most.

523
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,580
His wife was the main boss.

524
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,580
She was the main character.

525
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,580
She didn't even want to be promoted.

526
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,380
So the main boss can't write a 3000-word little folk tale.

527
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,980
But if I have money on you one day,

528
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,380
I'll write a 8000-word little folk tale to sue you.

529
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,780
You don't have to worry.

530
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:04,780
No way.

531
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,180
Teacher.

532
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,380
It's a day of tea.

533
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,780
It won't work tomorrow.

534
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,780
Can you think of a way?

535
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:11,980
Yes.

536
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,380
Okay.

537
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,180
Okay.

538
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,980
What did the client say?

539
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,180
He said he was a good man.

540
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,780
He couldn't send people out.

541
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,780
It's already 10 o'clock.

542
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,780
The client is coming.

543
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:31,980
It's okay.

544
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,380
The results are there.

545
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,580
We'll have the same tea.

546
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,380
I'll use the volume.

547
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,780
You can call me.

548
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,580
Yes.

549
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,380
I'll call you.

550
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,580
You check it.

551
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,180
No way.

552
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:05,980
Miss.

553
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:10,380
I shouldn't be here today.

554
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,180
It's okay.

555
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,780
Don't worry.

556
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,780
I have an extra round.

557
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,580
Hello.

558
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,180
What's up?

559
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,780
The old chicken in the world.

560
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,380
I don't know how to repair the electricity.

561
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,780
I haven't taught you this in the past.

562
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,180
The electricity is repaired.

563
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,380
It's just that the network is not good.

564
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,580
The tea master can't get in.

565
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,980
The phone can't get in.

566
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,580
My dad is a little confused now.

567
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,580
If you don't mind,

568
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,580
send me the whole thing.

569
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,780
I'll help you check.

570
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,780
I don't mind.

571
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,380
I even feel a little unwell.

572
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,180
I want to go to the main hall of the main hall for you.

573
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,380
Okay.

574
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,380
Who is not a puppy?

575
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,580
How can I sit still?

576
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:50,780
Yes.

577
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,180
I'm home by the Internet.

578
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:11,980
Wait a bit.

579
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,180
What?

580
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,780
What's wrong with Obction 600?

581
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,280
I can't use Internet more in the Voodoo아니's list.

582
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:16,780
Lady Chen.

583
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,780
To be honest, you look so tall.

584
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,260
I should be allowed to take the stroke.

585
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,540
Nonono.

586
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,620
Focus on your lips.

587
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,820
Your face

588
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,940
is the most attractive.

589
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:30,780
Keep the drawing.

590
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,280
Those....

591
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,980
You also need to starve to death

592
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,260
Then I won't have to worry about you.

593
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,540
You should get used to having slowly learned.

594
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,740
Nonsense!

595
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,700
Quick!

596
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,980
But I'm not afraid of losing my face.

597
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,980
I went up to the blind spot.

598
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,980
The result was that everyone was still in the middle of the game.

599
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,980
Later on, I found out that they didn't look at me.

600
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,980
They were looking at my teacher behind me.

601
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,980
Then why did you go up there?

602
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,980
Because I look pretty.

603
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,980
Because the teachers came to see me.

604
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:07,980
How can I say this?

605
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,980
Don't dare to say it again.

606
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,980
The lantern vase is still in the first place.

607
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,980
Fine.

608
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,980
Don't look at this. You're talking to me in a gold bar.

609
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,980
How much is the number?

610
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,980
I sent you the message.

611
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,980
Don't tell me the number if it's number 6008.

612
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,980
Is it a self-selection?

613
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,980
It's a self-selection.

614
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,980
I'm better than Sam.

615
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,980
I'm a total of 309.

616
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,980
Sam's grades can't be considered a reference.

617
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,980
It's all to add confidence to you.

618
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,980
The test papers are all in the list.

619
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,980
Hello?

620
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,980
Why aren't you talking?

621
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,980
Let's wait for Hua to call.

622
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,980
The self-selection is 738.

623
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,980
Congratulations on your first time to the architecture teacher.

624
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,980
Really?

625
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,980
What about you? Did you miss your own?

626
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,980
I missed it.

627
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,980
I missed it.

628
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,980
I missed it.

629
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,980
Did you miss your own?

630
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,980
I want to know.

631
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,980
Do you want to say it?

632
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,980
It's okay if you don't want to say it. You're leaving the country.

633
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,980
713.

634
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,980
It's okay to do it.

635
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,980
It's okay.

636
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,980
But it's considered a test if I don't get 785.

637
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:56,980
You guys are so crazy.

638
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,980
Chen Luzhou.

639
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,980
Can you check the score of one person?

640
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,980
He helped me a lot in the process.

641
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,980
I just want to see if he has any problem.

642
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,980
No need to explain.

643
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,980
Send me the message.

644
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:18,980
Forget it.

645
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,980
It seems that I can't find the score of someone else.

646
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,980
With you.

647
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,980
I'll hang up now.

648
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,980
Xu is still in a hurry. Thank you for today.

649
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,980
It looks beautiful.

650
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,980
How is it?

651
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,980
How is it?

652
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,980
I found it.

653
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:02,980
Qi Feng.

654
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,980
Qingda is actually pretty good.

655
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,980
You can keep it.

656
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,980
It's worth the price.

657
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,980
It's worth the price.

658
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,980
The power station I bought last time is good.

659
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,980
It's good.

660
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,980
It's not worth it.

661
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,980
Can you go to Beijing?

662
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,980
How much?

663
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,980
738.

664
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,980
738?

665
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,980
If you don't say anything, it's okay.

666
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,980
738.

667
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,980
My daughter is big and beautiful.

668
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,980
Is my father too excited?

669
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,980
If your mother knows,

670
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,980
she will be happy too.

671
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,980
Good.

672
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,980
We must do a big celebration.

673
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,980
We will invite all the people we know.

674
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,980
Let's celebrate together.

675
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:12,980
No need.

676
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,980
We don't have a garden yet.

677
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,980
We should not be so close.

678
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,980
It's a secret.

679
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,980
To the right.

680
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,980
To the right.

681
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,980
Not enough.

682
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,980
To the right.

683
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:39,980
I'm right.

684
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,980
You blame me?

685
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,980
I heard Xu Zhi is the first one in their school.

686
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,980
Do you know the score?

687
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,980
No.

688
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:52,980
I do.

689
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,980
The first one in the Rui Army is a middle school.

690
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,980
Understand?

691
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,980
Why?

692
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,980
It's definitely a famous trend

693
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,980
even if it's in the first grade.

694
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,980
I ordered delivery.

695
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,980
I'll go and see.

696
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,980
Okay.

697
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,980
I'm hungry.

698
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,980
I'll start the game.

699
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,980
Your delivery.

700
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,980
I didn't order delivery.

701
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,980
You ordered delivery?

702
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,980
You must have sent it wrong.

703
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,980
What?

704
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:33,980
It's delicious.

705
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:34,980
It's delicious.

706
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,980
If Zhu Yangqi opened the door just now,

707
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,980
you would have been in trouble.

708
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:41,980
If he opened the door for me,

709
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,980
I would have been in trouble.

710
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,980
What are you doing here,

711
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:46,980
assistant director Xu?

712
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,980
Didn't you say you're not here to eat dog?

713
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,980
I'm here to cook for you.

714
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,980
I'm here to talk to you about the支援.

715
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,980
I don't think it's too big.

716
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,980
But it's too far from Beijing.

717
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,980
Why don't we go to Shanghai?

718
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,980
Shanghai's major architecture is the most beautiful.

719
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:05,980
And the ticket to Beijing is 600%

720
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,980
and the ticket to Shanghai is only 100%.

721
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,980
Qingying,

722
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,980
I don't mind the car ticket problem.

723
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,980
Qingying,

724
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:17,980
your eyelashes are long.

725
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:21,980
What about eyelashes?

726
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,980
What are you talking about?

727
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,980
What did you say about that girl?

728
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:26,980
Xu Yuzhi, right?

729
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,980
Stop it.

730
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,980
Okay, let's go.

731
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:30,980
Let's go.

732
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,980
Really.

733
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:39,980
Who are they?

734
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,980
They've ruined our Tanxu.

735
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,980
They're so young now.

736
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,980
I told them to let the kids stay at home.

737
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:50,980
But they said they were students of the third grade.

738
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,980
They're good at it.

739
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,980
They're not blame you.

740
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,980
Enough.

741
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,980
Let's go.

742
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:56,980
Let's go.

743
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:57,980
Why are we here in this place?

744
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,980
Here.

745
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,980
Let's go.

746
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,980
So who is It hippNo?

747
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,100
I'm sorry.

748
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,020
Do you want to celebrate the birthday of Xu Zhi and Cai Yingying?

749
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,060
Sorry.

750
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,980
You were fast enough.

751
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,180
You called Xu Zhi here.

752
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,780
That's all about Cai Yingying.

753
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,620
Yingying seems to be displeased.

754
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,980
She doesn't look displeased.

755
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,220
Let me show you.

756
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:57,940
Celebrate the birthday.

757
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,020
You must celebrate it.

758
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,220
I'll do it.

759
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:04,820
I'll do it.

760
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,740
Let's go in and wait.

761
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,380
Let's go.

762
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,300
Come on.

763
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,060
Cheers.

764
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:19,980
Come on.

765
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,700
Cheers.

766
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,460
Have you decided where to put the wish?

767
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:30,300
What are we going to do?

768
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:32,860
I want to learn from Tian Hawai,

769
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,140
whether it's a big蝶.

770
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,700
I don't think so.

771
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,860
I'll travel around

772
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,020
the vast majority of the Yakais.

773
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,100
No情's coming.

774
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:48,760
哇!

775
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:53,700
We're going to bondspor, right?

776
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,660
Go for it.

777
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,660
I'll play the back.

778
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,660
Give me a hit.

779
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,660
I'm dying.

780
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,660
You're not playing the back.

781
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,660
I'll play the back.

782
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,660
I can't even get into college.

783
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,660
You don't let me play games.

784
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,660
Fine. Fine.

785
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:15,660
I'll give you a hug.

786
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,660
Look.

787
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,660
You'll die in a minute.

788
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,660
I know. I know.

789
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,660
I know.

790
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,660
This.

791
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,660
This.

792
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,660
I'll...

793
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,660
Let him fly.

794
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,660
Don't fly.

795
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,660
You can't fly now.

796
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,660
You're out of screen.

797
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,660
Look.

798
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,660
Hurry.

799
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,660
Pick it up.

800
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,660
Come on.

801
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,660
I'll do it on my left hand.

802
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,660
I want that.

803
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,660
I want that skin.

804
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,660
You want this?

805
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,660
I'll help you.

806
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:43,660
Sit down.

807
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,660
For me.

808
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,660
Thank you.

809
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,660
It's a little painful at home.

810
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,660
I checked the record score of the previous year.

811
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,660
The quality of the Chinese film is not bad.

812
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,660
But the architecture of Chinese film

813
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,660
may be a little risky.

814
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:12,660
The architecture

815
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,660
is very different from other architecture schools.

816
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:18,660
Other than the architecture

817
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,660
there will be many other professional schools.

818
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,660
Think about it before the Tianzhi Academy.

819
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,660
You can find out the information.

820
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:24,660
You can't know it clearly.

821
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,660
Okay.

822
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,660
If you need anything,

823
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,660
you can use my computer to find it.

824
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,660
Thank you.

825
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,660
Please.

826
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:25,660
I'm here to get rid of the weather.

827
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:31,660
The world is too quiet.

828
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:38,660
All the sound of the wind

829
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:44,660
will be in time.

830
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,660
The wind is blowing.

831
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,660
Be careful.

832
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,660
I'm calm.

833
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,660
The air in the ice

834
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:00,660
becomes a concern.

835
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,660
What's the problem?

836
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:13,660
I feel the sound of the wind.

837
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:18,660
Please push me to the world.

838
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:23,660
Please save me.

839
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:27,660
The future is moving.

840
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:30,660
Because you are the wind.

841
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:33,660
The lonely heart is singing.

842
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:38,660
The night is chasing.

843
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:42,660
We are so painful.

844
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:46,660
Be careful.

845
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:53,660
If you are the one.

846
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:00,660
The future is moving.

847
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:03,660
Because you are the wind.

848
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,660
The love is missing several times.

849
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:11,660
Only then can we be brave and fighting.

850
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:15,660
After the storm,

851
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:19,660
we will go back to the village.

852
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:24,660
We won't retreat.

853
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:28,660
In your eyes,

854
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:32,660
I see myself.

855
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,660
Into you.

856
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:39,660
Into you.
