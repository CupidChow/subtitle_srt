1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,580
Moonshine

2
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:49,400
Y

3
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,080
To find Xu Dacian for your wonderful mom's first love

4
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,960
Chang Daowen, Qu Huang Ji

5
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,740
And the亞ocusthenics

6
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,100
Can use my computer for pregnanле

7
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,220
หม

8
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,980
Let me do it

9
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,960
Mom!

10
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,240
You can still play violin?

11
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,240
I learned it when I was little.

12
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,680
My grandpa has a violin too.

13
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,800
But he can't play it.

14
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,960
My grandpa

15
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,480
always plays the violin

16
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,880
for him

17
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:41,600
in the yard.

18
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm so sorry.

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,800
Do you know that?

20
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,440
I couldn't understand

21
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,800
why my grandpa was so bad at it.

22
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,920
My grandma was still playing it.

23
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:48,800
Why?

24
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,440
When we were 80,

25
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,720
if we were still alive,

26
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,600
you'd give me a hand.

27
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,040
I'll tell you the answer.

28
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,720
I won't give you a hand

29
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,880
when you're 80.

30
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,120
Then who will you give it to?

31
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,680
Who knows if I'm single or old?

32
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,640
If I'm old,

33
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,640
I'll give it to an old friend.

34
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,600
If I'm not old,

35
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,160
I'll give it to someone else.

36
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,120
I'm so sorry.

37
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,880
You press this.

38
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,560
You press this button.

39
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,560
Yes, you're...

40
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,320
You press this button.

41
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,520
I can't do anything.

42
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,840
I'm so bad at games.

43
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,640
You're so good at it.

44
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,680
Come on. Let me do it.

45
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,640
I'm kidding.

46
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,480
I mean it.

47
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,480
Don't go to your heart.

48
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,240
Actually, you...

49
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,640
I'm good at it.

50
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,120
I was on the phone the other day.

51
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,440
I spent my days playing the violin.

52
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,200
I didn't have any plans.

53
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,880
I didn't even dare to cry.

54
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,120
That's right.

55
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,120
I'm not a bad student.

56
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,640
You can go to university

57
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,960
if you want to.

58
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,400
But what about me?

59
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,760
It's not good.

60
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,200
You should just take another exam.

61
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,320
Some people can't do well.

62
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,840
They have a chance to get a year's salary.

63
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,520
I can't study at all.

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,840
I can't do anything for a year.

65
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,520
Unless I can change my life.

66
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,560
Don't you envy me

67
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,680
to get a year's salary?

68
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,080
Why don't you try a new exam?

69
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,720
A new exam?

70
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,480
Me?

71
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,160
I can't do anything.

72
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,440
I can't do everything.

73
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,640
I can't do anything.

74
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,320
I've been in the club for a long time.

75
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,400
I can't do anything else.

76
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,040
What should I do?

77
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,040
Don't say that.

78
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,000
I think

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,680
you're really good at it.

80
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,760
Especially when you're against someone.

81
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,640
You're so thoughtful.

82
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,880
You're so smart.

83
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,640
I think you can try

84
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,720
to be a professional in the club.

85
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,240
Are you jealous or are you scolding me?

86
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,520
Really?

87
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,800
And I think

88
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,480
the price is also limited.

89
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,720
Why don't you go to the supplementary class

90
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,520
and try it?

91
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,800
What if you find the right way?

92
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,320
How about the design of the forest and the police?

93
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,320
I wanted to learn this

94
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,720
from the director of the forest and the building.

95
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,840
I think the design of the forest

96
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,360
should be interesting.

97
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,480
I thought about

98
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,680
buying a big tree

99
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,880
with a garden

100
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,160
and then design it myself.

101
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,000
Have you decided?

102
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,840
Since it's my favorite profession,

103
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,680
I should try it no matter what.

104
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,640
And I'm confident that I can choose.

105
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,640
Is this you?

106
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,200
Here you are.

107
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,480
The album.

108
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,920
You can use these details

109
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,560
when you are learning科.

110
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,640
Thank you.

111
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,640
What about you?

112
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,640
Have you ever been out?

113
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,640
I can't go to Huada.

114
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,640
I can go to the international university

115
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,640
and study in the cold.

116
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,640
If you don't feel at ease,

117
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,640
I can sign a guarantee.

118
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,640
I promise I won't take anything from Chen Jisheng.

119
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,640
As long as I can stay in China.

120
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,640
What nonsense are you talking about?

121
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,640
Even if your dad changes his mind,

122
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,640
I don't agree with that.

123
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,640
I'm going abroad.

124
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,640
I haven't got my first grade yet.

125
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,640
But I think it's okay to go to the university

126
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,640
because of your grades.

127
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,640
I'm thinking about going to the international university.

128
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,640
The house is all set.

129
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,640
What a pity.

130
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,640
I was thinking of going to the same city.

131
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,640
In this case,

132
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,640
if we don't have anything to do,

133
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,640
we can go to your school.

134
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,640
I'm not sure.

135
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,640
I don't think so.

136
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,640
I just want to go to Beijing.

137
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,640
I'm going to Beijing.

138
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,640
I've met a new friend.

139
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,640
I'm going to love Sisu soon.

140
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,640
I'll forget about her soon.

141
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,640
Who said I was going to Beijing?

142
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,640
I might go to Shanghai,

143
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,640
or Hangzhou.

144
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,640
Okay.

145
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,640
I'll forget anyway.

146
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,640
But when I get there,

147
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
I won't tell you

148
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,640
which school I'm going to.

149
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,640
Don't tell me

150
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,640
where you've been.

151
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,640
Why are you playing the ball?

152
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
Xu Zhi will definitely go to China.

153
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,640
I think he'll stay in Beijing.

154
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,640
Help me look after him.

155
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,640
Look after him?

156
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,640
Let's see if he has any boyfriend.

157
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,640
I don't care about that.

158
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,640
It's a girl.

159
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,640
It's a relationship.

160
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,640
Who cares?

161
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,640
It doesn't matter if he has a boyfriend.

162
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
Don't let him get bullied.

163
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,640
He can be friends with you.

164
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,640
Okay.

165
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
I'll send you a message

166
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,640
that he's always on the side of the sea.

167
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,640
It's a photo of him

168
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,640
being so sweet and kissy.

169
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
Okay.

170
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,640
I'll send you a message.

171
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,640
Why did you suddenly

172
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,640
come out to hang out today?

173
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,640
The TV station is going to have a interview.

174
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,640
The interview is 30 years old.

175
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,640
Xu Zhi asked me to buy a new suit.

176
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,640
Then when the interview is out,

177
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,640
we'll have to

178
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,640
have a tour of the whole hospital.

179
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,640
I'll go buy some drinks.

180
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,640
I'll wait for you here.

181
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,640
Okay.

182
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,640
Welcome to Guanyin.

183
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,640
Please have a look.

184
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,640
Hello.

185
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,640
Hello.

186
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,640
Can you send me a package?

187
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,640
Is it on the outside?

188
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,640
It's the same.

189
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,640
That's fine.

190
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,640
But it's a little late today.

191
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,640
I'll send it to you tomorrow.

192
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,640
Okay.

193
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,640
Please have a look at the bill first.

194
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,640
Okay.

195
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,640
238 yuan.

196
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,640
I'll pack it for you.

197
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,640
Okay.

198
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,640
Xu Zhi.

199
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,640
Come here.

200
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,640
You're not going to admit it so soon?

201
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,640
No.

202
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,640
I didn't recognize you just now.

203
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,640
I'll give you a few days later

204
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,640
to get more training and training.

205
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,640
You have a plan.

206
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,640
But

207
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,640
you'll be on the exam.

208
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,640
You have to treat me to a big meal.

209
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,640
Do you hear me?

210
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,640
I'm so tired.

211
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,640
I'm going to eat a big meal.

212
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,640
What?

213
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,640
The water is too good.

214
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,640
Do you want a bottle?

215
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,640
It's right there.

216
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,640
What's going on?

217
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,640
Why are you so quiet?

218
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,640
What's going on?

219
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,640
I've explained to my parents.

220
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,640
I've solved the problem

221
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,640
of my own mentality.

222
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,640
It has nothing to do with you.

223
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,640
They won't trouble you.

224
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,640
Congratulations.

225
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,640
You've done a good job.

226
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,640
Actually,

227
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,640
even if I didn't make it to the market,

228
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,640
I wouldn't be able to get your score.

229
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,640
What are you going to do?

230
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,640
Do you plan to do it again tomorrow?

231
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,640
Do you feel

232
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,640
I'm not qualified?

233
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,640
Tan Xue,

234
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,640
with your career,

235
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,640
as long as you can adjust your mentality,

236
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,640
it's not a problem to do anything.

237
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,640
How's the front line?

238
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,640
The front line?

239
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,640
It's a little bit hard.

240
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,640
It's like

241
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,640
talking about the hospital.

242
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,640
What?

243
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,640
Tan Xue is trying to

244
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,640
get rid of him?

245
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
I didn't hear it clearly.

246
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,560
Correct.

247
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,000
Did you just say

248
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,500
that I helped you

249
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:43,200
with your

250
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,120
Tamer's Zero Zalepiecy?

251
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,300
What happened

252
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,200
if you were playing an intercourse?

253
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,600
Do you think

254
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,580
playing the water award

255
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:55,340
would be useful?

256
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:55,920
Think about it

257
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,600
If Tan Xu knows that he's going to Beijing,

258
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,680
Tan Xu will also report the campus of Beijing.

259
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,880
What will you do then?

260
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,360
What do you want to say?

261
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,400
Just look at it.

262
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,600
If you can, just put this on the table.

263
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,280
Okay.

264
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,280
Ayou.

265
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,640
Fine.

266
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,640
I'll send it to you.

267
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,480
An Yu, are you welcoming me into the water?

268
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,240
Gee, you can check your social security.

269
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,480
Write down these two things.

270
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,080
You're doing Miss Purify.

271
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,960
When do you want to open this house?

272
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,240
I want to play that.

273
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,240
Go ahead.

274
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,840
Go ahead.

275
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,480
Me?

276
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,200
You go first.

277
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,680
You little bastard.

278
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,240
If you don't want to play, I'll go first.

279
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,400
No one will stop you.

280
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,000
I'll wait for you in front.

281
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,920
The End

282
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,480
When we are 80 years old,

283
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,760
if we are still alive,

284
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,560
you hold my hand.

285
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,840
I'll tell you the answer.

286
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,560
Mr. Jiong

287
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,680
蛙

288
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,480
Useless

289
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,960
You're...

290
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,800
Are you OK with that?

291
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,880
No, I'm fine.

292
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,920
You're our brother.

293
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,400
We all see you everywhere.

294
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,320
Tomorrow...

295
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,360
don't get wasted on me.

296
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,840
Look,

297
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,980
Missasty is

298
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,300
happy and assume

299
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:24,940
Thanks.

300
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,780
Is that you?

301
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,340
Why are you so sad?

302
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,300
Fine.

303
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,800
I'm waiting for the dawn.

304
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,400
The moon is passing through the trees.

305
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,400
Do you have any recommendations for the notebook for college students?

306
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,600
Did you see Xu Zhi's friend circle?

307
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,300
It's not you, right?

308
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,300
I'm lying.

309
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,600
The moon and the moon are not the same.

310
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,300
I will always be by your side.

311
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,400
Ten thousand stars

312
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,400
are looking for the perfect memory

313
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,900
and chasing after the eyes.

314
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,900
Ten thousand rain drops

315
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,700
are like memories in the universe

316
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,300
that fall into my heart.

317
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Hello.

318
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,100
Who's lying?

319
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,500
What?

320
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,900
What did you say?

321
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,500
Friend circle.

322
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
But I didn't see it.

323
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,200
I thought you were busy playing outside

324
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,800
and didn't want to play with your friends.

325
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,800
So you saw it long ago.

326
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,600
But you didn't see it.

327
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,600
Right?

328
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,000
Didn't you say that the thing that was withdrawn was not related to me?

329
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,600
The truth is so good.

330
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,000
You can remember the things that were withdrawn in two seconds

331
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,500
without missing them.

332
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,500
Why can't you see the key to the friend circle?

333
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,500
Let me see.

334
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,500
Then you have to practice hard.

335
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,500
I'll make money.

336
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,000
Maybe you can get a few jobs

337
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,500
when you're 80.

338
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,500
I'm hanging up.

339
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,500
A long encounter.

340
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,500
Heartbeats and heartbeats.

341
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,500
I have a moment with you.

342
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,500
Let's make every part of it

343
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,500
a reunion.

344
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,500
Tomorrow is the third day of the third month.

345
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,900
There's a special shoot.

346
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,900
You can go there.

347
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Can you refuse?

348
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,500
Two thousand for the old man.

349
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Okay.

350
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,300
Sit with hu mu.

351
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,400
Go.

352
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,100
Hello.

353
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,900
Sorry.

354
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,020
I found something wrong almostOK.

355
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,200
my days this here.

356
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,200
No need to tell.

357
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:49,720
Which side

358
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,000
You can change it

359
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,200
with the same então.

360
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,200
Letles to me.

361
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,700
Please take care.

362
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:58,700
okay

363
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,000
How music

364
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
What do you like?

365
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,160
I can't let go of something.

366
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,560
And I ate a little screw in the middle.

367
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,400
I feel like you're not as free as when you were little.

368
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,000
Think about your childhood.

369
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,960
My beauty is endless.

370
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,920
You have a lot of eyes.

371
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,640
Teacher, forget it.

372
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,880
Why are you so heartless?

373
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,240
Let me tell you.

374
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,920
When there is only something in your heart,

375
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,640
you will care about your face.

376
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,360
Do you know why you are so obsessed with me?

377
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,320
You thought you were heartless?

378
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,200
No.

379
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,760
I cared about you and mom a lot when I was little.

380
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,880
And my little goldfish.

381
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,960
How can that be the same?

382
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,720
All your performances are

383
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,680
like, love, and appreciation.

384
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,080
But

385
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,200
there is a feeling that is different.

386
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,480
Once you do something bad,

387
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,240
maybe that person will not like you.

388
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,960
Why do I feel that you are so beautiful?

389
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,800
Why do I feel that you have a ghost?

390
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,120
What about you?

391
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,000
No.

392
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,800
Anyway,

393
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,080
you are actually perfect.

394
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,520
You are beautiful and you are good at it.

395
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,760
As long as you stand on the stage,

396
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,760
all the lights and camera will be yours.

397
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,160
As long as you don't bow your nose and face,

398
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,880
that's fine.

399
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,120
When did I bow?

400
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,040
Yes.

401
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,000
Right on this phone.

402
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,320
I will never forget it.

403
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,760
No.

404
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,960
You have a boyfriend in the future.

405
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,240
I must let him see this photo.

406
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,200
If he only accepts the bright eyes,

407
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,880
we can't take this person.

408
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:42,920
Because

409
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,560
love will eventually take the fish eggs

410
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,320
and return to your garden.

411
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,720
This is the most important part.

412
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,560
Of course.

413
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,080
If you want to be shocked

414
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,080
and destroy this photo,

415
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,600
we women can still discuss it.

416
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,120
Take care.

417
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,240
What do you want to eat tonight?

418
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,760
Red-burned mobile phone.

419
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,320
Red-burned mobile phone is expensive.

420
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,040
Where are you going?

421
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,800
To the city.

422
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,280
B,

423
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,360
to Huadao.

424
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,520
Where are you going?

425
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,320
Which hospital do you want to go to?

426
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,000
It must be Huadao.

427
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,840
It's all right.

428
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,160
It's not going to work.

429
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,080
University.

430
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:19,880
Where are you going?

431
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,320
Stanford.

432
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,320
My mom asked me to go.

433
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,160
I must go.

434
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,200
I can't go.

435
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,080
Fine.

436
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,240
Bro.

437
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,640
Don't fight.

438
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,800
I've made you lose your temper.

439
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,040
Well.

440
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,320
Sorry.

441
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,640
I didn't mean it.

442
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,120
I...

443
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,440
I'm a little nervous.

444
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,120
The recording hasn't started yet.

445
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,960
Relax.

446
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:46,880
Hello.

447
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,360
I'm Yang Yijian, the deputy.

448
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,920
Xu Zhi, Rui Jun.

449
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,800
No wonder you don't know them.

450
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,920
They're all from the same school.

451
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,760
The top student.

452
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,800
I heard he's the top student

453
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,840
in our whole province.

454
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,640
Li Ke.

455
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,200
Plus the score of the competition,

456
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,120
he must have scored 750 points.

457
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,760
Really?

458
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,080
He's not the best.

459
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,320
They have a cow.

460
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,040
He scored 700 points.

461
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,000
He scored 700 points?

462
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,400
No choice.

463
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,520
He scored 700 points.

464
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,280
What a pity.

465
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,240
He didn't come today.

466
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,840
I don't think he's in the list.

467
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,560
I wanted to see

468
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,560
what he looks like

469
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,640
when he's so high-ranked.

470
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,520
And our class teacher

471
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,760
has a special score of his.

472
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,360
Plus the 60 points he chose.

473
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,680
He must have scored 750 points.

474
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,400
That's true.

475
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,640
By the way,

476
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,640
after the recording ends,

477
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,600
let's go to the concert together.

478
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,680
With him?

479
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,640
Yes.

480
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,280
We're not familiar with them.

481
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,280
We'll definitely not be ourselves.

482
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,760
But just now,

483
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,120
a girl came to tell us

484
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,360
that she's giving the money to the competition.

485
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,560
She said after the recording ends,

486
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,520
let's go to the concert together.

487
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,280
How much is it?

488
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,000
3,000.

489
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,480
Eat.

490
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,320
You must eat.

491
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,320
I'm a fool.

492
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,120
Eat.

493
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,200
I want to eat.

494
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,080
3,000 for the money.

495
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,680
What do you want to eat?

496
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,760
I'll take it.

497
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,680
There is.

498
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,240
It's meat.

499
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,760
I want to eat seafood.

500
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,440
No, seafood.

501
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,160
seafood is not agreeable.

502
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,080
seafood is too good.

503
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,160
So, at the end of the show,

504
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,040
I want to ask again

505
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,920
to Li Ke.

506
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,400
You've achieved such a good result.

507
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,560
Do you have any good suggestions

508
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,040
for your future students?

509
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,560
First of all,

510
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,400
you have to have

511
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,160
a mysterious opponent.

512
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,880
With such an opponent,

513
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,880
you've achieved half of it.

514
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,480
Because of your mysterious opponent,

515
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,560
he can always

516
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,360
make a mysterious achievement in the exam.

517
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,240
Such a person

518
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,400
will always encourage you to move forward.

519
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,000
That's what I said.

520
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,760
God Yuen.

521
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,760
It seems that you are good

522
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,760
with this god.

523
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,200
Yes, we are good friends.

524
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,200
Actually, he is a very interesting person.

525
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,680
When I was in third grade,

526
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,960
I didn't pass him a few times.

527
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,600
Once, I finally passed him.

528
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,760
Then I told him to leave the school

529
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,000
and say he shouldn't be divorced.

530
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,600
This is to change to another classmate.

531
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,080
They must remember to make fun of me.

532
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,360
But he

533
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,560
won't think that I'm talking to him.

534
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,240
Maybe this is the benefit

535
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,360
of being a friend of the strong heart.

536
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,640
He is a opponent,

537
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,040
but he is also a good friend.

538
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,360
I learned a lot from him.

539
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,280
But they often play with each other.

540
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,320
Once,

541
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,920
it was the night before the exam.

542
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,480
They ran away from the show

543
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,720
and went out to watch movies.

544
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,840
We met our principal and teacher.

545
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,480
They spent 10 years

546
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,680
of their wedding anniversary outside.

547
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,320
The wedding anniversary was a disaster.

548
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,440
Well,

549
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,920
our principal is called Mei.

550
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,560
The nickname is Mei.

551
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,360
Yes.

552
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,080
Later,

553
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,200
the god was very calm.

554
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,240
He said to the wedding anniversary

555
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,880
that he would watch a movie

556
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,640
at his mother's house in 10th anniversary.

557
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,720
How about I take a photo

558
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,360
of your wedding anniversary?

559
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,640
After the photo,

560
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,120
he felt very good.

561
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,360
He was very happy

562
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,240
and he was very happy.

563
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,000
Then,

564
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,080
Mei Qiguan didn't blame us.

565
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,440
She even gave us a ticket

566
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,480
to laugh at us.

567
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,520
Okay.

568
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,440
Thank you for your great analysis

569
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,440
and your valuable suggestions.

570
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,800
I hope their experience and suggestions

571
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,840
can help the students

572
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,000
who are in the back seat

573
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,040
or who will face the high school.

574
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,480
Thank you for your interview.

575
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,160
Thank you.

576
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,520
See you next time.

577
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,520
It's not very funny.

578
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,940
How is the material

579
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,720
on your book вик I prepared for you?

580
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,520
Nice.

581
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,800
Jiang Cheng taught you

582
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,440
to avoid black circles,

583
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,760
giving me a free labor.

584
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,280
Great.

585
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,240
She can't pretend to be a wolf without it,

586
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:30,760
Moreover,

587
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:31,920

588
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,040

Delicious.

592
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:37,720
Court me on your behalf.

593
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,680
City Mayor,

00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,680
it's better if you put me books

595
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,520
even more regularly today than on the same day.

596
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,600
Let's up

597
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,620
I'll beat you today

598
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,720
StinkyWhere to deduct money

599
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,380
Don't you know

600
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:58,180

00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,540

Don't rule

00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,520
Move

606
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,240
you're a normal dog

607
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,720
Who is a dog?

608
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,640
I think you are the dog's daughter.

609
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,120
No.

610
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,040
You are overthinking.

611
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,560
She doesn't like me.

612
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,080
I'm the only one who likes her.

613
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:19,760
What?

614
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,240
You like her too?

615
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,160
Or

616
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,160
you've been a king for so many years.

617
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,360
You look like a king to everyone.

618
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,440
I heard that you like to talk about stars.

619
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,640
Don't be like that.

620
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,720
What about Zhuge?

621
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,360
I'm busy with you.

622
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,240
I

623
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,120
pushed you to the university of Yizhong.

624
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,320
If other girls

625
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,680
call you ABB,

626
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,440
you will be promoted to the top.

627
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,600
How is it?

628
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,320
Is my coffee ready?

629
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,320
Yes.

630
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:50,800
Thank you.

631
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,920
I'm happy to see you off.

632
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,600
Wish you success in your secret training.

633
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,120
I won't send you off.

634
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,560
It's okay.

635
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,320
Don't mind her.

636
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,320
Sit.

637
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,440
You can do it, Yang Qizhu.

638
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,480
You even secretly trained me.

639
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,400
I almost believed you.

640
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,160
You have good acting skills.

641
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,800
Of course.

642
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,200
I'm telling you.

643
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,560
These actors in the fish

644
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,960
must be happy.

645
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:19,880
If I didn't

646
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,520
raise the pig,

647
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,480
I wouldn't be here.

648
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,200
I would be a painter.

649
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,360
Or

650
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,040
I would be a carpenter.

651
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,440
I would be a carpenter.

652
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,720
Isn't that all mine?

653
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:31,960
So beautiful.

654
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,240
This is the most important thing.

655
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,400
That's right.

656
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,120
Everyone is waiting for you.

657
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:41,840
If you are late,

658
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,880
let her have a drink.

659
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,320
Yes.

660
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,040
Drink up.

661
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,720
Drink up.

662
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,320
Drink up.

663
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,080
Drink up.

664
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:46,880
Bye.

665
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,480
How is it?

666
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,760
It's okay.

667
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,360
Yes.

668
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:51,920
Yes.

669
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,720
It's beautiful.

670
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,920
I'm sorry.

671
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,200
We were all on the same class.

672
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,160
It was too hot.

673
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,240
I didn't expect

674
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,440
your feelings when we were recording.

675
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,360
It's okay.

676
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,600
I'm worried about

677
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,560
what I said to the camera.

678
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,120
It's interesting to see you guys chat.

679
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,240
I thought

680
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,080
you guys were very nervous

681
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,280
when you were studying.

682
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,000
I didn't expect you guys

683
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,120
to be so good at studying.

684
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,480
Right, Xu Zhi?

685
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,120
By the way,

686
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,240
I just mentioned

687
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,480
the competitor of the same competition.

688
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,280
He will come over for dinner later.

689
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,280
You don't mind, right?

690
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,360
I don't mind at all.

691
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,120
I want to see a few more gods.

692
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,440
If you mind,

693
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,480
won't you let him come?

694
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,560
No.

695
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,720
Without him,

696
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,080
we won't be in the same team.

697
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,640
Right?

698
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,520
Yes.

699
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,480
Or so you say.

700
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,680
Xu Zhi.

701
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,960
If I remember it wrong,

702
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,840
you are the third one in the whole province.

703
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,160
Amazing.

704
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,440
If I'm right,

705
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,600
you won't be here

706
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,560
tonight.

707
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,600
Then you're not the provincial governor?

708
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,600
The train is starting.

709
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:00,840
Come on.

710
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,840
Let's go.

711
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,240
I don't know where is hard work.

712
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,520
I'm going to look around

713
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,640
where this group studies.

714
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,520
Let's look around.

715
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,920
How are we going to paywah?

716
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,480
Do I need to drive?

717
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,400
Okay.

718
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,740
Is this place

719
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,620
a hidden camp?

720
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,680
Is this place taught by my시� על아?

721
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,400
Report.

722
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,200
Who told that?

723
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,680
How is it going to be a place like that?

724
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,800
Ik would really like to see

725
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,800
Have a drink.

726
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,800
Drink outside.

727
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,800
What are you drinking?

728
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,800
I'll get something to eat.

729
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,800
Don't ask you to eat.

730
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,800
Get something to eat.

731
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,800
Don't eat.

732
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,800
Like a cloud in the clouds

733
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,800
The sky is clear

734
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,800
since the beginning

735
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,800
The world is too quiet

736
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:23,800
I've forgotten all the sound

737
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,800
The grass is coming.

738
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,800
The grass is coming.

739
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,800
The grass is coming.

740
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,800
Uncle, drink the grass.

741
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,800
Drink it.

742
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
Come with me.

743
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,800
Where are you going?

744
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,800
Come with me.

745
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,800
Sorry, it's late.

746
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,800
Excuse me, where's the wine?

747
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,800
Come, come, come.

748
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,800
Come, cheers.

749
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,800
Come, come, come.

750
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,800
Excuse me, everyone.

751
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,800
I've wasted some time.

752
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,800
Come, cheers.

753
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,800
Cheers.

754
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,800
Cheers.

755
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,800
Cheers.

756
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,800
Cheers.

757
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,800
Cheers.

758
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,800
Cheers.

759
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,800
Look, you're so hungry.

760
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,800
You drink a drink and get lost.

761
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,800
You drink too.

762
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,800
I'm so happy.

763
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,800
You drink.

764
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,800
I'll drink one.

765
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,800
Come, come, come.

766
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,800
Cheers.

767
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,800
Which university is better?

768
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,800
The one in Jingda is better.

769
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,800
You're so good.

770
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,800
And the one in Huada is better.

771
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,800
You even want to do this.

772
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,800
713.

773
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,800
You can still do it.

774
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,800
It's fine.

775
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800
But if you don't get 715,

776
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,800
it's considered a test.

777
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,800
You guys are so good.

778
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,800
You're so heavy.

779
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,800
Are you kidding me?

780
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,800
It's up there.

781
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,800
It's the top of Shanghai.

782
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,800
It's covered in clothes.

783
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,800
Look, the bed is all wet.

784
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,800
It's so clean.

785
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,800
I like the North.

786
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,800
It's dry.

787
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,800
I like it.

788
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,800
It's too comfortable.

789
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,800
It's like this in the South.

790
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,800
You're not coming.

791
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,800
I'll go.

792
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,800
It's my time.

793
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,800
Right, right.

794
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,800
10, 9, 8, 7,

795
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,800
75, 3, 2, 1.

796
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,800
Those things are for eating.

797
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,800
It's fine if you like it.

798
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,800
You're so good.

799
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,800
Cheng Ruizhou has been so good since he was a kid.

800
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,800
Is he coming?

801
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,800
I knew it.

802
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,800
He's not a kid.

803
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,800
He can't go anywhere.

804
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,800
I'm coming.

805
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,800
I found out that there are many things to eat.

806
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,800
But there's no food.

807
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,800
It's all desserts.

808
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,800
How can you eat it like this?

809
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,800
It's 3000 yuan.

810
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,800
Lu Ca.

811
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,800
Lu Ca.

812
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,800
You might not know it just now.

813
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,800
That peach is beautiful.

814
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,800
It's not a kind of peach.

815
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,800
It's a Rui Jun peach.

816
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,800
It looks like a girl from our school art class.

817
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,800
It's so beautiful.

818
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,800
It's so attractive.

819
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,800
It's so long.

820
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,800
You secretly look at her.

821
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,800
You dare not look at her.

822
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,800
You're so beautiful.

823
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,800
What are you doing, Lu Ca?

824
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,800
I just saw a mouse under your chair.

825
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,800
A mouse?

826
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,800
Where is it?

827
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,800
There's no mouse.

828
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,800
There's a barbecue.

829
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,800
Let's go.

830
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,800
I'll go and see the barbecue.

831
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,800
Okay.

832
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,800
I brought a picture of Lide.

833
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,800
How about taking a picture?

834
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,800
Sure.

835
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,800
Students from the first grade.

836
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,800
Take a picture.

837
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,800
Take a picture.

838
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,800
Take a picture.

839
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,800
Take a picture.

840
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,800
Come on.

841
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,800
Stop drinking.

842
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,800
Take a picture.

843
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,800
Let's go.

844
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,800
Take a picture.

845
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,800
Let's go.

846
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,800
Dong Yun.

847
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,800
Take a picture of He Zhao.

848
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,800
Okay.

849
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,800
Lu Ca.

850
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,800
It's C-Way.

851
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,800
C-Way.

852
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,800
Hurry up.

853
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,800
Three, two, one.

854
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,800
Thank you.

855
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,800
One more, okay?

856
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,800
One more.

857
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,800
Take a picture.

858
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,800
I'll go back to the news.

859
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,800
Okay.

860
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,800
This way.

861
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,800
One more.

862
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,800
I'll go back to the news.

863
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,800
Have fun.

864
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,800
Have fun.

865
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,800
Come on.

866
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,800
Two, three.

867
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,800
Yeah.

868
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,800
What are you looking at?

869
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,800
You're not coming?

870
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,800
You're busy with the peach blossom?

871
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,800
I found that the first impression of the team

872
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,800
was very important.

873
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,800
Since we first met,

874
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,800
did you

875
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,800
have a hard time with those flowers?

876
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,800
I was really not confident.

877
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,800
I was in the peach blossom battle.

878
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,800
They're all my classmates.

879
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,800
You can ask me

880
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,800
what I'm like to you.

881
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,800
You're so confident.

882
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,800
People like you.

883
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,800
The couple who just took pictures with you

884
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,800
are very reliable.

885
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,800
Then you should ask the director

886
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,800
to let you know

887
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,800
what you like.

888
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,800
Besides,

889
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,800
you can guarantee that

890
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,800
the people who came from the countryside like you.

891
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,800
Yes.

892
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,800
But I never hide my secret.

893
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,800
You didn't drink, did you?

894
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,800
I'll go get it.

895
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,800
Come on.

896
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,800
Have a drink.

897
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,800
You're not drinking with me.

898
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,800
What?

899
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,800
I'm not drinking.

900
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,800
It's our classmate who can't drink.

901
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,800
That's your business.

902
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,800
You can do it yourself.

903
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,800
This is for her.

904
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,800
Don't go.

905
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,800
Who is it?

906
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,800
You're not good at drinking.

907
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,800
I'm not a good drinker.

908
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,800
Fine.

909
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,800
Fine.

910
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,800
I won't tell you.

911
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,800
Waiter.

912
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,800
Give me a bottle of wine.

913
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,800
Thank you.

914
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,800
Do you have any more?

915
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,800
Thank you.

916
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,800
You've been here for a long time.

917
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,800
You're not a good drinker.

918
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,800
You said you'd come with beer.

919
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,800
I can't compare to a bottle of beer

920
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,800
to get a drink.

921
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,800
I went to see if the barbecue is ready.

922
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,800
If you don't find the lock,

923
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,800
I'll lock it myself.

924
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,800
The one in Luonan 713.

925
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,800
Try it.

926
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,800
I just baked lamb skewers.

927
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,800
It's very tender.

928
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,800
Do you want to try it?

929
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,800
You eat it.

930
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,800
I don't eat it naturally.

931
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,800
Okay.

932
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,800
By the way,

933
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,800
let me ask you a question.

934
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,800
Are you a lot of people

935
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,800
from Chenlu?

936
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,800
I think so.

937
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,800
There are many foreigners.

938
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,800
Anyway,

939
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,800
the most crowded place

940
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,800
in our class is

941
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,800
the one we're moving to.

942
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,800
We're all looking for people

943
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,800
to look for them.

944
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,800
Is it because you're handsome?

945
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,800
I don't think so.

946
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,800
It's because I'm handsome.

947
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,800
That's because you're handsome.

948
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,800
Because of you.

949
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,800
At first,

950
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,800
everyone didn't know

951
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,800
he was a gift-giver.

952
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,800
I just heard

953
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,800
that his father is very rich.

954
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,800
I'm not sure.

955
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,800
I just heard that

956
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,800
his father is very rich.

957
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,800
I thought

958
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,800
he was a gift-giver.

959
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,800
Then?

960
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,800
Then

961
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,800
we moved to the first exam.

962
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,800
He is the first in the class.

963
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,800
He is the second one.

964
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,800
He is the first one in our class.

965
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,800
He is 20 points higher than me.

966
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,800
This one

967
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,800
is the worst.

968
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,800
For so many years,

969
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,800
he met the real opponent for the first time.

970
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,800
Chen Luozhou

971
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,800
is the first one.

972
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,800
He is the only one.

973
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,800
I really want to know

974
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,800
what kind of girlfriend

975
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,800
Chen Luozhou will find

976
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,800
in the future.

977
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,800
I know that.

978
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,800
You should ask him yourself.

979
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,800
Yes.

980
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,800
I didn't eat it.

981
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,800
The roast is delicious.

982
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,800
But I cooked it first.

983
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,800
I'll try this one.

984
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,800
Try it.

985
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,800
We'll sign it first.

986
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,800
Let me introduce you to someone.

987
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,800
Many people here

988
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,800
will go to Huada.

989
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,800
I'm a student.

990
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,800
This is called the study of knowledge.

991
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,800
I used physics

992
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,800
and chemical tests.

993
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,800
Hello.

994
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,800
Hello.

995
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,800
Hello. Come on.

996
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,800
Come on.

997
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,800
Hello.

998
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,800
I'll do it myself.

999
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,800
Do you want to eat some of my roast?

1000
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,800
Sure.

1001
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,800
Sure.

1002
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,800
You can try this.

1003
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,800
I'll have some mushrooms.

1004
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,800
I want to eat mushrooms too.

1005
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,800
I'll get you some.

1006
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,800
I'll talk to you later.

1007
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,800
Okay.

1008
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,800
I bought the mushrooms.

1009
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,800
Luca.

1010
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,800
It doesn't look like you.

1011
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,800
What?

1012
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,800
It smells good.

1013
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,800
Yang Yijing, a student in the department, right?

1014
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,800
It's him.

1015
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,800
I think your friend

1016
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,800
is interested in

1017
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,800
the quantum physics

1018
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,800
and quantum physics.

1019
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,800
The quantum physics

1020
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,800
is a hobby.

1021
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,800
Let's talk.

1022
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,800
Sure.

1023
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,800
Let's go.

1024
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,800
I'm not interested in quantum physics.

1025
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,800
I'm not interested in quantum physics.

1026
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,800
I'm not interested in quantum physics.

1027
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,800
Let's go.

1028
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,800
I'm done.

1029
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,800
Do you want some?

1030
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,800
I'm not a natural.

1031
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,800
Potatoes.

1032
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,800
Thank you, Luca.

1033
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,800
Eat slowly.

1034
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,800
Why are you following me?

1035
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,800
Why are you hiding from me?

1036
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,800
You've stepped on my shadow.

1037
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,800
Okay.

1038
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,800
I'll go back.

1039
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,800
You step on me.

1040
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,800
What do you want?

1041
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,800
It's 8.30.

1042
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,800
There's smoke behind the mountain.

1043
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,800
Do you want to see it?

1044
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,800
I'll go back.

1045
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,800
Who will go with you?

1046
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,800
Okay.

1047
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,800
I'll go by myself.

1048
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,800
Are you really not going?

1049
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,800
Go.

1050
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,800
You still want to step on me?

1051
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,800
I'll let you step on me.

1052
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,800
You're so stubborn.

1053
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,800
You're so stubborn.

1054
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,800
I'm done.

1055
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,800
I'm done.

1056
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,800
I'm done.

1057
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,800
I'm done.

1058
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,800
I'm done.

1059
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,800
I'm done.

1060
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,800
I'm done.
