1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The wind blows my heart

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The world is burning and burning

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The smile is echoing in the distance

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The pain is in the hatred and hatred

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The wind blows my heart

6
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
If I cry out

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let the atmosphere of the city stay in the memory

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The sea is burning in each other's body

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Because the puppy is shaking

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The wind blows my heart

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
If I cry out

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Let the atmosphere of the city stay in the memory

13
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The sea is burning in each other's body

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The wind blows my heart

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If I cry out

16
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Let the atmosphere of the city stay in the memory

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The sea is burning in each other's body

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Do you want to watch the meteor shower with us?

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
A little bit, but it's better than now.

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I really recommend you to pay more attention to the stars.

21
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You will definitely make money.

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So you will make money.

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You will make money by paying the gold and silver.

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's not impossible.

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
How about you report to a international store?

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You are so good at your job.

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
If I don't come to the show today,

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
when will you hide it from me?

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
My mom used to say that I am the first person in the world to be a foreign monster.

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But I think you are the first person now.

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
No, my dad said that I was the first person in the world to be a foreign monster.

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Okay.

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
There are five more minutes.

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You want to listen to my explanation first.

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And you want to watch the fireworks first.

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't need to explain.

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But I am really curious.

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
How did your Luo Fen G13 come out?

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Just do it as usual.

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay.

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Chen Lu Zhou, I understand now.

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Why are you always so confident?

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Then it's your turn.

44
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You explain to me.

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Explain to me?

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Why do you hide from me?

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Am I so uneducated?

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I just don't want our relationship to be so complicated.

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What is complicated?

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You want to introduce me to your classmate, right?

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Then?

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Then I found that even if you don't come today,

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
they will keep talking about you.

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
If they become my classmates in the future,

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
they will not be able to talk much.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You are finally in the world of the public.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And you are in the world of the foreign currency.

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You don't want to hear my story?

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Why?

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The world is full of pain and pain.

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I open the door of the soft-hearted.

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You are so beautiful.

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You are so beautiful.

64
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You are so beautiful.

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You are so beautiful.

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We are the loyal people of the public.

67
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But we want to be the loyal people of the West.

68
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You are so beautiful.

69
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
This is the jade for the students of the school.

70
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Don't be so careful.

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Okay.

72
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Where is Chen Luzhou?

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Why hasn't he come back yet?

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
No, where is Xu Zhinao?

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Where is he going?

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
They are probably studying the place.

77
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
This should be the place.

78
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So?

79
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Why?

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Because Xiao Gou is studying the place.

81
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What? Because Xiao Dong is my mother?

82
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's okay if you don't hear it.

83
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Are you okay?

84
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm still here.

85
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I lost it in the middle of the night.

86
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Tell me what you just said.

87
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I said that Chen Luzhou is a bad person.

88
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Seven words.

89
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You just said eight words.

90
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You are still calculating.

91
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
A little bit.

92
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I was a calculation champion when I was a kid.

93
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Well, I'll say something.

94
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You have the ability to be straightforward.

95
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Say a few words.

96
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm a three-year-old.

97
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
If you lose, give me the wine.

98
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Okay.

99
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Then I'll have a drink first.

100
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I finished drinking.

101
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's a very good game.

102
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's okay.

103
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's good.

104
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Are you going out to drink with someone after you go to Beijing?

105
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I think so.

106
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Otherwise, it's boring.

107
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Take care of yourself.

108
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Okay.

109
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Try not to go drinking with a guy.

110
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm afraid you'll be displeased.

111
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Can I drink with you?

112
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Are you still playing?

113
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Are you still playing?

114
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yes.

115
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Come on.

116
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Congratulations on your score.

117
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I wish you a bright future.

118
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Don't lie to girls in the future.

119
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You have to change it sooner or later.

120
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
How many words?

121
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
35 words.

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Tell me, don't drink with a guy.

123
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
But you are not good at drinking with girls.

124
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
How many words?

125
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
No.

126
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
26 words.

127
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Some people are like a group of discussion stations.

128
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
They are afraid that I'm the queen.

129
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You can ask directly if you have any questions.

130
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Don't be so impulsive.

131
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Just a word.

132
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You have sharp eyes.

133
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm afraid I'll be fooled.

134
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I have a bright eye.

135
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
A little bit more.

136
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I didn't hear clearly.

137
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You are a hero.

138
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Are you still coming?

139
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Because the puppy is afraid.

140
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
How many words?

141
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Eight words.

142
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Just now, it was this.

143
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
What do you mean?

144
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Self-righteousness.

145
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Like a wind that has touched the sky.

146
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I will wipe the regretful memories.

147
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I passed by.

148
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Don't make a fool of me.

149
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
How many scenery

150
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
waiting for this encounter.

151
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Heartbeats, heartbeats.

152
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Have you got time?

153
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Let each story

154
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
start over.

155
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Even if it turns on you

156
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I will always be with you

157
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
like a rainbow piece.

158
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I will, I will, I will.

159
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Even if it turns on you

160
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I will always be with you

161
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I will let you know

162
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
you're the only one.

163
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm afraid I'll be fooled.

164
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I have a bright eye.

165
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I have you.

166
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'll wipe the regretful memories.

167
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I passed by.

168
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Even if it turns on you

169
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I will always be with you

170
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
like a rainbow piece.

171
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I will, I will, I will.

172
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I will, I will, I will.

173
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Maybe the people in my heart still remember me.

174
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And I'm waiting for the people to love me.

175
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
They like me.

176
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm so happy today.

177
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I've met so many friends.

178
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm also grateful to the staff and the brothers.

179
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
The recording process is very fast.

180
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's so interesting to chat with them.

181
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And

182
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I also met a very nice god,

183
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Chen Luzhou.

184
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
He passed away in 713.

185
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
He was a master of the recording.

186
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
He was indeed famous.

187
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I should be punished.

188
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Have you arrived home?

189
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Yes.

190
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Based on you,

191
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Dai Qian

192
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm here in the hurry.

193
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Anyone else?

194
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Someone's here.

195
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
What?

196
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Their parking project is done there?

197
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
3- available groceries.

198
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Oh,

199
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
they're working.

200
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
But

201
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I should order them.

202
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,760
The charging circle costs

203
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
2kg 609 yuan.

204
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Our regular-比如 First- you需要

205
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And

206
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You need to be very careful.

207
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,040
Click, click.

208
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,040
Hello, everyone.

209
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,060
This is the newSuper Junior dachte.

210
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,280
It's ranked 38th incartagia.

211
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,020
Dad, look at them.

212
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,420
Let the colleagues see my daughter.

213
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,620
She's not only excellent, but also a great actress.

214
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,820
You should keep your own heart.

215
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
Don't spread it to me.

216
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,020
What's wrong?

217
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,820
Did anyone bully you when you were on the show?

218
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,820
Look at me being bullied.

219
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,620
I bullied others.

220
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,820
That's...

221
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,020
Come.

222
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,820
What?

223
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,820
Look.

224
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,420
The girl from the ocean.

225
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,220
Do they want me to accompany them on their trip?

226
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,420
Who said that these twowere together?

227
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,420
This kind of stuff is not a scam.

228
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,020
What's so appelle when this guy is involved?

229
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,420
He's just this person.

230
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,220
He's really where you are.

231
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,420
Do you really want to stay here?

232
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,220
You'll excuse us since you've been away long.

233
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,020
But Azai is not with you.

234
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,420
If I know, then I'll go with you.

235
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,420
I really did go with you.

236
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,420
Besides,

237
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,540
the money is still in the debt.

238
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,620
If you're worried,

239
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,180
call Yin Yin and tell her.

240
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,180
You're not going.

241
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,180
I'll tell her.

242
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,380
You're too rich.

243
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:09,980
Hello, Ying Ying.

244
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,380
You...

245
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:10,980
Mr. Yin,

246
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,780
we can go to the sea.

247
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,380
My God, my swimming suit has been on for two years.

248
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,980
Finally, we can take a photo at the swimming pool.

249
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,580
Okay.

250
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,420
Thank you.

251
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,220
Who took a photo of this?

252
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,820
It's me.

253
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,420
Here you are.

254
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,220
You're early.

255
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,220
Xiaoyang, are you really?

256
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,420
It's so interesting to go back to the swimming pool.

257
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,820
Why don't you tell me?

258
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,220
What do you mean?

259
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,620
I'm sure I'll go.

260
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,420
Why is he going?

261
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,420
We're going to take a photo.

262
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,820
I think the photographer should find him.

263
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,420
You're so good at it.

264
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,020
Why didn't Ju Zhi go with you?

265
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,820
Do you think this is beauty beauty?

266
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,820
I need to clean up and get on with him.

267
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,020
Lucy,

268
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,820
I can smell the sourness.

269
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,020
I can smell it.

270
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,620
Lucy,

271
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,420
you look like a duck.

272
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,020
You're so stubborn.

273
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,220
It's hard to see, so I went to the hospital to admire you.

274
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,420
You only took a photo at the third corner, right?

275
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,020
Okay, what's wrong?

276
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,220
Zhou.

277
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,420
What's wrong with him? He took the medicine.

278
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,220
He seems to have been eaten.

279
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,220
He found that he was taken by others.

280
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,220
He only took the bag.

281
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,220
Go on.

282
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,420
He's so beautiful.

283
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,420
Go on.

284
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,820
Nice shot.

285
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,620
Nice shot.

286
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,220
Nice shot.

287
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,020
Nice shot.

288
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:30,620
Nice shot.

289
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,420
I'll hit you next time.

290
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,020
Okay, okay.

291
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:32,820
I'll hit you next time.

292
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,420
I'll hit you next time.

293
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,220
I'll hit you next time.

294
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:34,820
I'll hit you next time.

295
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,220
Okay.

296
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,620
It's him.

297
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,220
That guy.

298
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,220
You're going to send me to the hospital to see an eye doctor, right?

299
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,220
Yes.

300
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,420
Don't go there.

301
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,620
Otherwise, I'll be in a hurry.

302
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,420
Then why are you hitting me?

303
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,420
Then why are you hitting me?

304
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,420
Why are you hitting me?

305
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,420
I'm hitting you too.

306
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,020
What's wrong?

307
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,420
You're so arrogant.

308
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,620
He's so mean.

309
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,620
He doesn't have enough money to pay for the house.

310
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,220
I really don't dare to hit you.

311
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,620
It's not that he doesn't have enough money.

312
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,420
It's just that he's so lucky.

313
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,220
There's a news program producer at home.

314
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,620
If you want to get on the headlines, just do it.

315
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:21,620
You're so stupid.

316
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,620
Have you seen it?

317
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,020
You're so good.

318
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,220
Try hitting me.

319
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,820
Hit me.

320
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,220
Okay.

321
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,820
That's enough.

322
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,220
Doctor.

323
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,220
I'm fine.

324
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,820
Your eyes are fine.

325
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,420
You're going to the hospital again.

326
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,220
Just go out.

327
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,220
Let me tell you.

328
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,020
The wound has healed in half an hour.

329
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:10,820
Thank you, doctor.

330
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,420
Thank you, doctor.

331
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:12,820
Let's go.

332
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,220
Okay.

333
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,620
Bring the bottle.

334
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,220
Okay.

335
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,620
Thank you.

336
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,420
What's wrong?

337
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:28,620
What's wrong?

338
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,620
You're so arrogant.

339
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,620
So angry.

340
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,620
You're all injured.

341
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,220
It's okay.

342
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,820
Guess who I saw.

343
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,420
The door is so open.

344
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,020
Who are you looking at?

345
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:56,820
Chen Luzhou.

346
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,820
You're here again for the hospital?

347
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:58,820
No.

348
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,220
The guy who sent the red packet last time

349
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:02,820
hit the basketball.

350
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,620
His eyes are hurt.

351
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,220
Let me show him.

352
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,620
No.

353
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,220
What are you doing?

354
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,220
No.

355
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,620
If I remember it wrong,

356
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,020
it's him.

357
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:15,820
Come on.

358
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,420
Look at him.

359
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,820
Do you remember what you said?

360
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,620
If anyone looks at your eyes,

361
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,820
the first person you bring to see your eyes?

362
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,820
Look.

363
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,820
Isn't he here?

364
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:29,820
No.

365
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,620
That's impossible.

366
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,420
I was just taking pictures.

367
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,020
How is that impossible?

368
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:34,620
Look.

369
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,620
You...

370
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,620
Take a picture of it.

371
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,420
And send it to me.

372
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,420
What do you mean?

373
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,220
Look at it yourself.

374
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:39,620
The circle of friends is...

375
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,620
I can't see it.

376
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,620
He's afraid you're poor.

377
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,420
I'm not poor.

378
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,020
I'm just...

379
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,020
I'm just giving my daughter enough space.

380
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,220
What space?

381
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,220
That's the black hole.

382
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,220
Go home.

383
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,620
Congratulations to Young Master Chen

384
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,020
for getting the first step

385
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,220
and getting the first four awards.

386
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,820
Zhu Yangqi and Chen Luzhou

387
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,820
are fighting now.

388
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,420
Look.

389
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,420
They're so good-looking.

390
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,020
Don't be so mean.

391
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,820
You two are just ordinary fighters.

392
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,020
Mr. Zhi.

393
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,220
Do you know why they fight?

394
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,220
I don't want to know.

395
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,420
How do you know?

396
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,820
Zhu Yangqi said

397
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,020
he saw Feng Jing

398
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,020
playing with us in the circle of friends.

399
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,220
He was so mean.

400
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,820
He was so loud in the court.

401
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,820
He was so quiet.

402
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,220
I want to ask

403
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,820
what's your opinion

404
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,420
about the Taoism in this world?

405
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,020
Right.

406
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,420
Don't be so serious

407
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,620
about your own hand.

408
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,420
What's the rush?

409
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,820
You're not even close to him.

410
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,420
Eight pieces of one.

411
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,420
I'll call my husband.

412
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,420
What did you come back for?

413
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,420
Let me see.

414
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,620
Eight pieces of one.

415
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,420
Five hundred pieces of one.

416
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:12,020
Luo Nan, seven, one, three.

417
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,420
Mr. Zhi, who are you?

418
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,220
Look at you.

419
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,820
You're using your husband?

420
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,420
I want to see too.

421
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,620
This won't do.

422
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,420
I'll pay for it.

423
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,620
I can't let you go.

424
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,220
Pay for it?

425
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,020
It's better to pay for it.

426
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,220
Cheers.

427
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,420
I'll go now.

428
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,420
Thank you, boss.

429
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,220
See you.

430
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,460
They're so cute.

431
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,020
Who are you?

432
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,420
Do I look like a dog to you?

433
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:24,820
No.

434
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,020
If you say so,

435
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,220
I'll catch you.

436
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,820
I'll catch you, if you don't catch me.

437
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,300
Here, login card, backlink證.

438
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,620
屍體掌握

439
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,340
You're here.

440
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,140
mate?

441
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,820
Do you play in school with me?

442
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,340
Let me teach you.

443
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:54,940
Please, let me show you.

444
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,340
We were together since childhood.

445
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,260
Actually, I am after I was shot in 1968.

446
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:08,520
I can say someone named Xiao Xiao clearly because I am your target.

447
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,620
I fear that if you start a scandal with Isget,

448
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,000
any other gatekeeper would bug me again.

449
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,000
It's такие.

450
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,400
Xiao Xiao, good.

451
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,680
When are you going?

452
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,000
She's pretty and has a good career.

453
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,560
Why is it her?

454
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,360
Do you still remember

455
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,200
the first time we had a meal together?

456
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,520
Why are you looking at me?

457
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,200
My dad works in the hospital.

458
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,800
He's been seeing a lot of people looking for tea.

459
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,160
He told me that he's used to it since he was a kid.

460
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,240
If he meets someone looking for tea,

461
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,360
he'll be in a hurry to stay.

462
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,240
Is that how you met me the second time?

463
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,400
I thought we'd introduce each other.

464
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,480
We're just friends.

465
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,520
There's nothing we can do about it.

466
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:26,880
The efficiency of this tea is almost as high as

467
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,600
I'm not allowed to play alone.

468
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,120
Tell me.

469
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,640
What's the point of going up?

470
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,400
If you can forget it,

471
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,480
you can tell me when you come back.

472
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,720
I'm so unlucky, bro.

473
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,040
How about this?

474
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,520
Let's discuss it with Uncle.

475
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,480
Don't talk about me.

476
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,360
Even the underwear I'm wearing

477
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,800
are bought by my Queen.

478
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,040
I have no right to say no.

479
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,280
How long are you going to be back?

480
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,040
Two years.

481
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,320
I checked the class there.

482
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,680
I'm going to buy the school's school in two years.

483
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,280
See if I can get a chance to work.

484
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,440
Be a manager.

485
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,480
Otherwise, I'll be back after I'm independent.

486
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,760
Two years?

487
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,480
The cucumber dishes have been cold for two years.

488
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,480
It's cold.

489
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,880
I'm going abroad anyway.

490
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,560
I haven't been in touch for years.

491
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,920
He'll forget about you.

492
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,560
What's up?

493
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,480
What's up?

494
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,680
Desika.

495
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,200
The movie you're watching is going to be re-edited.

496
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,400
Do you have time tonight? I'll go with you.

497
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,280
Okay.

498
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,000
Let me see.

499
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,200
No rehearsal.

500
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,640
It's okay.

501
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,440
This kind of movie doesn't look funny.

502
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,120
It's the same in the video of Tencent.

503
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,560
Okay.

504
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,200
I'm back.

505
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,320
Come here.

506
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,520
What's up?

507
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,680
Can't I sit with you for a while?

508
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,840
Come on.

509
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,400
Sit here.

510
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,160
Sit closer.

511
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,760
Dad, I'm asking you.

512
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,600
Is dad your best friend in the world?

513
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:44,800
Yes.

514
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,760
Can we be without a word

515
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,320
about the secret in this world?

516
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,320
No secret.

517
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,360
Yes.

518
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,000
Who is this?

519
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,280
Who do I think it is?

520
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,360
A friend.

521
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,400
What friend?

522
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,080
I just met him.

523
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,080
He's from the art school.

524
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,240
He's a man.

525
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,480
He's a little bit shy.

526
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,760
He's also a fan of bragging.

527
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,560
But he's a good guy.

528
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,200
He recommended me to take the exam.

529
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,120
No.

530
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,320
You don't have to take the exam for the postgraduate exam.

531
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,120
It's for him.

532
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,280
How is that possible?

533
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,280
I took the exam for a medical school

534
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,320
to get a medical certificate.

535
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,240
Are we the best friends in the world?

536
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,040
Yes.

537
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,200
Tell me the truth.

538
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,120
Are you in love with Zhu?

539
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,000
I...

540
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,840
He's my best friend.

541
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,640
Who do you think you are?

542
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,480
And I can only call him Zhu in this world.

543
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,600
You can't call him Zhu.

544
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,720
You're not in love with him.

545
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,280
You...

546
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,040
Why are you comparing me to him?

547
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,360
Mr. Cai Binghong.

548
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,760
I don't compare you to any friend in the world.

549
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,160
Me too.

550
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,040
Since dad is the best friend in the world,

551
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,000
why can't you know my secret?

552
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,240
Why are you comparing me?

553
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,320
Let's go up.

554
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,160
Can you pull me back?

555
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,720
Let's see how you do.

556
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,320
How can I do that?

557
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,880
I said you're the best friend in the world.

558
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,040
We're talking nonsense.

559
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,280
There's no secret, right?

560
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,200
Who are you lying to?

561
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,280
Mr. Zhizong.

562
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,280
Mr. Zhizong.

563
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,840
Let me show you something.

564
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,600
What is it?

565
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,240
The second month's salary.

566
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,440
Your favorite card.

567
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,600
I've checked the cards without any cards.

568
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,680
You must be fake.

569
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,640
I'm not.

570
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,280
I thought you were fake at first.

571
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,440
But I checked the results.

572
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,840
I changed my card.

573
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,280
The result is clear.

574
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,280
I don't believe you.

575
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,840
Which hospital?

576
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,920
Bohui Hospital.

577
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,040
The hospital is in the middle of the city.

578
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:45,800
I'm sorry.

579
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,800
Which hospital?

580
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,960
Bohui Hospital.

581
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,960
No. 3.

582
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,360
Mr. Zhizong, this one.

583
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,960
Which card?

584
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,800
No. 3.

585
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,720
It's starting.

586
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,680
No. 3. 4.

587
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,800
Hurry up, Mr. Zhizong.

588
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,800
Mr. Zhizong.

589
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,800
Lol, a scene 쫌下夜幕降临

590
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:55,800
用烂的路騰减住行

591
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,600
月色穿透淑衣

592
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,600
追逐着我在你

593
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,000
Zhizong, I'll pay you.

594
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,760
I've played dead.

595
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,960
挲右喲 were stoiched in the 많

596
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,120
眼花牵命心跳呼吸

597
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:18,280
I understand how much you talk

598
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,920
The whole community

599
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,300
I don' brutalize you

600
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,300
It's like the Loveophil watching the galaxy

601
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:28,720
-->

602
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,680
I guarantee you

603
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,840
Xiao Lu Zheng

604
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:44,960
Come here.

605
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,440
I'm in a hurry.

606
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,120
I'm leaving.

607
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,000
Take care.

608
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,900
You put the 보�en in a bilateral seam warehouse.

609
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:46,280
영

610
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,220
Can you do me a favor?

611
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,780
How can you guess that?

612
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,980
Qingyi may not have manyhe ke stars know it.

613
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,940
Moreover, you're still a legend.

614
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:05,940
And

615
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,720
you've beautified yourself a little bit holiday worI

616
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,120
Only Qingyi criedus LifE to play with you.

617
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,840
Good, good.

618
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,320
What did he say?

619
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,000
What are you talking about?

620
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,640
What did youний

621
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,340
Hutton?

622
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,080
Hutton?

623
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,200
Thomas.

624
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,240
Come, let's go!

625
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,920
You told me you saw music before,

626
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,200
and you asked me to write it?

627
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,360
Didn't you refuse it?

628
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:39,960
Besides,

629
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,800
you're a discourse of cameras

630
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,000
I'll watch the movie myself.

631
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,240
You're so doggy.

632
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:48,760
I am.

633
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,320
Meijing.

634
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,720
How do you think it's possible?

635
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,840
If you watch Meijing,

636
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,640
you'll be quite Meijing.

637
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,640
Okay, we're both Meijing.

638
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,160
Watch Meijing's movie with Meijing.

639
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,160
Meijing is the best.

640
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,080
I'm going home.

641
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,360
Then

642
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,240
Jun Xiu,

643
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,240
we'll have a talk here.

644
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,400
I hope we don't poison anything...

645
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,800
I have something to tell you.

646
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,720
You need another interview?

647
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,800
You can't play with me.

648
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,800
You want to play with me, right?

649
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,800
Who can't play with me?

650
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,800
Isn't the person who doesn't reply to the WeChat your friend?

651
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,800
The WeChat

652
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,800
Can you answer your question?

653
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,800
Love is not close.

654
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,800
The kiss is not close.

655
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,800
Love is not close.

656
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,800
It's very close if you don't love me.

657
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,800
Look at him.

658
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,800
So sometimes,

659
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,800
you care too much about the girl.

660
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,800
So what's the point?

661
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,800
You want to play with me, right?

662
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,800
Fine.

663
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,800
Don't cry.

664
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,800
Don't worry.

665
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,800
I'll send you on the plane happily.

666
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,800
Yan Yan, I'm back.

667
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,800
I know.

668
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,800
Come here.

669
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,800
What's wrong?

670
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,800
What's wrong with your movie?

671
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,800
Your test subject said it was my 007.

672
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,800
The result is a total traitor.

673
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,800
Chen Lu Zhu betrayed me.

674
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,800
He said he'd help me when he was looking for me.

675
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,800
A man's mouth is a liar.

676
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,800
I know you helped him.

677
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,800
I'm helping you.

678
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,800
Who told my sister to be a liar?

679
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,800
Cold war is a good thing.

680
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,800
It's a good thing to be in the battle.

681
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,800
Someone said

682
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,800
he regretted having a real love in front of me.

683
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,800
But he didn't cherish it.

684
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,800
You should worry about yourself.

685
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,800
Have you thought about it?

686
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,800
Do you want to be a widow?

687
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,800
I've thought about it.

688
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,800
I'll go to Beijing to find you tomorrow.

689
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,800
Will you be a widow again?

690
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,800
No way.

691
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,800
I swear.

692
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,800
You're wrong.

693
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,800
Really?

694
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,800
I'm practicing.

695
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,800
One, two, three.

696
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,800
Close your eyes.

697
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,800
Today's mission is complete.

698
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,800
Thank you for accompanying me.

699
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,800
Okay.

700
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,800
I'll go back and prepare the words.

701
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,800
You can do it.

702
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,800
Don't waste a summer vacation.

703
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,800
You still have to do it.

704
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,800
I'll do it.

705
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,800
I'll do it.

706
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,800
I'll do it.

707
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,800
I still have to do it.

708
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,800
Don't worry.

709
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,800
Bye.

710
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,800
Bye.

711
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,800
You're not taking me?

712
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,800
I'm taking pictures with my name.

713
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,800
That's not good.

714
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,800
I went to the beach with Zhu Yang before.

715
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,800
I slept on the beach for a while.

716
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,800
He took more than 300 photos of me.

717
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,800
He even asked me to buy some money.

718
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,800
Or he'd send it to my girlfriend.

719
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,800
Really?

720
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,800
Is he still there?

721
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,800
Can't his girlfriend be cheaper?

722
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,800
You know that.

723
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,800
Do you have a girlfriend?

724
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,800
You can't sleep when you see him.

725
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,800
Isn't that ugly?

726
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,800
How can I use these photos

727
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,800
to wait for the rich man?

728
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,800
You're so handsome.

729
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,800
You probably won't see him anyway.

730
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,800
Eighteen.

731
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,800
Do you want to smell it?

732
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,800
Can't I think of it?

733
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,800
If I smell it, what should I smell?

734
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,800
Three words.

735
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,800
C L Z.

736
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,800
I suggest you not to ask me.

737
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,800
Don't write it down.

738
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,800
Can I?

739
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,800
I want to ask C L Z.

740
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,800
What do you think I should ask?

741
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,800
Chen Lu Zhou.

742
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,800
I had a goal when I was a kid.

743
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,800
To achieve C L Z.

744
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,800
That's to make money.

745
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,800
Why didn't you ask Ren Binbi?

746
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,800
I didn't know how to do it.

747
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,800
I'm sorry.

748
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,800
The room is ready to go out for reading.

749
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,800
We'll have dinner tonight.

750
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,800
See you at six.

751
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,800
So fast?

752
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,800
I thought it would be the end of August.

753
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,800
When did you go abroad?

754
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,800
Not yet.

755
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,800
I can't go tonight.

756
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,800
I have to go to the promotion of the hospital.

757
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,800
I'm done.

758
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,800
I'm leaving.

759
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,800
Help me call Feng Jing.

760
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,800
Okay.

761
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,800
Tell me.

762
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,800
What's your relationship with Chen Lu Zhou?

763
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,800
Nothing.

764
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,800
You two are very sweet.

765
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,800
Sometimes you are very distant.

766
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,800
You even look at me.

767
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,800
Do you have any relationship?

768
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,800
Come here.

769
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,800
Excuse me.

770
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,800
It's late.

771
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,800
Let's go.

772
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,800
Are you sure?

773
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,800
Are you in love?

774
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,800
Who told you?

775
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,800
You are single.

776
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,800
No.

777
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,800
Come on. Sit down.

778
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,800
Order.

779
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,800
Order whatever you want.

780
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,800
Waiter.

781
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,800
Water.

782
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,800
A little bit of cooking.

783
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,800
Order whatever you want.

784
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,800
Listen.

785
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,800
The leftmost yellow fist.

786
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,800
He is very close to the left.

787
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,800
You and Chen Lu Zhou are not close.

788
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,800
What?

789
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,800
Listen.

790
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,800
Don't be angry.

791
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,800
When I came in,

792
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,800
I heard Cai Yingying say

793
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,800
who is not sure about the relationship.

794
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,800
It's me.

795
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,800
It's me.

796
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,800
I'm in love.

797
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,800
You are dreaming.

798
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,800
You are in love.

799
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,800
Can't you see it?

800
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,800
Yes.

801
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,800
Come on.

802
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,800
Let me introduce you to him.

803
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,800
This is

804
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,800
my friend, Cai Yingying.

805
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,800
Yes.

806
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,800
Look.

807
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,800
I told you.

808
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,800
What's so hidden?

809
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,800
We have been together for a long time.

810
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,800
I thought it was a secret.

811
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,800
But you caught me.

812
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,800
Yes.

813
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,800
What are you doing?

814
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,800
Don't you find it?

815
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,800
It's good.

816
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,800
It's good.

817
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,800
Tell me.

818
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,800
You are playing together every day.

819
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,800
So you are secretly in love.

820
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,800
Zhou.

821
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,800
Let's go.

822
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,800
It's not easy.

823
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,800
Sure.

824
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,800
Sure.

825
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,800
Yes.

826
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,800
Come on.

827
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,800
Sister-in-law.

828
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,800
Sister-in-law.

829
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,800
It's better to call her Yingying.

830
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,800
Sister-in-law.

831
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,800
Come on.

832
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,800
Come on.

833
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,800
Come on.

834
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,800
How is it?

835
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,800
Did you drink too much?

836
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,800
What's the situation?

837
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,800
Did you drink too much?

838
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,800
It's good.

839
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,800
It's good.

840
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,800
I drank too much.

841
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,800
I drank too much.

842
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,800
I'm in Xuzhi's arms.

843
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,800
Pull it away.

844
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,800
I see.

845
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,800
Why don't you know

846
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,800
it's my turn?

847
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,800
It's your turn.

848
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,800
I'm sorry.

849
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,800
I'm sorry.

850
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,800
I'm sorry.

851
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,800
I'm sorry.

852
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,800
It's your turn.

853
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,800
What's your concern?

854
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,800
What's your concern?

855
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,800
Nothing serious.

856
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,800
It's just

857
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,800
me and Cai Yingying

858
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,800
are in the same team.

859
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,800
You drank too much.

860
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,800
Don't worry about me.

861
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,800
Just worry about yourself.

862
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,800
You are in the back room.

863
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,800
Over.

864
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,800
I'm sorry.

865
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,800
I'm sorry.

866
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,800
I'm sorry.

867
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,800
I'm sorry.

868
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,800
I'm sorry.

869
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:32,800
I'm sorry.

870
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,800
I'm sorry.

871
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:34,800
I'm sorry.

872
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:35,800
I'm sorry.

873
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:36,800
I'm sorry.

874
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,800
I'm sorry.

875
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:38,800
I'm sorry.

876
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,800
I'm sorry.

877
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:40,800
I'm sorry.

878
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,800
I'm sorry.

879
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,800
I'm sorry.

880
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,800
I'm sorry.

881
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:44,800
I'm sorry.

882
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,800
I'm sorry.

883
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,800
I'm sorry.

884
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:47,800
I'm sorry.

885
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,800
I'm sorry.

886
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,800
I'm sorry.

887
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:50,800
I'm sorry.

888
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,800
I'm sorry.

889
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:52,800
I'm sorry.

890
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:53,800
I'm sorry.

891
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,800
I'm sorry.

892
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:55,800
I'm sorry.

893
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,800
I'm sorry.

894
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,800
I'm sorry.

895
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:58,800
I'm sorry.

896
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,800
I'm sorry.
