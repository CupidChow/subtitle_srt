1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,800
Let's be together

2
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,560
Crush

3
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,080
Is there such a difficult way to add a WeChat?

4
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,120
Do you usually cook for you?

5
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,320
Do you want to have dinner?

6
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,240
Can I?

7
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,520
Chen Mu finally got into trouble.

8
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,720
Then add a WeChat first.

9
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,280
My phone is out of battery.

10
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,640
Hello, Mr. Han.

11
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,480
Hello, Mr. Han.

12
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,160
Hello, Mr. Han.

13
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,480
You said it yourself.

14
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,080
Add a WeChat to the door and put a seat for me.

15
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,800
I'm a little tired now.

16
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,040
Can you move the chair for me?

17
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,300
The device can't handle the heat

18
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:28,960
It's hot.

19
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,880
This is the promoting room of Qi Huomen domestic line

20
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,200
What about you?

21
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,120
I'm not sure.

22
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,760
You know I'm back.

23
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,360
Where's my roast sweet potato?

24
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,520
Here.

25
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,080
Another one.

26
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,120
If you want to eat it,

27
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,520
you can find someone

28
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,120
who can offer you roasted sweet potato.

29
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,360
This is my favorite.

30
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,640
You have a baby.

31
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,880
I have a baby.

32
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,360
Yes.

33
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,240
You went to his house.

34
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,760
Did you see his mother?

35
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,080
He's not with them.

36
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,480
Is he in a bad relationship?

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,200
He's the only one who can live alone.

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Chen Lu Zhou

39
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,640
might be adopted.

40
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,800
I was at his house that day.

41
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,520
I argued with his mother.

42
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,920
His mother said

43
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,600
when you first came to our house,

44
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,520
it wasn't like that.

45
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,720
Don't you think it's strange

46
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,200
to have a baby?

47
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,520
It's a bit strange.

48
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,920
But I can't say

49
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,200
he was adopted.

50
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,400
But he has many things

51
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,640
that are written in his name.

52
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,760
What's the relationship

53
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,840
between him and him?

54
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,400
I think the words

55
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,640
may have a natural component.

56
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,960
But it may be a habit.

57
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,040
For example,

58
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,360
he used to live in a collective environment.

59
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,760
It's like a welfare home.

60
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,000
There are bridges and bridges.

61
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,200
So he has to write his own name.

62
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,880
But these are all guesses.

63
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,480
I might have thought too much.

64
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,360
You're really a good person.

65
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,240
Are you going to see his mother?

66
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,720
Of course.

67
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,160
When my mother was born,

68
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,480
I couldn't even see her for the last time.

69
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,000
Actually,

70
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,200
I feel sorry for her.

71
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,880
When I heard her quarrel with his mother,

72
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,680
his mother's voice

73
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,280
sounded exactly like my mother's.

74
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,880
I think

75
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,440
I want to see him no matter what.

76
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,280
Even if it's just a talk with him.

77
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,040
Then we'll go to Shen Lu Zhou tomorrow

78
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,200
and ask his mother to make an appointment

79
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,160
and ask you for a dream.

80
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,360
That's not right.

81
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,440
You think

82
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,520
there's a stranger

83
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,600
who suddenly pulls you and says,

84
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,440
Ying Ying,

85
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,640
I think President Cai

86
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,120
is like my father.

87
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,640
I want to know

88
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,720
what you think.

89
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,280
I might think

90
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,800
he's a pervert.

91
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,720
Right?

92
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,720
So I can't be in such a hurry.

93
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,600
I think

94
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,320
we can

95
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,600
become friends with Chen Lu Zhou.

96
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,720
After we become friends,

97
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,960
we can tell him

98
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,680
the reason why I want to see his mother.

99
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,080
But he's a bit difficult to deal with.

100
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,840
I didn't add any WeChat.

101
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:42,880
It's okay.

102
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,600
I added the WeChat of the pig's pet.

103
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,640
What?

104
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,280
Pig's pet.

105
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,200
They're called pig's pet.

106
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,120
It doesn't matter if he's a pig or not.

107
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,040
Anyway, I added the WeChat of the pig's pet.

108
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,000
In the future,

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,720
I'll help you

110
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,960
to find out the news about Chen Lu Zhou.

111
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,480
From now on,

112
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,240
I'll be your 007.

113
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,760
You're so sweet.

114
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
You can't defeat me.

115
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,320
Time can be super long alone.

116
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,360
Now,

117
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,800
don't be afraid again.

118
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,160
Mr. Zhang,

119
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,080
can you let me take the call?

120
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,360
Yes.

121
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,160
Hey,

122
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,280
what's wrong?

123
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,400
Are they coming in here?

124
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,960
I'd better rush.

125
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,480
The child has been taken away.

126
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,520
What do you mean?

127
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,120
You're lying to my son, right?

128
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,800
Uncle, don't worry.

129
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,080
I'm not worried.

130
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,600
I'm worried about you.

131
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,160
Who are you, uncle?

132
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,680
I'm so old.

133
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,880
What are you talking about?

134
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,120
Lucy.

135
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,880
Why are you eating again?

136
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,840
It's noon.

137
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,600
You're going to brush your teeth.

138
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,600
Second floor.

139
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,560
What?

140
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,400
Who's so short-tempered?

141
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,240
The master of the gold chain.

142
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,320
He's too loyal.

143
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,120
He's found the master so soon.

144
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,200
Before he was lying in the study,

145
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,880
his wife found him.

146
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,720
How can he lie in the study before he was lying in the study?

147
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,200
This is a poor thing that limited our little girl.

148
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,080
So, your brother came to your door

149
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,880
to talk to you and hug you.

150
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,040
Yes.

151
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,400
The master of the gold chain.

152
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,520
Do you want the address?

153
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,560
No need.

154
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,760
So, last night,

155
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,120
Xu Zhi didn't have any background?

156
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,880
You must have.

157
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,400
A master.

158
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,000
He's definitely a master.

159
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,600
You said you'd call him home

160
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,160
to bake sweet potatoes.

161
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,280
Didn't he just find his knife?

162
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,920
Get out of the way.

163
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,840
You're not taking off your shoes again.

164
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,440
You're not taking off your shoes?

165
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,560
All right.

166
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,200
No, I'm telling you, Lucy.

167
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,080
If he didn't come to pick on you,

168
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,600
I, Zhu Yangqi, will change my name to Yang Ji Zhu.

169
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,840
Okay.

170
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,800
You think it's romantic

171
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,760
that you stew sweet potatoes on Wei Bulu

172
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,400
along with my overeating food?

173
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,480
Whatever.

174
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,640
It's awkward.

175
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,160
It's not like you.

176
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,920
I'm afraid you really have an idea for me.

177
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,800
Wait.

178
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,120
You're afraid I have an idea for you?

179
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,840
Why don't you fear her?

180
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,160
She has a boyfriend.

181
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,520
What can I do?

182
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,000
What else can I say?

183
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,160
What are you looking forward to?

184
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,520
Listen,

185
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,240
Xu Zhi is a queen.

186
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,640
She's still a good girl.

187
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,200
Xiao Chen.

188
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,920
Enough.

189
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,800
I'll take a walk around the hall next time.

190
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,480
Okay.

191
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,120
I'll give you back.

192
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,800
I'm not going to raise you anymore.

193
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,480
You've been growing taller.

194
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,360
You've lost weight.

195
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,240
I'm not kidding.

196
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:55,880
Come down.

197
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,040
If you don't take it,

198
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,760
I'll give it to him tomorrow.

199
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,920
Make a bowl of soup.

200
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,400
Why should I make a bowl of soup?

201
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,080
How cute.

202
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,040
Why don't you raise her?

203
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,720
She's a cute girl.

204
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,360
She's like Cheng Luzhou.

205
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,120
She loves to leave the house.

206
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,520
She can't find her way.

207
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,400
You've been thinking too much about it.

208
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,080
Don't you allow her to come out and be heartless?

209
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,480
Have you ever thought about my feelings?

210
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,160
You didn't want to answer my call.

211
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,400
Now you're here.

212
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,960
You live so far away from home.

213
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,480
If I have any serious matter,

214
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,440
I can't find you.

215
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,640
You're in the school.

216
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,720
No.

217
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,720
How is that possible?

218
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,400
Fine.

219
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,040
If you don't want to hang up,

220
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,800
don't come to me.

221
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,520
Brother.

222
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,000
Brother.

223
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,720
If you want to hang up,

224
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,920
I can look for you.

225
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,240
Is it a problem for Chen Yan to think about it?

226
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,520
You can't hear me.

227
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,720
You're just joking, right?

228
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,520
Fine.

229
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,600
If you don't want me to look for you, just say it.

230
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,040
Fine. Tell me.

231
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,120
What's the matter?

232
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,320
I want to go to the school with my classmates.

233
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,280
I'm not allowed to go.

234
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,880
You want to find someone to accompany you

235
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,440
to serve the young master, right?

236
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:09,920
Fine.

237
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,680
I'll accompany you for a day.

238
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:13,920
Deal.

239
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,640
Me?

240
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,040
Me?

241
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,240
500 more.

242
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,520
Bring Zhu Yangqi.

243
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,480
Just find a art teacher.

244
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,120
Why should I?

245
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,240
I'm cheaper than you.

246
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,600
Then you promised me, right?

247
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,120
Brother.

248
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,960
Look at my mood.

249
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,560
Yes.

250
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,840
Brother, take us out to make a move.

251
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,440
We Rod

252
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,080
Papandan.

253
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,440
Papandan.

254
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,120
Analyze. Analyze.

255
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,120
Li Yan, are you her boyfriend?

256
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,120
No.

257
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,120
What's the plan in your room?

258
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,120
Telling it to the person you like.

259
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,120
What's going on?

260
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,120
That's Cai Yingying's. She's a video user.

261
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,120
She said that she had to do the graduation schedule.

262
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,120
Since it's Yingying's,

263
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,120
I'll do it with you.

264
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
How about your graduation schedule?

265
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,120
I'll do it myself.

266
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,120
It's getting late. I'll read the books at home.

267
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,120
Old saying.

268
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,120
Reading a thousand books is not as good as doing a thousand miles.

269
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,120
Now that I've read it, I should do a thousand miles.

270
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,120
Let's see the big mountain in the country.

271
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,120
Xu,

272
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,120
there are a lot of money in doing a thousand miles.

273
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,120
Don't you know what's going on in our family?

274
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,120
You paid for the money you paid for others.

275
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,120
You still owe me a thousand miles.

276
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,120
Yes.

277
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,120
But I've paid for Uncle Cai.

278
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,120
Don't worry about that.

279
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,120
Besides,

280
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,120
someone else owes us money.

281
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,120
Who?

282
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,120
Uncle Lin from the auction.

283
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,120
He owes us a thousand miles.

284
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,120
Mr. Li,

285
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,120
the master is so good.

286
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,120
Yingying is here.

287
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,120
Have you eaten?

288
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,120
Uncle is here.

289
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,120
I'm fine.

290
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,120
Don't bother about eating.

291
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,120
What's wrong with your hair?

292
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,120
You got dyed yesterday.

293
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,120
Don't bother about it.

294
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,120
I'll tell you some good news.

295
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,120
I'm going out with Yingying for a few days.

296
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,120
Didn't you just say

297
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,120
you won't go out for my money?

298
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,120
Who said we should see the big mountain?

299
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,120
Let's go.

300
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,120
By the way,

301
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,120
where are you going?

302
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
Do you have a boyfriend?

303
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,120
What are you doing?

304
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,120
Look.

305
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,120
We're on the same earth.

306
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,120
We're just two and a half.

307
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,120
Isn't this Xu Shunan's boyfriend?

308
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,120
You're not going to hide from him, are you?

309
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,120
What?

310
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,120
Hurry up.

311
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,120
Or I'll be in trouble.

312
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,120
What do you mean, Lucy?

313
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,120
You really know what to do?

314
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,120
I said it's not right.

315
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,120
If you really want to hide,

316
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,120
you can't get away.

317
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,120
It's okay.

318
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,120
I can find you a shovel for the whole world.

319
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,120
But why did you avoid it?

320
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,120
I'm just worried that

321
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,120
if his girlfriend really has feelings for me,

322
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,120
I'll try not to touch her face.

323
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,120
Stop it.

324
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,120
You just said that

325
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,120
it's a reaction from the master of the three realms.

326
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,120
And, let me tell you.

327
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,120
Xu Shishan is a boyfriend.

328
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,120
He's not a good guy.

329
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,120
He has bad taste.

330
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,120
Be careful.

331
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,120
Did you hear that?

332
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,120
Do you know him?

333
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,120
Who?

334
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,120
Xu Shunan's boyfriend.

335
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,120
I know him so well.

336
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,120
His name is Tan Xu.

337
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,120
He's a high school student.

338
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,120
He was against others in the second year.

339
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,120
He said that

340
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,120
he'd encourage and encourage others.

341
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,120
That's not the point.

342
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,120
Later, he published a

343
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,120
medical certificate for the school.

344
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,120
He also rejected others.

345
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,120
The most disgusting thing is

346
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,120
that the certificate is fake.

347
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,120
What?

348
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,120
How do you know it's fake?

349
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,120
Do you know Feng Jian?

350
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,120
I'm a middle school student.

351
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,120
Feng Jian was close to him.

352
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,120
He told me that himself.

353
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,120
I'm telling you.

354
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,120
There's something even more.

355
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,120
Enough.

356
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,120
Stop talking.

357
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,120
Go to sleep.

358
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,120
Hello, your room card.

359
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,120
Thank you.

360
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,120
Put it on.

361
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,120
It's not comfortable.

362
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,120
It's still a bit of a cloud car.

363
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,120
I'll get you some ginger and ginger.

364
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,120
You can borrow the cloud car if you want.

365
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,120
Who do you want water for?

366
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,120
Father.

367
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,120
Father.

368
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,120
Father.

369
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,120
Father.

370
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,120
Father.

371
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,120
Father.

372
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,120
Father.

373
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,120
Father.

374
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,120
Father.

375
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,120
Father.

376
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,120
Father.

377
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,120
Father.

378
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,120
Father.

379
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,120
Father.

380
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,120
Father.

381
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,120
Father.

382
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,120
What kind of wind has blown our boss out?

383
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,120
You haven't come to see me for so long.

384
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,120
You almost forgot me.

385
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,120
How is that possible?

386
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,120
Do you want to ride a bike?

387
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,120
It's been two years.

388
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,120
You really come to the Du family?

389
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,120
Secret.

390
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,120
Go get him some ginger and ginger.

391
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,120
Thank you.

392
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,120
Have some water.

393
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,120
Come.

394
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,120
I don't want to talk to you.

395
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,120
I'll give you a boss's award.

396
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,120
Call him over.

397
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,120
Where is he?

398
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,120
Call him over.

399
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,120
Hurry up.

400
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,120
We only have mountain spring water.

401
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,120
What's wrong?

402
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,120
Don't be so hard on me.

403
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,120
This is not your house.

404
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,120
You go down first.

405
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,120
Tell me what's wrong.

406
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,120
It's so hard to drink.

407
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,120
How can I drink it?

408
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,120
How can I drink it?

409
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,120
We only have mountain spring water.

410
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,120
I'll tell you one last thing.

411
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,120
If you don't get used to it,

412
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,120
just boil it and drink it.

413
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,120
What if I find a solution?

414
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,120
Tell me.

415
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,120
Who is responsible?

416
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,120
What?

417
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,120
A solution.

418
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,120
A solution?

419
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,120
A solution?

420
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,120
You...

421
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,120
Are you totally fine?

422
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,120
Who didn't get a solution?

423
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,120
Little brother, calm down.

424
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,120
I'll be right there.

425
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,120
Wait for me.

426
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,120
Welcome.

427
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,120
How many times have I told you?

428
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,120
Call me if you need anything.

429
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,120
I...

430
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,120
See you again.

431
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,120
What a coincidence.

432
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,120
It's a coincidence.

433
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,120
He did it on purpose.

434
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,120
His parents?

435
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,120
He sent me a message a few days ago.

436
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,120
It was because of this.

437
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,120
Mr. Shan Zhuang is my dad's friend.

438
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,120
I'm here to spend the holiday with Ying Ying.

439
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,120
Where's your parents?

440
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,120
They're here.

441
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,120
What's my parents?

442
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,120
Didn't you come with your family?

443
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,120
Who told you that?

444
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,120
I'm just saying that

445
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,120
it's today that

446
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,120
Chen Lu Zhou is going to

447
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,120
go to the mountain villa with his family.

448
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,120
As long as you go,

449
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,120
you'll see his mom.

450
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,120
Where's Lu Zhou's family?

451
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,120
This is my brother.

452
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,120
This is his family.

453
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,120
I'm telling you,

454
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,120
he doesn't have any sense of justice.

455
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,120
He won't change even if the water is so bad.

456
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,120
What's wrong with the water?

457
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,120
You've been picking up the box and picking up the money.

458
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,120
You're not done yet?

459
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,120
No, you're right.

460
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,120
Your brother doesn't like our water.

461
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,120
But it's not a coincidence.

462
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,120
We only have the mountain water here.

463
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,120
It's not a good water.

464
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,120
Can't we send it out?

465
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,120
No.

466
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,120
Who wants to send it to you in two hours?

467
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,120
And all the guests here

468
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,120
want to drink the mountain water.

469
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,120
No one wants to drink the ordinary water.

470
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,120
How about this?

471
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,120
I'll give you your room back.

472
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,120
You can leave now.

473
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,120
Wait a minute.

474
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,120
If it's just the water,

475
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,120
I can go down the mountain to buy it.

476
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,120
How?

477
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,120
Drive.

478
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,120
Can you drive?

479
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,120
Do you have a license?

480
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,120
Want to go to the market to drink tea?

481
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,120
Okay, I'll go.

482
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,120
I'll try it on the other side of the legal street.

483
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,120
I have a license.

484
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,120
Which place can I buy the water?

485
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,120
Tell me.

486
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,120
Or you can take my car.

487
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,120
I can give you money.

488
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,120
Take a car, a car, and a taxi.

489
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,120
No car?

490
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,120
Think of a way.

491
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,120
You're a bad boy.

492
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,120
But he's scolding me.

493
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,120
What's the price?

494
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,120
It's been decades.

495
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,120
It's less than a year.

496
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,120
Let's add a WeChat.

497
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,120
If you and your brother have something to do,

498
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,120
just contact me.

499
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,120
For example,

500
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,120
what about taking the taxi?

501
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,120
Chen Luzhou,

502
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,120
I'll give you 800 yuan.

503
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,120
I'm not asking you to chat with

504
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,120
the WeChat with the lady here.

505
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,120
The water problem, hurry up and solve it.

506
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,120
Hurry up and leave.

507
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,120
I'll take care of the house.

508
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,120
I'll go.

509
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,120
Zhu Yangqin.

510
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,120
Coming.

511
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,120
I'm leaving.

512
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,120
I'm leaving.

513
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,120
WeChat and milk.

514
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,120
It's all because of Zhu Yangqin.

515
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,120
He's my brother.

516
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,120
He doesn't say anything to the family.

517
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,120
He even came to our place

518
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,120
to pick up the food.

519
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,120
He gave me a wet towel.

520
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,120
I'm so sad.

521
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,120
What are you doing?

522
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,120
I'm thinking about

523
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,120
the WeChat with Chen Luzhou.

524
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,120
Since his mother isn't here,

525
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,120
we'll have to attack him first.

526
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,120
It's not easy.

527
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,120
Let the lady of the forest

528
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,120
tell you some

529
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,120
little things about him.

530
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,120
If you want to add

531
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,120
the WeChat with the handsome guy,

532
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,120
pay attention to a few points.

533
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,120
First,

534
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,120
in his good field,

535
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,120
surpass him, defeat him,

536
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,120
and attract his attention.

537
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120
Second,

538
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,120
in his unfamiliar field,

539
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,120
don't be too busy,

540
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,120
so that he doesn't get hurt.

541
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,120
Third,

542
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,120
you're the most important one.

543
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,120
Do you remember?

544
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,120
I said it's a hard fire.

545
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,120
It's not easy to get out of it.

546
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,120
You have to be careful.

547
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,120
You have to catch the water.

548
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,120
Help me to get the food.

549
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,120
I don't know if I have time.

550
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,120
You're finally ready to fight.

551
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,120
Yes, I'm almost there.

552
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,120
What are you going to do?

553
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,120
What can I do?

554
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,120
I have to get out of it.

555
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,120
Or I'll lose.

556
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,120
No, I'm talking about Xu Zhi.

557
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,120
Why are you talking about A'Lun?

558
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,120
I'm talking about the competition.

559
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,120
What do you want me to talk about?

560
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,120
Then ask me

561
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,120
if he has time.

562
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,120
Although he's chasing you now,

563
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,120
his boyfriend

564
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,120
is indeed a good guy.

565
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,120
But he didn't break up after all.

566
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,120
You're too young.

567
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,120
Don't give me a divorce.

568
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,120
Who said he wanted to help me

569
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,120
get out of it?

570
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,120
You...

571
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,120
You have to prepare for me

572
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,120
in advance.

573
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,120
Brother,

574
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,120
how can I borrow a car

575
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,120
if Xu Zhi doesn't show up?

576
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,120
I can't borrow a car.

577
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,120
Who will buy water for you

578
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,120
when you're young?

579
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,120
I can't drink

580
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,120
your water

581
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,120
even if you're so arrogant.

582
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,120
Who's so annoying?

583
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,120
Mr. Zhi.

584
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,120
It's a great poem.

585
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,120
What's wrong?

586
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,120
Listen.

587
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,120
Hello.

588
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,120
It's been a long time

589
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,120
since I asked Xu Zhi.

590
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,120
Can you bring him

591
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,120
to the mountains to buy water?

592
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,120
Congratulations, Mr. Zhi.

593
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,120
His mom is only a little bit away.

594
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,120
You have to take good care of me.

595
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
Hurry up.

596
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,120
Don't put him in danger.

597
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,120
Hurry up.

598
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,120
Let's go.

599
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,120
Bye.

600
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,120
Bye.

601
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,120
If you want to add

602
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,120
a handsome man's WeChat,

603
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
first,

604
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,120
use his familiar area

605
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,120
to beat him

606
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,120
and attract his attention.

607
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,120
Are you getting married again?

608
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,120
Thank you.

609
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,120
It's okay.

610
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,120
Do you hear the song?

611
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,120
I'm listening to you.

612
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,120
I really like this movie.

613
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,120
It shows

614
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,120
the coldness

615
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,120
of the second-hand

616
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,120
and the romantic society.

617
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,120
It's a very beautiful movie.

618
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,120
It shows the coldness,

619
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,120
the poor,

620
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,120
and the importance of family.

621
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,120
Although it's a sad story,

622
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,120
it also shows a hope.

623
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,120
Even if life is hard,

624
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,120
as long as there is a warm family,

625
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,120
there will always be a bright future.

626
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,120
Have you ever seen it?

627
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,120
I really like the director

628
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,120
to be immersed in his

629
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,120
kind of entertainment in the visual.

630
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,120
For example,

631
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,120
when Li Qi was wearing that bridge,

632
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,120
he caught the man

633
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,120
who put the flower pot in the car.

634
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,120
The director wanted to express

635
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,120
the flower-like truth.

636
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,120
I'm getting tired.

637
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,120
That's all.

638
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,120
It's just a prop.

639
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,120
Don't overdo it.

640
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,120
Right.

641
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,120
Cai Yingying

642
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,120
is not just trying to fool me.

643
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,120
I can't believe

644
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,120
that he's a professional.

645
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,120
By the way,

646
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,120
can you help me

647
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,120
to get on the ship later?

648
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,120
I'm not familiar with the route.

649
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,120
You?

650
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,120
4.1.

651
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,120
Why don't you say it's my birthday?

652
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,120
This is my birthday.

653
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,120
Good day.

654
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,120
You've already entered the route.

655
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,120
The whole trip will take 45 minutes.

656
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,120
When you arrive at Lu Wenyan,

657
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,120
can you hear it?

658
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,120
The speed limit is 40 kilometers per hour.

659
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,120
The route is blocked by 5 signals.

660
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,120
The limit is on the route.

661
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,120
Is the satellite signal here?

662
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,120
Your experience

663
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,120
is not good for Chen Luzhou.

664
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,120
Well,

665
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,120
he's a machine after all.

666
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,120
Think about it.

667
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,120
How can I take my mom

668
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,120
to see me?

669
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,120
As his girlfriend?

670
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,120
He doesn't have to take you to see your elders.

671
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,120
What if he has a girlfriend?

672
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,120
Then as his girlfriend,

673
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,120
his mom will definitely come to see you.

674
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,120
My friend,

675
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,120
I suggest you to

676
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,120
review your personal products.

677
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,120
The line is 3 kilometers ahead.

678
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,120
There are several lines.

679
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,120
Please pay attention to the other side.

680
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,120
Do you have a girlfriend?

681
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,120
No.

682
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,120
I miss you so much.

683
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,120
Are you still mad at me?

684
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,120
Chen Luzhou,

685
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,120
I really like you.

686
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,120
You're going crazy.

687
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,120
He's not my girlfriend.

688
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,120
Your screen is pretty cool.

689
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,120
I took it when I was in the game.

690
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,120
Game?

691
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,120
What's wrong?

692
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,120
I found out that

693
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,120
you have a beautiful voice.

694
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,120
I'm thinking about it.

695
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,120
Don't fight.

696
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,120
Let me think about it.

697
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,120
What's that?

698
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,120
Come on.

699
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,120
Come on.

700
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,120
Come on.

701
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,120
Come on.

702
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,120
Come on.

703
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,120
Come on.

704
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,120
Come on.

705
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,120
Come on.

706
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,120
Come on.

707
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,120
Come on.

708
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,120
Come on.

709
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,120
Come on.

710
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,120
Xu Zhi.

711
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,120
You should get some water.

712
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,120
Okay.

713
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,120
Come on.

714
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,120
Come on.

715
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,120
Come on.

716
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,120
Come on.

717
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,120
Come on.

718
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,120
Come on.

719
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,120
Come on.

720
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,120
Come on.

721
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,120
Come on.

722
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,120
Help me to the other side.

723
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,120
Come on.

724
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,120
Come on.

725
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,120
Come on.

726
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,120
Okay.

727
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,120
Xu Zhi.

728
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,120
You should get some water.

729
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,120
I don't know either.

730
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,120
Forget it.

731
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,120
It's mathematical procedure for catatoing object.

732
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,120
It turns out that

733
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:21,440
he is

734
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,440
unbelievable.

735
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,080
That's all Kookforce can tell you.

736
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:24,840
It just happened.

737
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,960
Go to the ceremony.

738
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,000
Yes, sir.

739
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:27,960
Go.

740
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,240
Good day, Kookforce.

741
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,360
Stop.

742
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,280
No more Sikh fast is allowed.

743
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,960
You should eat lunch

744
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,560
at the engagement ceremony.

745
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,600
But it's not only for you.

746
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,480
You should have it after?

747
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,760
How hungry are you to treat your Preceptor like this?

748
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:49,400
Go in.

749
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,720
See just enough food for lunch.

750
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,360
Give me someų

751
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,560
and give me some light snacks.

752
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,880
You're crazy.

753
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,680
How can you do this?

754
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:56,760
I don't care.

755
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:57,920
I'm just a dried cow.

756
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,520
No.

757
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,480
Who did you go out with?

758
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,840
You haven't come back for a long time.

759
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,600
The one you met in the hall.

760
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,600
That one.

761
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,400
The one who tried to test the law.

762
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,200
Can you speak softly?

763
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,200
She can hear you.

764
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,880
Sister Tian'er.

765
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,400
If you want to be my sister-in-law,

766
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,920
bring me a dried cow.

767
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,000
Don't be so greedy.

768
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,120
I bought the medicine.

769
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,200
What did your father say?

770
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,800
Want to eat dried cow?

771
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,120
It's okay. Don't mind her.

772
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,240
She's just used to it.

773
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,120
There's a house here.

774
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:30,880
It's not troublesome.

775
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:32,920
Let's go.

776
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:33,800
Your father wants to eat it.

777
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,680
Bring him a piece.

778
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,200
It's so sweet.

779
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,000
The window paper will be broken by you.

780
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,280
It's so soft.

781
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,040
Your father wants to eat the sweet and sour one

782
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,000
or the horse?

783
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,800
It's good to eat it.

784
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,480
Just say it, Xu Zhi.

785
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,480
Do you want to chase me?

786
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,240
Don't run away from me.

787
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,200
Are you okay?

788
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,560
If you need any help,

789
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,240
I can pick为什么.

790
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,320
You can go first and wait for me.

791
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,680
Tan Xu.

792
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,320
What can we chat today?

793
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,200
My brother.

794
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,200
What else can we talk about today?

795
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,200
Can you not be so generous?

796
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,200
I don't need you to worry about me.

797
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,200
I got a medical certificate in high school that year.

798
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,200
I was so hungry all day.

799
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,200
You reminded me of the fact that

800
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,200
there is no real hope in the world.

801
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,200
Only the poor are left with the idea.

802
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,200
Sorry.

803
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,200
I didn't say that.

804
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,200
I saw it on the book.

805
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,200
I saw it on the book.

806
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,200
I really don't understand.

807
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
Is it really that good?

808
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,200
Fan Zitao has to teach me every time.

809
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,200
You are not in a good mood.

810
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,200
I can understand.

811
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,200
But you don't have to be so hostile to me.

812
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,200
I am the one who failed in the exam.

813
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,200
Not you.

814
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,200
A person like you like a winner

815
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,200
shouldn't be so bold in front of me.

816
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,200
Xu Zhi.

817
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,200
Do you know what the big problem is?

818
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,200
You are always in a stable mood.

819
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,200
But in fact,

820
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,200
it's because you are not good at public relations.

821
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,200
You can't be with someone else to think about it.

822
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,200
No. One more round.

823
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,200
The winner of the three rounds is the winner of the round.

824
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,200
After you lose,

825
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,200
you have to promise me

826
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,200
that you can't take this gun anymore.

827
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,200
It's dangerous.

828
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,200
Do you know that?

829
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,200
I will give it to you.

830
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,200
Thank you.

831
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,200
Wait for me.

832
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,200
Take the gun.

833
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,200
Don't shoot.

834
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,200
Thank you, brother.

835
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,200
Is it because of him?

836
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,200
What does it have to do with him?

837
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,200
It has nothing to do with me.

838
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,200
He asked you to come to me

839
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,200
to make a deal with me

840
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,200
and make a deal with you.

841
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,200
We didn't live together.

842
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,200
You didn't get a good result.

843
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,200
Because you found a better person,

844
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,200
you have to deny our past.

845
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,200
Xu Zhi.

846
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,200
I thought that my relationship

847
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,200
was already in the dark.

848
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,200
I used to help you so much.

849
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,200
So?

850
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,200
Do you like me?

851
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,200
Go back and look at yourself.

852
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,200
What?

853
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,380
You're right.

854
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,880
Seems like I'm right.

855
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,200
I thought you were different from others,

856
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,280
despite that being hunted for demerit,

857
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,640
you oversaw me.

858
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,840
더� tho lans you and others,

859
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,940
so you made up to easy for me.

860
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,640
Have you seen a doctor?

861
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,840
You told me you had demerit.

862
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,440
What do you mean?

863
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,840
Are you sure?

864
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,320
Do you admit it?

865
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,880
You're just trying to fool me.

866
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,320
I'll give it to you.

867
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,880
Why are you here again?

868
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,240
I've already taken a portion.

869
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,240
I can't eat any more.

870
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,040
Thank you.

871
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,720
Do you want this?

872
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,640
Where's your parents?

873
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,480
Did they ask you to eat something that's not human?

874
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,800
What if it's a bad guy?

875
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,960
I don't want to eat it.

876
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,640
What's that little boy doing?

877
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,360
Did you quarrel?

878
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,760
No.

879
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,400
Ding Duo is a coward.

880
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,760
What do you call a coward?

881
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,400
Don't call him a coward.

882
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,400
Okay.

883
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,640
If you need someone to talk to,

884
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,640
I can talk to you.

885
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
No need.

886
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,160
Go back after you eat.

887
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,160
Or your dad will trouble you again.

888
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,040
Do you know my dad so well?

889
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,640
Your dad

890
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,320
wants to eat beef and duck.

891
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,360
He wants to eat it with my grandma.

892
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,600
It's the same as eating a mouse.

893
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,720
It's a good thing.

894
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,160
He can order you a house later.

895
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,920
That's right.

896
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,040
Your dad will pay you 800 yuan a day.

897
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,040
You need money.

898
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,400
Men are soft-hearted.

899
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,400
They eat short-tongued food.

900
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,120
I want to be independent.

901
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,120
Okay.

902
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,800
Add a WeChat.

903
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,040
You just broke up.

904
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,840
You're too anxious.

905
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,040
You're about to tease Ling Cl girlfriends.

906
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,360
I thought you were worth it.

907
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,640
Brother, open the pantry.

908
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,800
Okay.

909
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,800
It's over.

910
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,000
All three characters are Write and��war, right?

911
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,160
Okay.

912
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,060
hit him,

913
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:31,700
or beat up his dad.

914
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,220
I am just a brother.

915
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:38,220
My son will know how to work out.

916
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:38,980
Mom,

917
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,300
can I ask you a question?

918
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:43,800
Anyone know

919
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,620
why my son goes into the water?

920
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,140
Whenever I need him,

921
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,260
I would bring a助 for him.

922
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:51,580
Yes.

923
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,400
My mom is busy with her TV set recently.

924
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,400
She doesn't have time to take care of me.

925
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,400
Otherwise, she wouldn't have given her baby to me.

926
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,400
If you want to listen to my mom,

927
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,400
you'll have to wait for her.

928
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,400
I'm looking forward to it.

929
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,400
Am I a little bit too much now?

930
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,400
Wow.

931
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,400
I can't solve a problem without me.

932
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,400
I'll take a look.

933
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,400
Pull in the orange juice.

934
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,400
What do you mean?

935
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,400
You two must be able to kill Tian Liao at any time.

936
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,400
But the amount is different.

937
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,400
It will never be cold.

938
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,400
If you don't answer, someone will answer.

939
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,400
Let me do it.

940
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,400
I'll make money with you.

941
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,400
Look.

942
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,400
What did I say?

943
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,400
Mrs. Cai Yingying.

944
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,400
You're a little bit of a girl.

945
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,400
Pick up the key.

946
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,400
Just pick it up.

947
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,400
This is good.

948
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,400
Go to check.

949
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,400
There was a question I asked.

950
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,400
Did you go to the Kasper crush after work?

951
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,400
You've turned into a geyser.

952
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,400
Do you?

953
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,400
I like the little sister's chasing after me.

954
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,400
Do you think you're jealous?

955
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,400
I'm so idle.

956
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,600
Give you the suit.

957
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,300
It's my choice.

958
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:54,960
This is okay.

959
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,500
I like that.

960
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,320
For me?

961
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,100
That will be awkward to take.

962
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:02,800
Here.

963
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:07,720
Give you.

964
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,200
If we don't make it,

965
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,060
I will lose Xun常 this time.

966
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,180
Did you...

967
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,140
You asked me?

968
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:29,140
Sorry, I forgot to buy you a new one.

969
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,660
All the set-up is set-up.

970
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,140
I've never let you have a chance to be with me

971
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,900
and be with you everywhere.

972
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,420
I've never even let you go.

973
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,860
Lucy, you're really a top player.

974
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,340
Do we have drinks in our room?

975
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,020
Don't you drink drinks?

976
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,780
I suddenly want to drink.

977
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,620
Can't we?

978
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,740
Sure.

979
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:53,740
I'll get it for you.

980
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:54,860
Thanks.

981
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,180
You're out of the room.

982
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,260
Why are you dressed up?

983
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,260
What happened?

984
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,660
Xue Zhi and Tan Xue seem to be separated.

985
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,860
Cheng Du Zhou, don't let anyone else get separated.

986
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,060
You're dressed up.

987
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,220
Don't jump into my fire pit.

988
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:12,940
No.

989
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,020
I don't know why I...

990
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,500
I'm a little...

991
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,500
A little what?

992
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,940
I don't want to be in love

993
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,540
so I want to treat you to a meal.

994
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:25,660
What's this?

995
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,580
Take it.

996
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,100
If you need any explanation,

997
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,100
I can go.

998
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:30,660
You can have it first.

999
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,500
Wait for me.

1000
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,420
Add a WeChat.

1001
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,020
I'll think of you if you have money.

1002
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:44,660
I'm a little...

1003
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,540
Unrequited.

1004
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,860
I can't refuse.

1005
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,460
What do you mean?

1006
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:50,820
I can't refuse?

1007
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,820
I don't know.

1008
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,020
If I knew,

1009
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,500
I wouldn't be so annoyed.

1010
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,300
I have a boyfriend.

1011
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:56,980
He's...

1012
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,820
Are you annoyed by him?

1013
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,980
Are you annoyed by him?

1014
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,380
Let me tell you.

1015
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,780
Xue Zhi is indeed beautiful.

1016
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,540
But the girl who chased after you

1017
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:11,940
is not that beautiful.

1018
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:12,780
Gu Yan.

1019
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,740
You're so simple

1020
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:16,140
to such a beauty.

1021
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:17,380
But you know,

1022
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,500
she's different from other girls

1023
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,620
from you.

1024
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:24,820
She has a boyfriend.

1025
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:27,580
So?

1026
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:30,140
So you can't refuse.

1027
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,340
It's not her.

1028
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:32,700
It's not...

1029
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:35,700
It's...

1030
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:37,940
Excitement.

1031
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,100
It's like...

1032
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,660
You can't say it in a word.

1033
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,500
It's like...

1034
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:45,580
It's like a normal kiss.

1035
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:46,220
Do you understand?

1036
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:48,420
I'm not a kisser.

1037
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,420
I'm not a kisser.

1038
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,420
I'm not a kisser.

1039
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,420
I'm not a kisser.

1040
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,420
I'm not a kisser.

1041
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,420
I'm not a kisser.

1042
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:54,420
I'm not a kisser.

1043
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,420
I'm not a kisser.

1044
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:56,420
I'm not a kisser.

1045
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:57,420
I'm not a kisser.

1046
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,420
I'm not a kisser.

1047
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,420
I'm not a kisser.

1048
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,420
I'm not a kisser.

1049
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,420
I'm not a kisser.

1050
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:02,420
I'm not a kisser.

1051
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:03,420
I'm not a kisser.

1052
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,420
I'm not a kisser.

1053
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,420
I'm not a kisser.

1054
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,420
I'm not a kisser.

1055
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,420
I'm not a kisser.

1056
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,420
I'm not a kisser.

1057
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,420
I'm not a kisser.

1058
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,420
I'm not a kisser.

1059
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,420
I'm not a kisser.

1060
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:20,000
Like the rain and the summer

1061
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:25,340
ulating the Jetzt

1062
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:35,300
It's simple but ay

1063
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:39,560
The world is so nice

1064
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,760
I'm sorry.

1065
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,760
I'm sorry.

1066
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,760
I'm sorry.

1067
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,760
I'm sorry.

1068
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,760
I'm sorry.

1069
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,760
I'm sorry.

1070
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,760
I'm sorry.

1071
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,760
I'm sorry.

1072
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,760
I'm sorry.

1073
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,760
I'm sorry.

1074
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,760
I'm sorry.

1075
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,760
I'm sorry.

1076
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,760
I'm sorry.

1077
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,760
I'm sorry.

1078
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,760
I'm sorry.

1079
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,760
I'm sorry.

1080
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,760
I'm sorry.

1081
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,760
I'm sorry.

1082
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,760
I'm sorry.

1083
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,760
I'm sorry.

1084
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,760
I'm sorry.

1085
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,760

1092
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,760
I'm sorry.

1093
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,360
I'm sorry.

1094
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,360
I'm sorry.

1095
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,360
I'm sorry.

1096
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,360
I'm sorry.

1097
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,360
I'm sorry.

1098
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,360
I'm sorry.

1099
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,360
I'm sorry.

1100
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,360
I'm sorry.

1101
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,360
I'm sorry.

1102
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,360
I'm sorry.

1103
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,360
I'm sorry.

1104
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,360
I'm sorry.

1105
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,360
I'm sorry.

1106
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,360
I'm sorry.

1107
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,360
I'm sorry.

1108
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,360
I'm sorry.

1109
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,360

1127
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,960
I'm sorry.

1128
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:45,960

1129
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:46,960

1130
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,960

1131
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:48,960
I'm sorry.

1132
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,960
