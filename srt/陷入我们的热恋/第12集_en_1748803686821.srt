1
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,560
The breath of feeling free

2
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,360
The flame of life

3
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,620
Butterflies pitch and rattle

4
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,380
Crash

5
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:50,200
When the dark night meets the secret

6
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,200
Crash

7
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:58,380
From the memories from the past

8
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:02,380
Baby, falling my heart

9
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:07,380
The moment I look back

10
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,380
The effect of being far away

11
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,380
I feel the hatred in my fingers

12
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,380
Falling my heart

13
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:22,380
If I'm tired of the eyes

14
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,380
The atmosphere of the city remains in my memory

15
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:32,380
The sea of people is waiting for each other

16
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:36,380
I'm afraid

17
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,380
Crush

18
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,380
Actually, you know me very well

19
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:09,380
What kind of sugar do you think it tastes like?

20
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,380
Churizu

21
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,380
You're lying

22
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,380
If you want to know, just say it

23
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,380
What are you doing?

24
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,380
Dad, why are you here?

25
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,380
My house is downstairs

26
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,380
Why is he here?

27
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,380
I found him a photo

28
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,380
Then I need to confirm the photo

29
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,380
You've been out for so long

30
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,380
You're not going back?

31
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,380
Okay

32
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,380
Why didn't you come back to make tea this month?

33
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,380
No time

34
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,380
These are excuses

35
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,380
I didn't put this thing on my heart

36
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,380
I had a patient before

37
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,380
He was young

38
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,380
He didn't take care of himself

39
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,380
He came back to make tea after marriage

40
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,380
He's been here for a long time

41
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,380
He's almost dead

42
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,380
I tell you

43
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,380
Come back to make tea this month

44
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,380
Do you hear me?

45
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,380
Do you hear me?

46
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,380
Go

47
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,380
Dad, thank you

48
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,380
What?

49
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,380
Milk?

50
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,380
Milk?

51
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,380
Good

52
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,380
Is there any problem with Mr. Chen?

53
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,380
What's the problem?

54
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,380
What's the relationship with you?

55
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,380
It has nothing to do with me

56
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,380
I just ask

57
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,380
Girls, don't ask this kind of questions

58
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,380
Are you hungry?

59
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,380
Let's cook

60
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,380
Let's eat

61
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,380
Let's eat

62
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,380
Nini

63
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,380
Yes

64
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,380
Have you been to Chen's?

65
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,380
No

66
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,380
I told you

67
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,380
I'm cooking a home-cooked meal

68
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,380
Oh

69
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,380
I remember that you're cooking a home-cooked meal

70
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,380
in Chenshan Road

71
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,380
Every time you come back

72
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,380
You come back from Yifeng alley

73
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,380
That's two directions

74
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,380
I'm going there to eat

75
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,380
You've been eating in the cafeteria

76
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,380
No one's cooking at home

77
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,380
I'm going there to eat

78
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,380
You're really busy

79
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,380
You should take care of yourself

80
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,380
How about this?

81
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,380
Come back early tomorrow at 8pm

82
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,380
I'll come back to cook dinner

83
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,380
You can come to play with your family

84
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,380
Let's eat dinner at home, okay?

85
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,380
Why don't you ask again?

86
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,380
Have you been to Chen's?

87
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,380
Yes, we've been playing

88
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,380
Actually, you're grown up

89
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,380
I shouldn't take care of some things

90
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,380
We just play a love game

91
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,380
Love is accepted because it's early

92
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,380
And Chen Luzhe is a good man

93
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,380
And he's still a local

94
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,380
After you get married

95
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,380
You have to be closer to our family

96
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,380
Is it so difficult to get along?

97
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,380
You've said it before

98
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,380
No

99
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,380
If you're from the north of the country

100
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,380
You can't get home in a year

101
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,380
Who do I say when dad wants to talk?

102
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,380
I don't want to be an old man

103
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,380
Dad, where have you been?

104
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,380
I've been in love with him

105
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,380
But he'll break up soon

106
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,380
Because he's going abroad

107
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,380
Chen Luzhou is in Yifeng alley, right?

108
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,380
Zhizhi, as long as you say it

109
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,380
Dad learned it and can't hurt you

110
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,380
He'll let you go

111
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,380
You can't be too happy

112
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,380
I'm still Yang Jizhu

113
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,380
You've been hiding it from me for so long

114
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,380
You still want to celebrate it?

115
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,380
Jiang Cheng told you he's in love

116
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,380
I don't believe it

117
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,380
No

118
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,380
No

119
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,380
Congratulations, Master Chen

120
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,380
Aunt

121
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,380
No, mom

122
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,380
Aunt Ling

123
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,380
Did your dad clean up?

124
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,380
No

125
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,380
But he said you'd leave me alone

126
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,380
I just had to use the knife to cut you

127
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,380
Luckily, I had a hard time

128
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,380
Then we'll meet tomorrow

129
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,380
You're so timid

130
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,380
I'm not timid

131
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,380
I'm worried your dad will be a trouble

132
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,380
Do you dare to go to my dad's tea shop?

133
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,380
Is your dad's career in the hospital

134
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,380
still in the company?

135
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,380
I'll stop talking

136
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,380
My dad seems to be drunk

137
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,380
What are you doing, Zhu Yangqi?

138
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,380
Why did you...

139
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,380
Why are you here?

140
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,380
Well, you two go ahead

141
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,380
I have to go

142
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,380
I'll be right back

143
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,380
I'll leave you alone

144
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,380
He's in love

145
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,380
What? You want to see him?

146
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,380
Forget it

147
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,380
I'm afraid you'll be mad at me

148
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,380
The visa for the study is down

149
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,380
I'm going to Rui Cheng to pick you up

150
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,380
Your dad said we haven't gone out for a long time

151
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,380
You don't have to take the fire

152
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,380
Take all the luggage

153
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,380
After Rui Cheng's trip is over

154
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,380
I'll go to your school

155
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,380
Don't take me with you

156
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,380
I'll go by myself

157
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,380
You're a sensible boy

158
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,380
You never let me worry about you

159
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,380
I believe this matter

160
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,380
will not be an accident

161
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,380
Are you okay, Du Xin?

162
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,380
The queen didn't make things difficult for you

163
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,380
I didn't mean it

164
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,380
I thought you were the one who opened the door

165
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,380
I was so excited that I said it

166
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,380
Dad, are you okay?

167
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,380
I'm fine

168
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,380
Chen Luzhou, this little bastard

169
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,380
He knows he wants to go abroad

170
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,380
He's here to see you

171
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,380
You two young people

172
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,380
can't be happy all of a sudden

173
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,380
What's happiness?

174
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,380
Happiness is

175
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,380
the long distance you have to see

176
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,380
Thank you

177
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,380
My dad is drunk

178
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,380
He's in the washroom

179
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,380
Did you go to Dunhuang that day?

180
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,380
I'm not going

181
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,380
I'll stay here for a few more days

182
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,380
My mom changed her schedule

183
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,380
She'll be going to Rui City with her family next Monday

184
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,380
She won't be in the washroom

185
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,380
I see

186
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,380
Good night, Mr. Shen

187
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,380
Nu Nu

188
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,380
Why did you drink?

189
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,380
The child can't drink

190
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,380
What's wrong?

191
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,380
I really can't say it

192
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,380
I can't say it

193
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,380
It's okay

194
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,380
It's okay

195
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,380
There are some things that will be good

196
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,380
If you're unhappy

197
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,380
I'll drink with you

198
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,380
Come

199
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,380
Don't be sad

200
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,380
There are some things that will be good

201
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,380
Let's have a drink

202
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,380
Take it easy

203
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,380
I'm telling you

204
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,380
Don't drink white wine anymore

205
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,380
I'll make you some fresh milk tea

206
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,380
Don't waste the information

207
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,380
I'm afraid of the wind

208
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,380
I'm afraid of the wind

209
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,380
I'm afraid of the wind

210
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,380
I'm afraid of the wind

211
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,380
I'm afraid of the wind

212
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,380
I'm afraid of the wind

213
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,380
I'm afraid of the wind

214
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,380
I'm afraid of the wind

215
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,380
I'm afraid of the wind

216
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,380
I'm afraid of the wind

217
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,380
I'm afraid of the wind

218
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,380
I'm afraid of the wind

219
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,380
I'm afraid of the wind

220
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,380
I'm afraid of the wind

221
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,380
Don't be afraid of the sad emotions

222
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,320
that have come before the last

223
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,300
The dream you once remembered

224
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,800
told us to meet each other

225
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,380
Do you have time

226
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,380
to go to the pub with me

227
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,380
She's not smart enough to Deputy governor Lu

228
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:15,380
Tomorrow he comes to the hospital to see me.

229
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,380
Come in.

230
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,880
Uncle Xu.

231
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,880
Who are you talking about?

232
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,880
Doctor Xu.

233
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,380
Where's Ding Li?

234
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,380
I heard you're going abroad.

235
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,880
Let me show you something.

236
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,880
Hello, everyone. I'm Xie Zhi.

237
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,380
The old man once said that I'm not a good soldier.

238
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,380
Although I don't have a good life,

239
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,380
I'm not pretty.

240
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,380
I can't give you a good life.

241
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,380
But I'm not a good soldier.

242
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,880
I don't have a job.

243
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,380
I hope you can choose me.

244
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,380
But I'm a class monitor.

245
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,380
I hope you can cooperate with me.

246
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,380
Don't make me feel embarrassed.

247
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,380
Thank you.

248
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,380
How is it?

249
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,380
Is my daughter confident?

250
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,380
She's confident.

251
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,880
You raised her well.

252
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,880
But she cried last night and told me.

253
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,880
Dad, am I very bad?

254
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,380
I can't even understand my boyfriend.

255
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,380
I'm really useless.

256
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,380
Dad, when did I say that?

257
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,880
Hello?

258
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,880
Why didn't you knock the door?

259
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,880
You asked the patient to give you a meal card?

260
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,880
Even if you're my real father, you have to knock the door.

261
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,880
Fine. I'm your real father.

262
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,880
No.

263
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,880
Guang Ji, I'm here.

264
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,880
Stand still.

265
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,880
The report is out. Have a look.

266
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,880
What are you looking at?

267
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,880
You little girl.

268
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,880
I need to know the situation.

269
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,880
Can't girls see?

270
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,880
Wait for me outside.

271
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,880
Who are you asking her to wait for?

272
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,880
Waiting for you to get off work.

273
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,880
Forget it.

274
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,880
I heard it too.

275
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,880
Later, where are you going?

276
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,880
Tell me.

277
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,380
I'll go to the耳朵 with her.

278
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,380
When I was a kid,

279
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,380
I took her to the耳朵 a few times.

280
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,380
But every time I walked to half way,

281
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,380
she went home.

282
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,380
She was actually afraid of pain.

283
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,380
And she loved to play with sand.

284
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,380
But after her mother left,

285
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,880
she changed.

286
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,880
Other than the little things about her,

287
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,880
she didn't tell me many things.

288
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,880
Maybe I didn't give her enough security.

289
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,880
Is my father very failed?

290
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,880
Uncle Xu, I think this is the father who is so failed.

291
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,880
His fist is still very hard.

292
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,380
Don't bully Wen Yu'er.

293
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,380
I'll beat you to death.

294
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,380
Just leave.

295
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,380
Don't be so lazy.

296
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,380
Okay.

297
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,380
How's your report?

298
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,380
It's so good.

299
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,380
I'm not sure.

300
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,380
But I'm sure.

301
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,880
So interesting.

302
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,880
Okay.

303
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,880
Let me show you.

304
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,880
What does this mean?

305
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,880
It's a gold test report

306
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,880
for a top-class graduate in the top-class.

307
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,880
Self-love?

308
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,880
Self-love?

309
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,880
I've never said that my beauty

310
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,880
is not as beautiful as this.

311
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,880
My father is giving you a video.

312
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,380
Yes.

313
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,380
But my favorite is that

314
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,380
if I become a class leader,

315
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,380
I hope everyone can cooperate with me

316
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,380
and don't make us men.

317
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,380
Zhizhi,

318
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,380
you're so ugly and cute when you were little.

319
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,380
Right?

320
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,380
If we met when we were little,

321
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,380
wouldn't you bow down to my nail?

322
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,380
You dare not?

323
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,380
No.

324
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,380
I'm afraid you'll steal my nail.

325
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,880
Oh, you really know me.

326
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:40,880
The Truth

327
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,880
actually

328
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,880
you can work out

329
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,680
Okay.

330
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,880
Do you want to see Erhuai?

331
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,880
There's a suitable one for you.

332
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:13,880
Take a look.

333
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,280
Here.

334
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,880
There's a new one.

335
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,880
This is so cute.

336
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,880
It looks good.

337
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,880
Why don't you help me pick it?

338
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,880
I'll pick it?

339
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,880
I haven't even picked a gift for girls.

340
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,880
Are you sure?

341
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,880
This one.

342
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,880
This one.

343
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,880
I can still pick it.

344
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,880
You're so thoughtful.

345
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,880
Do you want me to

346
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,880
think of you as a dog?

347
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,880
Okay. Let me see.

348
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,880
This one.

349
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,880
Is this okay?

350
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,880
The night is coming.

351
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,880
The road is long and hard.

352
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,880
I'm waiting for you.

353
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,880
Call him.

354
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,880
This one?

355
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,880
It's suitable for you.

356
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,880
Wait a minute.

357
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,880
We're done.

358
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,880
We can't touch water today.

359
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,880
You have to take it for a few days.

360
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,880
Okay.

361
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,880
I'll read it for you.

362
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,880
Here.

363
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,880
Here.

364
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,880
I'll read it for you.

365
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,880
Okay.

366
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,880
I'll go out for a while.

367
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,880
Wait here.

368
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,880
I'll go out for a while.

369
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,880
Wait here.

370
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,880
You're going to buy the umbrella?

371
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,880
Didn't the manager say

372
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,880
we can't touch water when we hit Erzong?

373
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,880
Well, this is...

374
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,880
The expert said

375
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,880
we can't touch water when we hit Erzong.

376
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:37,480
Is the expert

377
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,880
the one who's getting wet?

378
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,880
The manager is not.

379
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,880
Is the expert Jinchen?

380
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,880
You're so straightforward.

381
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,880
Are you going to the office tomorrow?

382
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,880
Yes.

383
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,880
You can go to the office tomorrow.

384
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,880
Tomorrow?

385
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,880
I might have something to do tomorrow.

386
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,880
I can't go.

387
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,880
That's fine.

388
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,880
I have to work tomorrow anyway.

389
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,880
You can go to the office tomorrow?

390
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,880
Yes.

391
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,880
Can you get up?

392
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,880
Of course.

393
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,880
I can get up at 11 o'clock

394
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,880
when I'm in the whole high school.

395
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,880
I'll get up at 4 o'clock.

396
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,880
Don't you believe me?

397
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,880
Yes.

398
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,880
It's what I imagined.

399
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,880
What about you?

400
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,880
What about you?

401
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,880
I'm just like you.

402
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,880
I only sleep at 3 or 4 o'clock.

403
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,880
Then I get up at 8 o'clock

404
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,880
and go to the early morning practice.

405
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,880
You're still in the middle of the night.

406
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,880
I thought you were very confident.

407
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,880
I only drank water with you.

408
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,880
It's only been three years.

409
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,880
So the expert is going to work hard.

410
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,880
I thought

411
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,880
we can get out of the window while lying down.

412
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,880
How is that possible?

413
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,880
It's only three years.

414
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,880
Li Zong has already brushed the seven or eight thousand.

415
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,880
Wow.

416
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,880
How much is Li Zong?

417
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,880
292 yuan.

418
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,880
It's so high.

419
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,880
Let's call him.

420
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,880
I should never meet

421
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,880
someone who can rely on 290 yuan

422
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,880
for more than 290 yuan.

423
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,880
That's all.

424
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,880
I'll mention it

425
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,880
when I see it later.

426
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,880
Bye.

427
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,880
Eat it.

428
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,880
I'll give it to you.

429
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,880
Take it back.

430
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,880
Okay. Bye.

431
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,880
Since then,

432
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,880
I shouldn't have met

433
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,880
a woman like you.

434
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,880
Tomorrow is the deadline

435
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,880
Are you free tomorrow?

436
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,080
Lu Zhong.

437
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,680
Where's mom?

438
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,880
She went to send her sister-in-law to send her to the hospital.

439
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,680
Today, we'll be having lunch together.

440
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,480
Let's eat.

441
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,880
Okay.

442
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,280
A little rice.

443
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,080
Bye.

444
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,480
Don't know if this is because of your wife.

445
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,280
Or because you want to go abroad.

446
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,480
Recently, I've always dreamed

447
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,380
that you just came to this除.

448
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,580
At that time,

449
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,280
you should drink like this.

450
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,960
Time flies.

451
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,680
You're taller than me in a blink of an eye.

452
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,280
Mo Chou,

453
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,480
let's change your shoes.

454
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,320
Okay.

455
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,840
Look.

456
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,680
This is your new home.

457
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,480
Let's live here.

458
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,680
Do you like it?

459
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,080
Chen.

460
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,080
Chen.

461
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,480
Here you are.

462
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,280
I'm here.

463
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:12,880
It's okay.

464
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,680
I'm afraid.

465
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,880
I'll stay here.

466
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,880
Hello, Mo Chou.

467
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,680
This is for you.

468
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,480
Take it.

469
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,080
Look.

470
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,680
I bought you a gift.

471
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,280
Here.

472
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,480
Do you like it?

473
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,480
Do you like it?

474
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,280
Good boy.

475
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:39,680
Let's go.

476
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,680
I'll take you to the other side.

477
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,680
It's okay.

478
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,680
I'll stay with you.

479
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,480
Don't be afraid.

480
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,280
Okay.

481
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:45,880
Let's go.

482
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,480
Let's go.

483
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,280
There are many, many things.

484
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,480
Yuli,

485
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,680
this is the key to the apartment.

486
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,480
Mo Chou,

487
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,080
are you...

488
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,680
actually not going to live here?

489
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,480
No.

490
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,280
The house is good.

491
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:30,880
Yes.

492
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,080
It's good to go out and have a look.

493
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,280
It's good.

494
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,480
But no matter where you go,

495
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,480
you can't go anywhere.

496
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,480
You will always have your family.

497
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,880
You can't come back to see them.

498
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,680
After I leave,

499
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,480
maybe I'll stay there for a while.

500
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,880
I'll be back soon.

501
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,880
I'm going to the other side.

502
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,480
Hello, Chen Lu Chou.

503
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,480
What's wrong?

504
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,680
Are you looking for me?

505
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,880
I'm listening to you.

506
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,880
What are you doing?

507
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,480
I'm waiting for my dad to make a home-cooking.

508
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,080
Okay.

509
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,280
You can go ahead.

510
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,880
We'll talk after we get off work.

511
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:25,880
I'm hanging up.

512
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,280
Hello?

513
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,280
Where are you going?

514
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,280
I'm going out for a while.

515
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,480
Please don't wait for me.

516
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,080
I'm sure I'll see him again.

517
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,080
You're not going to stay here.

518
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,480
Hello?

519
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,280
Ding Dong.

520
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,480
Hi.

521
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,880
Why are you here?

522
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,280
Didn't you want to hear my voice?

523
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,680
Let me give you a real-time review of the topic.

524
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,680
I'm off to class.

525
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,680
There's a kid here

526
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,680
who needs to take care of Mr. Xu.

527
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:49,880
I'm done.

528
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,480
Let's go.

529
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,680
Is there anyone at home?

530
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,080
What's wrong with the temper?

531
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,080
Stop pretending.

532
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,480
I just got up for a while.

533
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,080
You two are together.

534
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,080
Since there's someone here,

535
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,280
why don't you tell me?

536
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,880
It's too sudden.

537
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,480
I haven't come to the opening yet.

538
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:15,880
Tell me.

539
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,880
Which one is the first one to open?

540
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,080
It's you.

541
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,480
You know me well

542
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,880
about Chen Dongzhou.

543
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,080
He won't disturb you at this time.

544
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,280
Why won't he dare?

545
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,080
Because he's going abroad soon.

546
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,080
He won't dare.

547
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,080
Is it annoying?

548
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,080
What does it have to do with you?

549
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,080
It's just theiors.

550
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:40,400
You...

551
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,680
Are you disturbing me?

552
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,080
Fine, then I'm going.

553
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,080
How about what I go home first?

554
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,080
Send bellies back.

555
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,080
You guys must not gradually

556
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,680
solve matters inside me.

557
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,680
He's like this, too.

558
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,720
He can't find a way to get it.

559
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,040
You guys also had a fight?

560
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,320
He hopes that I can stay with him

561
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,520
and ask for his life.

562
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,040
I don't agree.

563
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,080
Let's have a fight.

564
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,400
When Anqi was young,

565
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,920
he begged his father

566
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,240
for a meal.

567
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,240
But he doesn't know

568
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,760
that my father and his father

569
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,440
are not the same kind of people.

570
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,160
As for you.

571
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,200
We stay together for so long,

572
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,240
that's my life.

573
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,720
But it's better to stay in Beili for the whole time after break

574
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,000
than live alone.

575
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,200
Then what should I do now?

576
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,880
It's okay.

577
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,880
Really.

578
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,720
managed to buy chicken.

579
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:02,980
Will you drink from the reaction of money?

580
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,380
No

581
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:12,040
More absolutely

582
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,880
It's too spicy.

583
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,600
Forget it.

584
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,000
Bring me a bottle of water.

585
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,520
Got it.

586
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,760
You know him better than I do.

587
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,040
He's used to it

588
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:34,760
when he's in a bad mood.

589
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,520
You know what?

590
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,160
Actually,

591
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,640
it's not the first time I met you

592
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,880
at your door.

593
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,760
When was that?

594
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,960
In high school.

595
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,680
High school?

596
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,960
Why didn't I remember?

597
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,520
At that time,

598
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,360
the basketball league

599
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,200
was the first one

600
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,360
that we played.

601
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,120
I was going to give the team a drink.

602
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,280
I saw you standing on the side of the basketball court

603
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,640
and talking to your classmate.

604
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,400
Then?

605
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,320
I wanted to ask you

606
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,960
to give me a drink.

607
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,520
But you treated me like a fan.

608
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,800
You drank it when you got it.

609
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,000
Do you think you're so self-righteous?

610
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,360
You should have recognized him.

611
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,640
I wouldn't have talked to you

612
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,840
when I was playing basketball.

613
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,320
You wouldn't have recognized him.

614
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,600
I saw him

615
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,640
on the show.

616
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,360
The one next to you

617
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,760
with the photo.

618
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,960
It's pretty.

619
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,760
It's called Zhang Yu.

620
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:50,880
You're wrong.

621
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,000
I didn't feel

622
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,560
my teeth at that time.

623
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,240
When did you feel it?

624
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,440
What about you?

625
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,360
I felt it at first sight.

626
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,160
But at that time,

627
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,240
I didn't believe in the middle.

628
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,840
And I thought you had a boyfriend.

629
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,080
So I didn't think about it.

630
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,680
Then don't you think about it now?

631
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,880
Don't comment.

632
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,840
I'm going to take a shower.

633
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,320
I'll send you back when I watch a movie.

634
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,560
Can you not close the door?

635
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:32,840
I'm thinking.

636
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,400
If you play basketball that day,

637
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,400
I'll ask your name.

638
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,200
Will you tell me?

639
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,080
Sure.

640
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,400
I'll also

641
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,560
text you.

642
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,960
Why?

643
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,400
I'll tell you the account of that bottle of water.

644
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,600
Youxi, I'm back.

645
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,200
Who's here?

646
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,880
Surprise!

647
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,880
Surprise!

648
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,880
Surprise!

649
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,880
Surprise!

650
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,120
Surprise!

651
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,800
What's wrong with you?

652
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,000
They said you're going abroad.

653
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,240
So they sent you here.

654
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,440
Come on.

655
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,600
Jiang Cheng.

656
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,320
Don't move your chair.

657
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,640
Don't move.

658
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,800
What's wrong with you?

659
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,560
Hi.

660
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,360
And Gu Yan.

661
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,240
We're at the convenience store.

662
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:27,960
It's a good place to meet.

663
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,000
He's here with us.

664
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,480
Come in.

665
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,880
Come on.

666
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,040
It's been a long time.

667
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,360
Yes.

668
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,760
I didn't expect to meet him here.

669
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,480
Why isn't Cai Ying here?

670
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,520
She's been preparing for the exam recently.

671
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,360
She can't make it.

672
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,440
What's the major in the exam?

673
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,080
The master of the voice acting.

674
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,120
I can't do it.

675
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,960
I've done it before.

676
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,000
Maybe I can give her

677
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,360
some little advice.

678
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,200
Really?

679
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,120
I'll get you two a ball.

680
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,160
You two can talk.

681
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:54,760
Sure.

682
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,400
The back yard is not on fire.

683
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,480
Don't worry. Go take a shower.

684
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,160
We'll catch her.

685
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:01,960
How can we take a break?

686
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,200
Thank you.

687
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,320
Come on.

688
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,040
Drink whatever you want.

689
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,320
It's all in the fridge.

690
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,280
Let's drink.

691
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,440
This is for kids.

692
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,000
Come on.

693
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,520
What are you playing?

694
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,120
Lu Zong.

695
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,320
I'm talking about you singing.

696
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,440
I haven't heard you sing for a long time.

697
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,040
Come on.

698
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,000
Come on.

699
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,440
I'll sing when you come out.

700
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,120
Come on.

701
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,160
I'll give you a tip.

702
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:29,720
Come on.

703
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,240
Go to the top.

704
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:30,880
Go to the top.

705
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,120
Go to the top.

706
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:31,640
Sit.

707
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,240
The drama is really good.

708
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,040
The memos on your song are awesome.

709
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,280
I want to write about this for everyone.

710
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,120
I want to say,

711
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,720
you're thekick of my story.

712
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,280
The lyrics on your song are great.

713
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,040
I want the lyrics to be like this.

714
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,200
Do you have any cloudones?

715
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,700
It's very brave

716
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:15,540
Z & C & Z'

717
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:18,540
You have your choice

718
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:26,540
I just hope that I can like you

719
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,540
The situation is very complicated

720
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:34,540
I'm very upset

721
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:38,540
The communication between people

722
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:41,540
Sometimes it's so beautiful

723
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,540
Maybe only you

724
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:47,540
Can delay it

725
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,740
anken

726
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,680
When I cry sides

727
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,540
Also banish me

728
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:56,540
By saying words

729
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,540
I'm so single

730
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:02,540
My legs areick

731
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,540
My point of view

732
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,040
In silence

733
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:10,800
Like put tightly

734
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,800
Wow.

735
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,800
Why is the song so good?

736
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,800
I'm so tired of listening to it.

737
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,800
Really tired of listening.

738
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,800
Let me show you.

739
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,800
Can you play it?

740
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,800
Definitely.

741
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,800
Come on, Jing.

742
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,800
Come on.

743
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,800
Why are you so sad?

744
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,800
Lu Siya.

745
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,800
Do you think you went to the third year of the foreign land last time?

746
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,800
No one reminded me that I'm going to wear a uniform.

747
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,800
No one reminded me that

748
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,800
you were on the left side of the pool.

749
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,800
No one said that I was much more than who said that.

750
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,800
Why haven't you left yet?

751
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,800
I've been missing you.

752
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,800
Right?

753
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,800
I'm leaving.

754
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,800
I'll pick up my dad's phone.

755
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,800
Where's the girl?

756
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,800
I have a phone.

757
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,800
Come on.

758
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,800
Where's the girl?

759
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,800
The girl is in the house.

760
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,800
I thought you went together.

761
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,800
Come on.

762
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,800
Come on.

763
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,800
Come on.

764
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,800
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

765
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,800
The fire is burning.

766
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,800
The air is blowing.

767
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,400
The world is full of

768
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,800
But can I play a little bit?

769
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,800
If you don't sleep at home,

770
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,800
don't go back home.

771
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,800
It's late.

772
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,800
Can I?

773
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,800
Can you?

774
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,800
You really want to live at her house?

775
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,800
You want to talk to that guy.

776
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,800
How about it?

777
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,800
You can go tomorrow.

778
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,800
Uncle, come on.

779
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,800
Uncle.

780
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,800
What do you mean?

781
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,800
Do you want to be kicked out?

782
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,800
Don't you want to come back?

783
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,800
Hurry up.

784
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,800
Send someone over here.

785
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,800
Okay.

786
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:58,800
What did Xu say?

787
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,800
He asked me

788
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,800
if I had tasted the taste of the dish knife.

789
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,800
Have you seen the movie?

790
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,800
I haven't.

791
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,800
Can you watch it now?

792
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,800
I can't.

793
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,800
Watch a movie.

794
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,800
There's everything in the movie.

795
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,800
The weather is so cold.

796
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,800
The world is so quiet.

797
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:26,800
All the sound of the wind.

798
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,800
Who will come to the light?

799
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,800
Be careful.

800
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,800
I'm not a little bit nervous.

801
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,800
The wind is so strong.

802
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,800
Let the world become a relationship.

803
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,800
What's the point of it?

804
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,800
Look.

805
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,800
The world is so quiet.

806
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,800
I want to be alone.

807
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:06,800
Please take me to the world.

808
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,800
I want to be alone.

809
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,800
I'm not moving in the future.

810
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,800
Because you are a fan.

811
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,800
I walk alone.

812
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:26,800
I don't want to be drunk at night.

813
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,800
I want to be alone.

814
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,800
I don't want to be alone.

815
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:40,800
I want to be alone.

816
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,800
I'm not moving in the future.

817
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,800
Because you are a fan.

818
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,800
I walk alone.

819
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,800
I can be brave and brave.

820
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:03,800
When will we meet again?

821
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:07,800
I want to be with you.

822
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:12,800
I don't want to be alone.

823
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,800
In your eyes.

824
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,800
I see myself.

825
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,800
Into you.

826
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,800
Into you.
