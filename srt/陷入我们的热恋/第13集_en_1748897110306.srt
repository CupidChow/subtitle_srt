1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Falling my heart

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The world is burning with heat and heat

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The smile is being drawn into this distance

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I can feel the hatred and hatred in this world

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Falling my heart

6
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
If I cry out my eyes

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let the scenery of the city stay in memory

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The sea is waiting for each other

9
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Crush

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
As long as the rain of happiness is still raining

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
A day in the dream

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The sky is waiting for each other

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Falling my heart

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
If I cry out my eyes

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Let the scenery of the city stay in memory

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The sea is waiting for each other

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Crush

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The sky is waiting for each other

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Crush

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Falling my heart

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm leaving. I'm not coming out to see you off.

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Help me go back.

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Why?

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm busy with my girlfriend.

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I can take my own car.

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Sure.

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Go back.

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You go see her off.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I don't know when we'll meet again.

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You're not jealous?

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Go ahead.

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Stop.

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay.

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'll see you when I get back.

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I've parked the car for you.

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Chen Lu Zhou.

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
If it's someone else,

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I won't give up easily.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But I'm happy to lose to Xu Zhi.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But if one day he dumped you,

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'll still like you.

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'll keep chasing after you.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Actually, you don't need to spend your heart on me.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
As an actor, it should be hard.

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I see you go to work at five o'clock every morning.

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You must be tired from moving to the big night.

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I hope you can continue to play the opera.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You can come to Europe to attend a movie festival.

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You can get a prize.

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'll give you a light.

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'll go to the scene to give you a drink.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Okay.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
See you at the movie festival.

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Bye.

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Why don't you see me?

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What's wrong?

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What are you looking for?

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
My skin.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'll put it here.

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I can't find it.

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Stop looking.

62
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Go back and buy one more.

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yidang.

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yidang, do you want snow flowers?

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Then I'll go buy them.

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
No problem.

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,560
Xun Bai, it's okay.

68
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,560
Where's Ru Yan?

69
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:53,960
He went back.

70
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,440
Where's the meal?

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,200
I'm hungry, too.

72
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,760
Go eat some good food.

73
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,280
What?

74
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,600
Food?

75
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,080
Let's go.

76
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,720
What do you eat at night?

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Let's go.

78
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
Let's go.

79
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,480
Xun Bai.

80
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:12,920
It's your turn.

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Here it comes.

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Here it comes.

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Here it comes.

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'll take it.

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay.

86
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
This is good.

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's a special one.

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Try this.

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Can you get it?

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Sorry.

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Everyone, take a bite.

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Thank you.

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Eat.

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's a good meal.

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Excuse me.

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Eat.

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Today,

98
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm here to give you a special gift.

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You should keep eating and drinking.

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Okay.

101
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But there's something important.

102
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Come on.

103
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Remember to buy the menu with Xiaodan.

104
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Remember to find her.

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'll find you.

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Hurry up.

107
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
No problem.

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You can do it.

109
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Go on.

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Come on.

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Everyone, take a walk.

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Come on.

113
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Take a walk.

114
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Take a walk.

115
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yes.

116
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Come on.

117
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You know,

118
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
it's big and small.

119
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We're friends.

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
We're destined to be friends.

121
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm going to do something.

122
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I don't know when it's next.

123
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
How about this?

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Let's say something.

125
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Say something.

126
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm here to help our big artist

127
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
sell a million pieces of art.

128
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I heard it.

129
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
A million?

130
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's a beautiful thing.

131
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
How about this?

132
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'll help you.

133
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'll make money at home.

134
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'll make money.

135
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Isn't that right?

136
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yes.

137
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You're so kind.

138
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You're like a mute.

139
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Let me say something.

140
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I wish everyone can find

141
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
someone who understands your heart.

142
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's really big.

143
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You said that

144
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
a piece of art can sell a million pieces of art.

145
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's still possible.

146
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Right?

147
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But if you really can find someone who understands your heart,

148
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
you have to pay attention to your fate.

149
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Some people are lucky.

150
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
They might just go out and hit the wall.

151
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Some people are not lucky.

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
They might even get hit in the back.

153
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Do you think so, Lucy?

154
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But I think Dan Dan understands you.

155
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You just need to come and clean up.

156
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
He'll know the price when he comes.

157
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He's very stingy.

158
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Fine.

159
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Can you say something?

160
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You haven't said anything yet.

161
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Say something.

162
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Fine.

163
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Lucy said something to me.

164
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
A boy needs to have a breath.

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
A breath is not a blow.

166
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's not a blow.

167
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Even if the light of the oil is gone,

168
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
as long as the fish is not gone,

169
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
as long as the light is gone,

170
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
we can hope again.

171
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The boys who are given to you.

172
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Come.

173
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Come.

174
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
If you don't stay by my side,

175
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
don't talk to me about anything.

176
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
This is a good thing.

177
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Don't cry.

178
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Don't control me.

179
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I...

180
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Stop crying.

181
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Mr. Zhi.

182
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
As the only girl here,

183
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
do you want to say something?

184
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I hope

185
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
our girl's temperament is higher.

186
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
After all, the blind is the land of the cool.

187
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
There are many places we haven't been to.

188
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Come.

189
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Lucy.

190
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I want to press a bell.

191
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Then

192
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'll say something to Mr. Liang Qichao.

193
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
As I know,

194
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
my friend, Ba Huang,

195
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
the future is long and the future is long.

196
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The future is long and the future is long.

197
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Come.

198
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Come.

199
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Come.

200
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
The future is long and the future is long.

201
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Please come to the court.

202
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Come.

203
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Okay.

204
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'll see you off.

205
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Bye.

206
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Bye.

207
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Talk to you later.

208
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
No problem.

209
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Bye.

210
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'll see you off.

211
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Bye.

212
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What's your name, Lucy?

213
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Then should you change your name?

214
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm Lulu Lucy.

215
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Then no one will be your name.

216
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You're still a little bit shy.

217
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Lulu Lucy.

218
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Xu Zhi.

219
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Qing Yi is so young.

220
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
We'll pretend to be strangers

221
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
in the future.

222
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Qing Yi is so young.

223
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
We've lived here for more than ten years.

224
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
But I don't think we've met

225
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
in the high school.

226
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And you don't know it at all.

227
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
How do you know I've never met you?

228
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I have to remember it.

229
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Otherwise, it's impossible to see you for the first time.

230
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I can't feel it.

231
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Do you think

232
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
money will be bought soon?

233
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I don't know.

234
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You should be willing to use money to buy it.

235
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Do you want to be so understanding?

236
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Let's do it.

237
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Like a wind

238
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
that moves through the sky

239
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and breaks the regret.

240
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I've passed

241
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Wait a minute.

242
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Don't you want to start?

243
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I've passed

244
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Wait a minute.

245
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
We're here.

246
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You're so tired.

247
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You're so excellent.

248
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You're so talented.

249
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Not everyone can chase you.

250
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
If you find a boyfriend in the future,

251
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
you have to show up according to my standards.

252
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Let's go forward.

253
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Then

254
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
goodbye.

255
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm sorry.

256
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm sorry.

257
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm sorry.

258
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Dad.

259
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Mingzhe.

260
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Can you hug me?

261
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm sorry.

262
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
When the dark night meets the mystery

263
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Crush

264
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I run towards you from the crowd

265
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Baby falling my heart

266
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
If tears fall

267
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Let the noisy wind stop and keep the memories

268
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Let the sea wait for each other

269
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
This is my favorite car.

270
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's also a show.

271
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'll clean it up now.

272
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Mom, if you always say that,

273
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
dad won't have to cook anymore.

274
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Anyway, you like to eat rice.

275
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You're so clumsy.

276
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You still have days to go.

277
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
If you really miss him,

278
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
go find him.

279
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I've heard about him.

280
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I've heard about him.

281
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I've heard about him.

282
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I've heard about him.

283
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'll say goodbye in advance.

284
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Then he can't bear to come to you.

285
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
He may have some needs.

286
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Can't take time.

287
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Then you really want him in the future.

288
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Dad will accompany you to the Tanghuzhou.

289
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm going to Beijing.

290
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Why do I still miss him?

291
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Maybe

292
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I went to Beijing and went to college.

293
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Maybe I'll meet a better guy.

294
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I think Chen Luzhou is just half.

295
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's not necessarily for people who are ten times or a hundred times more.

296
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Then clean up later.

297
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
After eating, go to the market.

298
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Buy some love strips and send it to grandma.

299
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'll get you some.

300
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
The sky is still dark and you're crying.

301
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's just Chen Luzhou's departure.

302
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Don't act like a master.

303
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
How can you see me crying?

304
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I just think Lucy will be out of the country for so long.

305
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I don't know when she'll be back.

306
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
She's doing everything alone.

307
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Try it first.

308
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Don't be so sad.

309
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Chen Luzhou is out of the country.

310
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Don't you have me?

311
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Open the ball, right?

312
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I'll play with you.

313
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You can?

314
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
How can I not?

315
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'll show you.

316
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
When I was in elementary school,

317
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Uncle Fu took me to play the ball with Xu Zhi.

318
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
If it wasn't for my dad,

319
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I would have been the queen of the nine balls.

320
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
What are you doing?

321
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Play the ball.

322
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
People who lose, please have some milk tea.

323
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Deal.

324
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'm afraid I'll be a fool.

325
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I can't find the reason.

326
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'll give her the answer.

327
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You're a fool.

328
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Did you scratch your beard today?

329
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Don't be afraid of the past.

330
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Everything is in the world.

331
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You'll find the dream you used to dream of.

332
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Open the brush and draw the wind.

333
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I'm with you.

334
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You listen to the words,

335
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
you don't remember the promise.

336
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
The story is not over yet.

337
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I won't be with you.

338
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'll search for the rain.

339
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Is it for the future?

340
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Why are you here?

341
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I bought some love strips for my grandma.

342
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I just passed by here.

343
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'll pack up.

344
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'll go now.

345
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Bye.

346
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Xu Zhi.

347
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
What's wrong?

348
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Look at me.

349
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I'm through now.

350
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I've always known you.

351
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Come after us!

352
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
When I was little,

353
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
you wouldn't ruin me.

354
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It's great that you loved me.

355
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Let me ask you!

356
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Why did you networking with your parents?

357
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
No.

358
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I'm a little worried about you.

359
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm not worried about you.

360
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm worried about you.

361
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'm not worried about you.

362
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I'm not worried about you.

363
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I'm not worried about you.

364
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'm not worried about you.

365
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm not worried about you.

366
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I'm not worried about you.

367
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm not worried about you.

368
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I'm not worried about you.

369
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I'm not worried about you.

370
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I'm not worried about you.

371
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm not worried about you.

372
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Ten thousand miles away,

373
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
the memories of this galaxy are like eyes.

374
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Ten thousand miles away,

375
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
the memories of the world are like stars.

376
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Ah...

377
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You forgot our relationship.

378
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Ah...

379
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Yeah...

380
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Ah...

381
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Wants City

Meet me

383
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:47,880
like a whole moon

384
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:54,120
ires

385
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,160
AClzu

386
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,080
How about?

387
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,760
What's your idea?

388
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,240
Go for it.

389
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,080
Can't you stay ohne water for an instant?

390
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,280
Sure!

391
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:03,840
Somehow

392
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,080
we managed 不曾

393
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,020
Bot firehog waterhuets

394
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,500
were all seen by the front wall first.

395
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:14,500
The world is a world of love

396
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:19,500
The world is a world of love

397
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,500
The world is a world of love

398
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:29,500
The world is a world of love

399
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:34,500
The world is a world of love

400
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:42,500
Let the moon be the fourth year of the earth

401
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:51,500
The shadow of the world becomes the star

402
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:58,500
Crush is the only sigh

403
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:07,500
Crush is the only thing in the world for you

404
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,500
Baby falling my heart

405
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:15,500
The world is burning with pain

406
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:20,500
The wind is blowing in the city

407
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:26,500
The sea is flying in the other city

408
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:34,500
The world is burning with pain

409
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,500
Brother, where is this place? I want to go there too.

410
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,500
Staying in the hotel while you're in the dorm.

411
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,500
Don't go anywhere.

412
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,500
Then give me the iPad. I'll play a game.

413
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:03,500
The world is a world of love

414
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:08,500
The world is a world of love

415
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:13,500
The world is a world of love

416
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:18,500
The world is a world of love

417
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:23,500
The world is a world of love

418
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:28,500
The world is a world of love

419
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:38,500
Hope that in the future you can find a rose, a flower and a flower in your life without me.

420
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:44,500
As long as the rain is still pouring, the puppy will be with me.

421
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,500
Because the puppy is with me, how many words?

422
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,500
What do you mean?

423
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,500
What do you mean?

424
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:56,300
TOT진

425
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,020
Who is it?

426
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,500
I'm going to sleep with you.

427
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,500
You know you're here every day.

428
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,500
Why don't you go back to your room?

429
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,500
My room is for my parents.

430
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,500
I come to the playground every day.

431
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,500
I'm tired of it.

432
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,500
So you come to bother me?

433
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,500
Yes.

434
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,500
By the way,

435
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,500
where is the watermelon I bought this afternoon?

436
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,500
In the corner.

437
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,500
I want to eat it.

438
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,500
My hair is looking good!

439
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,500
I want to go and get it.

440
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,700
Why is he getting angry?

441
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,500
What's wrong?

442
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,500
Every time I see this,

443
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,500
there's been a lot of supplementaries.

444
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,500
He always does piled-up things.

445
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,500
Self-reliance issues, right?

446
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,500
Xiaobai.

447
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,500
Why are you not working?

448
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,500
Why didn't you go to the small money?

449
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,500
Are you awake now?

450
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,500
Come on.

451
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,500
Is it sweet?

452
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,500
The sweetest in the middle.

453
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,500
I want the sweetest in the middle.

454
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,500
The melon is delicious.

455
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,500
Don't give the whole watermelon to others.

456
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,500
The sweetest in the middle of the fruit

457
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,500
won't feel like the sweetest.

458
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,500
Where's your melon?

459
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,500
It's all for Sister Xu Zhi.

460
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,500
Eat it quickly.

461
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,500
After eating, go back to your room.

462
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,500
I'll go back to my room.

463
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,500
Open the door.

464
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,500
Sister Xu Zhi.

465
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,500
Sister Xu Zhi.

466
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,500
Sister Xu Zhi.

467
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,500
Can you hug me?

468
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,500
You... You really came.

469
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,500
It's just passed by.

470
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,500
Bring a cup of milk tea

471
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,500
and ask the host of our hard-earned food.

472
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,500
Thank you.

473
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,500
What's wrong?

474
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,500
How can a cup of milk tea be like this?

475
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,500
Dad.

476
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,500
Uncle.

477
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,500
Uncle.

478
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,500
Uncle.

479
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,500
Uncle.

480
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,500
What's your name?

481
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,500
Zhu Yangqi.

482
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,500
You're the host.

483
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,500
Okay.

484
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,500
I'll call you later.

485
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,500
I'll call you later.

486
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,500
Ying Ying.

487
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,500
How do you promise me?

488
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,500
Didn't you say you're a professional?

489
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,500
You're not good at taking care of the students.

490
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,500
You're blind.

491
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,500
You're not going home.

492
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,500
You're blind.

493
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,500
What are you doing?

494
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,500
Uncle, don't misunderstand him.

495
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,500
He's really taking care of the students.

496
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,500
You two...

497
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,500
Right?

498
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,500
Right?

499
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,500
Yes.

500
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,500
We're just dating.

501
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,500
We've been dating for more than a year.

502
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,500
Are you satisfied?

503
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,500
You...

504
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,500
You're making a fool of yourself.

505
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,500
I... You...

506
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,500
Uncle.

507
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,500
You really don't get Ying Ying.

508
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,500
He's talking about the plan.

509
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,500
We've been dating for two months.

510
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,500
We don't have anything.

511
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,500
Zhu.

512
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,500
Zhu.

513
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,500
Yangqi.

514
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,500
Yangqi.

515
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,500
I've been dating for years.

516
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,500
You two are blind.

517
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,500
You're blind.

518
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,500
You're blind.

519
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,500
You're blind.

520
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,500
Don't think I don't know what you're doing.

521
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,500
Tell me the truth.

522
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,500
How did you get this?

523
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,500
How did you get this?

524
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,500
I admit it.

525
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,500
I do like him.

526
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,500
But I can swear.

527
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,500
He doesn't know anything.

528
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,500
Because I don't even know myself.

529
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,500
Is this really true?

530
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,500
I was going to wait for him to finish his studies

531
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,500
and go to Beijing.

532
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,500
But I only told him.

533
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,500
It's because he's afraid of being left out

534
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,500
and having a negative impact.

535
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,500
Uncle.

536
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,500
You really don't get Ying Ying.

537
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,500
Ying Ying.

538
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,500
Is what he said

539
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,500
really true?

540
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,500
I asked you.

541
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,500
You.

542
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,500
You two.

543
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,500
You two.

544
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,500
You two.

545
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,500
Ying Ying.

546
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,500
You two.

547
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,500
You're blind.

548
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,500
Don't think I don't know anything.

549
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,500
You're blind.

550
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,500
You're blind.

551
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,500
You're blind.

552
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,500
I think that guy who's watching the eye-catching movie

553
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,500
must have something to do with Ying Ying.

554
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,500
Don't talk nonsense.

555
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,500
We can't watch the movie.

556
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,500
You can't watch it?

557
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,500
Why are you asking me?

558
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,500
If I say it, I'll apologize to him.

559
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,500
If I say it, it'll be fine.

560
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,500
I'm sorry.

561
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,500
He doesn't care about me.

562
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,500
My dean.

563
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,500
He's a good talker.

564
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,500
You're quite capable in the hospital.

565
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,500
What's the relationship

566
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,500
between being capable and not?

567
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,500
He's been my mentor since he was a kid.

568
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,500
I've been a part of him.

569
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,500
He's been my mentor since he was a kid.

570
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,500
He's been my mentor since he was a kid.

571
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,500
Look at this garlic.

572
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,500
The older it is, the more it's skin.

573
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,500
Look.

574
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,500
I have to give it to him.

575
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,500
You're broken.

576
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,500
Look.

577
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,500
Look at this.

578
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,500
Look at this skin.

579
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,500
One layer.

580
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,500
One layer.

581
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,500
One layer.

582
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,500
Look.

583
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,500
I'm garlic.

584
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,500
Garlic?

585
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,500
Let's try.

586
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,500
He's still mad at your dad.

587
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,500
I didn't know he was so rude.

588
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,500
That's because of Zhuang Jie?

589
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,500
Lucy, are you still a brother?

590
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,500
When you had a problem,

591
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,500
I was not with you.

592
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,500
I was planning to make a plan for you.

593
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,500
This time,

594
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,500
you're going to disappear this time, right?

595
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,500
Go back to me.

596
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,500
Don't be sad.

597
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,500
Don't let anything happen to

598
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,500
Yin Yin and I

599
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,500
and the past night.

600
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,500
Don't be sad.

601
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,500
Yin Yin.

602
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,500
It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon.

603
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,500
I'm going to Beijing.

604
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,500
You can do it.

605
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,500
Beijing Sword.

606
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,500
What's wrong?

607
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,500
It's a fright.

608
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,500
I'm so scared.

609
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,500
I'm so scared.

610
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,500
I'm so scared.

611
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,500
I'm so scared.

612
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,500
I'm so scared.

613
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,500
I'm so scared.

614
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,500
I'm so scared.

615
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,500
I'm so scared.

616
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,500
I'm so scared.

617
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,500
I'm so scared.

618
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,500
Yin Yin.

619
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,500
I'm going to Beijing

620
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,500
at 4 o'clock this afternoon.

621
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,500
You can do it.

622
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,500
Beijing Sword.

623
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,500
I'm not going to Song Song.

624
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,500
Song?

625
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,500
Song what?

626
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,500
I treat her as my brother.

627
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,500
She's so pitiful.

628
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,500
I'm so happy to play with her.

629
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,500
She has that kind of idea

630
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,500
about me.

631
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,500
It's so awkward to see her.

632
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,500
You're not seeing her then?

633
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,500
You went to Beijing

634
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,500
and you didn't want to come late?

635
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,500
That's not a big deal.

636
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,500
Sometimes,

637
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,500
she's quite oily.

638
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,500
But she's a good person.

639
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,500
That's not a big deal.

640
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,500
It's okay

641
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,500
because she doesn't like

642
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,500
her friends.

643
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,500
That makes sense.

644
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,500
My food is nice and human.

645
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,500
She likes me

646
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,500
and she's a little more.

647
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,500
She's only an attentional figure.

648
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,500
Fine.

649
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,500
You just like me.

650
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,500
You're going to eat me up.

651
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,500
What are you afraid of?

652
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,500
Song Song.

653
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,140
Not you.

654
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,300
Sister Zhaoren!

655
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:46,340
Yingying!

656
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,680
I thought you didn't want to see me.

657
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,340
At least, you helped me so much.

658
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,840
It's a good idea to send you over too.

659
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,420
Here.

660
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:05,000
Could it be a love letter?

661
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:05,840
Come out.

662
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,160
Don't be so old-fashioned.

663
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,720
We can't even make friends.

664
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,160
What are you thinking about?

665
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:11,840
Here.

666
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,360
This is the paper I made for you.

667
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,440
Look.

668
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:30,720
Well,

669
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,600
don't put the words I said to you on your mind.

670
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,800
I like you.

671
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,120
You don't have to...

672
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,320
Besides,

673
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,840
after I go to Beijing,

674
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,680
I might like someone else very soon.

675
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,760
Thank you, brother.

676
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,520
The master is waiting for me.

677
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:57,680
I'm leaving.

678
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,680
I'm happy

679
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,760
that you can come to see me.

680
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:04,560
Hey!

681
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,120
I'll send you off.

682
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,360
Let's end here.

683
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,520
Go back.

684
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,320
Come on!

685
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,240
Come on!

686
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,120
Don't go.

687
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,160
Our love goes well in a convention.

688
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,520
I wish your story

689
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,040
and the differences

690
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,000
were all free.

691
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,960
I'll see you again, There's no limit to my love.

692
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:59,320
Let's sparkle light and make notes.

693
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:02,360
Goodbye.

694
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,320
Don't keep it safe.

695
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:06,720
Voluntary.

696
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,200
Don't know much

697
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,600
about the Pr angle.

698
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,720
beating a bear.

699
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:11,840
They won't sleep, will they?

700
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,680
What's the problem?

701
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:15,680
It's okay.

702
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,840
The baby is strong.

703
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:32,300
Let's walk to

704
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:34,300
Hi....

705
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,100
Singcky

706
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,100
The weather is cooler

707
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,600
I want two of those

708
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,600
Come, take a photo

709
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,100
Look over here

710
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,100
See if I can put on more

711
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,600
No need

712
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,300
Let's take a look.

713
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,300
Let's take a look.

714
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:05,300
Let's take a look.

715
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,300
Let's take a look ourselves.

716
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,300
Are you done?

717
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,300
Yes.

718
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,300
How is it?

719
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,300
It looks good.

720
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,300
By the way,

721
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,300
didn't you say

722
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:18,300
you wanted to buy me a new one?

723
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,300
We're going to close the shop

724
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:20,300
right away this afternoon.

725
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,300
You're done eating. Go.

726
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,300
I'm going.

727
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,300
Hurry up.

728
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,300
We're closing the shop in one go.

729
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:26,300
What time is it now?

730
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,300
It's more than four o'clock.

731
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,300
It seems that the shop is closed earlier.

732
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,300
Why don't we go now?

733
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:31,300
Hurry up.

734
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:32,300
Go.

735
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:33,300
Go.

736
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,300
Stay in the room.

737
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:35,300
Take a good look at him.

738
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,300
Don't run around.

739
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,300
Do you hear me?

740
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,300
Yes.

741
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,300
Let's go.

742
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,300
The past few years

743
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:53,300
when Grandma was sick,

744
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,300
my grandpa always gave her a small present

745
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,300
in the yard.

746
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,300
When we

747
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,300
get 80 years old,

748
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,300
if we're still here,

749
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,300
give me a hand.

750
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,300
I'll tell you the answer.

751
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,300
Be careful.

752
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,300
I'm sorry.

753
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,300
I'm sorry.

754
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:59,300
I'm sorry.
