1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,240
The heart that keeps chasing the burning fire

2
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:43,300
The moment dependency drifts under

3
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,040
Crush when it's night, we meet in the barrel

4
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:58,060
Crush when once in a while, we met

5
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,060
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,060
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,060
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,060
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,060
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,060
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,060
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,060
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,060
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,060
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,060
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,060
I'm not afraid of you.

17
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,060
I'm not afraid of you.

18
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,060
I'm not afraid of you.

19
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,060
I'm not afraid of you.

20
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,060
No matter what I do

21
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,660
Impatience繃

22
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,060
One Be It

23
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,320
Mankou

24
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,420
Xu Zhi

25
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,160
Who are you looking at

26
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,140
Looking by the waves

27
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,240
You study with Chen Luzhong

28
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,340
check her views

29
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,480
The beautiful beauty of stitch-line world

30
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,000
I even put on your absolute beauty.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,480
You guys should take a look at yourself.

32
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,480
You should also learn

33
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,100
Star starters.

34
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,660
think of them.

35
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,220
Don't fix basic money then.

36
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:07,980
Stop.

37
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,220
You are trying to fix by setting others' money.

38
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,940
Why would you read it?

39
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,540
Why can't I?

40
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,280
It's because I am in charge of it.

41
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,700
I think

42
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,360
you will quote the right form

43
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,820
or not.

44
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,820
I thought you were interested in me.

45
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,820
Why did you still help me?

46
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,820
What university do you study?

47
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,820
Qingda.

48
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,820
Qingda.

49
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,820
You're not kidding, right?

50
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,820
You passed the test last time.

51
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,820
It's ten meters ahead of you.

52
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,820
Aren't you going to Shanghai?

53
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,820
Qingda is not good.

54
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,820
You can go to the mountains to help you.

55
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,820
Here, give me the dog.

56
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,820
Are you worried about your dad and wife?

57
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,820
Your dad is already recovered.

58
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,820
It's okay.

59
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,820
I'll tell you what happened to my wife.

60
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,820
I'll take care of my own business.

61
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,820
Let's go.

62
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,820
I'm so worried.

63
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,820
Hello, mom.

64
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,820
Are you busy recently?

65
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,820
At least I have to work until next month.

66
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,820
What's wrong?

67
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,820
Is Chen Xinqi in the same building again?

68
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,820
No.

69
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,820
I'll just ask her casually.

70
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,820
I have a friend.

71
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,820
I want to say if you're free recently,

72
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,820
can you...

73
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,820
I'm busy.

74
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,820
I'll look after you.

75
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,820
I'll hang up.

76
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,820
Okay, bye.

77
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,820
Sis.

78
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,820
Go and see what Mot scale is.

79
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,820
I know you're my sister.

80
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,820
Jiang Nomada?

81
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,820
Why don't you pick up your phone?

82
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,820
Don't you have anything from your heart?

83
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,140
to drink with her?

84
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,460
Do girls usually

85
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,700
get close to Ms. Zhai?

86
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,220
She seems to have

87
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,820
a girlfriend after graduation.

88
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,660
Does she look like my name?

89
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,460
Yes.

90
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,420
Cai Jingjing.

91
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,940
The one who graduated in the eighth grade.

92
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,420
Cai Jingjing.

93
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,740
Zhai Xiao.

94
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,100
Concubine Jia.

95
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,420
Since you have known

96
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,020
how much for me.

97
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,340
Zhai Xiao.

98
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,860
You don't look good.

99
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,700
You are still arrogant.

100
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,700
You really consider yourself as a princess, right?

101
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,420
If you have properly

102
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,700
held back for your father

103
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,500
why do you think Cai Jingjing is?

104
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,380
Remember this.

105
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,020
You seem to be

106
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,060
thinking of Darlin't,

107
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,740
if you don't have bystander money.

108
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,700
Why are youpushing a girl like me?

109
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,620
Shut up.

110
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,500
People from Ping Ying needs your guidance.

111
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,740
It's possible.

112
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,500
So,

113
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,620
how do you like my Ma Teng, all right?

114
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:07,980
I'm great.

115
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,500
Look, he's what he is.

116
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,340
He's quite generous.

117
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,780
If that's not enough,

118
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,140
we can catch Chen Xingji and make a game.

119
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,140
Playing the game?

120
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,140
You forgot?

121
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,140
You bastard!

122
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,140
Beat him to death!

123
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,140
Beat him to death!

124
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,140
Beat him to death!

125
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,140
Beat him to death!

126
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,140
Beat him to death!

127
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,140
Beat him to death!

128
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,340
What are you doing here?

129
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:33,840
Me?

130
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,840
You're not helping me?

131
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,840
Okay.

132
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,840
This is the game.

133
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,840
You bastard!

134
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,840
Beat him to death!

135
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,840
Beat him to death!

136
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,840
Okay, okay.

137
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,340
So you heard everything?

138
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:44,840
I...

139
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,340
I didn't listen on purpose.

140
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,340
I didn't listen on purpose.

141
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,940
I didn't listen on purpose.

142
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,940
I swear.

143
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,440
You didn't help me sell the game?

144
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,240
Okay, okay.

145
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,940
I'll make sure you can see my strength next time.

146
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,940
No need.

147
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,140
No need to waste your breath for the worthless bastard.

148
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,740
Yingying!

149
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,940
You haven't finished your game yet!

150
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,540
Chen Luzhou, you should be responsible for me!

151
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,140
What are you doing, Lucy?

152
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,640
Nothing.

153
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,140
What's wrong with the group?

154
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,140
It's all your fault.

155
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,140
You asked us to go to the forest to collect the forest.

156
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,640
I almost got bitten by mosquitoes.

157
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,140
Let me see.

158
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,740
You didn't bring the medicine?

159
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,740
I brought it to the water.

160
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,740
Who did you bring it for?

161
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,740
You didn't bring it yourself.

162
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,740
The forest mosquitoes are so poisonous.

163
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,240
I'll follow that one first.

164
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,740
That one.

165
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,740
The white-tailed snake.

166
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,740
The white-tailed snake.

167
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,740
The white-tailed snake.

168
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,140
The white-tailed snake.

169
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,540
The white-tailed snake.

170
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,540
The white-tailed snake.

171
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,540
The white-tailed snake is to catch you and kill you.

172
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,540
Okay, go back and take a shower.

173
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,140
I'll ask who brought the medicine for you.

174
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,340
Do you want to get a little sister?

175
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,940
Who do you want to get a sister?

176
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,140
You're so boring.

177
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,140
You're so annoying.

178
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,140
What a pity.

179
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,140
I just don't like you.

180
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,460
You've ruined my life.

181
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,940
So nice.

182
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,340
Hey you,

183
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,700
It's early in the morning.

184
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,020
I'm school-related.

185
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,540
Your是不是 Miss Zhiyin?

186
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,340
You're really such a��.

187
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,840
You should have called me.

188
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,940
I didn't see you before.

189
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,740
Do you really have community activity?

190
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,900
I want to request something.

191
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,340
Can I ask

192
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,220
if Xu Zhi brought any herbs?

193
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,940
I've made it myself.

194
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,540
Couldn't cross the line.

195
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:04,780
Great.

196
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,980
Don't let me

197
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,200
know who you like.

198
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,480
Do you have anyiddog herbs?

199
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,900
I'll go get the text.

200
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,060
I'll give it to you.

201
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,100
I'll hear it.

202
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,380
Look.

203
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,420
There's a chance to meet him.

204
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,340
Can you help me get it?

205
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,580
No.

206
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,540
I just want you to meet him.

207
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,140
I want to see

208
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,580
how he treats you.

209
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,140
I like it.

210
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,100
If you have the guts,

211
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:34,980
you can hold him.

212
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,140
You can chase him.

213
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,940
If you can do it,

214
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,620
you can share it with him

215
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,940
and get a love card.

216
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,460
Okay.

217
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,260
You can help him.

218
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,660
Okay.

219
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,020
Just like this.

220
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,140
Why are you taking the bait?

221
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,380
Coming.

222
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,860
burada.

223
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,820
I'm sorry.

224
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,420
These little fish are colorful and cute.

225
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,540
Oh, right.

226
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,900
My dad brought them back.

227
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,540
They taste like cold oil.

228
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,140
You should give them to your dad.

229
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:24,500
Thank you.

230
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,460
You're welcome.

231
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,220
Have you eaten dinner?

232
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,580
No.

233
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,140
Do you want to eat together?

234
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,260
Come on.

235
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,380
What do you want to eat?

236
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,220
You order it.

237
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,060
I'll do it.

238
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:44,780
Okay.

239
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,220
I'll have dinner with him.

240
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,860
You can solve the dinner by yourself.

241
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,220
I'm sorry.

242
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:04,860
I'm sorry.

243
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,580
I'm sorry.

244
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,300
I'm sorry.

245
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,020
I'm sorry.

246
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:07,740
I'm sorry.

247
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,540
I'm sorry.

248
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,260
I'm sorry.

249
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,420
You're still a little girl.

250
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,820
You're a bitch.

251
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,460
Don't drink too much.

252
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:24,900
Drink some.

253
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,140
You can't drink too much

254
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,100
like the food.

255
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:29,540
It's okay.

256
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,540
I'm good at drinking.

257
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,220
I won't drink too much.

258
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,220
Go ahead.

259
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:34,820
You can do it.

260
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,380
Hello.

261
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,940
I want a glass of lemon water.

262
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:38,700
Okay.

263
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:40,940
I'll drink it.

264
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,700
Dad.

265
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:46,820
Dad.

266
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,700
I want to drink some lemon water.

267
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:49,940
Here.

268
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,580
Let me show you.

269
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:53,900
Xu.

270
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:56,860
You're doing great.

271
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:57,740
You mean

272
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,780
this is expired, right?

273
00:12:59,180 --> 00:12:59,740
I...

274
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:00,900
Here.

275
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,220
Let me see.

276
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:01,900
Let me help you.

277
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,980
You can't see

278
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,820
such a big word.

279
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,420
Please.

280
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,100
Yes.

281
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,860
Don't drink these unhealthy things.

282
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,500
Here, baby.

283
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,300
Let's drink lemon water.

284
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,660
I don't drink lemon water.

285
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,860
I want to drink it.

286
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:21,740
Here.

287
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,180
Drink it.

288
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,140
Lemon water is healthy and beautiful.

289
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,020
Beautiful.

290
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:38,780
Hello.

291
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,380
We want two glasses of lemon water

292
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,700
and a double-cooked soup.

293
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,460
Okay.

294
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,180
Thank you.

295
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:57,980
Why are you looking at me?

296
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,700
You don't have

297
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,780
any bad habits, do you?

298
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:02,700
No.

299
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,100
I don't.

300
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,140
Why do you ask me that?

301
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:07,980
You get to whether I feel товap When I'm a few years old

302
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,300
заб about it.

303
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,380
Are you repaying me?

304
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,860
I hate wine and grass.

305
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:13,980
All right.

306
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,960
I'll drink a burst of wine.

307
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,020
You don't need.

308
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,860
Lemon water is good.

309
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,340
We are quite late-time.

310
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,900
leaders're up.

311
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,260
Thank you.

312
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:36,980
Come in.

313
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,380
Please enjoy.

314
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,020
I heard that

315
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,900
your degree is quite high.

316
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,820
Where are you going to go to college?

317
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,420
I want to stay in the capital.

318
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,620
I want to study building.

319
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:03,700
Study building?

320
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:04,940
What's up?

321
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,660
Can't you study building?

322
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,140
I don't mean that.

323
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,660
I think the building is quite ordinary.

324
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,940
With your degree,

325
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,980
don't you want to go to Shanghai and Beijing?

326
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,940
Okay, I misunderstand you.

327
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,300
The main thing is

328
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,540
my friends and relatives

329
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,260
always ask me to change my major.

330
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,780
They say that girls can't study building.

331
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,820
I thought you thought the same.

332
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,380
I think

333
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,620
girls are more suitable for studying building than boys.

334
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,580
Really?

335
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,460
The space is open, the structure is logical.

336
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,140
Building works

337
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,300
are similar to art works

338
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,420
in some extent.

339
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,860
They need to be clear.

340
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,260
I think girls

341
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,060
are more delicate than boys.

342
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,340
But this is just my personal opinion.

343
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,740
There is a

344
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,220
water-based bookstore in the city.

345
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:56,780
Do you know that?

346
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,260
I heard that

347
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,780
it's designed by a female builder.

348
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,980
You know that?

349
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:03,980
It's very coincidental

350
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,860
to design in the water.

351
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,620
You can see the water grass and the fish bugs

352
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,820
in the front of the window.

353
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,860
People, nature, and architecture

354
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,420
are harmonious.

355
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,620
It's a great idea.

356
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,340
But you're different from other girls.

357
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,420
You don't need the word

358
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,660
in your heart, right?

359
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,580
But I think

360
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,180
you can do whatever you want.

361
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,560
Are you

362
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,100
praising me?

363
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,820
Of course.

364
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,940
What about you?

365
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,220
Are you a student kız at the submitting of the university?

366
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,620
What are you going to do?

367
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,740
Isn't it your lesson?

368
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,380
I feel like you're quite broad-minded.

369
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,060
Who told you I was a student in the school?

370
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,340
Because you're so close to Zhu Yangqi.

371
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,940
I thought you were both in the same school.

372
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,140
I'm not. I'm just a normal student.

373
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,020
Then are you a high-school student?

374
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,980
I heard your mom say it at the door that day.

375
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,660
Forget it.

376
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,660
Just a little accident.

377
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,940
Okay.

378
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:36,340
You're not full yet? You should go back.

379
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,940
You go back first. I'll sit for a while.

380
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,540
Don't forget the medicine.

381
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,340
The medicine is in my pocket.

382
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,740
Okay.

383
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,340
You want to drink?

384
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,340
I know you're a professional student.

385
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,140
Police, criminal.

386
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,740
My dad said I wasn't suitable to be a police officer.

387
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,940
Why?

388
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,140
He said I was handsome.

389
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,940
I was too idle in the crowd.

390
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,940
Being a police officer is easy to be a gunman.

391
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,340
You're really a self-lover.

392
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,140
Whether I should leave or not, I can't afford to drink with you.

393
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,740
You're allergic to alcohol?

394
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,540
Not really. I just drank a cup of alcohol.

395
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,140
When I was young, I was tricked by Zhu Yangqi's dad.

396
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,340
I drank a cup of white wine.

397
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,140
Then I pulled her grandma out and had a chat.

398
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,340
Her mom's fried porridge and salt were all cooked.

399
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,540
She was lying in bed for a week.

400
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,140
That's great.

401
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,140
Oh my god.

402
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,740
What kind of fairy is Chen Luzhou?

403
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,740
Next time, we must try to get her drunk.

404
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,940
We'll see what she says and then we'll talk about it.

405
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,740
Good idea.

406
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:56,140
I'm tired. I'm going to take a shower.

407
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,140
I'm going to take a shower.

408
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,740
I think

409
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,740
you're more suitable for learning architecture than men.

410
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,740
According to the latest report from the National Sky Tower,

411
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,740
the white sheep that is being watched by the audience

412
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:55,340
will be released at 23 p.m. tonight at 1 p.m. on the morning of the morning.

413
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,140
This is the first year of the year.

414
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,540
Mr. Zhi.

415
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,940
Look, there's a fairy.

416
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,740
The real thing after graduation is

417
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,940
how can you miss the fairy?

418
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,740
Go and have a look.

419
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,140
Call them Chen Luzhou.

420
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,740
Okay.

421
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,540
Hello, dad.

422
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,140
Hello, Zhizhi.

423
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,140
How was the game in the mountains?

424
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,540
I was happy.

425
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,540
Let me tell you.

426
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,540
The mountains are so cold.

427
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,340
Uncle Fu said that when the tea is ready,

428
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,940
I'll pack two bags for you.

429
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,340
Okay.

430
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,140
Your turn.

431
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,740
Xu Zhi.

432
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,140
Is Ling Ling with you?

433
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,140
Let her answer the phone.

434
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,140
I'm looking for you.

435
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,740
Me?

436
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,540
Hello?

437
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,740
Yes.

438
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,940
Why are you looking for me?

439
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,540
What do you want? I'm asking you.

440
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,740
Can you fix the hairpin after using it?

441
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,140
Your grandma is so embarrassed.

442
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,140
You said it was awkward.

443
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,140
Grandma used the wrong hairpin.

444
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,140
It's my fault.

445
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,140
Besides,

446
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,340
who will fix the hairpin?

447
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,740
Don't talk nonsense with me.

448
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,540
Listen.

449
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:06,940
You're going to...

450
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,140
Cai Binghong.

451
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,740
I'm angry if you say that again.

452
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,740
I'm not coming back.

453
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,540
You can do it yourself.

454
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,940
You're so fierce.

455
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,940
I'm not coming back.

456
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,140
I'll go to see Liu Xinyi tonight.

457
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,540
I'm coming.

458
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,540
Why are you still

459
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,140
coming in with me?

460
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,540
You just graduated from high school.

461
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,740
Why is Lu Xi so good?

462
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,940
She's been good for 18 years.

463
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,340
She found out that

464
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,540
she's going to be on the Internet with you.

465
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,140
Cai Yingying said that

466
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,140
there's a shooting in Liu Xingyu in Baiyang

467
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,540
at 11 p.m. tonight.

468
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,540
Do you want to go?

469
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,140
I don't want to go.

470
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,140
I have to cut the film.

471
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,940
He said that Xu Zhi also wants to go.

472
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,740
He said

473
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,140
Xu Zhi's mom is also from Baiyang.

474
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,540
And the family who left

475
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,340
will also be the top of the list.

476
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,740
So he wants to go.

477
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,140
He wants to go to this?

478
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:11,740
Yes.

479
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,140
Lu Xi, you're so kind.

480
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,340
Are you going or not?

481
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,340
Yes.

482
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,540
The color of this shoes is bright.

483
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,340
Why don't you wear this kind of outfit?

484
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,540
What are you wearing today?

485
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,540
I want you to come here.

486
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,740
Oh, right. I forgot to ask you.

487
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,540
You came back so late last night.

488
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,940
Did you have a good time with Xu Zhi?

489
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,540
What good time?

490
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,140
Just chat and have a meal.

491
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,340
Then you're free.

492
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,940
Chat?

493
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,940
Chat what?

494
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,140
Xueyi.

495
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,340
Xu...

496
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,940
Are you crazy?

497
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,940
Just say whatever you want.

498
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,340
I really thought that you're so charming.

499
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,940
Come, let me tell you.

500
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,740
When a man and a woman go out for a meal,

501
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,540
they usually feel like they're in love.

502
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,540
You're so good at chatting.

503
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,940
It seems that Xu Zhi really doesn't have feelings for you.

504
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,740
Yes, he doesn't have feelings for me.

505
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:33,340
So don't talk about those messy things in front of him.

506
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,140
Do you hear me?

507
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,740
Okay, okay.

508
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,340
I'm wrong.

509
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,940
I'm not kidding.

510
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,940
Why is it still black?

511
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,940
You're the one who needs to be controlled.

512
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,540
You're so bright.

513
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,540
You're so weird, Zhu.

514
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,540
Brother, my name is Bai Jiao.

515
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,940
Zhu Yangqi.

516
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,540
Yangqi Zhu.

517
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,540
What's up?

518
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,540
I have a problem.

519
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,940
No, you can just like it.

520
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,540
Come, help me hold it.

521
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,540
Let's go and have a ride.

522
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,540
Let's go.

523
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,540
Let's go and have a ride.

524
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,540
What are you doing?

525
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,740
Are you going to drive?

526
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,540
Do you have any worries about your car?

527
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,940
Did you come back to give Uncle Fu a good time last time?

528
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,140
Enough.

529
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,340
I'll go down tomorrow.

530
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,540
I'll come back to give him a home.

531
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,540
You're going down again tomorrow?

532
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,540
What are you going to do?

533
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,940
Don't ask me if you're interested in me.

534
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,540
You're going down again tomorrow?

535
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,940
My mom is looking for me.

536
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,140
This time, no.

537
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,140
I'll have a chance to introduce you to her next time.

538
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,940
What are you playing with?

539
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,940
Stop.

540
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,340
Take care of your safety.

541
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,740
Let's go.

542
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,140
Let's go.

543
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,340
This place is so beautiful.

544
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,540
Where do I put the bottle?

545
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,740
Can I still use this to wash my blood?

546
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,340
Is it dirty?

547
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,340
Are you okay?

548
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,340
I'm fine.

549
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,540
You broke the camera.

550
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,540
Is your camera expensive?

551
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,540
It's more expensive than your body.

552
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,140
Are you okay?

553
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,140
I'm fine.

554
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,140
You broke the camera.

555
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,340
Is your camera expensive?

556
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,340
It's more expensive than your body.

557
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,340
Have you taken the video?

558
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,740
My ears are red.

559
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,740
Brother.

560
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,940
Move.

561
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,740
Move.

562
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,740
Move.

563
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,740
Move.

564
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,540
It's red.

565
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,540
Here.

566
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,740
Is it here?

567
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,940
None of them.

568
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,940
Lucy, stop.

569
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,940
The line is good.

570
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,740
Come on.

571
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,940
Come on.

572
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,140
I've finished.

573
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,140
The posture is good.

574
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:35,540
It's okay.

575
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,540
Come on.

576
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,940
Okay.

577
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,540
The line is good.

578
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,140
The model is good.

579
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,540
Really?

580
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,540
There's a shooting.

581
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,740
There's a shooting.

582
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,740
Look.

583
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,340
Where?

584
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:51,740
There.

585
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,540
See?

586
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,740
Really?

587
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:56,940
Shooting.

588
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,740
Look.

589
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:02,740
I'm going to the same city with you.

590
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,540
God bless.

591
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,140
God bless.

592
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,140
I'm going to the exhibition.

593
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,340
I'm going to the cinema.

594
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,340
God bless.

595
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,340
This is a shooting.

596
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,340
Same.

597
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,340
Mr. Zhi, go to the cinema.

598
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,340
I'll make a lot of money in the future.

599
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,740
Lucy, what's your wish?

600
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,140
I hope...

601
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,540
The world is peaceful.

602
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,940
The theater is so big.

603
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,140
Let's go to the universe.

604
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,140
Right.

605
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,140
The shooting is coming.

606
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,340
Look.

607
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,340
So many.

608
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,740
Hurry up.

609
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,940
Don't use your lens.

610
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,740
Use the original camera.

611
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,940
The lens is good.

612
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,540
Xu Zhi, look back at me.

613
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,940
The moon is in the window.

614
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:14,940
It's chasing me and your distance.

615
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,940
In the mountains where the shooting is taking place,

616
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,540
the shadow of the river is hidden.

617
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,940
The stars are dancing and breathing.

618
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,940
The whole world is listening.

619
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,140
The information about the universe.

620
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,340
Ten thousand kilometers,

621
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:39,540
the shadow of the river is chasing you.

622
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,540
Ten thousand kilometers,

623
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:47,340
the memories are like the universe.

624
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,740
They are in my heart.

625
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,740
It's hard to imagine.

626
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,340
Every star just now

627
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,340
disappeared completely in the universe.

628
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,540
It's so good.

629
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,540
Not a second early, not a second late.

630
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,940
Fortunately, the four of us

631
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,340
witnessed this moment together.

632
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,340
Did you just take the picture?

633
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,540
Your angle is better.

634
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,540
Can you send me the picture?

635
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,740
I want to send a circle.

636
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,940
Didn't you send a circle?

637
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,340
Look at my circle.

638
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,540
Just look at it.

639
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,540
It's meaningless.

640
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,540
I know.

641
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,540
But my friends want to separate.

642
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,940
You can't see a lot of things.

643
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,540
How about I pull you in?

644
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,540
Send me the picture.

645
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,940
I'll take the picture.

646
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,540
Just pull it.

647
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,940
Why are you asking so much?

648
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,540
Why are you sending it?

649
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,740
Did I humiliate you?

650
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,540
I was a little shy just now.

651
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,540
Sorry.

652
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,840
I have to show it to my friends.

653
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,140
Ying Ying.

654
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,240
How about Mrs. Wangi

655
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,640
put on the crowd picture in her spot?

656
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,540
Is it okay?

657
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,340
Must be pretty.

658
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,340
You guys can play here.

659
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,340
Let's go, hurry.

660
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,340
OK.

661
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,540
Have fun!

662
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,540
Be quick!

663
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,300
I'll go get it.

664
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,260
Come here.

665
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,260
Let me show you something.

666
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:51,740
What is it?

667
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,380
Another one?

668
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,020
It's time for Liu Xingyun.

669
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,460
Why is there a fish in the net?

670
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,260
But this one

671
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,340
seems to be more attractive than my naked eye.

672
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,060
Who did you shoot?

673
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,540
Do you like shooting stars?

674
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,380
I usually do.

675
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,700
I like shooting people.

676
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:20,900
Old people, young people,

677
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,060
men and women,

678
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:22,740
you should think about it.

679
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,820
I'm not thinking about it.

680
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,100
I'm just curious.

681
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,900
Will you learn photography in abroad?

682
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,180
Why are you so curious about what I'm learning?

683
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,380
Because I feel you know a lot of things.

684
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,180
But I don't know what you like.

685
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,220
Sometimes,

686
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,260
you can do anything you like.

687
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,740
Do you learn architecture because you like it?

688
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,540
But my dad may not be so supportive.

689
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,220
He thinks that girls learn architecture too hard.

690
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,620
And he wants to go to the palace.

691
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,420
Because my mom is a student of architecture.

692
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,940
The water and the book store you mentioned

693
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,860
is his work.

694
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,620
Is that your mom's design?

695
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,420
I really want to be

696
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,700
a architecture teacher like her.

697
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,060
Looking at my design,

698
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,940
it's more than ten times more than my drawing.

699
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,020
It must be very successful.

700
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,060
Do whatever you like.

701
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,180
There's no need to worry so much.

702
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:22,860
But actually,

703
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,140
a long time ago,

704
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,420
because of my family's fault,

705
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,460
I've already thought about

706
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,980
the outside world.

707
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,780
But what you said to me yesterday

708
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,500
is very deep to me.

709
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,380
I'm thinking

710
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,980
if I can really go to a better school to study.

711
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,940
I just suggest

712
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,700
that I choose you.

713
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,420
Just like today,

714
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,460
you're waiting for the starry sky.

715
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,340
And I'm actually waiting for the autumn wind.

716
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,140
Someone will guard the desert

717
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,220
to wait for the flowers to bloom.

718
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,420
Let's choose the best for each other

719
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,460
and the best for each other.

720
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,100
Is it definitely the wind?

721
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,700
What are you thinking about?

722
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,700
Our future is the wind.

723
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,460
It doesn't matter who says it.

724
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,260
We can decide by ourselves.

725
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,480
moet

726
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,580
But if I really got to go to Beijing for study,

727
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,540
I still have to make even more energy.

728
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,160
You have time to takes care of your way,

729
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,660
what can you recommend?

730
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,580
You can't join my project now.

731
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,660
What project?

732
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,060
Talk with me.

733
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,420
I can leave you for 5 dollars

734
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,300
You're a bad guy.

735
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,820
You're not doing the project right.

736
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,180
Do you want to consider

737
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,580
doing something else with me?

738
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,220
For example?

739
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,220
For example,

740
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,860
I want to buy a blanket

741
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,260
for the hot-blooded fish.

742
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,900
So you planned to

743
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,140
invest in me here.

744
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,420
I can't help it.

745
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,180
I don't have a rich brother.

746
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,540
I can't earn the first prize.

747
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,340
You don't have a rich brother.

748
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,940
You have to have a rich brother.

749
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,580
Want an steward?

750
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,100
NO!

751
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,940
Hey, He feliz,

752
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,180
I'll swallow the coal.

753
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,460
Yeah.

754
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,380
Clamps!

755
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,820
I have to go.

756
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,820
You're so good at it.

757
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,820
You're taking the two of them as breakfast?

758
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,820
No.

759
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,820
You don't mind?

760
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,820
I just saw Zhu Yangqi

761
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,820
and I'm still here.

762
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,820
Are you hungry?

763
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,820
Mr. Zhu,

764
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,820
is Lucy mad at you again?

765
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,820
You're asking me, Chen Luzhou.

766
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,820
You're actually mad at Mr. Zhizong?

767
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,820
I haven't seen Mr. Zhizong in so many years.

768
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,820
Right, Mr. Zhizong?

769
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,820
It's none of my business.

770
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,820
I don't believe you. Ask him.

771
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,820
Be careful.

772
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,820
I'm really going to vomit.

773
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,820
Okay.

774
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,820
How about we let Zhu Yangqi get off the car?

775
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,820
I think so.

776
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,820
No, I...

777
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,820
What's the matter with you two?

778
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,820
Why are you so quiet?

779
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,820
Why are you so quiet?

780
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,820
You're a third-class man.

781
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,820
You can't be so quiet.

782
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,820
I knew I'd go up the mountain today.

783
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,820
I haven't had water for the whole day.

784
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,820
The girls are here.

785
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,820
Don't you feel a little bit confident?

786
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,820
I'm asking you to be confident.

787
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,820
Next time,

788
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,820
I won't drink water

789
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,820
when I'm with the girls.

790
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:10,820
Okay?

791
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,820
Okay.

792
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,820
You can drink now.

793
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,820
Thank you.

794
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,820
You can't drink.

795
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,820
Don't be so anxious.

796
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,820
Well,

797
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,820
you're so popular.

798
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,820
Are you really going to chase him?

799
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,820
Who told you I was going to chase him?

800
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,820
You've been popular for a long time.

801
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,820
Are you angry at me for being popular?

802
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,820
I'm popular every time, okay?

803
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,820
You're popular, too.

804
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,820
I'm serious.

805
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,820
You're not going to chase him?

806
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,820
I think you two are quite suitable.

807
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,820
Really?

808
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:56,820
Okay.

809
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,820
When I come back from abroad,

810
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,820
I'll chase him if he's not married.

811
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,820
What if he's divorced?

812
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,820
Can you be a good judge?

813
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,820
If you're really going to divorce,

814
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,820
you can chase him.

815
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,820
Don't you think you're too much?

816
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,820
I think he said

817
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,820
he didn't mean that to you.

818
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,820
Why do you ask so much?

819
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,820
I don't want to ask.

820
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,820
I don't want to ask.

821
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,820
Chen Luzhou.

822
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,820
Why do you suddenly want to drink?

823
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:47,820
Didn't you drink before?

824
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,820
I'm not good at buying drunk.

825
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,820
Buying drunk?

826
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:53,820
Drinking a cup of beer?

827
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,820
You're so talented.

828
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:58,820
Are you really angry?

829
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,820
To be precise,

830
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,820
I'm just a little bit angry.

831
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,820
I'm just a little bit angry.

832
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,820
I'm just a little bit angry.

833
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,820
I'm just a little bit angry.

834
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,820
To be honest,

835
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,820
I'm just a little bit angry.

836
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,820
I'm sorry.

837
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,820
I'm just kidding.

838
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,820
I'm just kidding.

839
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,820
Actually, the place where Zhu Yanqi went to

840
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,820
is quite far from here.

841
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,820
You can relax if you dig grass.

842
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,820
Chen Luzhou.

843
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,820
You're so childish.

844
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,820
I'm childish.

845
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,820
Didn't you lie to me before?

846
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,820
You're finally back to your youth.

847
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,820
Okay.

848
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,820
We're both young now.

849
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,820
No one will owe anyone.

850
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:38,820
Okay.

851
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,820
Are you hungry?

852
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,820
A little bit.

853
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,820
What do you want?

854
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,820
I'll order.

855
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,820
Then

856
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,820
please don't drink water.

857
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,820
Then what?

858
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:00,820
Just your skin.

859
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,820
Hello.

860
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,820
Hello.

861
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,820
A bowl of instant noodles.

862
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,820
Wait a minute, sir.

863
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,820
I'll give you a discount.

864
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,820
So you won't get cold.

865
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,820
Thank you.

866
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,820
Thank you.

867
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:20,820
How much was the nightclub just now?

868
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:21,820
I'll transfer it to you.

869
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,820
If you want to make a fortune,

870
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,820
you can pay the money.

871
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,820
I'll pay the money in ten minutes.

872
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,820
I'll pay it this time.

873
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,820
You're buying and selling?

874
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,820
Yes.

875
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,820
You've been forced to do it.

876
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,820
I found you're really weird.

877
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,820
You must be so close to your husband.

878
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,820
Last time,

879
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:39,820
you pretended to have a boyfriend

880
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,820
and invited me to dinner.

881
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,820
You didn't want to owe me, did you?

882
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,820
Then do you think

883
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,820
you'll be my boyfriend?

884
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,820
Of course I will.

885
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,820
But you're not my boyfriend.

886
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,820
Does this have anything to do with Liangzhe?

887
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:56,820
Fine.

888
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:57,820
Then just call me A.A.

889
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,820
and send me a message.

890
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,820
I'll catch you.

891
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,820
Come on tomorrow.

892
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,820
You can do it.

893
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:08,820
I'm here to get the weather.

894
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:14,820
The world is too quiet.

895
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:21,820
The sound of all the people

896
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:27,820
is in the light.

897
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:33,820
Be careful, you'll get hurt.

898
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,820
The air is cold.

899
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,820
The world becomes a relationship.

900
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,820
What's the point of it?

901
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:54,820
Look, the sun rises and sets.

902
00:41:55,820 --> 00:42:00,820
Please push me to the world.

903
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,820
I'm going to sacrifice myself.

904
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,820
The future is moving.

905
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:12,820
Because you're a fan.

906
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:15,820
The lonely heart is singing.

907
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:20,820
The night is falling.

908
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:24,820
Are we hurt?

909
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:28,820
Be careful, you'll get hurt.

910
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:35,820
I'm going to sacrifice myself.

911
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,820
The future is moving.

912
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:45,820
Because you're a fan.

913
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:48,820
The wind is still blowing.

914
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:53,820
Only then can I be brave and brave.

915
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:57,820
After the long and long journey,

916
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:01,820
I'll walk with you.

917
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:06,820
I won't retreat.

918
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:10,820
In your eyes,

919
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:14,820
I see myself.

920
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:18,820
Into you.

921
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:22,820
Into you.
