1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,120
The breathing of the first love

2
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,080
The sunset that controller my heart

3
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,720
Well

4
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,280
No problem

5
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,960
Crush

6
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,760
When the night comes to collect honey

7
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,600
Crush

8
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,460
This situation is familiar to the world

9
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:33,580
The sea of people is waiting for each other

10
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,900
Every step of his steps is coming from beyond you

11
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,460
What are you going to do when you're back?

12
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,260
I'm writing my homework

13
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,580
Why are you writing your homework every day?

14
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,380
Every time I tell others that I'm a good student

15
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,900
Someone always asks me a question

16
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,740
Do you know what it is?

17
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,740
Am I asking you in one sentence?

18
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,860
Because what is the first sentence?

19
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,860
People in the first sentence always see themselves as the first sentence

20
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,220
It seems that other schools can't represent the youth

21
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,260
So I tried to kill others with my heart

22
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,260
So you want to work harder

23
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,260
Let these people feel that those advantages are boring

24
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,260
Of course

25
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,020
Heroes don't ask for punishment

26
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,020
How about we make a bet?

27
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,700
What bet?

28
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,460
Who is the best in the bet?

29
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,580
You represent Yi Zhong

30
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,580
I represent Rui Jun

31
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,900
I heard that

32
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,300
If you don't make a good point, you won't win

33
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,220
Same thing

34
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,220
We don't get in and we don't get in

35
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,220
When we do, we get in

36
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,220
But if we don't, we pass

37
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,220
Right?

38
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,220
I've just got in

39
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,220
I think that's how it's like

40
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,220
What does that mean?

41
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,220
What do you mean?

42
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,220
I mean, that's the difference between us

43
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,220
If we don't, we'll get in

44
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,220
But if we don't, we'll get in

45
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,220
You're just talking about that

46
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,020
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,220
I might not be okay.

48
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,020
The staff of the agency recently sent me...

49
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,220
They sent me a WeChat message

50
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,220
with another guy.

51
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,420
It's quite bold.

52
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,820
Fine.

53
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,020
Didn't you not treat her as a matter?

54
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,220
What?

55
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,820
What are you talking about?

56
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,220
It's a good idea.

57
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,420
Yes, she's a good cook.

58
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,620
And she's not that good.

59
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,820
I just want to have a chat with her

60
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,420
and let her know that I'm not a good cook.

61
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,420
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,420
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,220
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,020
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:54,820
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,620
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,620
I just want to have a chat with her.

68
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,220
What's the result?

69
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,620
I found out that person likes excitement.

70
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,420
Right?

71
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,020
He's really in love.

72
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,420
He has to break up after a long time.

73
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,220
He sent me a WeChat message.

74
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,620
I have to think about it for a long time.

75
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,220
I'm afraid that he'll feel bored if I say it too much.

76
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,020
I'm afraid that he'll feel cold if I say it too little.

77
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,220
He's been thinking about it all day.

78
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,420
He's got a flower on him.

79
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,220
What's the result?

80
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,820
That person turned around and said...

81
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,420
He's a good cook.

82
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,420
Do you think he's a good cook?

83
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,420
You're really thinking like that.

84
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,620
Poor him.

85
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,020
If we were like this forever,

86
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,020
it would be great.

87
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,420
It's great?

88
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,020
Of course not.

89
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,020
Don't think about it.

90
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,220
You're thinking a lot.

91
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,220
But even if you say it,

92
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,620
we're separated again.

93
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,820
You don't want to think about it.

94
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,620
But I'm a very good guy.

95
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,020
I'm a good guy.

96
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,620
I'm really cool.

97
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,020
It sounds better than

98
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,220
the school grass and the class grass.

99
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,820
After all, the former teacher

100
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,540
has been pretty and

101
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,820
well-educated since kindergarten.

102
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,820
If you don't talk to anyone,

103
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,620
you'll have a girlfriend.

104
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,020
I can change now.

105
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,420
It's too late.

106
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,020
Wait for the call.

107
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,220
Bye.

108
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,620
Good night.

109
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,220
Good night.

110
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,220
Good night.

111
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,020
You're so happy.

112
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,220
You're back with Xu Zhi?

113
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,620
Yes.

114
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,620
Zhu Yang is back.

115
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,420
I'll go to the fire later.

116
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,820
I'm back.

117
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,220
I'll go to the fire later.

118
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,420
I'll go to the fire later.

119
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,220
I'll go to the fire later.

120
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,020
I'll go to the fire later.

121
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,620
I'll go.

122
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,420
I'll go.

123
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,620
What are you doing?

124
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,020
You're not answering my messages.

125
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:17,820
What are you doing?

126
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,620
Why are you so slow today?

127
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,420
Are you hurt?

128
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,460
No.

129
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,820
I'm fine.

130
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,020
Zhu Yang is back.

131
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:30,820
I just want to

132
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,020
tell you for a moment.

133
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,020
POWER?

134
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,020
I received it from the community.

135
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,020
You saw it?

136
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,020
You haven't sent the school for frequent kişi很aving?

137
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:40,820
I'm sorry.

138
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,300
わかんした。

139
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,060
Xiaohui.

140
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,020
what's the matter?

141
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:49,620
Feel].

142
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:51,620
Yuibo.

143
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,820
I'm not feeling well.

144
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,820
Be careful.

145
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,020
Hahaha.

146
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,740
You're so ridiculous.

147
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,220
What's the reason for this?

148
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,140
Isn't the answer obvious?

149
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:03,900
It's because

150
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,980
he came to find Xu Zhi.

151
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:09,900
Did you order food?

152
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,180
Yes.

153
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,260
Sorry.

154
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,540
I came to see you.

155
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,460
It's really rude.

156
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,500
But I've known

157
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,740
such a friend.

158
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,260
Why do you want to come to Beijing?

159
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,780
It's harder than I thought.

160
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,180
So I want to

161
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,700
come to the university

162
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,540
and have a look.

163
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,220
Let's find a place to stay.

164
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,540
You're so rude.

165
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,620
I'm just rude.

166
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,220
It's just that I'm getting worse.

167
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,100
I can't learn it.

168
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,060
I feel that my parents' demands are getting worse.

169
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,820
It's like I'm in a dead end.

170
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,420
Have you ever thought

171
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,940
what you're doing in the university?

172
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,900
Are you doing this for yourself

173
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,180
or your parents?

174
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,820
Sometimes,

175
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,620
you don't need to care about so many people's opinions.

176
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,060
Just do what you want to do.

177
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,540
He's so thoughtful.

178
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,660
He knows

179
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,420
how to get to Huada tomorrow.

180
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,220
Why do you want to see Xu Zhi?

181
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,340
Give him a big cake.

182
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,660
If he really wants to see Xu Zhi,

183
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,300
I'll make him some snacks.

184
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,780
Xu Zhi loves it.

185
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,900
Excuse me,

186
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,980
your lamb chop is here.

187
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,860
Thank you.

188
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,180
Where's the food?

189
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,100
Sorry, where do I go now?

190
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,100
It's okay.

191
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,340
I'll just stand there.

192
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,780
It's okay. I'll go get it.

193
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,940
You go get it. Thank you.

194
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,500
Eat.

195
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,340
Eat.

196
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,860
Thank you.

197
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,700
I didn't bring this.

198
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:04,860
Come on.

199
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:06,940
By the way,

200
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,940
did Chen Lu Zhou come to Huada?

201
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,700
Yes, you know that.

202
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,500
After all, he's Chen Lu Zhou.

203
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,500
Chen Lu Zhou,

204
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,300
when did you

205
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,580
even go to watch movies?

206
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,900
You're going to take the test.

207
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,420
And this one.

208
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,660
Decica.

209
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,220
Decica can teach you three little Han trees.

210
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,420
Or a few of them.

211
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,980
Can he teach you three?

212
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,580
I bet on it, boss.

213
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,820
Why?

214
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,220
The next month, the number of the trees is increasing.

215
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,180
I want to help the school get the first one.

216
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,420
I want to watch a movie next time.

217
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,180
You can take a price.

218
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,580
Okay, you take the first one.

219
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,260
I'll take the price.

220
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,100
I'll count it.

221
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,020
Okay.

222
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,180
I'm leaving.

223
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,140
I'm leaving, boss.

224
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,820
Are you sure?

225
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,780
I've always been envious of Chen Lu Zhou.

226
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,100
I can always see

227
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,620
the sense of relaxation in him.

228
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,180
It seems that everything

229
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,660
can be taken down immediately.

230
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,260
But I can't do that.

231
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,660
I can't

232
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,140
let Decica be so relaxed.

233
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,500
Many people think

234
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,180
Chen Lu Zhou is a talented player.

235
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,540
He can be the first one to lie down.

236
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,260
But everyone has ignored his efforts.

237
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,820
He sleeps at 3 p.m. every day

238
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,340
at 3 or 4 p.m.

239
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,300
He wakes up at 8 p.m. and gets up early.

240
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,660
And Gao San,

241
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,300
the manager of the shopping mall,

242
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,620
has made 7 or 8 thousand taels.

243
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,380
He came to Huada to make a trip.

244
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,140
Do you know that?

245
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,260
I know that.

246
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,020
In many people's eyes,

247
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,220
he went abroad if he wanted to.

248
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,220
He can go to Huada if he wants to.

249
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,500
But everyone doesn't know

250
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,700
he wants to transfer his favorite profession

251
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,500
to make a lot of efforts

252
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,580
for the courses he's done.

253
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,220
But he never mentioned it.

254
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,680
Gu Chang'er.

255
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,340
I am very lucky to see

256
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,580
Di fate in your company.

257
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,740
Now you two are quite alike.

258
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,660
Mr. Xu, I want some vinegar.

259
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,180
Thank you.

260
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,500
What are you talking about?

261
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:25,780
I'm telling you,

262
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,380
thank you.

263
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,300
You came back from Europe,

264
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,180
and you're so hot.

265
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,620
Your clothes are really changed.

266
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,700
I don't dare to act like a man.

267
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,900
Can you wear a white shirt,

268
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,620
big brother?

269
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:36,700
You look so cool

270
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,700
every day.

271
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,780
Your figure is so good.

272
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,700
You don't wear white shirts.

273
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,420
How wasteful you are.

274
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,860
I wear white shirts every day.

275
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,020
I'm not good at it.

276
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,460
You're not good at it

277
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,660
when you wear a shirt.

278
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,700
Still gross.

279
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,140
Why?

280
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,480
You're a girl?

281
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,100
Are you in love?

282
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,140
No, I don't.

283
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:55,980
Nah.

284
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,260
I think I like you.

285
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,100
Do you look a little European?

286
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,100
You know..

287
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,060
metrics are

288
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,740
話y hu.

289
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,260
Zoet.

290
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,500
Because we are

291
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,000
men in resilient

292
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,820
kg.

293
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,540
Uncle, in high school,

294
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,780
the grass is the best.

295
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,380
When you go to college, the grass is still the best.

296
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,940
My mom has already changed two. The grass is still the best.

297
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,980
Then I'll leave.

298
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,980
Is that right?

299
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,900
If there's anything new, don't hold it back.

300
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,100
You have to tell me.

301
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,820
If it's not enough, we'll quit.

302
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,300
It'll be fine with you until the day of the wedding.

303
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,700
Until the day of the wedding?

304
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,900
So fresh.

305
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,060
What's so fresh?

306
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:48,020
There's nothing more important than being comforted by my brother.

307
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,300
Right?

308
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,500
I really don't want to go back to my dorm.

309
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,660
How about I stay there?

310
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,500
Go ahead.

311
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,380
Just let me stay in the dorm.

312
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,420
I can't even have a meal alone.

313
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,500
I'll open a hotel for you.

314
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,700
You can stay in the dorm.

315
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,940
Sure.

316
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,100
The central hall.

317
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,900
Thank you.

318
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,820
I'll put on your head.

319
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,700
In my current situation, you're really my brother.

320
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,180
You can sleep in the central hall.

321
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,340
You're so beautiful.

322
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,140
Go, Cheng Dongzhou.

323
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,980
Okay.

324
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,620
Good night.

325
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,020
Good night.

326
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,620
No.

327
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,180
Are you my brother?

328
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,100
Why not?

329
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,420
No way.

330
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,060
I'm too talented.

331
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,060
I know.

332
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,900
Pour some more.

333
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,620
I'm not drunk at all.

334
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,620
Okay, let's drink again next time.

335
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,380
Okay?

336
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,340
Just sleep well.

337
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,820
I'm so tired.

338
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,220
I'm so tired.

339
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,580
I'm so tired.

340
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,740
I'm so tired.

341
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,980
I'm so tired.

342
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,300
I'm so tired.

343
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,380
I'm so tired.

344
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,700
I'm so tired.

345
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,860
I'm so tired.

346
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,260
I'm so tired.

347
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,580
I'm so tired.

348
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,820
I'm so tired.

349
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,860
I'm so tired.

350
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,100
I'm so tired.

351
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,260
I'm so tired.

352
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,500
I'm so tired.

353
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,860
I'm so tired.

354
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,100
I'm so tired.

355
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,420
I'm so tired.

356
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,660
I'm so tired.

357
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,100
I'm so tired.

358
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,500
I'm so tired.

359
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,260
Why have you come this hour?

360
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,260
Why?

361
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:46,340
Zhang即余来一步.

362
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,420
Don't I should come to here?

363
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,820
You're really okay.

364
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,140
You're my sister.

365
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,580
Well- Bottled.

366
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,700
YouUhin.

367
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,340
It's not right.

368
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,340
Why are you still learning?

369
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,340
Do you need to be so strict?

370
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,340
Learn it.

371
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,340
Learn it.

372
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,340
You still want to go to school?

373
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,340
Today is not right. It's Saturday.

374
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,340
I'll go to school.

375
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,340
I'll have breakfast with Xu Zhi.

376
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,340
What?

377
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,340
No.

378
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,340
Why are you so slow?

379
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,340
You're going to have breakfast with him again?

380
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,340
I'm done.

381
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:41,340
The world is too quiet.

382
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:48,340
All the sound of the wind is gone.

383
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,340
The future is moving.

384
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,340
Because you are the wind.

385
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,340
The lonely heart is leaving.

386
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:04,340
The heart is not stopping at night.

387
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,340
We are together.

388
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,340
I want to be with you.

389
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:18,340
I want to be with you.

390
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,340
I want to be with you.

391
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:23,340
Did you get up?

392
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,340
That's all for today.

393
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,340
If you have any questions, you can come to me.

394
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,340
Where is he?

395
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,340
What time is the next game?

396
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,340
No.

397
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,340
I have to do my job tomorrow.

398
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,340
I can't stand this kind of day.

399
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,340
Yesterday, no one was there.

400
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,340
But Mr. Hu told me that you drew well.

401
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,340
Don't draw again next time.

402
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,340
It's so scary.

403
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,340
What's wrong?

404
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,340
Did you have a fight with your ex-boyfriend?

405
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,340
No.

406
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,340
What ex-boyfriend?

407
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,340
Hongzhu, can you help me?

408
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,340
I have a high school classmate in the afternoon.

409
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,340
Can't you go to the game in Chen Luzhou?

410
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,340
Don't worry. We will cheer for you.

411
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,340
No.

412
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,340
I want to help him to take a tour around.

413
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,340
What tour?

414
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,340
I want to see the basketball.

415
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,340
I want to see my boyfriend play basketball.

416
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,340
Boyfriend.

417
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,340
Thanks.

418
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,340
Boyfriend?

419
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,340
We are together.

420
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,340
Xu Zhi.

421
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,340
Come on.

422
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,340
Come on.

423
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,340
Come on.

424
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,340
Come on.

425
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,340
Come on.

426
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,340
Come on.

427
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,340
Come on.

428
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,340
Xu Zhi.

429
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,340
Come on.

430
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,340
Are you hungry?

431
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,340
I'm so hungry.

432
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,340
He is so handsome.

433
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,340
Really?

434
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,340
He is handsome.

435
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,340
Super handsome.

436
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,340
You are still in the car.

437
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,340
I'm leaving today.

438
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,340
Where is your phone?

439
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,340
It's charging.

440
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,340
You are playing basketball without a phone?

441
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,340
I don't believe you can search.

442
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,340
What time is it?

443
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,340
4.30.

444
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,340
Tell Zhu Yangqi that we are together.

445
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:52,340
He will send you messages if he wants to see me.

446
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,340
Zhu Yangqi wants to see you, so you need a phone.

447
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,340
I will charge your phone if I want to see you.

448
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,340
Are you tired?

449
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,340
I can ask you this question.

450
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,340
You are tired, so we need a phone.

451
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,340
What happened to your tongue?

452
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,340
I hit my tongue.

453
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,340
Do you know how to play basketball?

454
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,340
I don't know how to play.

455
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,340
I'm lazy.

456
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,340
I don't know how to play.

457
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,340
We will play 10 games.

458
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,340
If you win, I will give you a request.

459
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,340
Do you want to win or lose?

460
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,340
Of course I want to win.

461
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,340
OK, I will give you 4.

462
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,340
I will give you 10 and you will give me 6.

463
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,340
I advise you to play the best.

464
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,340
I advise you to play the best.

465
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,340
No.

466
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,340
At least you should work hard.

467
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,340
Otherwise, I will be caught easily.

468
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,340
Do you know the answer?

469
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,340
Do you have time to eat?

470
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,340
I want to thank you before you leave.

471
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,340
If you want to go to him,

472
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,340
don't come to me again.

473
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,340
I don't have the patience to be with you.

474
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,340
That's all.

475
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,340
Where did you see him yesterday?

476
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,340
You really think so?

477
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,340
I thought you knew me.

478
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,340
You did.

479
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,340
I failed Xia Feng.

480
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,340
If someone can catch me,

481
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,340
you will have to take the blame.

482
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,340
If someone really

483
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,340
does that to another person,

484
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,340
he will do it.

485
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,340
You go to the school with him.

486
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,340
I will take care of him.

487
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,340
I will take care of him.

488
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,340
I can understand

489
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,340
if you go to the school with him.

490
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,340
But you have to tell me something.

491
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,340
What do you think I am?

492
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,340
What do you think I am?

493
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,340
I don't like him.

494
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,340
Don't you know that?

495
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,340
But he cares about you.

496
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,340
He likes you.

497
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,340
Do you know

498
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,340
if Gu Yan comes to me today,

499
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,340
what will I do?

500
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,340
I will never hide it from you

501
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,340
and see him.

502
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,340
Go, go, go.

503
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,340
Go, go, go.

504
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,340
Go.

505
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,340
Xu Zhi, you will not reject me.

506
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,340
You just don't care about my feelings.

507
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,220
That's right.

508
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,820
If that's how it is, that's all it would do to me.

509
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,300
consistency

510
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,140
ę

511
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,580
used

512
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:38,340
The sound of flowers in the road

513
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,340
The sound of the sound of the river

514
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:43,340
The voice of the heart

515
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,340
The world is listening

516
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:50,340
The information of the universe

517
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,340
Ten thousand stars

518
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,340
The shadow of the world

519
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,340
The eyes are falling

520
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,340
Ten thousand miles

521
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,340
The shadow of the universe

522
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,340
The heart is falling

523
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:12,340
I guess you're busy, so don't disturb me.

524
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:15,340
I'll be back tonight. See you next time.

525
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:23,340
The light of the night

526
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,340
The light of the night

527
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,340
Xu Zhi.

528
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,340
Milk tea?

529
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,340
I can't drink it anymore.

530
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,340
Chen Lu Zhou asked me to bring it to you.

531
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,340
Chen Lu Zhou?

532
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,340
The captain just asked if Chen Lu Zhou would drink it

533
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,340
while he was asking if he would drink it.

534
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,340
He said he wouldn't drink it.

535
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,340
He still wanted it.

536
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,340
I have something to do.

537
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,340
I finally got it.

538
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,340
I found Chen Lu Zhou in the afternoon

539
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,340
and almost thought you two were fighting.

540
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,340
He was playing basketball.

541
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,340
I didn't bring my phone.

542
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,340
It's okay. Just stay alive.

543
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,340
Are you busy now?

544
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,340
I'll be right next to you.

545
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,340
If you're fine, have a meal.

546
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,340
Mr. Zhi, let's start eating.

547
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,340
Don't wait for him.

548
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,340
I'm starving.

549
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,340
You really don't want to wait for him?

550
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,340
I don't know when he'll end up.

551
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,340
Mr. Zhi,

552
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,340
I'm telling you,

553
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,340
men are very troublesome.

554
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,340
They wash their hair, get changed,

555
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,340
and change clothes.

556
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,340
They can't get out in a few hours.

557
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,340
Let's eat first.

558
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,340
He'll definitely find it here.

559
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,340
He won't.

560
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,340
He hasn't passed the time limit?

561
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,340
He told you?

562
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,340
Yes.

563
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,340
Last night, I drank with him until morning.

564
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,340
He went to find you at 4 o'clock

565
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,340
and thought he wanted to see you.

566
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,340
I didn't know.

567
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,340
I didn't know he was looking for me.

568
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,340
I saw him at the office last night and slept in the morning.

569
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,340
It's over.

570
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,340
He was angry and went to find you for breakfast.

571
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,340
But he was waiting for you in the morning.

572
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,340
He was even more angry

573
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,340
before he found you.

574
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,340
What should we do?

575
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,340
Mr. Zhi,

576
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,340
I...

577
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,340
I'll tell you the truth.

578
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,340
Don't mention it to him.

579
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,340
Because I...

580
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,340
I didn't tell him about my thoughts.

581
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,340
You tell him.

582
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,340
Chen Luzhou's dad

583
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,340
looks like a fool.

584
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,340
He doesn't care about anything.

585
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,340
But he cares about you a lot.

586
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,340
He knows you don't like Tan Xu.

587
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,340
But he's been dating you

588
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,340
for two years.

589
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,340
He's been studying with you

590
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,340
and taking a step forward.

591
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,340
But Chen Luzhou

592
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,340
only knows you for a few months.

593
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,340
Most of the time,

594
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,340
he's still separated.

595
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,340
I know.

596
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:37,340
He's very demanding.

597
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,340
He's always

598
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,340
trying to do the best

599
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,340
for himself.

600
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,340
Sometimes, I think

601
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,340
he's a bit too much.

602
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,340
But I know

603
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,340
he's doing this

604
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,340
because he doesn't feel safe.

605
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,340
I know.

606
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,340
Actually,

607
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,340
we often quarrel

608
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,340
with him.

609
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,340
We said he's a bit too much.

610
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,340
But actually,

611
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,340
he doesn't have

612
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,340
any basic knowledge.

613
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,340
When he was in primary school,

614
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,340
he was the first in the class.

615
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,340
His mom thought

616
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,340
he was so good at it.

617
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,340
When he was in primary school,

618
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,340
he was the first in the whole world.

619
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,340
He was the first one

620
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,340
to turn around when he was in school.

621
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,340
He was the first one

622
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,340
to go abroad.

623
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,340
He was always

624
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,340
in a new environment.

625
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,340
Even though he's experienced this,

626
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,340
he never told us.

627
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,340
All the negative emotions

628
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,340
he has are all gone.

629
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,340
Actually,

630
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,340
he's been gone for

631
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,340
quite a while.

632
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,340
In Rui City,

633
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,340
he's been through

634
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,340
half of his life.

635
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,340
He's been through

636
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,340
his parents' divorce.

637
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,340
He didn't say anything.

638
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,340
But actually,

639
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,340
every step of his

640
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,340
is trying to

641
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,340
make you leave.

642
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,340
I only knew

643
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,340
a while ago

644
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,340
that the night we were having dinner,

645
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,340
he secretly took away

646
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,340
your black heart.

647
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,340
You've been holding it in your hand.

648
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,340
I'm sorry.

649
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,340
I'm sorry.

650
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,340
I'm sorry.

651
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,340
Did you hurt him?

652
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,340
I'm dead.

653
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,340
I'm dead.

654
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,340
Wait a minute.

655
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,340
Wait for me.

656
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,340
I'm dead.

657
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,340
I'm dead.

658
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,340
I'm dead.

659
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,340
I'm dead.

660
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,340
I'm dead.

661
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,340
I'm dead.

662
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,340
I'm not singing.

663
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,340
Get up.

664
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,340
Lu Xi is here.

665
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,340
Come on.

666
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,340
Sit down.

667
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,340
It's time to order a song.

668
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,340
Come on.

669
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,340
Let's see what you want to order.

670
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,340
I'm not singing.

671
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,340
No.

672
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,340
Order one.

673
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,340
Order one.

674
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,340
Order one.

675
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,340
I'm not singing.

676
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,340
I'll sing.

677
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,340
Order one of my theme song.

678
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,340
Okay.

679
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,340
Applause.

680
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,340
Let's sing.

681
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,340
I'm not singing.

682
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,340
If he knows you,

683
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,340
he'll give you a meal if you don't eat.

684
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,340
Do you understand?

685
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,340
Lu Xi,

686
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,340
he asked if he had anything to eat in his treasured body.

687
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,340
Is the treasured body yours?

688
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,340
No, I don't have that experience.

689
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,340
I don't have it.

690
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,340
I have it.

691
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,340
Lu Xi said he wanted to feed him.

692
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,340
I can hear it.

693
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,340
Lu Xi,

694
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,340
you're the one who gave me my life.

695
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,340
I'll sing the song for you.

696
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,340
Lu Xi.

697
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,340
Lu Xi,

698
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,340
you're the one who gave me my life.

699
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,340
I can hear it.

700
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,340
Lu Xi.

701
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,340
Lu Xi.

702
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,340
Thank you, Lu Xi.

703
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,340
Lu Xi.

704
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,340
Lu Xi.

705
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,340
Lu Xi.

706
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,340
Lu Xi.

707
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,340
Lu Xi.

708
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,340
Lu Xi.

709
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,340
Lu Xi.

710
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,340
Lu Xi.

711
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,140
I'll go.

712
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,420
Well,

713
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,020
the box is open at 6 o'clock in the morning.

714
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,260
Have a good talk.

715
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,420
Don't waste it.

716
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,500
Don't waste it.

717
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,260
Let's go.

718
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:47,940
Tell me.

719
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,180
You had a bad start in your hometown.

720
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,540
There has been no one

721
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,600
that has made you angry

722
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,860
since I know Mr. Zhang for so many years!

723
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,980
If you tell me that,

724
00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:59,820
Luaining knobs

725
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,000
can never be that angry.

726
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,620
Okay?

727
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,060
Have you known his mind

728
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,300
often for the past few months?

729
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,620
What's your plan?

730
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,100
Lu씩, Lu pasando, Lu秒is.

731
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,620
Endness?

732
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,140
I know my plan.

733
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:13,620
Right?

734
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,100
I feel that

735
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,340
Lucy is indeed a little girl.

736
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,460
I had too much to drink that day

737
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,380
and called you.

738
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,100
I didn't say anything wrong.

739
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:29,780
What do you think?

740
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,020
Water!

741
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,780
Thank you for watching.

742
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,060
See you next time.

743
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,820
Thank you for watching.

744
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,300
See you next time.

745
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,300
Hello? What are you doing?

746
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:56,900
Hello?

747
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,900
Are you the host?

748
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,380
Such a beauty?

749
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,940
You must have had too much to drink.

750
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,420
Ying Ying,

751
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:08,540
do you like to hit or to gain weight?

752
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,340
At least give me a target, okay?

753
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,620
The camera is high.

754
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,740
It seems to be a little short.

755
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:18,340
I'm really not good at it.

756
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,740
Yang Jizhu,

757
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,340
you don't have to change.

758
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,380
It's good now.

759
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:26,660
Wait.

760
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,980
I can also beatbox.

761
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,820
Do you like it?

762
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,820
Beatbox.

763
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:31,780
Beat...

764
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,100
Beat...

765
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,980
I'm really sorry.

766
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,180
I'm so tired.

767
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:48,900
Jizhu.

768
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,980
And I promise

769
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,420
I'll control myself later.

770
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,700
I won't disturb you anymore.

771
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,980
You'd better say it.

772
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,540
I will.

773
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,580
Hurry up and wear it.

774
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,740
You're wearing a short sleeve.

775
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,460
I'm fine.

776
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,180
I'll wear it when I see you.

777
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:10,860
Don't be afraid.

778
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,500
Wear it.

779
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,780
Okay.

780
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,500
Well,

781
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,020
it's late.

782
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,060
I'll take you back.

783
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,700
No, I can take a taxi.

784
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,500
No,

785
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,580
you're so far away from the school.

786
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,860
You're late again.

787
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,940
I'm worried about a girl.

788
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:44,860
All right

789
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:57,380
Everyone finds out what accident

790
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:08,940
our time Aerial Japan

791
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:23,260
In the longر Doomless

792
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,640
When you talk, I was wrong.

793
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,180
I'll do comforter to worship myself.

794
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,580
Do you want some mucus?

795
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,700
Within days,

796
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,740
there will never be change.

797
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:57,980
All right.

798
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,220
Let's not drink.

799
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,260
He left with Zhu Yang.

800
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,580
Then I have to pay back this room.

801
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,580
Or I'll quit.

802
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,820
Who will sleep if you quit?

803
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,300
I'll sleep.

804
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:39,820
Let's go.

805
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:09,900
Costume.

806
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:13,740
That way.

807
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,020
That way?

808
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:17,820
I'll go to the door.

809
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,460
Chaneste House

810
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,420
Finally, I found the team.

811
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,460
I haven't seen the 7th location part before!

812
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,020
Agent Li got caught.

813
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,060
There must been something on this small child's hand

814
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,660
that could truly fall off.

815
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:56,020
He can sensitively solve trouble and both of our positions

816
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:58,140
could never even dares to go.

817
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,580
No worries.

818
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:01,540
We'll talk.

819
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,980
Let's go since you said you'd come see Qiangidai.

820
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,860
Okay, you can go to her for now.

821
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:36,880
Today is not so一次.

822
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,980
I think I'd better get a finds out more details if the worse.

823
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,020
Is this firmness from you?

824
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,320
Sir,

825
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,900
it doesn't matter focus on useless details.

826
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,280
Look,

827
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,060
Are you okay?

828
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,580
I'm okay,

829
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:05,200

834
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,820

835
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:32,240
sitting in the car

836
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,000
seeing the sky

837
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
The red rice in the green pepper

838
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,000
is like a rose

839
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Crush when the dark night meets the secret

840
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Crush when I fall in love with you

841
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000

cuerpo slowly opens

844
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:16,000
body with just a drop of tears

845
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,720
if the tears of Saranaur

846
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,860
freeze withiko

847
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,420
waiting for each other

848
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
from embers to transform

849
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,840
I'm afraid I'll be lost

850
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:09,240
I'm afraid I'll be lost

851
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:14,280

00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,400
step into the

861
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,580
dimension

862
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:46,260
applauding the

863
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:48,220
wind

864
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:49,840
For the

00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,720
I'm afraid that I'll be too tired to be with you

870
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,720
I'm afraid that I'll be too tired to be with you

871
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:10,720
I'm afraid that I'll be too tired to be with you

My heart can't stand still

878
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,720
We vent our pain

879
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,720
And take deep sleep

880
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:46,920

00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:51,420
The future走 upright

882
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:55,060
Because you are the wind

883
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:58,140
I still have several chances to swim

884
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:03,180
So I can be brave and brave

885
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:06,780
When I get to the end

886
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:11,540
I will let go of my hand

887
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:16,500
I won't retreat

888
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:20,060
