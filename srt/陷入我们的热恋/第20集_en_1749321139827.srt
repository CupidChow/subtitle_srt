Episode 1

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,400
I'm Xu Zhi's boyfriend.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,400
Episode 1

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,400
Episode 1

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,400
Episode 1

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,400
Episode 1

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,400
Xu Zhi.

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,000
I brought a new pair of shoes today.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,600
Look at them.

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,800
I can pick one for you.

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:23,800
How about this?

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,000
And this.

13
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,400
I think it's not bad.

14
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,600
Can you do it?

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,200
Just arrange a small room for me.

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,800
Are you annoyed?

17
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,600
How many times have you been here this week?

18
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,400
I've told you so many times.

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,600
People like you

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,200
can't even enter a new exhibition.

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,800
Don't be a fool.

22
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,600
Even if you ask me 100 times,

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,400
it's useless.

24
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,400
Xu Zhi.

25
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm busy.

26
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,400
If you can't do it,

27
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,400
why don't you arrange a

28
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,800
space for me?

29
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,800
I can just put it on the ground.

30
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:56,800
Is that okay?

31
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,800
You insist on telling the truth, right?

32
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,400
I know your new strength.

33
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,200
People like you

34
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,400
who don't have any talent

35
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,400
are just looking for confidence.

36
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,000
I suggest you

37
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,000
spend more time on painting.

38
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,400
Why don't you become a fitness coach?

39
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,400
Zhu Yangqi.

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Zhu Yangqi.

41
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,000
Didn't you choose to be an exhibitionist?

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,600
You think you're so embarrassing?

43
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,200
You're at least

44
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,600
a school of art.

45
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,600
What about me?

46
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
I'm still a student.

47
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,200
It's not certain whether I can be an examiner.

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Compared with you,

49
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,600
am I more embarrassing?

50
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,600
I didn't say that.

51
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,400
Let's go.

52
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,400
What are you doing?

53
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,000
Come here.

54
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,600
Sit.

55
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
I'll play a song for you.

56
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,160
归 knife,

57
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,160
Yisheng.

58
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,080
Play a song for yibang.

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,400
this is my latest solo number.

60
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,000
I've always felt that

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,600
no matter where you went with me,

62
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,400
I could still do that.

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,600
99% of people in the world

64
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,800
are here to be the parents.

65
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,360
But they don't like

66
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,960
the majority of us

67
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,440
trying to pursue their dreams.

68
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,560
Don't compare to him.

69
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,920
Just compare with yesterday.

70
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,280
Zhu Yangqi,

71
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,880
if one day I can't see you,

72
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,320
you must give up on yourself.

73
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,040
Do you understand?

74
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,360
I'm holding Qingqing

75
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,520
the day of De Protagon of Beijing.

76
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,640
Hell收看.

77
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,900
No.

78
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,520
Hee?

79
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,520
Zi Nuan!

80
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,240
Zi Wujing.

81
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,960
Do you understand?

82
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,480
Yes, I do.

83
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,880
He's smart.

84
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,280
Then you are dead.

85
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,680
Go away.

86
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:22,800
This

87
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Why is someone watching Zhong Quan?

88
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm afraid of this kind of relationship.

89
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,000
Crying is just a form of expression.

90
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,000
You're always suppressed by emotions.

91
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,200
Next time, if you're unhappy,

92
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,400
try to release your emotions and vent your anger.

93
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,000
Maybe you'll be able to find your soulmate soon.

94
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,400
I've received it. Thank you for your guidance.

95
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,200
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,600
You're still not crying, right?

97
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,800
Don't force yourself.

98
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,200
I told you

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
you don't fit to learn architecture.

100
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,200
Why did you say that?

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,200
When you were little,

102
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,800
you were too lazy to draw an egg.

103
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,200
I gave you a model.

104
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,400
You fell for a watermelon.

105
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,400
You said it yourself.

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,800
The thing you hate the most is the house.

107
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,400
That's what I said.

108
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,800
You made a promise.

109
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,400
So you gave me a gift for you.

110
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,400
You fell for it.

111
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,600
That's what you are.

112
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
You never understand my feelings.

113
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,000
You think I want to be your daughter?

114
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,400
You want me to give up on architecture?

115
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,200
Do you know how much effort I've put in today?

116
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,800
You just left.

117
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,200
You just left me and my grandma.

118
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,400
Have you ever understood me?

119
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,600
I've never received your expression since I was little.

120
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,000
You're always unhappy with me.

121
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,600
I did everything wrong.

122
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,400
So what do you want me to do?

123
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Do you want me to die like you?

124
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,000
I want to die like you.

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,400
I want to die like you.

126
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,800
Come out.

127
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Come out.

128
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,800
Come out.

129
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,800
Come out.

130
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
Morning.

131
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,000
The egg wrap you want,

132
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,400
and three-times warm-up food.

133
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Thank you.

134
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,400
You have a bug.

135
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,000
It's your sleeping bug.

136
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,200
Really?

137
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,000
So sleepy.

138
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,200
Then my sleeping bug has been removed by me.

139
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,200
Didn't you sleep well last night?

140
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,600
No.

141
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,200
I dreamed of my mom last night.

142
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,200
I had a fight with her.

143
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
I was so sleepy.

144
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,000
I had a fight with her.

145
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,800
I said a lot of bad things.

146
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,800
How about this?

147
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,600
Let me see your mom's picture.

148
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,200
I can dream of her tonight.

149
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,800
And then I'll have her in my dream.

150
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,200
Don't fight with you anymore.

151
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,400
You're so perverted.

152
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,200
You can't have someone dream of her.

153
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,200
But I can show you how hard my mom is.

154
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,400
My mom was in Europe at that time.

155
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,600
She participated in a project on building an ancient building.

156
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,800
Only she was a Chinese girl in the team.

157
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,200
She really liked this picture.

158
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,800
So she always brought it as a gift.

159
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,800
Very cool.

160
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,400
Like you.

161
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,800
I miss her a lot.

162
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,200
I had a lot of misunderstandings between her and me.

163
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,000
My dad told me he left a letter before he left.

164
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,800
But he accidentally burned my grandma's clothes.

165
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,600
I really want to know what it says.

166
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,600
But I might never know.

167
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,800
Mr. Zhi, are you free this weekend?

168
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,200
I'm going to the exam next month to go to the exam.

169
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,800
Do you want to go with me?

170
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,200
Let's go together.

171
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,400
I want to go with you.

172
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,000
Okay.

173
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,600
Mr. Zhi, I'll go with you.

174
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll go with you.

175
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,800
Okay.

176
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,000
I'll go with you.

177
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,200
I'll go with you.

178
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,400
I'll go with you.

179
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,200
Okay.

180
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,400
I'll go with you.

181
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Okay.

182
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,200
Okay.

183
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,200
As long as it's not about Su Zi.

184
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,800
Cheers.

185
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,800
Eat it.

186
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,600
It's not cold.

187
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,200
What kind of yard is it?

188
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,400
Mr. Zhi, you're here.

189
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,600
Did you see the stores selling the brand cards when you went up the mountain?

190
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,000
Look, they're all there.

191
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,200
No.

192
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,800
Do you want to sell some brand cards today?

193
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,200
You can go straight there.

194
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,200
Guan Xiao Chu is the store selling the brand cards.

195
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,800
Let's go and buy them.

196
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,400
Okay.

197
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,000
Okay.

198
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,800
You go first.

200
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,000
I'll go with you.

201
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,600
Okay.

202
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,400
Okay.

203
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,000
Let's go.

204
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,200
Okay.

205
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,200
Okay.

206
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,200
Hello.

207
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,400
We're only selling the brand cards here.

208
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,400
We don't want to sell the brand cards.

209
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,800
Really?

210
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,800
Sorry.

211
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,800
What did the person say to you just now?

212
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,600
He said he has a meeting with me.

213
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,400
He asked me if I should cut off the red dust.

214
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,400
What did you say?

215
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,800
I said I have six of them.

216
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,200
I'm too deep.

217
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,600
I'm just a servant.

218
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,200
Let's go and buy the brand cards.

219
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,000
Aren't you not going?

220
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,800
You said you wanted to buy them.

221
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,200
You said you wanted to buy them.

222
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,200
You said you wanted to buy them.

223
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,200
You said you wanted to buy them.

224
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,400
You said you wanted to buy them.

225
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,000
You said you didn't want to buy them.

226
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,000
You said you wanted to buy them.

227
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You said you wanted to buy them.

228
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,200
You should be able to do it.

229
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,400
I'm sure I can.

230
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,200
Trust me.

231
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,200
I'll wait for you in Beijing next year.

232
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,800
Okay.

233
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,600
I have to finish my work.

234
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,400
I'll go and buy the bill.

235
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,600
I'll do it.

236
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,400
No.

237
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,000
Sit down.

238
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,400
I'm not leaving.

239
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,000
Sit down.

240
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,200
Then you do it.

241
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,600
It's getting cold.

242
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,200
Pile up my clothes.

243
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,000
Let's go outside.

244
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,000
Let's go.

245
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,200
Pile up my clothes.

246
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,200
Pile up my clothes.

247
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,800
Aunt Lin.

248
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,000
Hello.

249
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,200
My name is Chen Luzhou.

250
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,000
Xu Zhi's boyfriend.

251
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,400
Xu Zhi said he had a fight with you in his dream.

252
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,800
I was a little worried.

253
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,800
So I wrote this letter to you.

254
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
I hope I won't disturb you.

255
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,200
During this time with him,

256
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
he mentioned you to me many times.

257
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,800
I can feel that

258
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,000
Xu Zhi has been very close to you since childhood.

259
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,400
You have been very close to him since you left.

260
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,600
He has always wanted to get your recognition.

261
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,600
He may not have been very good in his past.

262
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,400
But you may not know that

263
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,400
he has a high score of 738.

264
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,200
He has the first grade in the school.

265
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,200
He has a high score in the school.

266
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,200
Now he is a student in the Chinese architecture department.

267
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,600
He has a very good score.

268
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,000
I wrote this letter to tell you.

269
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,200
Actually Xu Zhi is very excellent.

270
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,800
He loves you very much.

271
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,800
Just like you, he loves him too.

272
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,000
Since you are very strict,

273
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,000
he loves to play with me since childhood.

274
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,000
He almost got sick of playing with me.

275
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
He came to Ninhong.

276
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,600
He was deducted a month's salary.

277
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,200
It seems that you were very angry at that time.

278
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,600
But you later made the most good work

279
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,200
and built it in the water.

280
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,600
Maybe when you were drawing the design,

281
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
you have always thought of Taoxi's daughter.

282
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,800
So I have an unending love.

283
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,200
If he dreams of you again next time,

284
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,200
you can praise him

285
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,000
and say that you love him.

286
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,200
I will be happy to see you.

287
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,200
I will be happy to see you.

288
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,200
I will be happy to see you.

289
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,200
I will be happy to see you.

290
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,200
I will be happy to see you.

291
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,200
I will be happy to see you.

292
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,200
I will be happy to see you.

293
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,200
I will be happy to see you.

294
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
I will be happy to see you.

295
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
I will be happy to see you.

296
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,200
I will be happy to see you.

297
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,200
I will be happy to see you.

298
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,200
I will be happy to see you.

299
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,200
I will be happy to see you.

300
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,200
I will be happy to see you.

301
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,200
I will be happy to see you.

302
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,760
We will wait in vain for someone straight away.

303
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,200
Are you going to live or die?

304
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,080
I won't make any sources.

305
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,360
Only a matter of time will come.

306
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,440
When you will live for the long haul,

307
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,120
they will underway.

308
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,940
I'll never become a orchestral fan.

309
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,080
I absolutely believe him.

310
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,000
What's wrong?

311
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,080
What's wrong?

312
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,800
The writing pattern...

313
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,080
Well...

314
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,480
Don't think about what I think...

315
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,600
Make your dream

316
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,720
come true!

317
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,000
Indeed.

318
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,960
The medicine really Medicines enthusiastically take three days off firstly.

319
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,220
to better the mood of the results.

320
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,960
The ping pong fell.

321
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,800
Her cheesecake beans are nicely nonefing.

322
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,640
Oh, you can stoop on my heart and make one with you or I'll rip it away and Account.

323
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:58,860
Hehe, if it was halfway through

324
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,520
When the opposite wind keeps Chapter quota

325
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,360
Still hurts each other

326
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,440
Actually, I have something

327
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,740
I never told you

328
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,240
What is it

329
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,640
I've seen your dad before I came to Beijing.

330
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,480
Let's get out of here.

331
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,220
Let's make some diamonds.

332
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,920
Let me think.

333
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,160
Мне od车.

334
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:52,720
Van hell?

335
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,600
I can make a diamondz.

336
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:54,520
Okay,

337
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,280
Wait a second, by yourself.

338
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,160
Yes.

339
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,120
before I go back home.

340
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,040
Third Uncle Deng I left...

341
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,040
and now you want me to persuade you to leave.

342
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,940
Don't be so selfish.

343
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,140
Let me help you do this.

344
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,580
I'll let you use me to do well.

345
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,920
There's hope!

346
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,140
Understood!

347
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:33,940
Then you and Wang Jia...

348
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,540
You haven't contacted them yet?

349
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,940
Not yet.

350
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,740
After returning home, there are still many things that haven't been handled.

351
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,340
I'm not saying that you can't be in love.

352
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,940
It's just that...

353
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,740
a daughter is her own daughter.

354
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,340
I'm scared.

355
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,940
She was cheated.

356
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,740
I'm scared that she will be hurt.

357
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,740
I don't believe you.

358
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:13,140
It's just that we are all men.

359
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,140
You know that too.

360
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,140
Men don't have a good thing.

361
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,340
My dad never told me these things.

362
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,940
I guess he didn't tell you.

363
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,340
I was going to tell him about us when we were going home.

364
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,940
But first, don't.

365
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,340
I feel that he is very afraid of me.

366
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,340
Afraid of you?

367
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,740
Afraid that I will take his daughter away.

368
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,740
I didn't understand him before.

369
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,940
Your dad was a man. Why did he rely on his daughter so much?

370
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,340
But when you told me about your mom,

371
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,740
I think he really only has you.

372
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,940
Hello, Teacher.

373
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,540
Hello, is that Dr. Xu's daughter?

374
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,740
I'm asking you about...

375
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,940
I'm Dr. Xu's nurse.

376
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,340
She went downstairs.

377
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,740
I was afraid that you might have something urgent.

378
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,340
So I took her.

379
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,140
You're a nurse?

380
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,340
What's wrong with my dad?

381
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,940
He's not feeling well.

382
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:19,340
No, he's fine.

383
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,540
There's a problem with him.

384
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,340
He came to the hospital today.

385
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,340
He came to a person who was in a mess.

386
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,740
He had a minor accident.

387
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,940
Your dad is a little bit nervous.

388
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,140
It's okay.

389
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,940
President Cai asked him to observe him in the hospital.

390
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,740
Did he get beaten up?

391
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,740
No.

392
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,340
He went to persuade him.

393
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,940
The insurance company's aunt just finished cleaning the floor.

394
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:41,940
It's too slippery.

395
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,140
He's in a hurry.

396
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,340
He fell down from the door.

397
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,940
Is there anything wrong with him?

398
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,340
He's fine. Don't worry.

399
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,740
By the way, President Cai also sent him

400
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,140
a suggestion.

401
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,140
He went downstairs to get a prize.

402
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,140
Okay. It's fine if he's fine.

403
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,940
I'll give you a big prize.

404
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,740
How is it? Are you happy?

405
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,540
Do you think I'm happy?

406
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,140
Explain to me.

407
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,340
How much is the prize?

408
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,940
The suggestion is not broken.

409
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,940
The suggestion is not broken.

410
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,540
But this prize...

411
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,340
It can't be broken.

412
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,140
A prize.

413
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,340
It must be.

414
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,140
I'll give it to him.

415
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,540
I'll give you all the prizes.

416
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,940
What prize do you want?

417
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,140
A gift for you.

418
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,740
Why are you so stingy?

419
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,140
I'm so angry today.

420
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,540
I'm not like this.

421
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,940
I'm not even a good kid.

422
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,740
Look.

423
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,340
I'm a big hero.

424
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,540
No.

425
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,940
No prize.

426
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,340
I don't want the prize.

427
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,340
You don't want it?

428
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,340
Then...

429
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:41,940
I'm sorry.

430
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,740
I can't take this.

431
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,340
I feel like this is a humiliation.

432
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,540
Come on.

433
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,140
Okay.

434
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,140
How about this?

435
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,140
I'll give you a reward.

436
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,140
Can't you do it?

437
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:51,740
Okay.

438
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,340
Come on.

439
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,540
Give me your reward.

440
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,340
I'll give you the reward.

441
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,340
I'll give you the reward.

442
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,140
Okay.

443
00:22:59,140 --> 00:22:59,740
Tell me.

444
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,140
Have you told your girlfriend

445
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,740
about the incident of Jian Yongwei and Ying Jingjue?

446
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,740
What did you say?

447
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,340
I didn't say it.

448
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,540
No.

449
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:11,540
You're in a good relationship with the owner.

450
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,540
You have to tell her.

451
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,540
The child is studying outside.

452
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,140
Feng Nian is going to be married.

453
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,540
She has to come back.

454
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,940
You're always hiding it from her.

455
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,340
Now is the time for your girlfriend to be sensitive.

456
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,140
What if she doesn't agree?

457
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:25,740
What should we do?

458
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,140
So,

459
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,540
we can't come back for a year.

460
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,140
How many times?

461
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,940
I just want to ask her.

462
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,940
Besides,

463
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,740
the child is just in college.

464
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,140
I just want to wait for him to graduate.

465
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:36,940
Besides,

466
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,940
Aoyong.

467
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,940
Why are you still looking at me?

468
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,140
You're so embarrassed.

469
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:43,940
What's wrong with me?

470
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,340
Are you embarrassed with your girlfriend

471
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,940
or with the owner?

472
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,140
What should I say?

473
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,740
It's okay.

474
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,340
I understand.

475
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,340
I understand.

476
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,540
I understand.

477
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,940
Is it important?

478
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,940
I'm so angry.

479
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,340
My head hurts.

480
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,540
Look at it yourself.

481
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,540
Look.

482
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,540
What kind of a surprise did you send me?

483
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,540
You're so brave.

484
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,340
You're not sleeping.

485
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,540
I can't laugh.

486
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,540
She...

487
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,140
She just wants to make me laugh.

488
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,740
What kind of a joke is this?

489
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,540
It's not even certain

490
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,940
how many people are laughing at me outside.

491
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,340
Do you think I'm useless?

492
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,540
How could it be?

493
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,940
The person who made the scene

494
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,140
stood in front of me with a knife.

495
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,740
There were so many people in the whole yard.

496
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,940
You were the only one who came out.

497
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,340
You solved the problem.

498
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,940
You're a hero.

499
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,940
I'm just a hero.

500
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,940
I'll find him in the theory.

501
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,340
Don't look for him.

502
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,340
I'll ask him to take a look.

503
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,140
By the way,

504
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,940
your daughter is calling.

505
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,540
I think she's quite anxious.

506
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,540
She's picking up.

507
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,740
She's picking up for you.

508
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,940
But don't worry.

509
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,140
I told her

510
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,940
I'm your guardian.

511
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,740
I've wronged you.

512
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,340
For me,

513
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,540
you're still lying to me.

514
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,140
No.

515
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,140
I know about your family.

516
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:09,340
Xu Zhi is a very sensible and obedient child.

517
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,740
My son is also a high school student.

518
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:15,140
I didn't expect to be a family again so soon.

519
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,740
I think we should take care of each other now.

520
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,740
I'm very satisfied

521
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,740
that I have a person who is kind to me.

522
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,540
When the kids are stable in their studies and work,

523
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,940
they can talk about our business.

524
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,740
Okay.

525
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,740
I'll listen to you.

526
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,140
I've called my parents.

527
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,940
Running cats and dogs.

528
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,740
She says she would always love me.

529
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,240
Here's the data you want.

530
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,340
I just printed it out.

531
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,940
Look at it. Let's calculate it again.

532
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,340
Okay.

533
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,740
We should start math.

534
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,640
Get your mom to explain that.

535
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,540
Is she okay?

536
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,940
She can use jerky.

537
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,940
Then I'll bring her back.

538
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:54,980
Huai

539
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,220
it seems that you've forgotten

540
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,460
the Давай س whisper of me

541
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,640
It seems that you've forgotten

542
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,220
I hope in the future

543
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,660
without my day

544
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,020
People in your world

545
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,740
still would be innately

546
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,100
flower and its flag

547
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,540
are slowly getting shorter

548
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,520
As long as my future improvement

549
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,400
remains

550
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,460
to the ground

551
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,400
We should love each other.

552
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,300
We should love each other forever, forever.

553
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:37,840
Cheng Dongzheng,

554
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,300
come and see for me.

555
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,440
어주ugh.

556
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,020
Li asked me to make the verification report.

557
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,020
Go to bed. Good night.

558
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,020
You're so late.

559
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,020
You don't sleep and you're working with me.

560
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,020
You don't have time to chat with me.

561
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,020
You know that you won't be angry, right?

562
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,020
Get out.

563
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,020
By the way,

564
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,020
Zhang Yu asked me to have dinner two days ago.

565
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,020
He asked me if you had time.

566
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,020
I told him that you went to the movies with your girlfriend.

567
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,020
He told me that.

568
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,020
I said that he would change the day.

569
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,020
What?

570
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,020
I remember that you have a good relationship.

571
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,020
You don't seem to be familiar with each other.

572
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,020
Let me tell you.

573
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,020
We've discussed it before.

574
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,020
He might like you.

575
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,020
What do you mean?

576
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,020
You feel sorry for him?

577
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,020
Are you stupid?

578
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,020
We're the same table.

579
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,020
We can't avoid each other.

580
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,020
But he doesn't like me.

581
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,020
Are you sure?

582
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,020
He always keeps mentioning you.

583
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,020
He's been in college.

584
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,020
He keeps asking me to come.

585
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,020
Have you ever thought that

586
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,020
you're the one

587
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,020
that he likes?

588
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,020
Who likes him?

589
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,020
I like him.

590
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,020
How is that possible?

591
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,020
If he likes me,

592
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,020
I don't know.

593
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,020
You're like a lawyer.

594
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,020
You know how to learn.

595
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,020
You're so annoying.

596
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,020
You know that he likes you.

597
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,020
Think about it.

598
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,020
Why did you have breakfast

599
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,020
on the table?

600
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,020
Did you buy it for me?

601
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,020
Although you're nice,

602
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,020
I'm not that kind of person.

603
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,020
I bought it for you.

604
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,020
Chen Lu Zhou,

605
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,020
don't joke with your brother.

606
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,020
Don't fool me.

607
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,020
I'm not joking with you.

608
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,020
It's true.

609
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,020
Besides, you're a student.

610
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,020
You're handsome.

611
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,020
You're confident.

612
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,020
Okay?

613
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,020
What's wrong?

614
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,020
What's wrong?

615
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,020
I'm sorry.

616
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,020
Tell me the night.

617
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,020
Hello, everyone.

618
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,020
Mr. Wan, I have something to do.

619
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,020
I'm here to take a class.

620
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:18,020
You may not know me.

621
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,020
My name is Bai.

622
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,020
My name is Bai Jiang.

623
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,020
I hope that after this class is over,

624
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,020
everyone will have something to do.

625
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:27,020
Don't let me be Bai Jiang.

626
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,020
That student,

627
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,020
don't you have a group?

628
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,020
No.

629
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,020
Sit to the second row.

630
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,020
Have you got the lesson?

631
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,020
Yes.

632
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,020
Today,

633
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,020
you should

634
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,020
throw the textbook

635
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,020
aside.

636
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,020
It's better to learn the theory

637
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,020
than to practice the practice.

638
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,020
Look.

639
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,020
Today, I'm here to teach you

640
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,020
how to play the game.

641
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,020
The management of the elite.

642
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,020
I'm here to teach you

643
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,020
how to play the game.

644
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,020
I'm here to teach you

645
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,020
how to play the game.

646
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,020
I'm here to teach you

647
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,020
how to play the game.

648
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,020
I'm here to teach you

649
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,020
how to play the game.

650
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,020
I'm here to teach you

651
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,020
how to play the game.

652
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,020
I'm here to teach you

653
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,020
how to play the game.

654
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,020
I'm here to teach you

655
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,020
how to play the game.

656
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,020
I'm here to teach you

657
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,020
how to play the game.

658
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,020
I'm here to teach you

659
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,020
how to play the game.

660
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,020
I'm here to teach you

661
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,020
how to play the game.

662
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,020
I'm here to teach you

663
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,020
how to play the game.

664
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,020
I'm here to teach you

665
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,020
how to play the game.

666
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,020
I'm here to teach you

667
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,020
how to play the game.

668
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,020
I'm here to teach you

669
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,020
how to play the game.

670
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,020
I'm here to teach you

671
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,020
how to play the game.

672
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,200
Well,

673
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,020
I'm here to teach you

674
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,020
how to play the game.

675
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,020
Today,

676
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,020
we have nine teams,

677
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,020
only two and

678
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,120
four teams are in the production.

679
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,020
Now,

680
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,020
fire our two teams

681
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,020
to introduce yourself

682
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,020
The first place in the second year is worth the applause.

683
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,820
The second group.

684
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:16,020
Teacher, I'm not from your school.

685
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,020
I'm here for a test.

686
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:18,820
A test?

687
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:22,020
Yes. I have a plan to transfer to the economy school in the second year.

688
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:27,020
Actually, what surprised me the most today is your group.

689
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:31,820
When everyone is in the position of industrial upgrade,

690
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,220
you rely on the basic products of the production.

691
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,020
You can live on and talk about your ideas.

692
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,620
Actually, when we were in the middle of the promotion,

693
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,420
we found that our loss was already very big.

694
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,820
But considering that the actual market is affected by the supply and demand relationship,

695
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:49,220
it's better to bet on a single piece of the expansion of the blind.

696
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,820
Especially the basic products of the production.

697
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,420
Although the profit is very low, but its market is also very wide.

698
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,220
Maybe we can make up for the loss.

699
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,620
You're right.

700
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,220
Please sit down.

701
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,020
Thank you, teacher.

702
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,820
Did you hear that?

703
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,420
Today's test

704
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,620
clearly explains a reason.

705
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,220
The theory tells us that

706
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,820
success is only one way of industrial upgrade.

707
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,220
This path is full of people.

708
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,820
But success is not only one way.

709
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:28,820
So it's not just one way of life like us.

710
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,420
The standard answer.

711
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,020
Thank you, teacher.

712
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,420
Thank you, teacher.

713
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:40,580
Xin 아니� pocketan,

714
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,220
is T arrangement good or not.

715
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,020
Do you think that

716
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,980
there are successful smartlich practicing

717
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,820
no next?

718
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,420
It seems

719
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,220
that

720
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,820
I just went to his class next to him.

721
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,820
He searched several pages of his thesis.

722
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,820
He only studied the ability.

723
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,820
He is no worse than those hot-blooded teachers.

724
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,820
And I don't know why.

725
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,820
I feel that his aura is more suitable for us.

726
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,820
Okay, okay, okay.

727
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,820
Two to one?

728
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:19,820
I'll listen to you.

729
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,820
Then I'll contact Mr. Bai Jiang.

730
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,820
No.

731
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,820
You're a computer graduate.

732
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,820
How can you have the micro-study of a financial graduate?

733
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,820
You're so good at it.

734
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,820
Are you your relative?

735
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,820
Not now.

736
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,820
What do you mean not now?

737
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:46,820
Actually, he's my girlfriend's father.

738
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,820
Father?

739
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,820
You're a bastard!

740
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,820
What are you doing?

741
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,820
You're a bastard!

742
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,820
Lu Cao is also very fond of him, okay?

743
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,820
You're a good boy.

744
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,820
I like to play politics.

745
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,820
Okay, okay, okay.

746
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,820
Wait for me.

747
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,820
Then I'll go with Ke Ke to have your wedding wine.

748
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,820
Can you give me a red packet?

749
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,820
Okay.

750
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,820
Then you two should get married soon.

751
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:06,820
I think your two values will be married tomorrow.

752
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,820
You say, Xu Zhi and I...

753
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,820
What else?

754
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,820
We're so close.

755
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,820
You know that.

756
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,820
Please, please, please, please.

757
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,820
People are always in a hurry.

758
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,820
The more you step back, the more you want to be angry.

759
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,820
Go ahead.

760
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,820
Go!

761
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,820
You're here!

762
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,820
Come on, come on, come on.

763
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,820
Let's celebrate the wedding.

764
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,820
Let's have a toast.

765
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,820
Cheers!

766
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,820
Congratulations.

767
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,820
As long as we can keep the score last year,

768
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,820
we can fill in a book.

769
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,820
Don't worry.

770
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,820
We'll be back in the past.

771
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,820
As long as we don't die,

772
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,820
we'll go to the dead.

773
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,820
When are you going back?

774
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,820
Tomorrow.

775
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,820
So soon?

776
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,820
Mr. Zhi, I can't bear to see you leave.

777
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,820
We should be apart for a few days.

778
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,820
We'll be free in two days.

779
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,820
I'll go back to you.

780
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,820
Okay.

781
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,820
Oh, right.

782
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,820
I've set the time for the magic competition.

783
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,820
I'll go back to the Han family.

784
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,820
It's okay.

785
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,820
We'll see each other in a few days.

786
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,820
Mr. Zhi,

787
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,820
we have to go.

788
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,820
Chen Luzhou,

789
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,820
you're so mean.

790
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,820
What are you doing?

791
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,820
I'm the main character today.

792
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,820
Let's continue drinking.

793
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,820
Come on. Let's continue drinking.

794
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,820
Cheers!

795
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,820
Cheers!

796
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,820
Oh,

797
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,820
Mr. Cai,

798
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,820
I should go prepare my magic competition.

799
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,820
See you later.

800
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,820
Okay.

801
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,820
Mr. Zhi, let's go.

802
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,820
Mr. Zhi, I'm with you.

803
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,820
He has to accompany me?

804
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,820
Yes.

805
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,820
Oh.

806
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,820
Okay, no problem.

807
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,820
You guys go ahead.

808
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,820
I'll go with Yingying for a while.

809
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,820
Okay. Bye.

810
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,820
See you later.

811
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,820
Thank you, Yang Qizhu.

812
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,820
What do you thank me for?

813
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,860
Thank you for

814
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,820
making up for one of the beautiful hostess.

815
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:27,820
Beautiful hostess?

816
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:31,820
I'll take you to a place.

817
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,820
It's a secret.

818
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,820
You'll know when you're gone.

819
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,820
Okay.

820
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,820
Close your eyes.

821
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,820
Don't look.

822
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,820
Walk two more steps.

823
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,820
Are you there?

824
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,820
Two steps.

825
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,820
What are you doing?

826
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:47,820
It's a secret.

827
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,820
Go ahead.

828
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:49,820
What?

829
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,820
It's not there yet.

830
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,820
Is there anything?

831
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,820
No.

832
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:53,820
You'll know later.

833
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,820
Turn right.

834
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,820
Turn right.

835
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,820
One, two, three, four.

836
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:58,820
Turn right.

837
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,820
Okay.

838
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,820
How is it?

839
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,820
You drew it yourself?

840
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,820
You drew it?

841
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,820
Of course.

842
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,820
Look at this.

843
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,820
It's me.

844
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,820
No.

845
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,820
How can this picture be in the body?

846
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,820
And the waist is a little bit smaller.

847
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,820
Your eyes are bigger.

848
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,820
Your head is smaller.

849
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,820
No.

850
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,820
It's not a picture.

851
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,820
It's a picture.

852
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,820
Okay.

853
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,820
It's a picture.

854
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,820
You can pay for it.

855
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,820
I'll pay for it.

856
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,820
Okay.

857
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,820
This client.

858
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,820
As a friend,

859
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,820
I'll give you a share.

860
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:37,820
One million.

861
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:38,820
You're a contestant.

862
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,820
Hello, police officer.

863
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,820
Someone is competing here.

864
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,820
So fat.

865
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,820
Where are you?

866
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,820
I'm here.

867
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:28,820
You look like a wild flower,

868
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:32,820
but we'll have many blue mountains.

869
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:36,820
Let's be friends.

870
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,820
Sorry.

871
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,820
I'll pay for it.

872
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,820
I'll pay for it.

873
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,820
We'll be friends.

874
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:46,820
Let's be friends.

875
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,820
Okay.

876
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,820
Let's pay for it.

877
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,820
What is the difference between both?

878
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:25,600
All right, just continue.

879
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,260
What do we do now?

880
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:34,040
What if you just share it and start thinking of you?

881
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,160
We should stop here.

882
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,340
Before, you said you miss me, so I want a lot of tiny friendships.

883
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,100
Now you're worse than me.

884
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:43,100
Oh, do not believe your thoughts!

885
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:48,180
Do you want to remember to repay the pardon?

886
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,920
You can repay me the pardon.

887
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,460
We will talk later.

888
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,340
Okay.

889
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,020
It's better for you to have some raka meat before you sleep now.

890
00:40:59,140 --> 00:40:59,720
Yes.

891
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,840
Y потом you are in the toilet while neck is cold.

892
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,980
You have no one to check your clothes.

893
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,080
Bye!

894
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,100
Though be careful.

895
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:06,880
Good.

896
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,900
I love you.

897
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,500
Let's go.

898
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,380
Wear more.

899
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,780
Look at your bare legs.

900
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:44,700
Is it cold?

901
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:45,980
Give it to me.

902
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:46,860
I'll do it.

903
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,620
You bought a new car.

904
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,260
Not bad.

905
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,020
It's a good price.

906
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:51,860
I just bought a new car.

907
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,340
I just added a little bit.

908
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,820
Look, I bought a new car.

909
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,100
You should have listened to me.

910
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,660
You won't be born with money.

911
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,420
Okay.

912
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,060
I'll listen to you.

913
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,140
I just listen to you.

914
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,980
Chen Jiajiao.

915
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,060
I found that I love you so much in Beijing.

916
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:08,940
You miss me so much?

917
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,020
It's okay.

918
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,300
I didn't miss you so much

919
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,780
when I came back to Qingying.

920
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,980
You can compete in Beijing.

921
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:16,860
Come on.

922
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,300
I'll go to the Han River.

923
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,580
Wu Nan Duo.

924
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,260
What's wrong?

925
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,300
What are we eating?

926
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,300
I'm going to the beach

927
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,300
I'm going to the beach

928
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,300
I'm going to the beach

929
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,300
I'm going to the beach

930
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,300
I'm going to the beach

931
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,300
I'm going to the beach

932
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,300
I'm going to the beach

933
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,300
I'm going to the beach

934
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,300
I'm going to the beach

935
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,300
I'm going to the beach

936
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,300
I'm going to the beach

937
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,300
I'm going to the beach

938
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,300
I'm going to the beach

939
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,300
I'm going to the beach

940
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,300
I'm going to the beach

941
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,300
