But he isn't here now.

18
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,759
So you have to...

19
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,040

00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,399

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,319
But butler isn't here now.

24
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,600
No! If he isn't here, you must do it by yourself.

25
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:46,040
If not, I'll use my heir rights,

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,879
This house is gonna blow up.

35
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,600
My head will blow up first.

36
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,959
Fine!

37
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:13,480
Smell it.

38
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:14,720
And calm down.

39
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,720
I'll take him upstairs.

40
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Look at me and calm down.

41
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:20,240

42
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:25,519

Smell it more.

44
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,879
He's gone.

45
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,000
Enough now.

46
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:52,560

51
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,319
You don't answer the call?

52
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,519
Still thinking about it?

53
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,079
It's not our business at first.

54
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,839
Hello, buddy!

55
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,759
I called you but you're not answer me.

56
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,319
So, I thought you stay at misters' house.

I'll go to meet you someday.

58
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:52,680
Hey!

59
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,720
What's happening?

60
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:56,800
You have something to tell me?

61
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:58,920

62
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,879
Or no?

63
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,600
Yes

64
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:06,959
but.

65
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,639
I'm not telling you.

66
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,639
Huh??

67
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,439
Just split it out.

68
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,600
Yes, but..

69
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,120
Something stuck in my throat.

70
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,399
I'll be right back.

71
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,199
Oops! It's gone.

72
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,079
Say it now.

73
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,319
Are you free this evening?

74
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,160
I've something to show you.

75
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,800
I saw something.

76
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,360
By my eyes.

77
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,759
You have grandpa? I think you live with your dad.
(in Thai eye and grandpa is same pronunciation.)

78
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,279
No!! I saw by my own eyes. Two eyes.

79
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,040
What?!

80
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,519
You've two grandpa?

81
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,439

00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:05,879
I mean my own eyes!! I'll picked yours.

83
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,040

84
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:11,920
Okay.

85
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,279
Answer my call too!

86
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,319
Or just put it on papers?

87
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,279
Let's go!

88
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,039
Each time we gather together,
we have to disguise ourselves.

89
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:38,159
Little bit.

90
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But it's strange even though
he knows where you are,

91
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,600
He still need us finding you.

92
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:51,639
Because we have to find uncle as soon as possible.

93
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:53,200
Before it's gonna be worst.

94
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:56,840
There! Found it!

95
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,000
Hooo!

96
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,240
That's fine. I'll do it.

97
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,240
Let's go but be careful.

98
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:11,879
Mamuang, where are you taking me?

99
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,360
You'll figure out.

100
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Here! Uncle! Are you here?

101
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,279
Hey! This is...?!

102
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,279
Okay.

103
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,679
Is uncle Wan here?

104
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,720
Huh?

105
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,000
What did you say?

106
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,879
What's wrong?

107
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,519
I want to meet uncle Wan?

108
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,919

109
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,799

00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,919

I'm sorry. It's going into your mouth.

133
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:42,799
In my mouth??

134
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,360
Oh my gosh!!

135

When he knew the truth.

146
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:13,799
I have to erase you memory.

147
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,320
I'm so sorry!!

148
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,279
A secret that no one knows.

149
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,159
Night night.

150
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,960
Hi! Handsome!!

151
00:11:52,359 --> 00:11:54,520
So, what are you doing here?

152
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,680
I came to meet my friend.

153
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,200
This! Saeng! My best friend.

154
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,640
My name is Saendee. I'm his girl-friend.

155
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,000
What?!

156
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:07,880
She's my old friend.

157
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,919
Girl-friend.

158
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:09,959
Yes.

159
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,439
Yes, Girl-friend.

160
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:13,840
It seemed unbelievable

161
00:12:14,439 --> 00:12:15,279
that you were friends.

162
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,360
This is the truth!

163
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:23,479
My hair smells good, my hair is this beautiful.

164
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:26,600
Does Uncle have a girl-friend?

165
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,320
Meanwhile, at Mister's house.

166
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:41,000
What a gluttonous eater, mister.

167
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:43,680
Chicken! Chicken!

168
00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:45,040
Chan!!

169
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,360
Yes, sir.

170
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,239
Bring it more.

171
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,280
What's more??

172
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,319
Food!! I'm eating food,
you must bring it more!

173
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,519
Yes, I'm sorry, sir.

174
00:12:58,519 --> 00:12:59,159
So annoyed.

175
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,360
So fierce.

176
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,879
That was suck.

177
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,439
Look good! I want it!

178
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:07,000
Stop it!

179
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,599
Why? Why?

180
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:12,640
That's for P'Thod.

181
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,840
Is this P'Thod's?

182
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,159
So what??

183
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:29,480
Yummy.

184
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,760
I want to eat it.

185
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:33,280
Ouch!

186
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:34,840
Ouch!

187
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:35,640
Ouch!

188
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:36,360
Ouch!

189
00:13:36,439 --> 00:13:36,920
Aw!

190
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,360
Ouch!

191
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:37,920
Ouch!

192
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:38,400
Ouch!

193
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,400
Stop it!

194
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,120
It's hurt.

195
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,079
Do you want it again? Do you want it more?

196
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,000
Okay, I won't slap you anymore.

197
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,879
I'll do it myself!

198
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:46,519
Ouch!

199
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,920
Oh!!!

200
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,679
Slap his ears too!

201
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,400
Chan!

202
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:50,239
Chan!

203
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,720
So annoying.

204
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,720
Chan!!! Both of them are teasing me!!

205
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,520
They slap my face!

206
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,680
I'm not teasing you.

207
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,680
I'm not.

208
00:13:58,879 --> 00:13:59,840
My hands are jerking.

209
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,680
Slapped so hard.

210
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,720
How are your hands jerky? P'Thad.

211
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:02,960
Like this.

212
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,039
Mr. Thian!!

213
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,919
We'd better go.

214
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:07,720
Oh, it's better.

215
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,240
Let's have a taste.

216
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,120
Hey, it doesn't look delicious at all.

217
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,680
What a sleep!?

218
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:18,639
Straight line!

219
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:19,919
It's like a dream

220
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,800
but the pain is still there.

221
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,680
Are you okay, Mister?

222
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,639
Is there blood?

223
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,919
At fortune-tellers Mari's place.

224
00:14:30,439 --> 00:14:32,439
Abracadabra.

225
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,879
Abracadabra.

226
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,680
Ms.Mari.

227
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,560
What?

228
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,319
Can you advise me something?

229
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:48,479
Can you advise me something?

230
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:50,759
Hmmm, Who am I?

231
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:55,560
Give the thing that I gave you.

232
00:14:58,599 --> 00:14:59,680
Give it to me.

233
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,680
Oh, where?

234
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:08,759
It's gone!!

235
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:11,800
I think it fell into that house.

236
00:15:17,479 --> 00:15:21,280
You must return to the place from which you came from.

237
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,039
And the truth will show out soon.

238
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,400
You mean misters' house, right?

239
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:37,439
Just think by yourself.

240
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,960
But...

241
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,800
I just...

242
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:44,039
Go! You can go now.

243
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:46,039
Go go I will meditate.

244
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:54,039
What should I do?

245
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:55,319
Just leave.

246
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:55,840
Wait!

247
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,240
Or should I take a holy rattan to dispose of you?

248
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:11,799
So tired!

249
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,119
Huh?

250
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,119
- P'Thad.
- You start first!

251
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,679
Huh? So what?
P'Thad calm down.

252
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,400
So?

253
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,039
So what?

254
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,520
Please, no, both of you.

255
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,440
Stop!!

256
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:24,119
I said stop!

257
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:25,559
Huh! Came just in time.

258
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:30,200
What's wrong with you guys?

259
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,799
They make trouble to me first!

260
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:38,960
Oho~~ Who's make it first actually?

261
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:40,359
Gardener!!

262
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:44,320
I'm not gardener! I'm a merchant!

263
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,760
Merchant.

264
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,239
Stop! Enough!

265
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,799
Mr. Thep.

266
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:56,359
Mr. Thad.

267
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,999
How can you came out from home?

268
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,280
P'Thod... He allow you go back to our house.

269
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:05,720
What?!

270
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:11,280
Please don't go back.

271
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:15,999
That place isn't belong to us.

272
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,840
It's up to you

273
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,840
because we came here

274
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,119
by P'Thad's order.

275
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,400
If you don't go back... Let's go with me.

276
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:30,840
Yes.

277
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:32,720
Mr. Thad.

278
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:42,080
Inn.

279
00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:51,359
I'm sorry.

280
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,200
Come with me.

281
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,640
No, come with me.

282
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,520
Come.

283
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:07,840
Come.

284
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:09,679
Come.

285
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:11,840
Come.

286
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:12,760
Stop!

287
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:33,919
Inn,

288
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:36,440
I'm sorry.

289
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,119
I'll go with them.

290
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,239
Dammit!

291
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,999
I'm getting itchy fingers.

292
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,280
Forehead stinging.

293
00:20:11,999 --> 00:20:13,280
Hit me really hard.

294
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:17,399
I'd rather eat.

295
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,080
Um...

296
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:22,160
it doesn't go into my mouth at all.

297
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:24,920
Greetings!

298
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:31,399
Who are you??

299
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:35,080
How can you come here??

300
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:42,639
I'm a butler here.

301
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,840
Butler?

302
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,720
Is that the butler?

303
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,720
Ah~

304
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,800
servant?

305
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:02,879
So sweet!

306
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,239
Come here.

307
00:21:09,399 --> 00:21:09,999
Yes.

308
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,239
Closer!

309
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,999
As a servant

310
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,759
you must clean this house.

311
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:32,960
Do it all. I told you before.

312
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,279
Hey! Thian!!

313
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,920
Why?

314
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:53,800
Are you upset? Mr. Thad.

315
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,440
Do it!

316
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,800
Yes

317
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:17,239
don't.

318
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:17,999
Stop ritght there!

319
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,720
Don't be nosy.

320
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:26,720
We are Mister!

321
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:29,440
How can we mess with the lackey?

322
00:22:38,639 --> 00:22:39,680
It's alright, Mr.

323
00:22:50,399 --> 00:22:52,399
And... Mr. Thad, look.

324
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:57,800
"Lackey" is always "Lackey" anyway.

325
00:23:09,399 --> 00:23:11,399
If you're upset.

326
00:23:12,999 --> 00:23:14,160
Go away!

327
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,599
Do it!

328
00:23:21,999 --> 00:23:22,519
Yes.

329
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,560
Go!

330
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,359
P'Thad.

331
00:23:43,879 --> 00:23:45,720
Dissatisfied, dissatisfied.

332
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,160
Eh! Annoying!

333
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:56,560
Why are you looking at my face?

334
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,239
Chan.

335
00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:04,440
Yes, Mister.

336
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,040
Refill my water! It's stick in my throat.

337
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,800
Thian!

338
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,479
Thian!!

339
00:24:16,479 --> 00:24:17,160
Thian!!!

340
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,800
Thian!!!

341
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,479
Thian! Thian! Thian!!!

342
00:24:18,479 --> 00:24:19,359
Thian! Thian! Thian!!!

343
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:20,119
Thian!!!

344
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,440
Thian!!!

345
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,359
Thian!!!

346
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,279
Mister.

347
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:30,399
Water.

348
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,519
Don't you remember?

349
00:24:42,479 --> 00:24:44,279
That I don't like drinking water from a glass.

350
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:47,119
You?

351
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,519
What do you call me, Mister?

352
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:54,359
So what do you want me to call you?

353
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,239
Huh?

354
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:57,599
Oh!

355
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,440
There's nothing

356
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,800
so I'll go change it for you.

357
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:02,359
Luv.

358
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:05,479
Luv?

359
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:13,680
What do you call me, Mister?

360
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,119
Luv.

361
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:26,279
Isn't your name.

362
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,759
Luv?

363
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:41,479
Sorry, Mister.

364
00:25:43,639 --> 00:25:44,599
That's fine.

365
00:25:48,479 --> 00:25:49,999
Though...

366
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,399
Mr. know...

367
00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:54,479
I know.

368
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:58,519
Mr. Thep has told me everything.

369
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:08,119
Mr. Thep has already told you.

370
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,599
Luv.

371
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,581
I'm

372
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,221
sorry.

373
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,741
You don't have to say sorry.

374
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,940
When you come into my life

375
00:26:50,861 --> 00:26:52,861
it made my life more colorful.

376
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,261
By the way..

377
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,421
You made me know the word…

378
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,900
Word...

379
00:27:04,061 --> 00:27:04,741
Friend.

380
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,140
Mister.

381
00:27:08,421 --> 00:27:09,780
What do you mean?

382
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,100
Can you be my...

383
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,101
Friend?

384
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,220
Friend!

385
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,341
Oh, Yes! Of course!

386
00:27:41,341 --> 00:27:42,621
Um...

387
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,621
but where did you get this necklace

388
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:48,140
from?

389
00:27:52,181 --> 00:27:53,261
This necklace?

390
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,140
My mother gave it to me when I was a kid.

391
00:27:58,981 --> 00:28:00,580
I don't know either.

392
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,860
Hey, what is this?

393
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,461
Butler

394
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,541
why are you doing here?

395
00:28:23,461 --> 00:28:25,940
I'm hungry. Go cook for me.

396
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,061
Nurse Chan.

397
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:28,940
Yes.

398
00:28:29,061 --> 00:28:30,701
Why don't you take good care of Mr. Thian.

399
00:28:30,701 --> 00:28:31,740
What are you doing?

400
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,701
I'm spraying water here.

401
00:28:32,701 --> 00:28:33,541
Mister.

402
00:28:37,261 --> 00:28:38,261
Mister! Watch out!

403
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,020
Hey!

404
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,580
Mister! Be careful!

405
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,261
Enough! Mr. Thian.

406
00:28:46,661 --> 00:28:47,781
Fine.

407
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,020
Mr. Thep, This is none of your business.

408
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,580
This is my house.

409
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,860
What I do is my right.

410
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,381
You have no rights.

411
00:29:01,821 --> 00:29:03,261
If you're still messing with this.

412
00:29:03,501 --> 00:29:04,981
I'll expel all three of you guys

413
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,781
including Mr. Thod.

414
00:29:06,781 --> 00:29:08,421
Leave this house completely!

415
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:13,381
It was true that you was the heir to all the wealth.

416
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,421
But we are all brothers.

417
00:29:17,941 --> 00:29:22,541
If you wants to have siblings,
you must respect all of us.

418
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:27,101
Find the word "brother" to make excuses.

419
00:29:27,101 --> 00:29:28,421
Damn! I'm annoyed.

420
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,101
Chan!

421
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:31,460
Yes, Mister.

422
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,541
Take me to sleep!

423
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,661
Where are you going to sleep?

424
00:29:36,661 --> 00:29:38,020
Oh, Silly question

425
00:29:39,261 --> 00:29:40,381
maybe a toilet!

426
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,060
It's the bedroom!!

427
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:43,541
Sorry Mister.

428
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,020
Yeah

429
00:29:47,381 --> 00:29:49,381
if you wants to be alone.

430
00:29:49,381 --> 00:29:51,381
Then you'll be alone until you die.

431
00:29:51,381 --> 00:29:53,740
Oh, I won't last for a few more years as I am.

432
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,941
Die Die Die.

433
00:29:56,941 --> 00:29:58,340
Still curse me.

434
00:29:59,941 --> 00:30:01,060
Hey!

435
00:30:01,821 --> 00:30:02,620
Chan.

436
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,620
Yes, Mister.

437
00:30:03,781 --> 00:30:05,300
Take me out of here.

438
00:30:08,261 --> 00:30:09,340
So where do you go?

439
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:09,900
Oh!

440
00:30:11,981 --> 00:30:12,661
So bored!

441
00:30:13,101 --> 00:30:14,261
Then you're here!!

442
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:15,460
No, Mister

443
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,381
I'll go by myself!

444
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:16,821
Don't.

445
00:30:16,821 --> 00:30:17,340
Leave me.

446
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:17,781
Don't.

447
00:30:17,781 --> 00:30:19,261
Let me go, I want to jump and drown.

448
00:30:19,261 --> 00:30:21,661
So mean! Cruel family!

449
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,101
Chan!

450
00:30:24,541 --> 00:30:25,261
Take me with you.

451
00:30:27,221 --> 00:30:27,661
Chan.

452
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,860
You're heartless.

453
00:30:30,981 --> 00:30:32,981
Chan! Wait for me. Chan! Come back.

454
00:30:33,821 --> 00:30:35,261
Not long afterwards.

455
00:30:35,821 --> 00:30:36,460
Mister.

456
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,900
Thian.

457
00:30:41,221 --> 00:30:42,581
Mister, please sit and wait for a moment.

458
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,421
I'll go prepare water for you to take a shower.

459
00:30:45,581 --> 00:30:46,221
Wait!

460
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,500
You're wet.

461
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,180
Go take a shower.

462
00:30:54,581 --> 00:30:57,141
That's fine, I'll take care of you first.

463
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,300
Oh! P'Thad just getting wet like this
will make you infected with COVID-19?

464
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:01,981
Mister.

465
00:31:03,581 --> 00:31:04,661
Let's go take a shower.

466
00:31:05,141 --> 00:31:06,341
Here! Luv Luv.

467
00:31:07,781 --> 00:31:10,101
You forgot what I give you.

468
00:31:10,421 --> 00:31:11,421
What is it?

469
00:31:11,581 --> 00:31:12,860
Keep it with you.

470
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,620
This thing is our new invention.

471
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,380
It's a digital watch.

472
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,221
It will go on sale in 2014.

473
00:31:24,221 --> 00:31:25,461
It's very expensive.

474
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,500
Let's try it and see that I'm not bragging.
What kind of watch is this?

475
00:31:34,341 --> 00:31:36,021
Keep wearing this watch!

476
00:31:38,421 --> 00:31:39,860
Thank you Mr. Thep.

477
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,101
- Yeah.
- I won't forget it.

478
00:31:41,101 --> 00:31:43,101
I'll go now.

479
00:31:43,221 --> 00:31:44,620
Hurry! Take a shower. You'll catch a cold.

480
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,901
P'Thad, I'll go!

481
00:31:45,901 --> 00:31:47,581
I don't want to interrupt the love scene.

482
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,620
Mister!

483
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:18,901
Well, Mister.

484
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,060
I think you'd better take off your shirt first.

485
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,260
You'll catch a cold.

486
00:32:28,981 --> 00:32:29,421
Um...

487
00:32:31,221 --> 00:32:31,981
please help me.

488
00:32:33,421 --> 00:32:33,940
Huhh?

489
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:34,820
Please help!

490
00:32:36,021 --> 00:32:36,940
Take off my shirt.

491
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,860
Take off your shirt.

492
00:32:41,781 --> 00:32:42,581
Ummm!

493
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,500
Alright!

494
00:33:11,981 --> 00:33:13,981
You seem especially interested in my necklace.

495
00:33:14,781 --> 00:33:15,260
Hm,

496
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,021
oh, nothing.

497
00:33:20,101 --> 00:33:21,940
Just wipe it.

498
00:33:22,461 --> 00:33:23,541
There's nothing.

499
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,581
Do you have a scar?

500
00:33:31,101 --> 00:33:32,021
Oh,

501
00:33:32,021 --> 00:33:32,781
that's right.

502
00:33:34,021 --> 00:33:36,740
Back then I often used to like to play outside.

503
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,141
I was very weak at that time.

504
00:33:40,141 --> 00:33:41,940
I'll take a papaya.

505
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,060
There are no papayas, there are mangoes.

506
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,981
I don't want mango.

507
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,260
My name is Mamuang(Mango)

508
00:33:48,541 --> 00:33:50,541
My house grows mangoes.

509
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,981
And my dad and mom like to eat mangoes.

510
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,260
I'm so sick of mangoes.

511
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,060
But in our shop we sell mangoes.

512
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,581
So I'll take mangoes.

513
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:02,661
You’ll see

514
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,860
when I grow up I'll grow papayas to eat myself.

515
00:34:09,901 --> 00:34:11,581
1 2 3 ah 1 2 3.

516
00:34:11,781 --> 00:34:12,180
Hey!

517
00:34:12,541 --> 00:34:13,581
Can I join?

518
00:34:15,661 --> 00:34:17,221
Can I play with you guys?

519
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,461
Sure, you'll be a customer.

520
00:34:20,901 --> 00:34:22,541
I'll take a mango.

521
00:34:24,541 --> 00:34:26,260
Here, 5 baht.

522
00:34:26,661 --> 00:34:28,180
You have to go get the money first.

523
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,101
So where am I going to get the money from?

524
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:31,300
That!

525
00:34:36,581 --> 00:34:37,300
No,

526
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,901
you have to take it from that tree only.

527
00:34:41,461 --> 00:34:42,581
Hey!! That's so picky!

528
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,380
Come, I'll help you.

529
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,741
Be careful!

530
00:35:05,501 --> 00:35:07,300
Mister! Mister!

531
00:35:13,021 --> 00:35:14,381
What are you guys doing with mister?

532
00:35:15,861 --> 00:35:17,340
I'm just going to help.

533
00:35:19,901 --> 00:35:20,661
Help?

534
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,700
Go away and don't mess with mister again.

535
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:26,781
Come, mister.

536
00:35:28,541 --> 00:35:30,541
Later, don't sneak and play like this again, Mister.

537
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,501
Hey, come check him out!

538
00:35:34,021 --> 00:35:34,901
How are you?

539
00:35:36,541 --> 00:35:37,781
Inn, What should I do?

540
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,781
After all..

541
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,580
I... don't have any friends anymore.

542
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,460
Mister...

543
00:35:53,021 --> 00:35:54,220
It's you!

544
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,261
You're that child.

545
00:35:56,741 --> 00:35:58,741
It's time for dinner at the mister's house.

546
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:02,381
- Please come.
- All together.

547
00:36:07,661 --> 00:36:08,661
Here we go again.

548
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,940
It has a wrath.

549
00:36:22,661 --> 00:36:24,901
Happy family day.

550
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,781
Today is a good day

551
00:36:28,661 --> 00:36:31,421
that we ate together.

552
00:36:33,141 --> 00:36:33,741
So.

553
00:36:34,621 --> 00:36:37,621
I hope everyone enjoys this meal.

554
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,180
Enjoy eating!

555
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:43,940
So good.

556
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,100
Well, Mr. Thian.

557
00:36:45,501 --> 00:36:47,501
I have a present to give you.

558
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,340
Present? What present?

559
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,261
Chan.

560
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,781
Yes, Mister.

561
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:58,980
There.

562
00:37:00,501 --> 00:37:01,340
Yes, Mister.

563
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,621
There!

564
00:37:03,861 --> 00:37:04,621
Excuse me.

565
00:37:05,261 --> 00:37:07,261
Go get this.

566
00:37:07,781 --> 00:37:08,381
Sorry.

567
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,340
Is it a good idea to change to a new nurse?

568
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,781
I taught you so you don't remember.

569
00:37:13,021 --> 00:37:13,661
Yes.

570
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,940
So what is it?

571
00:37:21,421 --> 00:37:24,781
This will help control your weight.

572
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,980
Don't you want to be handsome?

573
00:37:27,901 --> 00:37:30,541
- Oh, I still want to be handsome.
- If you were skinny, you would be handsome like Oppa.

574
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:32,661
Just sayin'!! I'm blushing.

575
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,980
How can I use it?

576
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,980
You just keep wearing it.

577
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,340
When you eat too much.

578
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,661
It will try to notify you.

579
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,901
Good! I'll wear it.

580
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,300
I want to be handsome like Nadech!

581
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,220
Stay still.

582
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,741
Oh, why are you hitting my hand?

583
00:37:48,741 --> 00:37:50,460
Just keep wearing it.

584
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,741
After all, Mr. Thian is the
younger brother of all of us.

585
00:37:55,501 --> 00:37:56,541
We're worried.

586
00:37:57,021 --> 00:37:59,021
You guys worried about me.

587
00:38:01,621 --> 00:38:03,621
I really appreciate it.

588
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:09,060
Three of you guys were very kind to me.

589
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,421
In that case.

590
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,940
I also have something to give.

591
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,501
Chan.

592
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:15,820
Yes, Mister.

593
00:38:16,141 --> 00:38:18,741
Go get ginger juice from Mother's recipe.

594
00:38:19,261 --> 00:38:20,141
Yes, Mister.

595
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,460
I'm so appreciative.

596
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,621
I want to repay the kindness.

597
00:38:24,621 --> 00:38:26,060
I'm so appreciative.

598
00:38:48,381 --> 00:38:52,220
I haven't been this happy in a long time

599
00:38:52,861 --> 00:38:54,580
since our mother died.

600
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:01,141
From now on, I am the happiest person in the world.

601
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:03,741
So...

602
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,820
let's make this a happy night.

603
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,820
Everyone, drink up.

604
00:39:16,741 --> 00:39:18,621
You didn't put sleeping pills on it, right?

605
00:39:26,621 --> 00:39:27,501
Why?

606
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:32,541
Or are you guys afraid that I'll add poison?

607
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:34,700
Poison.

608
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:42,820
Poison.

609
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,220
We're brothers.

610
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,141
There's no need to be suspicious.

611
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,421
Right?

612
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:52,781
Mr. Thad.

613
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:55,700
Mr. Thep.

614
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:56,700
Yes.

615
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,741
Mr. Thian.

616
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,700
Yes

617
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,501
that's right, P'Thod.

618
00:40:04,621 --> 00:40:06,621
So everyone, drink up.

619
00:40:06,621 --> 00:40:07,541
Drink it.

620
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:08,901
Drink it.

621
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:33,100
Have fun, enjoy eating.

622
00:41:12,861 --> 00:41:13,781
Mister

623
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,580
I'll bring you some water.

624
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,261
Are you asleep?

625
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,421
Sweet dreams, my mister.

626
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,501
Where does the bell sound come from?

627
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,460
When will he come? It's very late.

628
00:42:33,901 --> 00:42:35,381
- Finally.
- Mr. Thian...

629
00:42:36,261 --> 00:42:37,421
are you calling me?

630
00:42:39,661 --> 00:42:40,861
Yes

631
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,700
I called you.

632
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,700
Good night
