(Crazy Handsome Rich)
(Episode 4)

2
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,520
(Previously)
Heyyyyy

3
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,920
Mr. Thad, he is good to us.

4
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,600
So I asked Mr. Thad to find more gardeners.

5
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,440
Mister, this is the new gardener here.

6
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,560
What are you doing here?

7
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,880
And bringing an outsider into my house.

8
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,520
Diary? What's this?

9
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,000
What are you doing?

10
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,160
Please don't chase me.

11
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,080
You should tell me
what happened?

12
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,360
Get out!

13
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,920
Wait! Butler wait!

14
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,200
It's not our place?

15
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,960
Let's go.

16
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,640
Why stop?

17
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,000
Thank you

18
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,680
For what?

19
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,840
For everything

20
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,840
Well, let's go home first.

21
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,240
It'll be tough to find a ride
home if it's raining harder.

22
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,320
You go back. I'll be here

23
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,680
What does it mean?

24
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,920
That means I'll be here.

25
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,480
What about all these things
that they have done to you?

26
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,520
You don't like me anymore?

27
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,760
Huh! Like?

28
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,840
What do you mean?

29
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,120
I've heard all about your
conversation with Mr. Thep.

30
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,560
Huh?

31
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,400
It's about "you like me".

32
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,880
Inn, You're misunderstanding

33
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,400
Let's talk at home.

34
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,440
I'm not going.

35
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,600
Go

36
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,480
No, if you don't want me to
hate you even more. Just go back.

37
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,800
I really don't understand you.

38
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,960
P'Thad. P'Thad.

39
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,880
Come over here.

40
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:22,840
5 4 3 2 1 Stop

41
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,920
P'Thad can go now.

42
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,360
Stop posing handsomely and go.

43
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,280
Huh, Has the rain stopped?

44
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,680
It's better to close the umbrella.

45
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,240
Mister, so handsome.

46
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,560
Oh!

47
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,760
Hmmm Splashy!

48
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,920
Oh, sorry Mr. Thad

49
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,120
Did the water splash on you?

50
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,560
That's fine. I'm okay.

51
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,400
Well, but why did you come out here?

52
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,320
Mr. Thod will be angry.

53
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,680
Forget it. P'Thod is just
like that and he'll be fine.

54
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,880
Well, but now it's evening.

55
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,200
I know that's why I'm here to stay up.

56
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,160
Mister, are you worried about me?

57
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,720
Well, worried?

58
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,080
Ummm

59
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,080
Well, it's not

60
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,760
Haa!! You look suspicious.

61
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,240
I saw that you were being
scolded by P'Thod. I feel sad for you.

62
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,760
Mister!

63
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,080
Oh, but today you'll have to sleep outside.

64
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,920
Well, that's true.

65
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,120
What should I do? What should I do?

66
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,720
Hold on! Let me use my brain for a moment.

67
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,640
Ah, I figured it out. Give me a sec!

68
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:45,539
What's on your mind, Mister?
So why are we standing here?

69
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,360
Heyy

70
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,040
I'm coming.

71
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,080
Mr. Thep

72
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,680
Hello, butler

73
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,240
Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.

74
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,440
- Hey, what are you guys talking about?
- Oh!

75
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,760
- No
- Nothing, sir.

76
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,760
Well then.

77
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,720
Let's go find a place to
pitch a tent. It's almost dark.

78
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,600
It's like camping, right? P'Thad

79
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,840
Talk too much. I'll get you rolling.

80
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,400
Do we cook in the backyard?

81
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:21,800
Yes

82
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,120
Whatever Thep says, I'm in.

83
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,520
Oh, are you coming?

84
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,920
Please come butler.

85
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,000
Thank you very much Mr. Thep

86
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,440
It's fine

87
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,920
Don't mention it.
You should sleep here first tonight.

88
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,280
Hey! Luv

89
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,440
Nong Thep

90
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,120
Yes?

91
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,320
Who did you call just now?

92
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,480
Oh, I call butler Sin.

93
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,720
It's not butler Sin. No, I heard

94
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,760
something about "Luv".

95
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,760
Oh! I mean "Loe" (Dirty).

96
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,960
My tent was dirty just now.

97
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,120
Yes!! Dirty.

98
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,400
So I told the butler to wipe it as well.

99
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,280
Yes, That's right!

100
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,960
Here, I'm wiping.

101
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,760
So, good night, Butler.

102
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,480
Sweet dreams, Mr. Thep.

103
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,000
Better go. There'll be
trouble if I stay longer.

104
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,720
Sweet dreams, Mr. Thad

105
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,400
What's a sweet dream?

106
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,920
Oh, I thought you were going to sleep.

107
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,200
Aren't you going to go to sleep?

108
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,400
Tonight, I'll be with you.

109
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,880
Huh?

110
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,200
But Mister's room is...

111
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,000
Come here

112
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,880
Oh! Mister.

113
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,160
What are you going to do to me?

114
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,080
Mister

115
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,480
What will you do to me, Mister?

116
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,120
Why are you looking at my face?

117
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,400
Starving?

118
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,000
What do you mean, Mister?

119
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,000
I mean "Hungry".

120
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,000
Phew! Oh I'm not.

121
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,520
Ouch, my stomach is rumbling.

122
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:49,960
You say you're not hungry
but your tummy is talking to me.

123
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:55,280
Rumbling! Yeah!!

124
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,920
Second time

125
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,560
Wow!

126
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,000
Before going back,
I have to show grilling chicken.

127
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,520
Oh, it smells so good.

128
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,880
You'll see! Legendary Griller Chicken

129
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:31,320
Grilling chicken in the dark is
like the sky suddenly turbulent.

130
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,760
Hungry, right?

131
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,120
Yes

132
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:53,720
Smells good!

133
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,720
Tight thighs

134
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,400
Chicken thighs

135
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:07,880
Hey! Hold on!

136
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,080
Your hands are dirty.

137
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,880
I can use my clothes to wipe them.

138
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,040
It's clean.

139
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,440
Well, your hands are dirty.

140
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:57,960
Hey, eat it, why don't you eat it?

141
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,000
Ahh! Umm!!

142
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,680
I'd rather eat it myself.

143
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:13,320
Oh Okay then

144
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,680
Butler

145
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,640
Yes

146
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
(Next Break)
Mr. Thad! Comets!

147
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,100
Where?

148
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,380
- Over there! Let's pray.
- I don't see it.

149
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,820
Over there..

150
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,940
It's too late.

151
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,400
Butler

152
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,700
Yes

153
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,880
It's good to be a butler.

154
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,960
Life looks so free.

155
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,360
How is it?

156
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,480
Since you came here,

157
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,760
Our house looks more colorful.

158
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,680
It's so diferent from before.

159
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,880
That we do only what P'Thod said.

160
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,920
Why is Mr. Thod so...?

161
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Do you want to know?

162
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,560
Of course.

163
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,200
I'll tell you.

164
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,040
Do you really want to tell me?

165
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,040
It's long story.

166
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,200
Can you give me the short version?

167
00:17:41,225 --> 00:17:42,385
I can't.

168
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,025
It's so long story.

169
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,360
The story is...

170
00:17:53,826 --> 00:17:56,426
You should go play outside.

171
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,840
Okay father.

172
00:17:59,986 --> 00:18:01,146
Can I play with you?

173
00:18:01,171 --> 00:18:02,331
Sure!

174
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,840
You win!

175
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,240
Let's talk later.

176
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,960
It's time for family.

177
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,840
Then you've to spin yourself.

178
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,280
No!!

179
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,120
Thod

180
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,560
Father

181
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,400
What did you bring to show me?

182
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,880
You should give to uncle too.

183
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,800
Uncle Therd

184
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,240
I'm full, thanks.

185
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,200
That's okay. You should
go to play with your brother.

186
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,480
Take care of the inheritance?

187
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,920
Yes

188
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,040
I'm still alive.

189
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,960
It's not like that.

190
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,640
I just worry about you.

191
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,720
What will be the future of them?

192
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,680
That's fine.

193
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,840
Did you forgot that

194
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,800
I still have my wife?

195
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,400
About the testament,
I'll talk to her first.

196
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,200
Fine

197
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,520
But look at this first.

198
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,640
Look at what?

199
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,600
Wan, it's all I have.

200
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,560
Madam

201
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,640
P'Wan run!!!

202
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,800
Freeze!!

203
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,680
Come here! Are you cheating on me?

204
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,640
No! Listen to me please.

205
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,560
Shut up!!

206
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:23,680
I trusted you but you
pay me back like this?

207
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,800
I'm sorry.

208
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,720
Enough!

209
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,560
I'm going to give all
of my properties to you.

210
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:37,040
But why?! Why do
you do this to me?

211
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,240
Listen to me first.

212
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,520
Sh*t!!

213
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,720
Your mother ran away with her boyfriend.

214
00:21:11,745 --> 00:21:16,345
From now, I'll take care of you.

215
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,840
Go to your father.

216
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:35,000
Thod, come here.

217
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:44,680
Father, look at me.

218
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,880
Please don't go.

219
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,880
After father passed away.

220
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,680
Uncle Therd left this house
to find father's testament.

221
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,120
I'm so sorry..

222
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,600
So where is uncle Therd now?

223
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,680
After that day, he never came back.

224
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,640
There is only butler Sorn here, right?

225
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,880
Yes

226
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,160
So P'Thod makes the many rules as you know.

227
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,240
P'Thod is so worried about us.

228
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,680
Maybe he doesn't want
us to be tricked like mother.

229
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,760
I get that now.

230
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,240
We can only hope to meet mother someday.

231
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,000
Mr. Thad!

232
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,720
Mr. Thad! Comets!

233
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,320
Where?

234
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,600
- Over there! Let's pray.
- I don't see it.

235
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,040
Over there..

236
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,160
It's too late.

237
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,080
Let's pray quickly.

238
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,040
About what?

239
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,560
Hurry up Mr. Thad.

240
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:50,200
Close your eyes and one-two-three.

241
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,480
Pray quickly mister.

242
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,800
Butler…

243
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,760
Yes?

244
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,400
Do you want to know what I pray about?

245
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,880
What did you pray about?

246
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,040
Mister Thad!

247
00:25:16,353 --> 00:25:19,593
My wish came true now.

248
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,120
Mister Thad

249
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:44,920
I just prayed about this.

250
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,360
N'Thep, how are you?

251
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,200
That's fine. I'll talking with him.

252
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,160
It doesn't work.

253
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,600
So what should I do?

254
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,160
You'll let P'Thod do this?

255
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,760
Butler Sorn isn't here,
and if we chase butler Sin out too.

256
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,320
We'll have no one left.

257
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,840
Whatever, butler Sin
has to come back to us.

258
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:45,480
P'Thad, I've something to tell you.

259
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,440
What's that?

260
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,440
P'Thod, I just want to ask you...

261
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,320
If it's about butler Sin,

262
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,840
If you ask, my answer is NO.

263
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,080
P'Thod!

264
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,360
Why you so stubborn?

265
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:35,040
Stubborn? Have you ever known what we want?

266
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,720
So what do you want?

267
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:57,440
Happiness, we just want happiness.

268
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:12,080
Are you not happy while you stay with me?

269
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,120
Mr. Thep

270
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,320
I'm happy but I want freedom.

271
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:35,080
Me too but I want friends.

272
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:42,800
I just want to know what
the outside world is like.

273
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:55,360
I'm sorry that mother ran
away with her bad boyfriend.

274
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,760
But it's more that we lose faith.

275
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,760
She also stole the testament.

276
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,720
What did you say?

277
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,720
If you don't know, me too.

278
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,840
And no one knows what the testament says.

279
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,360
Where is the testament?

280
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,760
I've no idea.

281
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,400
I thought you know.

282
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,640
So I sent butler Sorn to find uncle.

283
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,840
And he's also finding the
testament from mother.

284
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:45,000
I'm afraid that mother will be
gullible and give it away to others.

285
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,760
If that time comes,
we're just normal people.

286
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,880
Or we'll be chased out
from this house, right?

287
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,000
Yes

288
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,760
No way! I've only got 500 million baht!

289
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,280
(Next Break)
It's not easy to be Mr. Thian.

290
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,840
Who's blocking my way?

291
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,440
Make way!

292
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,900
Where?

293
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:35,780
I've followed the map.

294
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,700
Is it this house?

295
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,980
This house!

296
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:53,260
Go straight and turn right.
You'll see a tamarind tree.

297
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,020
Where's the tamarind tree?

298
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,700
I only saw a mango tree.

299
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,340
Or am I going the wrong way?

300
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:01,420
I really want to scold the map writer.

301
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,260
Uncle Wan

302
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,740
Vegetables have been delivered.

303
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,500
What vegetables are you delivering now?

304
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,980
Delivered at the right time.

305
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,980
Is there something undesirable?

306
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,180
That's smelly!

307
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:18,020
The vegetable delivery boy again?

308
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,060
Last time, You didn't stop bothering me.

309
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:20,980
What a loud noise!

310
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,220
I'm sorry, May I join you.

311
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,260
Is there a dog rotting and dying in here?

312
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,500
Uncle Wan

313
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,460
Uncle!

314
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,620
Uncle, I've brought papaya.

315
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,940
What the ..?

316
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,340
What are you shouting about?

317
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,180
I brought vegetables to deliver.

318
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:44,460
Papaya from Handsome Mamuang's garden.

319
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,700
Alright, thank you.

320
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,100
Finish your job and go.

321
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:51,500
Oh Uncle, I still don't
know who's in the house.

322
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,420
It's none of your business.

323
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:56,980
Put your vegetables in
the basement and go back.

324
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:00,220
Uncle! Uncle!

325
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:03,660
What a hurry!

326
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,500
I still don't know
whose house to deliver.

327
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,340
I can't take it. I want to throw up.

328
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,460
That smells horrible!

329
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,580
What?

330
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,900
I need to hurry back and sell vegetables.

331
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,100
Hey!

332
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,300
What the ..?

333
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,860
Oh Butler!

334
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,660
Hey! Butler!

335
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,140
Butler Sorn, Butler Sin

336
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,340
Sh*t!

337
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,180
Am I?

338
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,700
Is this my brother?

339
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,540
Butler!

340
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,020
It's really you. Butler!

341
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,540
No! No, I'm not.

342
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,300
What kind of butler is beautiful like this?

343
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:39,980
I'll go now.

344
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,540
Bye

345
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,100
Butler, It's really you!

346
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,300
Butler Sorn, Butler Sin

347
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,140
Hang on! Wait for me.

348
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,900
Meanwhile at Mister's mansion

349
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:57,620
Why did both of you disobey my orders?

350
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,980
Get out

351
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:16,220
Get lost!!

352
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,420
Stop it, Mr. Thad

353
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,940
Finally, my opening time has come.

354
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:16,020
Waiting in the wheelchair until tired.

355
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:20,460
It's my time to shine

356
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,100
Hey, who's blocking the way?

357
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,180
Who is this?

358
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,660
Chan

359
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,740
Yes, Mister

360
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,780
Yes, Mister

361
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:36,980
Pardon?

362
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,620
Take him away!

363
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,460
Make way, please

364
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,580
All right.

365
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,580
Who is he?

366
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:14,980
Today has finally arrived.

367
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:30,580
Who is this?

368
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,740
Chan

369
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,740
Yes, Mister

370
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,740
Yes, Mister

371
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,380
There

372
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,660
Pardon?

373
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,620
Take me there!!

374
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,580
