00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,100
Untied me now!

198
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,500
Why you tied me?

199
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,260
Untied me now!

200
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,020
Don't make it easy.
Who are you?!

201
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,500
Who am I?

202
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,660
I'm a bad guy! Do you remember me?

203
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:10,740
Look at me!

204
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,580
Look!

205
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,020
Can you remember?

206
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,020
No!

207
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,580
If you can't remember,

208
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,860
I'll give you helper. Chan!

209
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,100
Yes, sir.

210
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,260
Look at this photo! Look!

211
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,660
Look!

212
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,380
Do you remember?

213
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,820
Mother!

214
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,580
Mother?

215
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,380
Why mother is in this photo?

216
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,500
Who does my mother live with?

217
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,460
That's your father!!

218
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,260
Father?

219
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:02,740
Yes!

220
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,980
Actually.

221
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,020
You're the true heir of this family!!

222
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:08,700
WHAT?!

223
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:10,980
I

224
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,860
Am.

225
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,860
The true heir?

226
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:17,780
Yes!!

227
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,700
Who is coming?

228
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:22,980
Chan.

229
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,380
Yes, uncle.

230
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,820
Go behind.

231
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,260
Ah, yes!

232
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,740
I can't open the door.

233
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,780
F*ck! Let me in.

234
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:34,940
Hey!

235
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:36,980
Who's that?

236
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,100
I don't know who he is,

237
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,380
But he looks like a bad guy!

238
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,300
If you're not considerate of the clothes we wear.

239
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,540
He must be like this!!

240
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,660
Do you dare to fight with the police?

241
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,900
I've to go!

242
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,020
Eh? So coward.

243
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,900
You should follow him, I'll handle this.

244
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,700
Okay!

245
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:05,820
Stop!!

246
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,820
I'm a police officer!!

247
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,940
Put your hands up!!

248
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,460
And come here!

249
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,380
Fine

250
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,260
but I'm unarmed.

251
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,620
Slowly and don't be tricky.

252
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,140
Butler Sin?!

253
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,260
No

254
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,620
I'm a police officer.

255
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:28,780
Come here!

256
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,460
I know that

257
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,500
I'm walking.
Don't be tricky.

258
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,060
Be careful!

259
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,220
This opportunity!

260
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:39,820
Be careful!

261
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,780
Oh! I thought you dare!
Butler Sin!

262
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,180
Butler Sin!

263
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,100
You meet my secret step!
You! Calm down.

264
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:57,780
Why?

265
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,740
How dare you!

266
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,580
How dare you bring my Luv, here?

267
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,540
Where he comes out?

268
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,700
Why he act cool?!

269
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,500
Where is my Luv?

270
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,580
So handsome.

271
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,620
Mr. Thad! Be careful!!

272
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,380
Uncle

273
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,100
let him go.

274
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,540
I beg you.

275
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,180
Let him go??

276
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,580
So the first body that should be you! My nephew!!

277
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,140
Luv!

278
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,540
Mr. Thad! Be careful!!

279
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:45,780
Release me!

280
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,020
No!

281
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,300
Release me! Do you want my team kill him?

282
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,500
You should deserv this!

283
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,980
Mr. Thad!

284
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,100
Sh*t!!

285
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,300
Uncle!

286
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,900
What do you want?

287
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,780
The wealth?

288
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,660
You can take it all!

289
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,020
You speak it easy

290
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,300
can you?

291
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,540
Even the true heir is here.

292
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,060
Uncle, I beg you.

293
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,460
Please let them go.

294
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,500
Please let me go.

295
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,740
I promise

296
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,420
I'll run far away!

297
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,540
Run away?

298
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,260
You speak like your mother!

299
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,900
Sign the contract to let me get all the wealth.

300
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,340
If not, your wife die!

301
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,740

Mother.

311
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,900
Motherrrrrr.

312
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,060

313
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,940

314
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,740
From now

315
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,340
I'll take care you guys.

316
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:41,940
Dad!

317
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,900
The testament is in the chest! Stupid!!

318
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,860
What?!?!?!

319
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,740
(Next Break)
I can't hold this

320
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,340
I'll go home.

321
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,880
Hey!! Mustache-faced bastard!

322
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,600
Butler Sin!

323
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,520
Mister.

324
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,240
Mister

325
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,960
Butler Sin, Oh! Policeman, follow quickly.

326
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,040
I got this!

327
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:19,920
Yes.

328
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,560
I've told you.

329
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,240
My Luv, no one can touch.

330
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,320
Mister!

331
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,520
Just that.

332
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,400
Shining!!

333
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:01,720
Luv.

334
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,040
Mister, Are you alright?

335
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,160
I'm fine.

336
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,680
Better tie it off!

337
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,920
Can you fix the tie?

338
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,000
Luv.

339
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:11,760
Yes.

340
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,600
I can't untie it.

341
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,400
Why? Mister.

342
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,200
It can't untied.

343
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,320
Then take it like this, Luv.

344
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,640
Stand up.

345
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,440
Huhh?

346
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,400
Stand up!

347
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,320
Stand?

348
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,640
Well! Stand!!

349
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,160
It's that work?

350
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,720
Why didn't you run away in the first place?

351
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,320
Go!

352
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,120
New morning at Mister's mansion.

353
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,360
I give it back to you, Mr. Tan.

354
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,120
Mr. Tan?

355
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,320
This is my necklace.

356
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,160
Mr. Tan

357
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,600
umm..

358
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,600
Why is there a picture of me in here?

359
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:47,880
If so

360
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,560
I'll tell you.

361
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,640
Should I continue to open the 2nd one?

362
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,960
Are we going to have a baby?

363
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,000
We have been married for years.

364
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,240
I'm afraid to die before I have a baby.

365
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,960
And this

366
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,800
is your child.

367
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,520
I'll be retired after this job.

368
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,440
The Department of Labor will get rid of me.

369
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,240
Your heirs

370
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,280
will have many treasures, enormous.

371
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,240
That means…

372
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,440
Is this necklace

373
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,080
my representative?

374
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,560
Yes.

375
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,120
Welcome home.

376
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,360
Mr. Tan.

377
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,880
I...

378
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,080
thank you all very much.

379
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,640
Where are you going?

380
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,520
Go home, sir.

381
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,120
Well?

382
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,120
It's here!

383
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,440
Your house.

384
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,200
No, sir.

385
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,360
I can't make up my mind.

386
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,800
I would like to go home.

387
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,680
A week later.

388
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,920
Can I buy some lemons?

389
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,880
Yes.

390
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,800
All fresh vegetables!!

391
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,640
Do you want anything else?

392
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,520
I'll take the corn too.

393
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,400
Yes, sir.

394
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,960
How much?

395
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,880
50 baht.

396
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,240
- Thank you.
- Yeah!

397
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,960
What are you looking at?

398
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,160
Oh...

399
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,040
this one?

400
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,160
It's called iPhone.

401
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,560
Oh, I think it's a calculator.

402
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,280
Mr. Thep

403
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,960
invented it himself.

404
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,000
Is he that good?

405
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,320
Let me see, iPhone... or something!!

406
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:44,960
Yes.

407
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,640
Make way for me, please.

408
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,360
Handsome Mamuang is coming!!

409
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,600
I'm coming! Creak!

410
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,400
I'll park the car first.

411
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,520
Hello

412
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,840
today Mamuang doesn't have papaya to deliver.

413
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,320
It's sold out!

414
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,680
Hey! What the hell is wrong with you.

415
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,880
Can't you come quietly?

416
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,840
Come quietly, it's not me.

417
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,760
I forgot. Hello, Uncle Wan.

418
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,480
Hello Inn, my friend!

419
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,040
And hello

420
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,160
mister

421
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,120
mister what?

422
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,400
Why do you make a face like that, my friend?

423
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,440
Can I have an interview please?

424
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,040
Mister, why didn't you go back to your real house?

425
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,320
Mister

426
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:28,000
I'll tell everyone that we have friends with you.

427
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:34,840
Be Mr. Tan's best friend.

428
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,160
Tada!!

429
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,800
Enough! You speak nonsense!

430
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,760
If you're free, come and help me.

431
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,120
I have a mission for you.

432
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,560
Mission?

433
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:47,960
For what?

434
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,880
Today I'm trying to dress up handsomely.

435
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,160
Well, that's it. Dress well and go!
Papaya is sold out.

436
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,320
Where are we going?

437
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:54,960
Go on a mission.

438
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,480
Wait a minute.

439
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,440
Give it back.

440
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,680
Hey! You.

441
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,520
Are you okay?

442
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,560
Umm...

443
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,120
I’m okay.

444
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,000
You don't have to worry about me.

445
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,920
I'm worried.

446
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,640
You know what?

447
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,520
When I have you.

448
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,720
I am very happy.

449
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,280
So...

450
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,880
I want you

451
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,960
to be happy too

452
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,680
when you have me.

453
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:48,880
You.

454
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,760
I would like to buy ten dozen lemons.

455
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,320
Why are you going to buy that much?

456
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,440
To cut the rich taste off!

457
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,400
Mister.

458
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,360
What are you doing here?

459
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,880
What?

460
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,160
Your clothes.

461
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,240
You can go back to stay with us.

462
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,240
Please.

463
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,440
You go back

464
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,960
this isn't your place.

465
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,760
It's not your business,

466
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,320
right?

467
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,360
What!? Speak Thai!!

468
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,640
He started!

469
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,240
Enough! Stop!

470
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,000
Stop!

471
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,400
Here, let me help you.

472
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,320
Careful!

473
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,280
Mister!

474
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,520
Mister!

475
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,800
What did you guys do to mister?

476
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,240
I just want to help.

477
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,440
Help?

478
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,480
Go away!

479
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,240
Don’t mess with mister again.

480
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,880
I can remember this scar.

481
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,040
Sorry!

482
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,440
Are you insane?

483
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,400
Enough!

484
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,560
- Luv.
- Luv.

485
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,680
- Luv.
- Luv.

486
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,520
Luv.

487
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,280
Luv.

488
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,240
Luvvv.

489
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:46,760
Luvvv.

490
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,480
Mister!

491
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,360
Let me go!

492
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,560
I'll enter the house.

493
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,320
Luv, hold on, Luv.

494
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,000
Luv.

495
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,320
Go home with me.

496
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,440
No.

497
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,760
If you...

498
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:01,840
No, yes.

499
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,200
If you want me to go back to take the treasure alone.

500
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,480
I can't do it.

501
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,720
You guys were before me.

502
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,720
I was just an excess.

503
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,360
Luv listen, it's not like that.

504
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,520
Mister.

505
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,000
Don’t do this.

506
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,400
We are just...

507
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,760
brothers.

508
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,520
Luv Luv.

509
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,560
You can go back with me.

510
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,320
If you go back,

511
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,000
you'll know the truth

512
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,000
everything.

513
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,640
Huh?

514
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,880
Truth!?

515
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,760
Do you still have it?

516
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,920
I told you that a long story.

517
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,400
Please, go back with me.

518
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,120
A house without you

519
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,680
is not a house.

520
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,880
What do you want, Mister?

521
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,360
It doesn't have time, Luv.

522
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,440
It must be over.

523
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,200
Let me go, Mister.

524
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,960
Let me go, Mister.

525
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,200
What a loud sound!

526
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,280
Mister.

527
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,080
I told you I'm going home.

528
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,680
Where are you going?

529
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,400
Didn't you unlock the key to find true love?

530
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,480
How do you know this?

531
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,880
What do you mean?

532
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,800
Then I'll tell you again.

533
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,520
Your heirs

534
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,520
will have many treasures, enormous.

535
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,160
But..

536
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,920
You'll have to adopt 3 children.

537
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,640
3 children?

538
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,960
Are you alright maam?

539
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,240
Otherwise

540
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,760
your heirs

541
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,640
will be killed.

542
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,800
And this

543
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,040
is an amulet

544
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,360
that will make your family

545
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,480
get through obstacles.

546
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,040
Pay!!, I don't give it for free.

547
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,760
I'm going to say that there are no free things in the world, right?

548
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Mr. Thod.

549
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,040
Yes.

550
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,520
Please allow me.

551
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,720
Do you want to unlock me first?

552
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,680
The story will end soon.

553
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,680
Yes.

554
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,520
Well, don't need rush to see P'Thad.

555
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,320
Let's try it, maybe I can be your soulmate.

556
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,440
All right, unlock it.

557
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,720
Looks like it's not.

558
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,040
Mr. Thad.

559
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,720
It's that hard.

560
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:44,920
Cannot.

561
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,240
Why can't I unlock it?

562
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,200
What exactly is this key for?

563
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,000
When I tried to unlock everything.

564
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,440
Are you sure you have unlocked all the keys?

565
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,400
Inn?

566
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,040
I'm coming!

567
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,320
Is it for this chest?

568
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,720
What is this chest?

569
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,160
Butler, can I take a look.

570
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,520
What the hell is that box?

571
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,840
Let's try to open it.

572
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,720
Ready?

573
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,120
Mr. Thad.

574
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,240
Mr. Thep.

575
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:15,800
Yes

576
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,080
Mr. Tan.

577
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,720
About the treasure, I don't want to get involved.

578
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,400
Oh??

579
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,360
I'm going to continue selling jewelry.

580
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:22,680
P'Thod.

581
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,880
If P'Thod sells jewelry, you would be rich by now.

582
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,880
Wait for season 2, alright?

583

Is everyone ready?

584
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,840

595
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,320
I haven't paid for the fortune teller yet.

596
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,840
Please pay for your mother.

597
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,200
Ohh!!

598
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,760
It's better to disperse to do the sequel.

Wait, come back.

601
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:13,800
Hey, Mr. Thad.

602
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,760
Who’s gonna pay for her.

603
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,040
This is our house.

604
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,680
Go out for a walk in the front yard.

605
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,120
Ohh.

606
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,960
Mister!

607
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,520
Huh?

608
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,320
Wait a minute, honey.

609
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,240
Help me!

610
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,680
Oh! I'm here!!

611
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,400
I almost fell, Mister!

612
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,400
Hold me that tight!

613
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,560
Mister.

614
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,440
Mr. Thad

615
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,120
please let me go first.

616
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,880
Someone will see it.

617
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,160
Get rid of them!

618
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,840
Well, I want to stand here.

619
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,360
Mister, don't do this.

620
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,760
I don't want to regret it later.

621
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,560
Regret?

622
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,720
What do you mean?

623
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,480
Because you

624
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,320
may not be my soulmate.

625
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,600
If we can unlock this key

626
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,280
we'll be soulmates, right?

627
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,880
If you dare, you can unlock the key.

628
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,160
Now

629
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,480
we are soulmates.

630
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,640
Crazy! Mister!!

631
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,920
Crazy handsome rich isn't over yet.
Don't get up anywhere.

632
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,680
Have you guys forgotten me?

633
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,480
Help me!
